    "body": "<p>I was halfway up a cliff in northern <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/the-colorful-and-complex-world-of-omani-cuisine\">Oman</a> when I realized I hadn’t thought about my prosthesis in more than an hour—which, if you’ve ever worn one, you’ll know is no small thing. The socket was slick with sweat against my thigh. The ridge of my liner had started to roll slightly, but not enough to make me stop. I’d already hiked for five hours that day and was now hauling myself—and my leg—up the blunt edge of a rock face.</p>\n<p>A steel cable snaked along the cliff, bolted in intervals above a sliver of a ledge. Below, a drop that would turn your stomach inside out if you dared to look down. I didn’t. I wasn’t scared. Or rather, I was, but not of falling. I was scared that after such an intense day, my reserves were starting to slip, that the engine was sputtering just as the terrain got harder. But the adrenaline didn’t care. It surged forward, dragging me with it, past the point where reason said stop.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/golden-rules-of-solo-travel\">Solo travel</a> comes with a strange kind of liberty. People project onto it: courage, loneliness, madness. It’s none of those things. When I travel alone, I’m not someone’s daughter or patient or quiet cause for concern. I’m not “the woman with one leg”. I’m just Zainab.</p>\n<p>This wasn’t my first <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/our-editors-favorite-places-to-travel-solo\">solo trip</a>. I’d wandered the alleyways of <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/seeking-silence-in-wadi-rum\">Jordan</a>, roamed <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/in-charismatic-istanbul-the-past-still-shapes-the-present\">Istanbul</a>, gotten lost on purpose in countless cities. I’d learned how to pack light, how to listen to my body, how to push it past the borders of comfort. Yet Oman was different. There was something elemental about it all: the land stripped to its bones, the quiet confidence of the men I’d found online to hike with, the challenge I’d set for myself. Not to prove anything. Just to see what I could do.</p>\n<p>But I didn’t always know I could do this. There was a time when I didn’t even know I had a choice—not about travel, or mountains, but about how to exist. I was seven. We were in the garden of our house in <a href=\"https://www.cntravellerme.com/story/the-best-of-baghdads-streetside-cafes\">Baghdad</a>. It was hot, still. I was fiddling with the handlebars of my bike, which were damaged and needed to be fixed, and my dad came out to help. My youngest sister was on the swing nearby. We found a piece of scrap metal in the garage—something heavy, solid. He thought it might help. It looked like a screw. It wasn’t.</p>\n<p>The blast was thunderous and eerily quiet all at once. I remember the air being sucked from the world, the heat bending around my face, the sensation of being thrown. Blood, screaming, neighbours running toward us.</p>\n<p>My father lost his hand, and my baby sister was seriously injured in the explosion. Later, after several hospitalizations, I lost my leg.</p>\n<p>Some memories loop like broken film: my mother telling me not to move as my father approached my hospital bed, because he didn’t yet know my leg had been amputated. The way he touched my face, frantic and gentle, trying to confirm the rest of me was intact. And the feeling, at seven years old, that I had to be strong for him.</p>\n<p>Nothing made sense, but I knew what had happened was bigger than me.</p>\n<p>For a long time, I didn’t recognize the girl in the mirror. I was a collage of stitches and plaster casts, tape measures and socket moulds. At home, my mother cupped my face with both hands and said: “You are strong. You were made unbreakable.” I didn’t believe her. But I wanted to. And maybe that’s what led me here, to the side of <a href=\"https://www.cntravellerme.com/story/hiking-in-uae-and-oman\">a cliff in Oman</a>, fingers clawed around a steel lifeline, pulling myself inch by inch up the rock. We’d started at sunrise, the path zigzagging across loose shale and burnt orange limestone. I was the only woman in the group – just me and a few Omani adventurers I’d found on Instagram. They were cheerful at first, helping me check my harness, asking about my prosthesis. But once the hike began, the talking stopped. The terrain demanded it. The rock was brittle, flaking underfoot, always a little unsure. We scrambled over boulders, edged along loose ridges with open air on one side.</p>\n<p>By the time we reached the via ferrata—a <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/sasha-digiulian-on-rock-climbing-around-the-world\">climbing route</a> fixed with cables and metal rungs—my muscles were already aching. We clipped in. The cable was cold, smooth, unsentimental. I moved with care: right foot, then a pivot of my hip to swing the prosthetic into place. It doesn’t follow like a real leg would. Every step is deliberate. But when the risk is real – when you’re high up and focused—there’s no space for resentment. That’s when I realized I hadn’t thought about it in an hour. I wasn’t calculating how much longer I could keep going. I wasn’t wondering if people would judge me if I stopped. I was just climbing, like everyone else.</p>\n<p>The guys were ahead, their movements fluid and sure. I kept my distance. I didn’t want to slow them down. But one of them turned briefly and grinned. “You good?” he called. I nodded. “All good.” He didn’t offer help or ask if I needed anything—he just kept climbing. And that was the respect I hadn’t known I needed.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

While the city is a dream destination for those seeking spooky thrills, it’s also essential to approach Salem’s October festivities with mindfulness and respect.

Like most, the monumental structure in Málaga is the product of many centuries of addition, modification, embellishment, and destruction.</p>\n<p>Although historical texts mention earlier fortresses in its current location, the Alcazaba as we know it was primarily built in the 11th century and then significantly improved in the 13th and 14th centuries by a series of small Moorish kingdoms, or \"taifas,\" that controlled Málaga after the fall of the powerful caliphate based in Córdoba.</p>\n<p>When the city fell to the troops of Ferdinand and Isabella in 1487 after a siege of over three months, it became the residence of the crown's local military governor. As the centuries passed, the Alcazaba's importance as an administrative center diminished, and it served a variety of functions, including as an artillery outpost and prison. Its condition deteriorated significantly following an earthquake in 1680 and a French naval bombardment in 1693. By the end of the 18th century, it had been occupied by the townsfolk, becoming a marginal and picturesque residential neighborhood. It remained that way, partially hidden by the houses of local residents, until 1931, when it was declared a national monument.</p>\n<p>The Alcazaba's rehabilitation was initially directed by the same architect responsible for restoring the Alhambra in Granada, Leopoldo Torres Balbás. He took a historicist approach, seeking to restore the structure's appearance as faithfully as possible during the time of the Moors. When construction teams undertook the removal of the neighborhood's houses, they were happy to discover that residents had often simply covered up or walled off the remains of arches and columns — cheaper than demolishing and removing them entirely — thereby preserving these features for posterity. What visitors explore today is the result of the restorations carried out from the 1930s to the 1960s, which combined the remains of the original structure with reconstructions informed by archaeological evidence and historical drawings.</p>\n<p>A visit inside the Alcazaba's formidable walls reveals lush gardens and numerous fountains, harmoniously combining manmade and natural elements. The monument's highlights include the arched doorways of a series of original towers leading up into the fortress's residential interior, some of which incorporate columns from the ruins of the adjacent Roman theater. There's also the Patio de las Armas, a small plaza with a fountain and garden overlooking the port of Málaga, and the upper palace, featuring its own water-cooled interior courtyards, elegant arches, and numerous other intricately detailed decorative elements.</p>\n\n\n                \n            </div>\n\n              </div>",

But during <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/travel/best-places-to-see-fall-foliage/\">peak color times</a>, many of those places are often teeming with people.</p>\n<p>If you'd rather enjoy nature than hordes of other people, this list is for you.</p>\n<p>We've picked 11 lesser-known fall foliage destinations to visit between late September and late October. From idyllic U.S. towns to stunning Croatian national parks and even a prime northern lights spot, these are the best places to see fall foliage without the big crowds.</p>\n<h2>Pine Creek Gorge, Pennsylvania</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.visitpottertioga.com/activities/pennsylvania-grand-canyon\">Pine Creek Gorge</a> extends 1,450 feet down at its deepest point. Pine Creek flows through the gorge — often called the Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania — and tree-covered, rolling hills flank each side.</p>\n<p>The gorge runs for about 47 miles, with the deepest point near the southern end in Waterville in northern Pennsylvania, about a four-hour drive northwest of Philadelphia. Pine Creek Gorge offers plentiful opportunities for hiking, cycling, horseback riding or a scenic drive.</p>\n<p>Climbing the <a href=\"https://www.visitpa.com/region/pennsylvania-wilds/barbour-rock-trail\">Barbour Rock Trail</a> in <a href=\"https://www.dcnr.pa.gov/StateForests/FindAForest/Tioga/Pages/default.aspx\">Tioga State Forest</a> is a must for memorable views of the gorge. In the fall, those views include a veritable rainbow of autumn leaves, made even more vivid by the evergreen trees that dot the landscape.</p>\n<p><strong>TPG tip:</strong> Toward the northern end of the gorge, you'll find locally owned bed-and-breakfasts, inns and campgrounds. If you want to use your points, there's a <a href=\"https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/iptlh-fairfield-inn-and-suites-lock-haven/overview/\">Fairfield by Marriott Inn &amp; Suites</a> in Lock Haven, a 20-minute drive south of Waterville. Rates start at $116 or 24,000 <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/award-travelers-guide-to-marriott-bonvoy/\">Marriott Bonvoy</a> points per night in October.</p>\n<h2>Dubuque, Iowa</h2>\n<p>In the fall, bushy trees in varying hues against a bright blue sky with fluffy white clouds make Dubuque, Iowa, look like something out of a Bob Ross painting.</p>\n<p>Get a bird's-eye view of the landscape from the top of the <a href=\"https://www.fenelonplaceelevator.com/\">Fenelon Place Elevator</a>, listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Known as the world's steepest, shortest scenic railway, the 296-foot-long railway takes passengers on one-way or round-trip tours from Dubuque's Fourth Street to Fenelon Place.</p>\n<p>From the top, you can view downtown Dubuque, the Mississippi River and thousands of \"happy little trees.\" Riding the Fenelon Place Elevator requires a small fee ($2 one-way or $4 round-trip), and you must pay in cash. Children under the age of 5 are free.</p>\n<p><strong>TPG tip: </strong>Use your <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/ihg-rewards-club/\">IHG One Rewards</a> points at the <a href=\"https://www.ihg.com/holidayinn/hotels/us/en/dubuque/dbqia/hoteldetail\">Holiday Inn Dubuque/Galena</a>, just a five-minute walk from the elevator. Rates start at $107 or 22,000 IHG One Rewards points per night in October.</p>\n<h2>Finnish Lapland</h2>\n<p>If you thought the best time to visit Finnish Lapland was in the winter, think again. If you visit in mid-to-late September, you'll be treated to a fiery prism of leaves and the rare opportunity to see the northern lights. The aurora is typically visible beginning as early as late August, and is often most active around the fall and spring equinoxes.</p>\n<p>During the day, you can enjoy autumn activities like berry picking, mushroom foraging and hiking in scenic spots like the <a href=\"https://www.visitfinland.com/en/product/6f216470-664f-4fc4-8a67-4bf401755cc5/vikakongas-hike/\">Vikakongas hiking trail</a> and the <a href=\"https://santaclausvillage.info/activities/auttikongas-waterfall-and-nature-trail/\">Auttikongas waterfall and nature trail</a>.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Related:  Best hotels to see the northern lights</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>TPG tip:</strong> You don't have to give up the gorgeous outdoor views when you book a stay at the <a href=\"https://www.hyatt.com/mr-and-mrs-smith/en-US/m0414-arctic-treehouse-hotel\">Arctic Treehouse Hotel</a> via <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/ultimate-guide-world-of-hyatt/\">World of Hyatt</a>. The property has 60 private suites and villas, including its namesake treehouse suites with panoramic windows. Rates start at $332 or 22,125 World of Hyatt points per night this September.</p>\n<h2>Lexington, Kentucky</h2>\n<p>When you think of Kentucky, horse racing and bourbon probably come to mind. You'll find both in Lexington, along with vibrant fall colors. View the fall leaves on foot with a 3.8-mile hike along the Kentucky River Palisades Trail in <a href=\"https://eec.ky.gov/Nature-Preserves/Locations/Pages/Tom-Dorman.aspx\">Tom Dorman State Nature Preserve,</a> or take to the skies with a treetop canopy zip line tour with <a href=\"https://boonecreekoutdoors.com/\">Boone Creek Outdoors</a>. To explore by car, go for a drive along the <a href=\"https://www.kentuckytourism.com/explore/old-frankfort-pike-historic-and-scenic-byway-2996\">Old Frankfort Pike Scenic Byway's</a> rolling hills.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

And it may just be getting started.</p>\n<p>Last week, JetBlue <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/news/jetblue-fort-lauderdale-expansion/\">announced a major expansion</a> at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL), ramping up service to Latin America and a handful of U.S. cities — including a slew of routes Spirit serves.</p>\n<p>Expect to see more where that came from. \"The bet we've made in [Fort] Lauderdale is a pretty big bet,\" JetBlue president Marty St. George said, speaking last week at an industry conference. \"And we have more stuff to come.\"</p>\n<p>So far this year, JetBlue has added 17 new routes out of FLL, and bolstered its flying to a dozen other cities. That includes a significantly larger presence in the Caribbean, Central America and South America.</p>\n<p>All you have to do is look at a map to see the growth — check out what JetBlue's international route map out of FLL looked like in January 2025, as shown by Cirium.</p>\n<p>Here's what it'll look like come January 2026 — St. Maarten, Honduras, Colombia, Aruba, Costa Rica, you name it.</p>\n<p>That southward expansion isn't over.</p>\n<p>\"There are a lot of places south of Fort Lauderdale that we'd like to fly,\" St. George said, addressing the Morgan Stanley Laguna Conference in California on Sept. 11.</p>\n<p>All told, the airline expects to grow its departures out of Fort Lauderdale this winter by 38%, per Cirium data.</p>\n<p>And the carrier sees the airport, going forward, as the southeast counterpart to its big hubs in New York and Boston — a third \"tentpole,\" as St. George put it, to complement John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and Boston Logan International Airport (BOS).</p>\n<h2>Opportunities in Fort Lauderdale</h2>\n<p>That JetBlue is back to major growth somewhere outside the Northeast is notable, after 2024 saw the <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/news/jetblue-lost-angeles-cuts-adjustments-network/\">carrier pull back significantly</a> in other parts of the country as part of a series of maneuvers meant to return the company to profitability.</p>\n<p>The timing of the carrier's Fort Lauderdale moves, though, is no coincidence. JetBlue has long wanted more gates at FLL.</p>\n<p>The airport's top carrier — Spirit Airlines — is now <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/news/spirit-airlines-chapter-11-bankruptcy-filing-again/\">embroiled in chapter 11 bankruptcy</a> for the second time in less than a year (and less than two years after its planned merger with JetBlue came to a halt). Spirit has raised concerns about its long-term financial viability, and recently began <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/news/spirit-airlines-begins-bankruptcy-route-cuts/\">slashing flights from its network</a> — opening up gate space in Fort Lauderdale in the process.</p>\n<p>\"As our biggest competitor there has started to [cut back] and luckily open up some gate capacity for us,\" St. George said, \"we're taking advantage of it.\"</p>\n<p>So have other rivals. United Airlines recently <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/news/united-airlines-new-routes-spirit-bankruptcy/\">announced a sizable Florida expansion</a>, and Spirit's low-cost competitor Frontier Airlines will grow its wintertime departures out of FLL by 40%, Cirium data shows.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, Spirit told TPG the network moves by other airlines amounted to \"wishful thinking\" by competitors hoping to put the Dania Beach-based carrier out of business.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the motives, JetBlue and others sense a big growth opportunity — perhaps a once-in-a-decade chance — to make a big push in Fort Lauderdale, now perhaps one of the airline industry's biggest flashpoints in the year ahead.</p>\n<p>\"We are excited to welcome the new routes and/or increased flight frequency that existing carriers have announced recently,\" the Broward County Aviation Department, which oversees FLL, told TPG in a statement, noting the increase in \"convenient and cost-effective ways to visit and enjoy these destinations\" for business and leisure travelers alike.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>FAQ:  Spirit Airlines' bankruptcy and how it might affect your travel</strong>\n    </p>\n<h2>JetBlue's future plans in Europe</h2>\n<p>On top of adding new short-haul international routes to Latin America, JetBlue is also dropping hints about its future long-haul international flights to Europe.</p>\n<p>It was only four years ago the carrier <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/airline/reviews/onboard-jetblue-london-inaugural/\">launched its first transatlantic flights to London</a>. Then came <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/news/jetblue-airways-new-york-paris/\">Paris</a>, <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/news/jetblue-airways-new-york-amsterdam/\">Amsterdam</a>, <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/news/jetblue-inaugural-flight-dublin/\">Dublin</a>, <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/news/jetblue-boston-edinburgh-inaugural/\">Edinburgh and Madrid</a>. But while JetBlue isn't ruling out another European destination, it is expecting its fast growth trajectory across the pond to level off.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

A variety of topics will be on the agenda, including trade deals related to both commercial and military aircraft acquisitions. On the commercial side, national carrier Turkish Airlines <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/boeing-poised-huge-order-turkish-airlines/\">has long been in discussions with Boeing</a> over the acquisition of up to 250 aircraft, consisting of a mix of Boeing 737 MAX and around 75 Boeing 787 Dreamliner jets.</p>\n    <p>Turkish Airlines spokesperson Yahya Ustun clarified that the airline has <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/turkish-airlines-boeing-order-6-months-finalize/\">been discussing an order with Boeing</a> for \"quite some time, but no final decision has been made yet.\" The carrier lodged a major order with Airbus for 220 aircraft back in December 2023, but has declared its intentions to double the size of its fleet with another mega order. Trump and Erdoğan are also due to meet for talks in October, so a deal could be thrashed out then if nothing materializes next week.</p>\n    <p>But Trump has spoken optimistically of getting a deal over the line, stating on his Truth Social account,</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>\"We are working on many Trade and Military Deals with the President, including the large-scale purchase of Boeing aircraft, a major F-16 Deal, and a continuation of the F-35 talks, which we expect to conclude positively. President Erdoğan and I have always had a very good relationship.\"</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <h2>Turkish Airlines Wants 800 Aircraft By 2033</h2>\n    <p>Turkish Airlines already operates one of the most extensive networks of any global carrier, <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/turkish-airlines-record-breaking-global-network/\">flying to over 340 destinations in 130 countries worldwide</a> with a fleet of almost 400 aircraft. It operates a fairly even mix of Airbus and Boeing aircraft, opting for a mixed-fleet strategy of narrowbodies and widebodies from both manufacturers. </p>\n    <p>The carrier now wants to double the size of its fleet to an impressive <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/turkish-airlines-chairman-800-planes-by-2033/\">800 aircraft within the next eight years</a>, and has already committed to 220 new aircraft from Airbus, consisting of the A321neo and A350.</p>\n    <table>\n      <row span=\"2\"><cell role=\"head\">\n\n\n    <p>Aircraft Type</p></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell role=\"head\">\n\n\n    <p>Total</p></cell>\n\n            </row>\n      <row span=\"2\"><cell>\n\n\n    <p>Airbus A319-100</p></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>6</p></cell>\n\n            </row>\n      <row span=\"2\"><cell>\n\n\n    <p>Airbus A320-200</p></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>21</p></cell>\n\n            </row>\n      <row span=\"2\"><cell>\n\n\n    <p>Airbus A321-200</p></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>67</p></cell>\n\n            </row>\n      <row span=\"2\"><cell>\n\n\n    <p>Airbus A321neo</p></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>58</p></cell>\n\n            </row>\n      <row span=\"2\"><cell>\n\n\n    <p>Airbus A330-200</p></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>22</p></cell>\n\n            </row>\n      <row span=\"2\"><cell>\n\n\n    <p>Airbus A330-300</p></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>37</p></cell>\n\n            </row>\n      <row span=\"2\"><cell>\n\n\n    <p>Airbus A350-900</p></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>30</p></cell>\n\n            </row>\n      <row span=\"2\"><cell>\n\n\n    <p>Boeing 737-800</p></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>40</p></cell>\n\n            </row>\n      <row span=\"2\"><cell>\n\n\n    <p>Boeing 737-900ER</p></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>15</p></cell>\n\n            </row>\n      <row span=\"2\"><cell>\n\n\n    <p>Boeing 737 MAX 8</p></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>20</p></cell>\n\n            </row>\n      <row span=\"2\"><cell>\n\n\n    <p>Boeing 737 MAX 9</p></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>5</p></cell>\n\n            </row>\n      <row span=\"2\"><cell>\n\n\n    <p>Boeing 777-300ER</p></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>36</p></cell>\n\n            </row>\n      <row span=\"2\"><cell>\n\n\n    <p>Boeing 777F</p></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>8</p></cell>\n\n            </row>\n      <row><cell>\n\n\n    <p>Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner</p></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>24</p></cell>\n\n            </row>\n    </table>\n    <p>While Boeing can be hopeful of securing a big order, Turkish Airlines chairman Ahmet Bolat said a deal would be heavily dependent on delivery slot availability, stating that the airline would go to Airbus again if slots were not favorable.</p>\n    <h2>F-35 Conflict Resolution</h2>\n    <p>Despite being one of the original foreign partners of the Lockheed Martin F-35 program, Turkey was kicked out after it acquired the Russian S-400 missile defense system, barring the country from purchasing and using the advanced F-35 fighter jet. At the time, Turkey blamed unfavorable terms for the US-made Patriot missile system and bought the Russian system in the interests of its national security.</p>\n    <p>However, according to Erdoğan, he has reached an agreement with Trump over the jets and declared that deliveries will commence during his current term. The Turkish president also said a potential deal for more F-16 fighter jets was on the agenda, despite the priority of returning to the F-35 program.</p>\n    <p>Turkey is NATO's second-largest operator of the F-16 but scaled back its acquisition in the hopes of acquiring the F-35 instead. The US has six F-35s already built for Turkey, but these airframes remain in storage due to the ongoing disagreement.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Each jet aircraft embodies a different chapter of the same epic of flight. We'll look at how these icons came to be, what made them groundbreaking, and why their legacy can still be seen today in everything from art and entertainment to airport ramps and modern jet cabins.</p>\n<h2>5 Boeing 707</h2>\n<h3>The First Of Its Kind</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/boeing-707-story/\">The Boeing 707</a> was the first commercially successful jetliner in history and the machine that hurled air travel into the Jet Age. The four-engine narrowbody with 35-degree swept wings, sported     <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/pratt-whitney/\">Pratt &amp; Whitney</a> JT3C turbojets. The prototype “Dash 80’s” first flight took place on July 15, 1954, and launched the transformation of     <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/boeing/\">Boeing</a> from a military contractor into the leading airliner manufacturer in the world.    <graphic src=\"https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/boeing-icon.png?fit=contain&amp;h=22&amp;w=22\"/></p>\n<p>On October 26, 1958, Pan American took delivery of the first 707. Its jets cut the New York to Paris travel time in half to eight hours. Airlines rushed to order the long-range 707-320, short-field 720, and combination carrier 707-320C. With 140–180 seats and a cruise speed of close to 600 mph, the 707 attracted millions of new passengers. It transformed intercontinental travel from a luxury to a mass market by offering vibration-free comfort, high utilization, and unparalleled seat-mile economics.</p>\n<p>Boeing produced 1,010 of the 707 by the end of 1979. By that time every major airport had installed jetways, widened taxiways, and lengthened runways to accommodate its weight and speed. The jet's overwhelming success secured Pratt &amp; Whitney's place, pushed Douglas and Convair into competing programs, and created the standard design of swept wings, podded engines, and fuselage shapes as we know them now. It gave rise to military variants like a tanker, reconnaissance plane, and flying command post that are still in use today. Even though widebody twins have overtaken quadjets, the Boeing 707 is still the jetliner that made international air travel as fast as it is today.</p>\n<h2>4 Airbus A340</h2>\n<h3>The First Four-Engine Airbus</h3>\n<p> A turning point for the fledgling Airbus came in 1993 when the     <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/why-airbus-build-a340-4-engines/\">four-engine A340</a> went into service with Lufthansa. Prior to that, Boeing's 747 and the     <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/mcdonnell-douglas/\">McDonnell Douglas</a> MD-11 were the only aircraft capable of competing in the lucrative ultra-long-haul market. Airbus had relied on the twin-engine A300 and A310 to break into short- and medium-haul markets. Airbus’ first quadjet provides airlines with a new intercontinental platform. The A340, which was designed concurrently with the nearly identical twin-engine A330 and allowed Airbus to expand its family concept into the widebody market by utilizing shared cockpits, parts, and training.    </p>\n<p>The most significant contribution of the aircraft was breaking up the monopoly on nonstop travel between distant destinations. While the stretched -600 briefly held the title of longest airliner in the world, the early -300 and -200 versions gave carriers like Air France, South African Airways, and Cathay Pacific another option to connect Paris to Tahiti, Johannesburg, and New York, or Hong Kong and Toronto.</p>\n<p>Airbus brought a new choice to a limited market segment and offered fleet flexibility, the plane was made with new composites, and shared type rating with the A320. The twin-aisle cabin and smaller powerplants provided passengers with a competitive alternative to aging first and second-generation 747s.</p>\n<p>The A340 demonstrated that Airbus could compete at the top end of the market. Its 377-unit production run helped fund new programs and influenced the design of the A380's systems, as well as solidifying Airbus' position as Boeing's widebody rival.</p>\n<h2>3 Concorde</h2>\n<h3>Supersonic Transport With A Side Of Caviar</h3>\n<p> The     <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/concorde/\">Concorde</a> redefined the boundaries of civil aviation when it started service with     <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/british-airways/\">British Airways</a> and     <graphic src=\"https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ba-icon.png?fit=contain&amp;h=22&amp;w=22\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/air-france/\">Air France</a>in 1976. The supersonic transport (SST) was powered by four</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/rolls-royce/\">Rolls-Royce</a>Olympus 593 turbojets. It cut the London to New York flight time to just over three hours, cruising at Mach 2 and 60,000 feet. For a select few, Concorde demonstrated that regular supersonic travel was possible for civilian flyers.</p>\n<p>Concorde introduced high-temperature aluminum alloys, electronic fuel transfer for in-flight center-of-gravity adjustments, a droop nose for improved landing visibility, and the first fly-by-wire controls.

They include two African links, <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/american-airlines-vs-delta-vs-united-which-airline-is-bigger-internationally/\">with Delta being the top US carrier to that vast continent</a>. The remaining 12 international routes are short-haul, all of which are to Central America, the Caribbean, or Mexico, mainly for winter sun.</p>\n    <h2>Delta Will Begin These 5 Long-Haul Routes Through December</h2>\n    <p> Most of the coming links are from     <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/hartsfield-jackson-atlanta-international-airport/\">Atlanta.</a> As everyone knows, it is the world's busiest airport by passenger traffic, Delta's busiest hub, and a critical fortress hub. <graphic src=\"https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/hartsfield-jackson-atlanta-international-airport.png?fit=contain&amp;h=22&amp;w=22\"/></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/american-vs-delta-vs-united-the-uss-top-10-fortress-hubs-unveiled/\">Some 79% of flights are operated by Delta</a>.</p>\n    <p>The upcoming services include Atlanta to     <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/berlin-brandenburg-airport/\">Berlin,</a> whose inclusion is debatable. This is because it only exists to cater to fans traveling to watch the Atlanta Falcons take on the Indianapolis Colts in the German capital on November 9. It is not a normal, regular offering.    <graphic src=\"https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/berlin-brandenburg-airport.png?fit=contain&amp;h=22&amp;w=22\"/></p>\n    <p>Perhaps the most interesting addition is <strong>Marrakech</strong>. When Delta touches down in the Moroccan airport, it'll become the second US carrier (after United Airlines) and the third from North America (joining Air Transat, too). Until 2024, Marrakech—particularly famous for tourism—did not have any North American services.</p>\n    <table>\n      <row span=\"4\"><cell role=\"head\">\n\n\n    <p>Start Date: October-December Only</p></cell>\n\n                    \n                                    \n    <cell role=\"head\">\n\n\n    <p>Route*</p></cell>\n\n                    \n                                    \n    <cell role=\"head\">\n\n\n    <p>Operations</p></cell>\n\n                    \n                                    \n    <cell role=\"head\">\n\n\n    <p>Served By Delta Before?</p></cell>\n\n            </row>\n      <row span=\"4\"><cell>\n\n\n    <p>October 25</p></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>Mainly three weekly, but up to daily around Christmas (</p></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>No</p></cell>\n\n            </row>\n      <row span=\"4\"><cell>\n\n\n    <p>November 5</p></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>Atlanta-Berlin</p></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>November 5 (A330-300) and 6 (767-300ER) only, returning on November 10 (A330-300) and 11 (767-300ER)</p></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>No</p></cell>\n\n            </row>\n      <row span=\"4\"><cell>\n\n\n    <p>December 1</p></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>Atlanta-Accra</p></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>Daily (A330-900)</p></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>Yes (2010-2012)</p></cell>\n\n            </row>\n      <row span=\"4\"><cell>\n\n\n    <p>December 3</p></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>Los Angeles-Melbourne</p></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>Three weekly (A350-900)</p></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>No. It'll be its first time in Melbourne</p></cell>\n\n            </row>\n      <row span=\"4\"><cell>\n\n\n    <p>December 4</p></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>Daily (767-300ER)</p></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>No. It'll be its first South American route from Utah</p></cell>\n\n            </row>\n      <row><cell>\n\n\n    <p>* Excl. routes that have operated since 2021</p></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    </row>\n    </table>\n    <h2>These 12 Short-Haul Routes Are Coming</h2>\n    <p> All 12 routes will begin on the same day and are timed to coincide with travel for the Christmas period.

The exception is     <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/new-york-jfk/\">New York JFK</a> to Grand Cayman, which Delta served until nine years ago. Then, as now, it will run weekly. It'll compete head-to-head with Cayman Airways and JetBlue.    <graphic src=\"https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/new-york-jfk-airport.png?fit=contain&amp;h=22&amp;w=22\"/></p>\n    <p>Airport pairs new to Delta's network include <strong>Detroit to Liberia</strong>, Costa Rica, which is the gateway to beaches, rainforests, and more. Booking data via <a href=\"http://www.oag.com\">OAG</a> shows that more than 17,000 people flew between the two airports from August 2024 to July 2025.

    "body": "<p>The     <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/f-15/\">F-15</a> Eagle family is one of the most iconic and long‐serving fighter jet programs in modern aviation history. Over the decades, various air forces around the world have adopted different variants of the F-15 to meet roles ranging from air superiority to strike missions. In this guide, we’ll explore which countries have the largest fleets of F-15s, how many planes they possess, which variants, and how those forces stack up in terms of capability, modernization, and future outlook.    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Stock Code</strong></li>\n      <li>BA</li>\n      <li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Business Type</strong></li>\n      <li>Planemaker</li>\n      <li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Date Founded</strong></li>\n      <li>July 15, 1916</li>\n      <li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>CEO</strong></li>\n      <li>Kelly Ortberg</li>\n      <li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Headquarters Location</strong></li>\n      <li>Chicago, USA</li>\n      <li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Key Product Lines</strong></li>\n      <li>Boeing 737, Boeing 747, Boeing 757, Boeing 767, Boeing 777, Boeing 787</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Originating in the early 1970s, the F-15 was built to give air forces a clear edge in air superiority. As threats and technologies have evolved, so have F-15 variants, such as the Strike Eagle versions, export / foreign‐built or built under licence, and most recently the F-15EX. Understanding which air forces have large numbers of F-15s provides insight into global air power balances, the extent of investment in upgrading older aircraft, and what to expect in future air force structures. This guide will cover not only raw numbers but also variant differences, modernization efforts, and operational considerations.</p>\n<h2>The United States Air Force: The Largest F-15 Operator</h2>\n<p>According to FlightGlobal , <a href=\"http://www.flightglobal.com/defence/2025-world-air-forces-directory/160846.article\">919 F-15s are still flying around the world</a>. These numbers combine different variants: from the F-15C and D legacy models to Strike Eagles (F-15E family), and newer or upgraded versions like F-15EX / export variants (F-15QA, F-15SA, etc.).</p>\n<p>The     <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/united-states-air-force/\">United States Air Force</a> (USAF) remains the natural dominant user by fleet size, with 395 in service and another 102 on order.    </p>\n<p>McDonnell Douglas initially developed the F-15 Eagle in the late 1960s, in response to the USAF request for a jet to specifically meet its need for aerial combat fighters. After nearly three decades of production, the F-15 Eagle has been one of the most successful tactical fighters with several primary users.</p>\n<p>The fighter jet is powered by two     <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/pratt-whitney/\">Pratt &amp; Whitney</a> F100 turbofan engines with afterburners, each providing more than 23,400 pounds of thrust. While its payload depends on the mission, the Eagle can travel at a speed of 1,875 miles per hour (the Mach 2 class) and reach a ceiling of 65,000 feet (19,812 meters).    </p>\n<p>By early 2025, the active-duty USAF bid farewell to the last operational F-15C/D squadrons, although that doesn't mean the Eagle won't keep flying:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n                                        <strong>F-15C/Ds</strong>are aging and gradually retiring,<a href=\"http://simpleflying.com/oldest-fighter-jet-us-air-force/\">but they are still in service with Air National Guard units</a></li>\n      <li>\n                                        <strong>F-15E Strike Eagles</strong>remain the backbone of long-range precision strike</li>\n      <li>\n                                        <strong>F-15EX Eagle IIs</strong>will reinforce homeland defense and Pacific posture while replacing some of the oldest airframes in the inventory</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>Saudi Arabia And Japan: Legacy Giants With Evolving Eagle Fleets</h2>\n<p>In 1982, the ‘Peace Sun’ Foreign Military Sales program marked the start of the deliveries of the first Saudi F-15C and F-15D to the Royal Saudi Air Force. Today, the F-15 fleet of     <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/saudi-arabia/\">Saudi Arabia</a> is second by numbers in the world, with roughly 210 F-15s in service.    </p>\n<p>The F-15SA (Saudi Advanced) is an advanced variant of the older F-15S export Strike Eagle models, featuring a digital electronic warfare suite, fly-by-wire flight controls, an infrared search and track system, AESA APG-63     <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/radar/\">radar</a> , advanced joint helmet-mounted cueing system, enhanced avionics, and more.    </p>\n<p>Japan Air Self-Defence Force (JASDF), keeps about 200 F-15s in service, built domestically under license by    <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/mitsubishi/\">Mitsubishi</a>with the designation F-15J/DJ    to complement the air defense capability following the retirement of the F-104 fighter plane.With high scramble rates over the East China Sea and a focus on defending the home islands, the JASDF values availability, radar coverage, and rapid interception, keeping jet fighters at the core of    <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/japan/\">Japan</a>’s air defense network.    </p>\n<p>Country / Operator</p>\n<p>Estimated Fleet</p>\n<p>Main Variants</p>\n<p/></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>~395 in service (+102 F-15EX on order)</p>\n<p>F-15C/D, F-15E, F-15EX</p>\n<p/></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>~210</p>\n<p>F-15C/D, F-15S, F-15SA</p>\n<p/></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>~200</p>\n<p>F-15J/DJ (Mitsubishi license built)</p>\n<p/></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>~80</p>\n<p>F-15A/B/C/D “Baz”, F-15I </p>\n<p/></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>59</p>\n<p>F-15K “Slam Eagle”</p>\n<p/></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>~40</p>\n<p>F-15SG</p>\n<p/></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>36</p>\n<p>F-15QA “Advanced Eagle”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/boeing/\">Boeing</a>and <graphic src=\"https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/boeing-icon.png?fit=contain&amp;h=22&amp;w=22\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mhi.com/products/defense/f_15j_jet_fighter.html\">Mitsubishi Heavy Industries</a>are carrying on a modernization for standoff and high-end air defense, to upgrade selected F-15J airframes with modern sensors, EW, and integration of standoff weapons, creating a tiered fleet where the best-equipped jets handle the toughest missions.</p>\n<h2>Israel, South Korea, Singapore, And Qatar: High-end Eagles With Sharp Missions</h2>\n<p>The Israeli Air Force (IAF) was the first export customer for the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle in 1975 under the Peace Fox program, with the aircraft, nicknamed \"Baz\" (Falcon), entering service in 1976.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>A cyberattack has impacted operations at select European airports, including London Heathrow (LHR), leading to significant delays and cancellations. The attack targeted the MUSE (Multi-User System Environment) software developed by Collins Aerospace for electronic check-in, bag drop and boarding, affecting several airlines that use the software.</p>\n    <p>Dozens of flights have been canceled so far and hundreds more are delayed as passengers face extremely long queues and manual check-ins. Collins Aerospace has acknowledged the attack and said it is urgently working on a fix.</p>\n    <h2>Cyberattack Hits Europe Airports</h2>\n    <p>Operations have been affected across a few European airports following the cyberattack, forcing airlines to process check-ins and boarding manually. According to aviation analytics company <a href=\"https://www.cirium.com/\">Cirium</a>,     <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/berlin-brandenburg-airport/\">Berlin Brandenburg Airport</a> (BER),     <graphic src=\"https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/berlin-brandenburg-airport.png?fit=contain&amp;h=22&amp;w=22\"/></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/brussels-airport/\">Brussels Airport</a>(BRU) and Heathrow have seen a total of 29 flight cancellations as of 12:30 BST Saturday, while data from FlightAware shows ten cancellations and</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.flightaware.com/\">over 200 flights delayed</a>at Heathrow alone.</p>\n    <p>The number of cancellations and delays will certainly rise, leaving more passengers stranded or facing long queues. It isn't known how many airports have been affected, but Ireland's Cork Airport and Dublin Airport have also reported disruption. According to the BBC, British Airways <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3drpgv33pxo\">is operating normally</a> as it has a backup system in place, but the majority of other airlines at Heathrow have been impacted.</p>\n    <p>Brussels Airport said the attack happened on Friday night and had a \"large impact\" on its flight schedule, warning that departing flights are now facing average delays of one hour. Collins said it was aware of the attack, but did not clarify if it knew who was behind it, while the UK's National Cyber Security Centre is assisting in the investigation. RTX, the parent company of Collins, told The Guardian in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/20/heathrow-airport-delays-cyber-attack-berlin-brussels-cancelled-delays\">an emailed statement</a>,</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>\"We have become aware of a cyber-related disruption to our Muse software in select airports. We are actively working to resolve the issue and restore full functionality to our customers as quickly as possible. The impact is limited to electronic customer check-in and baggage drop and can be mitigated with manual check-in operations. We will share more details as they are available.\"</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <h2>Passengers Face Long Delays</h2>\n    <p>Airline staff have been processing passengers manually, a more time-consuming process that has led to lengthy queues and delays. Videos from Brussels Airport show airline staff writing out boarding passes by hand as long queues form in the lines, while images of heavily congested queues in Heathrow show the extent of the turmoil.</p>\n    <p>Many passengers have been left stranded while waiting for connecting flights or missing their onward connections. One passenger, Maria Casey, had a 09:30 flight with Etihad Airways out of Heathrow, but ended up queuing for three hours to check in as only two desks were staffed. Other travelers claim they have been waiting eight hours or more without any updates from their airline.</p>\n    <p>Although stating the degree of disruption was \"minimal,\" Heathrow has told its passengers not to arrive at the airport early, advising timings of no earlier than three hours before long-haul flights and two hours before domestic flights.</p>\n    <h2>Rising Industry Cyberattacks</h2>\n    <p><a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/airport-cyberattacks-so-dangerous/\">The aviation industry has been a common target for hackers</a>, particularly those using ransomware tactics to extort money from airlines and airports. Some hackers have targeted personal information before ransoming the data, such as a recent attacks on Qantas and Air France-KLM.</p>\n    <p>Given how interdependent many systems are in the aviation industry, it finds itself at a heightened risk. This is particularly true of third-party systems like Collins' MUSE which are used by multiple operators.</p>\n    <p>According to a report from French company Thales, the aviation sector saw a staggering 600% increase in cyberattacks from 2024 to 2025, warning that the industry's vulnerabilities have made it an ideal target for hackers.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

The Live Translation feature fared well when tested on Spanish-to-English and French-to-English translations, making the earbuds a potentially handy tool to have for travel. (You'll need an iPhone with Apple Intelligence in order to use Live Translation, though).</p>\n    <p>The earbuds earned a score of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html\">90 in Engadget's review</a>, which notes noticeable improvements in sound quality and battery life. Apple says you'll get up to eight hours on a charge with ANC enabled. With the addition of heart-rate monitoring and support for 50 workouts using Apple's Fitness app, the AirPods Pro 3 allow you to get heart rate metrics during exercise without wearing an Apple Watch.</p>\n    <p>There's a lot to like about the latest version of the AirPods Pro, so discount or not, you can't go wrong if you've been holding out for a meaningful upgrade.

Elon Musk's xAI announced the release of <a href=\"https://x.ai/news/grok-4-fast\">Grok 4 Fast</a>, a faster, more efficient reasoning model compared to its recent predecessor. According to xAI, Grok 4 Fast offers similar performance to Grok 4 while using 40 percent fewer thinking tokens on average.</p>\n    <p>Along with faster results, xAI said Grok 4 Fast \"results in a 98% reduction in price to achieve the same performance on frontier benchmarks as Grok 4,\" whether it's handling tasks that involve writing code or just browsing the web for quick responses.

The only papers exempt are those for which \"scientific journals had already returned proofs — the final step in the academic publication process,\" reports </p>\n    <p><i>The Washington Post</i>, which spoke to two agency employees. Among other things, the role of the Office of Water is to ensure the safety of drinking water.</p>\n    <p>It's the latest in a string of changes at the EPA under the Trump administration, and raises yet more concerns for public health. In May, the agency announced <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/the-epa-is-rolling-back-biden-era-clean-water-rules-130029921.html\">plans to roll back limitations</a> for some perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), known as \"forever chemicals,\" that had been set by the Biden administration, saying it would keep only the limits for the two most common, PFOA and PFOS. In July, the EPA <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-epa-cutting-workforce-by-23-closing-research-division-2025-07-18/\">laid off thousands of employees</a> and announced it would shut down its scientific research office. The same month, the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-releases-proposal-rescind-obama-era-endangerment-finding-regulations-paved-way\">EPA proposed</a> rescinding certain greenhouse gas emissions standards, and just last week <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-releases-proposal-end-burdensome-costly-greenhouse-gas-reporting-program-saving-24\">announced a plan</a> to do away with the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program that requires some of the nation's biggest polluters to report their emissions.</p>\n    <p>Following the latest orders, staffers with the Office of Water who spoke to <i>The Washington Post</i> said they were not given a reason to provide scientific journals as to why the papers have been halted, and no details on the new review process have been shared. One employee told the publication, \"This represents millions of dollars of research, potentially, that’s now being stopped.\"</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

The latest update in the convoluted lawsuit between </p>\n    <p><i>Subnautica</i>'s developer, Unknown Worlds, and its parent company, Krafton, represents a complete 180 with one of the case's key claims. According to a</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/the-subnautica-2-lawsuit-is-getting-even-messier-with-krafton-doing-a-massive-u-turn-confusing-both-the-ousted-founders-lawyer-and-the-judge-this-is-a-little-bit-bewildering/\">report, Krafton said that \"documents relating to the readiness of the game were irrelevant to the termination\" of Unknown Worlds' leadership, which was one of the main disagreements that led to the legal action in the first place.</a>\n    </p>\n    <i>PC Gamer</i>\n    <p>As a quick recap, <i>Subnautica 2</i>'s developers felt the game was ready for early access, while Krafton claimed otherwise and instead delayed it to 2026. The lawsuit hinged on this major dispute and included <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/what-the-hell-is-going-on-with-subnautica-2-212928022.html\">many crucial elements</a>, like a $250 million performance bonus and the leadership team being fired and replaced. This change of heart from Krafton has left Fortis Advisors, who represent the founders of Unknown Worlds, confused and called this \"a seismic shift in the case,\" according to <i>PC Gamer</i>.</p>\n    <p>Krafton reps didn't offer clear reasoning as to why they're not pursuing this argument anymore, but instead want to focus on making the case that Unknown Worlds' leadership \"abandoned their post\" and \"deceived\" Krafton, according to the report. To further complicate things, Fortis claimed that Krafton isn't cooperating with providing evidence for the lawsuit. As the case moves through the discovery phase, where both sides try to obtain evidence from the other, it's obvious that thalassophiles will have to wait a little longer for the hotly anticipated sequel.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Lenovo abruptly cancels some Legion Go 2 preorders due to overwhelming demand</h1>\n    <h2>The company posted in a Reddit AMA that it couldn't fulfill preorders of its next-gen gaming handheld \"in a timely manner.\"</h2>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/about/editors/jackson-chen/\">Jackson Chen</a>Contributing reporter</p>\n    <p>From a disastrous AMA on Monday to disappointing <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/lenovo-legion-go-2-hands-on-powerful-upgrades-but-with-an-even-higher-price-060052114.html\">Legion Go 2</a> preorder customers on Friday, the Lenovo team is having a hell of a week. To kick things off, the Lenovo Legion team hosted an <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LegionGo/comments/1nhni67/were_the_lenovo_legion_team_ask_us_anything_about/\">AMA on Reddit</a> revolving around its gaming handheld launch. The Legion Go 2 generated a ton of hype, being Lenovo's next-gen gaming handheld with more powerful specs and a higher price tag, but the team only answered 10 questions before abandoning the thread. On Wednesday, Lenovo apologized for not being prepared enough to answer all the questions, but followed it up with a bombshell in an edit posted on Friday, adding that \"we will need to cancel some preorders placed directly on Lenovo.com\" for the Legion Go 2.</p>\n    <p>According to the Lenovo team, the demand \"substantially exceeded our projections\" and led to \"unforeseen delivery range extensions.\" While the orders with Lenovo's retail partners, like Best Buy, aren't affected, anyone who preordered the Legion Go 2 directly on the Lenovo website may see some frustrating news in their inboxes. The cancellations might not be a total shocker, since some <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LegionGo/comments/1niilj2/canceled_my_legion_go_2_preorder_disappointed_by/\">user reports</a> are circulating that Lenovo already pushed initial ship dates from September to October with \"zero communication about the delay.\"</p>\n    <p>To try to save face, Lenovo explained that \"as soon as our inventory is replenished, <a href=\"https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/coming-soon/coming_soon_laptops/legion-go-gen-2/len106g0004\">Lenovo.com</a> will show updated availability and ordering will reopen.\" There's no indication yet if those with canceled orders will get priority with the next batch of available devices, but the Lenovo team said it would respond to the AMA thread's questions over the rest of the month. However, if Reddit comments are any indication, there's a good chance a lot of customers won't reorder following this catastrophic launch.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<h3>TechRadar Verdict</h3>\n<p>The Skullcandy Method 360 sound fantastic for the price, which is probably thanks to Bose’s work on the buds. But beyond audio chops they have a lonely snug fit, a respectable battery life and a reasonable price. The big issue with the buds is the colossal size of the carry case, which almost needs its own postcode, and frequent app connection issues also plagued my time with the buds.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>+<p>Competitive price</p></li>\n      <li>+<p>Well-rounded sound</p></li>\n      <li>+<p>Snug fit</p></li>\n    </ul>\n<ul>\n      <li>-<p>Unwieldy carry case</p></li>\n      <li>-<p>App connectivity issues</p></li>\n      <li>-<p>Screaming voice assistant</p></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\n<a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/how-we-test\">Find out more about how we test.</a>\n</p>\n<h3>Skullcandy Method 360: One minute review</h3>\n<p>As my editor at TechRadar well knows, I’ve spent the last year enamored with the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/audio/earbuds-airpods/nothing-ear-a-review\">Nothing Ear (a)</a> as the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/audio/best-in-ear-headphones-1276925\">best earbuds</a> you can buy for a relatively affordable price, and nothing has come close to toppling these svelte and low-cost buds.</p>\n<p>That’s all changed now though, because the Skullcandy Method 360 give their year-and-change older rivals a run for their money. And I see them being the new big buds that, going forward, I shall compare all contemporaries too.</p>\n<p>These buds from American audio company Skullcandy are dead ringers for the brand’s cheap Dime Evo buds, coming in the same novel carry case, but I’ve already got to correct myself: these aren’t <i>just </i>from Skullcandy, but from another key player too.</p>\n<p>In a big partnership, top audio dog Bose contributed to the sound of the Method 360, and it shows. These have the energy of Skullcandy buds but the audio precision of Bose ones, and the fantastic audio quality shows that the Method 360 benefits from the best of both worlds.</p>\n<p>While Skullcandy boasts that the Method 360 have ‘Sound by Bose’, the design of the new buds also bears more than a passing resemblance to recent Bose earpieces too, especially with a gel fin around the buds to help them stick in your ear. Whether this was another case of the Bose helping hand or just a total coincidence, it’s welcome, with the Method 360 staying in the ear reliably even during workouts. They’re comfortable too, letting you listen for long bouts without your ears getting achy.</p>\n<p>Design of the buds may be great, but the carry case itself provides problems: namely, that it’s <i>absolutely huge</i>. It’s a massive long tube which hides an inner shell that you slide out to retrieve the earbuds, and it’s far too big to easily fit in trouser pockets. According to promotional images Skullcandy sees you using the O-ring to strap the case to your bag, or perhaps your trousers, but the sheer size would make that about as unwieldy as walking about with a scabbard.</p>\n<p>A few rough edges show their face in the feature set too: the app often failed to connect to the earbuds, even when they readily connected to my phone without issues, which was irritating when I wanted to change ANC mode. Plus, the voice announcer on the buds is both terrifyingly loud and surprisingly low-res, making me wonder if I’d accidentally been sent a pair of Method 360 which had been cursed by the Babadook.</p>\n<p>Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.</p>\n<p>Are these flaws enough to ruin the Skullcandy? Not by any means, they’re just minor gripes, and ones that give me something to write about to seem even-handed too. But they do little to counteract the real strengths of the Method 360: its reliable fit, its fantastic sound and its affordable nature.</p>\n<h3>Skullcandy Method 360 review: Specifications</h3>\n<p>Component</p>\n<p>Value</p>\n<p>Water resistant</p>\n<p>IPX4</p>\n<p>Battery life (quoted)</p>\n<p>11 hours (earbuds), 29 hours (total)</p>\n<p>Bluetooth type</p>\n<p>Bluetooth 5.3</p>\n<p>Weight</p>\n<p>11g / Charging case: 77g</p>\n<p>Driver</p>\n<p>12mm</p>\n<h3>Skullcandy Method 360 review: Price and availability</h3>\n<p> <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CznHsUce6xZmQSxPLjTmN6.jpg\" alt=\"The Skullcandy Method 360 on a shelf.\"/></p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Announced in April '25</strong>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>RRP $119 / £99 / AU$189</strong>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Priced against mid-range rivals</strong>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Skullcandy announced the Method 360 in April 2025 and put them on sale straight away afterwards.</p>\n<p>The official price of the buds is $119 / £99 / AU$189, although they were cheaper for their first few weeks of existence thanks to introductory pricing. When considering their value, though, we’ll consider this official price.</p>\n<p>At that price these can be considered mid-range buds, with the aforementioned Nothing Ear (a) costing more or less (depending on region) at $99 / £99 / AU$192. Their other big rival at that price is the WF-C710N which has an RRP exactly the same as the Skullcandy and we’ll get more into the differences in our comparison section below.</p>\n<h3>Skullcandy Method 360 review: Design</h3>\n<p> <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4a94ZuWinAshhg8gZwXVP6.jpg\" alt=\"The Skullcandy Method 360 on a shelf.\"/></p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Huge case that's fiddly to insert buds into</strong>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Buds are comfortable and fit reliably</strong>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Range of color options</strong>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<p>The worst part of the Skullcandy Method 360 is its case. It’s absolutely <i>huge</i> – you’ve got no chance of fitting this thing in your trouser pocket and it was even a squeeze fitting it into the folds of my jacket. It’s significantly bigger than the case of any other earbud I’ve tested recently, making it a pain for portability.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Micron, Sandisk set to dramatically increase NAND and DRAM prices, with a direct impact expected on SSD and RAM prices within weeks</h1>\n    <p>\n      <a

NAND products this week</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f7Au3Yzj5FNE4KJCbBPfZ3.jpg\" alt=\"Micron PCIe 6.x SSD\"/>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Micron pauses DRAM and NAND quotes, signalling sharper increases coming soon</strong>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>DDR4 spot prices climbed 3.31%, rising from $4.896 to $5.058</strong>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Transaction volumes are shrinking as buyers resist higher memory costs</strong>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Micron and SanDisk are preparing aggressive price adjustments that could ripple through the storage and memory markets within weeks.</p>\n    <p>Recent reports have claimed SanDisk has already announced a 10% hike for NAND products, aiming to boost market sentiment.</p>\n    <p>In response, Micron has paused its NAND and DRAM quotes, signaling sharper increases on the horizon.</p>\n    <h2>DRAM market reactions and DDR5 trends</h2>\n    <p>These developments come as suppliers attempt to recover margins ahead of anticipated supply shortages in 2026, while buyers remain hesitant to accept steep hikes.</p>\n    <p>Spot prices for DRAM continue to move upward, led by DDR4 products.</p>\n    <p>The average spot price of mainstream DDR4 1Gx8 3200MT/s chips has climbed 3.31%, rising from $4.896 to $5.058 in a single week.</p>\n    <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/09/10/insights-memory-spot-price-update-sandisks-10-price-hike-meets-demand-side-resistance/\"> TrendForce</a>, this is influenced by Nanya’s strong August revenue performance.</p>\n    <p>Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!</p>\n    <p>However, transaction volumes are shrinking as buyers resist these increases, showing limited willingness to absorb higher costs.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, the spot trading of <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/computing/best-ddr5-ram\">DDR5</a> chips remains subdued, showing no change from previous weeks.</p>\n    <p>Despite DDR5 representing the latest memory technology, its uptake appears tempered by cost concerns and limited near-term demand growth.</p>\n    <p>SanDisk’s effort to push a 10% NAND price increase has not been fully embraced by buyers, especially now that peak-season stocking activity has passed.</p>\n    <p>The spot price of 512Gb TLC wafers has risen by around 1.5%, but suppliers have largely confined increases to channels rather than the retail market.</p>\n    <p>If these channel adjustments expand, consumers could soon see higher costs for SSD storage and related products.</p>\n    <p>SanDisk’s recent financial results show why suppliers are confident in pursuing price hikes.</p>\n    <p>The company reported quarterly revenue of $1.901 billion, a 12% increase from the prior quarter and 8% year-over-year growth.</p>\n    <p>For fiscal 2025, revenue reached $7.355 billion, up 10% from fiscal 2024.</p>\n    <p>This growth was supported by moderate gains in bit shipments and average selling prices, demonstrating sustained demand across key segments.</p>\n    <p>SanDisk’s <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/pro/best-data-center-proxies\">data center</a> business accounted for over 12% of total bits shipped, while cloud revenue rose 25% year-over-year to $213 million.</p>\n    <p>These figures indicate that enterprise and professional sectors remain willing to absorb higher costs, giving suppliers a foundation to push DRAM and NAND pricing higher.</p>\n    <p>With suppliers holding firm on quotes and signaling additional hikes, both enterprise customers and end users may face increased costs during the Black Friday period.</p>\n    <p>Rising DRAM and NAND prices could tighten margins for retailers and integrators, particularly if buyers delay purchases in anticipation of stabilization.</p>\n    <p>For consumers, any temporary relief in storage deals may be short-lived, making this shopping season one of the most unpredictable in recent times.</p>\n    <h3>You might also like</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Check

    "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/tag/shark\">Shark</a> makes many of the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/best-vacuum-cleaners\">best vacuum cleaners</a> on the market today. It's especially good at coming up with solutions to problems that you might not even knew you had. For example, wands that can bend forward so you can clean under furniture without bending down, or floorheads that can be pulled backwards over chunky spillages to clear them, rather than just causing them to pool up.</p>\n<p>I've tested plenty of different models from this brand, and I'm consistently impressed. The range can be a little tricky to make sense of though – Shark isn't afraid to release 20 new models every other month – so here I've pulled together what I think are the three <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/home/vacuums/the-best-shark-vacuum-cleaners-year\">best Shark vacuums</a>. Each will suit a slightly different type of customer, but there's something for everyone here.</p>\n<h3>Shark PowerDetect Cordless</h3>\n<p>The PowerDetect Cordless is the model that sits at the top of Shark's cordless range. It combines outright power with advanced automation capabilities, and features geared towards convenience and usability.</p>\n<p>This vacuum can sense the kind of floor it's on and how dirty it is, and adjust suction power in response. It can also tell when it's near the edge of a room and amp up the power on the relevant side of the floorhead to clear any dust that might have gathered there.</p>\n<p>The wand can pivot in the middle to enable you to clean right under furniture, and has a floorhead that's designed to pick up larger bits of debris when pulled back over them. The usefulness of that last feature shouldn't be underestimated – I've tested far too many vacuums that just push dirt around. There's also a compatible auto-empty base which, if you have space for it, is a big effort-saver.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Who should buy it?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>If you want a cordless vacuum that packs plenty of power and is straightforward to use, the PowerDetect Cordless is your best bet.</p>\n<p>Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Why shouldn't buy it?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>If you have mostly hard floors or only need something for light cleaning, the Detect Pro (#2) is a better choice. It doesn't offer as much suction, but it's lighter in weight and offers many of the same special features as the PowerDetect.</p>\n<p>If you have tons of carpet or hairy pets, you should consider the PowerDetect Upright (#3). It's bulkier and heavier than both the cordless stick vacuums here, but the benefit is far more suction power, no need to recharge, and a generous dust cup.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Read our full </strong>\n      <strong>Shark PowerDetect cordless vacuum review</strong>\n    </p>\n<h3>Shark Detect Pro cordless</h3>\n<p>The Shark Detect Pro is slightly older than the PowerDetect above. It's smaller and lighter, but offers many of the same convenient features. It's the least powerful of all the vacuums here, but ideal for smaller homes or homes with lots of hard floor.</p>\n<p>The floorhead isn't designed to allow chunky particles to pass under it when pulled backwards. Otherwise, you're getting most of the same features as you will with the PowerDetect Cordless (#1) above. It can sense dirt, edges and floor type, and there's a compatible auto-empty base. Some versions of this vacuum have the forward-bending wand feature (Shark calls this <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/home/vacuums/shark-vacuum-technologies-guide#section-multiflex-us-flexology-uk\">MultiFLEX in the US and Flexology in the UK</a>) while others do not.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Who should buy it?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Those who have homes with mostly hard floors and the occasional rug will find the Detect Pro packs ample power for a thorough clean. It's also a great choice if you need something lightweight for getting into awkward corners.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Who shouldn't buy it? </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Pet owners and those with lots of carpet will need more oomph, and should check out the PowerDetect Upright (#3) for maximum power, or the PowerDetect Cordless (#1) if you're set on a cordless stick vacuum.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Read our full </strong>\n      <strong>Shark Detect Pro Cordless vacuum review</strong>\n    </p>\n<h3>Shark PowerDetect Upright</h3>\n<p>If it's outright power you need, you can't beat a corded upright. The best one in Shark's lineup is the PowerDetect Upright (although UK shoppers should definitely also check out the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/home/vacuums/shark-stratos-nz860ukt-pet-pro-upright-vacuum-review\">Shark Stratos Pet Pro Upright</a>). This vacuum will deliver a seriously deep clean, getting ingrained dust out of thick carpets and pulling up pet hair with ease. The dust cup is also large enough to handle serious volumes of dirt without having to make constant trips to the trash.</p>\n<p>Obviously it's heavier, bulkier and less convenient than the cordless cleaners at #1 and #2, but Shark has made it as flexible as possible with a modular design that enables you to use different configurations for different cleaning tasks. For instance, if you need to clean up high you can remove the dust bin and hold it in your hand while you use a detail tool on the end of a flexible hose.</p>\n<p>Like its cordless counterpart (#1), the PowerDetect Upright can automatically adjust suction based on the floor type and how dirty it is, as well as increasing power at the edges of rooms. It also has that same floorhead that can be pulled backwards over chunky spillages. An anti-odor puck is designed to keep things smelling fresh, even if you have a bin full of dog hair.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Who should buy it?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

You take control of a private dick investigating a kooky cult out in the countryside, and things naturally take a turn for the cosmic and horrific⁠—who knew there were so many primordial stone catacombs under Anytown, USA?</p>\n    <p>The boomer shooter vibe, dudes in robes, and bundle of dynamite-as-grenade all <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/cultic-might-be-the-years-grungiest-retro-fps/\">harken to the classic shooter Blood</a>, but I've always thought Cultic takes at least as much of a page from Resident Evil 4. It has that same autumnal vibe as RE4, these dark forests and abandoned townships calling to mind the ones I explored in <del>Spain</del> a lonely and rural part of Europe.</p>\n    <p>Cultic also boasts a simple, but gratifying weapon upgrade system like RE4's, and its variety of encounters also reminds me of Capcom's opus. Cultic is always surprising and exciting in this classico action movie way, lurching from one memorable set piece to another. You can go from wide open cultist base clearing amid sniper fire, to being hunted by chainsaw minibosses in a hedge maze, to exploring a claustrophobic asylum⁠—and that's all in one level.</p>\n    <p>I don't think I was the only one out there who was confused about Cultic's release plans: It was never explicitly an early access game, but it was <i>pretty much</i> early access as far as the end user was concerned. Instead of paying $20 upfront and getting part of the game, then the rest later, like you would with a New Blood shooter, each half of Cultic is $10, with Chapter Two categorized as DLC on Steam.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NGkShRQ6f2EtjbyBHRaZDU.jpg\" alt=\"A cultist with a hatchet runs from an explosion\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FVB4srPZReBjEePTvGFkSX.jpg\" alt=\"Kicking a hooded cultist as blood flies out of them\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sRDsRRRNgM3RkA7xsaeW2F.jpg\" alt=\"Cultic FPS\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kmmQfAAje3XwrokWTUGA6D.jpg\" alt=\"Cultists charge toward the camera through a mine tunnel as the player wields a stick of dynamite and a lighter.\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a3TgBzjyBk8oLdhuHUwLQF.png\" alt=\"Cultic FPS\"/>\n    <p>Six of one, half dozen of the other, and Episode One was a great value already, taking me about seven hours to beat the first time, and that's having missed a ton of level secrets. 3D Realms has said that Episode 2 is even bigger, more than doubling the size of the game.</p>\n    <p>Over email, a 3D Realms representative didn't rule out the possibility of a third chapter, but said the publisher is viewing this as Cultic's effective 1.0 version, and the bundle of both episodes on Steam is the \"complete edition.\" I've started a new playthrough from Chapter One to review the full monty, but I can already heartily recommend Chapter One⁠—and its bifurcated structure means you can get the first half just to try before committing to the full $20 purchase.</p>\n    <p>Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/new-games-2025-upcoming-pc-release-schedule/\"> 2025 games</a>: This year's upcoming releases</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/best-pc-games/\">: Our all-time favorites</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Best PC games</strong>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/best-free-pc-games/\">: Freebie fest</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Free PC games</strong>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/best-fps-games/\">: Finest gunplay</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Best FPS games</strong>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/best-rpgs-of-all-time/\">: Grand adventures</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Best RPGs</strong>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-co-op-games/\">: Better together</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Best co-op games</strong>\n    <p>Ted has been thinking about PC games and bothering anyone who would listen with his thoughts on them ever since he booted up his sister's copy of Neverwinter Nights on the family computer.

The new “Gaming Copilot” feature was <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/microsofts-gaming-copilot-ai-is-now-available-in-beta-for-xbox-insiders-promising-to-help-you-get-to-gameplay-faster-sharpen-your-skills-and-be-there-when-you-need-it-and-out-of-the-way-when-you-dont/\">announced just last month</a> and, as of Thursday it's already <a href=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/18/gaming-copilot-xbox-pc-mobile/\">beginning its full beta roll-out to PC</a> and coming to the Xbox mobile app in October. As the name suggests, it’s a gaming-specific version of Copilot that Microsoft calls “your personal gaming sidekick.”</p>\n    <p>You can use Gaming Copilot to ask for tips, suggestions, summaries, info on achievements, and the like. It can analyze what’s on your screen for context, such as identifying an NPC you’re talking to (although their names are usually on screen anyway).</p>\n    <p>You’re able to access this assistant directly through the Xbox Game Bar⁠—by default, pressing Windows+G on a keyboard or the Xbox button on one of the company's controllers. There’s also a voice mode and a \"mini mode\" for pinning the AI to your screen.</p>\n    <p>While I can see how some gamers might find this useful, it's hard to see how it's more than an AI version of simply pulling up a guide on your phone or via the Steam browser. It also raises concerns about the potential for cheating in online games. After all, being able to ask an AI for live, personalized advice or explanations during a competitive game toes the line between “coaching” and “cheating.”</p>\n    <p>For example, would it be possible for Gaming Copilot to call out enemy locations for you in deathmatch? If Gaming Copilot was found to be an issue in competitive games, would anti-cheat programs be able to detect it, given that the Xbox Game Bar is automatically installed with Windows, and cannot be fully disabled? On the other hand, could it potentially lead to a false-positive with anti-cheat programs flagging players for cheating when they aren't?</p>\n    <p>Whether this AI could really help you⁠—as a replacement for searchable guides or to cheat⁠—depends on how accurate and detailed its guidance is. \"Hallucinations,\" or false info an AI displays as fact, remain an endemic issue with large language models.</p>\n    <p>For example, just the other day, Google's AI overview responded to my Nightreign team's search about a boss's weakness with incorrect information. Microsoft has said it’s working with game developers to ensure Gaming Copilot’s tips are correct, but given the track record with LLMs, I'm still skeptical.</p>\n    <p>Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.</p>\n    <p>It’s also worth thinking about your hardware and game performance. Even though most of Copilot's functions seem to be handled in the cloud, if you’re playing on an older or low-end system, it's possible having an extra process like this running in the background could eat up RAM or CPU resources, leading to poorer game performance. Even on high-end hardware, most gamers aren’t looking for more bloatware or unnecessary software to siphon off processing power.</p>\n    <p>There is also the privacy issue of an AI constantly analyzing your screen and collecting gameplay data. If you’re concerned about your data privacy (<a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/new-report-alleges-microsoft-recall-is-still-screenshotting-credit-card-numbers-and-passwords/\">and rightfully so</a>), you’re probably not using AI assistants anyway. Regardless, you have to explicitly give Gaming Copilot permission for screen recording in the widget's capture settings, so at least you can always leave that turned off.</p>\n    <p>I attempted to test out Gaming Copilot (and see if there was any way to disable it), but it wasn't available on my Windows 11 systems yet. You can check to see if it's available on your device by opening your Xbox Game Bar and looking for the Gaming Copilot widget in the Home bar.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/new-games-2025-upcoming-pc-release-schedule/\"> 2025 games</a>: This year's upcoming releases</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/best-pc-games/\">: Our all-time favorites</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Best PC games</strong>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/best-free-pc-games/\">: Freebie fest</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Free PC games</strong>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/best-fps-games/\">: Finest gunplay</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Best FPS games</strong>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/best-rpgs-of-all-time/\">: Grand adventures</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Best RPGs</strong>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-co-op-games/\">: Better together</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Best co-op games</strong>\n    <p>Stevie Bonifield is a freelance tech journalist specializing in mobile tech, gaming gear, and accessories.

You've been suckered. A cabal of sirens has made you stupefied and susceptible, bearing impressive names like Unreal Engine 5, Unity, Anvil, Snowdrop. These are distractions: dark paths to divert you from the true way. You don't need nanite-rendered leaves or dappled evening sunlight rendered with lumen. Look away. Look away!</p>\n<p>This is <strong>Terminally Online: </strong>PC Gamer's very own MMORPG column, and I am <i>not</i> Harvey Randall, your usual author. I'm Joshua Wolens, filling in for Harvey this week with a lot of wistful, misty-eyed old-man musings about the glory of the MUDs of yore.</p>\n<p>Look away and look back to the last time anything was good: the '90s, when the internet moved too slow to cook your brain and the absolute peak of graphical fidelity was translucent water and the PlayStation 1, whose vertices swam and staggered beneath their own raw aesthetic power. Back then, if you wanted a world—a <i>real</i> world—there was only one place to go: Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs).</p>\n<p>And frankly, my contention is that for all our modern graphical horsepower, that's still the case.</p>\n<h2>Sacred texts</h2>\n<p>MUDs, if you're not familiar, are large, shared, entirely text-based worlds where everything is conducted by the input and output of text. Massively multiplayer command lines, of a sort. Want to go somewhere? Prepare to type GO NORTH, GO NORTHWEST, GO NORTH, GO NORTHEAST ad nauseum until you reach your destination.</p>\n<p>PvE might, in a generous game, consist of you typing KILL until the deed is done, pausing intermittently to input whatever the appropriate verb is for healing. A less generous game will have you type out the correct verb for every specific type of attack you want to do. As for PvP? Likely a terrifying arms race of custom-made combat scripts based on an ever-shifting sea of variables.</p>\n<p>They're complex, in other words. But despite that, it was a MUD—<a href=\"https://www.achaea.com/front\">Achaea</a>—that got its hooks into me at the tender age of 13. Not WoW, not EverQuest, not anything else. Achaea was my main game for years, but I moved on to others: <a href=\"https://www.lusternia.com/\">Lusternia</a> (no, it's not a XXX game), <a href=\"https://www.aardwolf.com/\">Aardwolf</a>, a brief flirtation with <a href=\"http://discworld.starturtle.net/lpc/\">Discworld</a>, and so on.</p>\n<p>The 'why' of it is easy: more than any graphical MMO, these games captured the spirit of tabletop roleplaying—where the gaps in presentation left by dry stat sheets and dice rolls have to be filled by your imagination. MUDs were (and are) nothing but imagination, and their rudimentary presentation left enormous room for players to fill the gaps themselves.</p>\n<p>Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.</p>\n<p>In my heyday, the meat of what I got up to in the MUDs I played didn't consist of relentlessly grinding dev-authored quests (though there was plenty of that), it took place in all the interstices the designers had left and that players had moved to fill. The beauty of text is that there's very little you can't do with it and <i>doing</i> it takes very little time.</p>\n<p>Being able to describe yourself any way you liked, to perform any action you could fit into a sentence meant that players I knew made their living as travelling performers, as essayists on in-game lore (this was often tedious), as politicians and diplomats. Also they would quite regularly retreat to somewhere secluded with one another and—sweaty fingers trembling—co-author the most specific smut you can imagine. The internet!</p>\n<p>It is, in these circumstances, relatively easy to catch a dev's attention and have them help you roleplay out some kind of in-game event. Perhaps you want to be an archaeologist making a momentous discovery: all you need is someone to type you up a new item, and maybe briefly inhabit a nearby NPC to act out the scene.</p>\n<p>And it really did look great, too. Not to turn into a kindergarten teacher, but your imagination <i>is</i> quite powerful, and good writing is timeless in a way no texture or lighting model ever will be.</p>\n<h2>Left on read</h2>\n<p>Alas, MUDs are on the downswing. In fairness, they've been that way since at least the late '90s. They were dying even when I was first getting into them, slowly supplanted by MMOs which more closely resembled videogames and less resembled emacs. Where my favourites of yore once had playercounts in the hundreds, now they number in the tens. Some in the single-digits. Though <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mmo/the-mmo-granddaddy-youve-never-heard-of-is-celebrating-its-35th-anniversary-and-it-still-pulls-in-a-few-thousand-active-players-and-needs-a-staff-of-40-to-run-we-want-to-be-able-to-survive-for-another-35-years/\">some are doing quite well</a>, I understand.</p>\n<p> <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/woEYsnCbeSVME2WUfHF9T3.png\" alt=\"Lusternia running in Mudlet.\"/></p>\n<p>We'll miss them if they ever go entirely, I think. As tech advances to fill more and more of those gaps which we used to have to fill ourselves, our scope for participation and mental investment in the worlds we spend thousands of hours in diminishes. Or mine does, anyway.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

That glitch and some much-needed quality-of-life tweaks are getting addressed in <a href=\"https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-upcoming-deep-of-night-adjustments\">an upcoming patch</a> Bandai Namco announced on Friday.</p>\n    <p>Along with a fix for the Depth level increase bug, this patch will also give you an option to voluntarily decrease your Depth level and add Depth level demotion protection for level three onward. You gain points toward promotion for winning runs, and lose points when you fail, meaning it's possible to be demoted, similar to competitive multiplayer ranks in other games.</p>\n    <p>This new protection feature effectively gives you a second chance to hang on when you would otherwise get demoted starting at Depth level three. You then get two extra chances for levels four and five each.</p>\n    <p>Lastly, this patch will also allow Steam players to return to an ongoing session if they get disconnected due to Steam server issues. The voluntary demotion, meanwhile, lets you turn down the heat if you need more practice or want to better accommodate lower-ranked friends.</p>\n    <p>If you've tried the new Deep of Night mode, which <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/after-170-hours-of-elden-ring-nightreign-its-new-increasingly-evil-deep-of-night-mode-has-managed-to-hook-me-in-again/\">launched on September 11</a>, you know it's designed to be brutal, even by <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/tag/fromsoftware/\">FromSoftware</a>'s standards. These adjustments won't make it easier (that would sort of defeat the whole point), but they'll offer some balancing to give players more control over their Deep of Night runs.</p>\n    <p>If you want to hang back and repeat a Depth level, you'll be able to. If you drop the ball at a higher level, you'll get a little extra leeway to take another stab at it before losing a rank. It's not so much making Deep of Night's apocalypse-level difficulty easier as it is balancing things out and generally improving the player experience.</p>\n    <p>Unfortunately, Bandai Namco hasn't announced the release date for this update yet. So, until it's released, watch out for that potential bug preventing players from moving up a Depth level after a victory. If you haven't had a chance to try the Deep of Night mode yet, you'll need to effectively beat the game (defeat the Night Aspect) to unlock it.</p>\n    <p>Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/new-games-2025-upcoming-pc-release-schedule/\"> 2025 games</a>: This year's upcoming releases</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/best-pc-games/\">: Our all-time favorites</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Best PC games</strong>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/best-free-pc-games/\">: Freebie fest</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Free PC games</strong>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/best-fps-games/\">: Finest gunplay</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Best FPS games</strong>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/best-rpgs-of-all-time/\">: Grand adventures</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Best RPGs</strong>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-co-op-games/\">: Better together</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Best co-op games</strong>\n    <p>Stevie Bonifield is a freelance tech journalist specializing in mobile tech, gaming gear, and accessories.

Pop back every weekend to find out what Jeremy, Josh and Rick have become obsessed with this time, whether it's the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/i-embarked-on-a-mission-to-answer-the-most-important-question-in-pc-gaming-how-tall-is-garrett-from-thief/\">canon height of Thief's Garrett</a> or that time someone in the Vatican pirated <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sports/a-part-of-my-brain-will-always-be-dedicated-to-the-time-someone-in-the-vatican-pirated-football-manager-2013/\">Football Manager</a>.</p>\n<p>Anybody who is as hopelessly obsessed with Source engine games as I am will probably remember SiN Episodes: Emergence. Released in 2006, Emergence was the first part of Ritual Entertainment's massively ambitious plan to follow-up its 1998 FPS SiN. This plan, which dwarfed the aspirations of Half-Life 2's episodic expansions, would have told the sequel's story across a total of nine episodes, representing three games' worth of experiences developed over a decade.</p>\n<p>In the end, only one of these episodes ever saw the light of day. But I've always been curious about how SiN: Episodes would have proceeded, had Ritual been able to see these grand plans through. Where might subsequent episodes have taken players? What would have happened in the story? What new weapons, enemies, and experiences would they encounter?</p>\n<p>Recently, I spoke to someone who knows. Michael Russell was the QA manager at Ritual Entertainment during the development of Emergence. While only employed at Ritual for two years, Russell was present for most of Emergence's development, privy to both the studio's plans for the future of the series, and why those plans never came to fruition. \"A lot of the story was fairly public knowledge within the company,\" Russell says. \"Shawn Ketcherside was the writer for the game, and he was there on site.\"</p>\n<p>Russell explains that there <i>was </i>a grand plan for Sin: Episodes' story. But understanding how Ritual planned to achieve it requires an important clarification. Russell says that SiN: Episodes was not conceived as a single, nine-episode series, but as a \"trilogy of trilogies\"—basically a trio of stories, each roughly the length of a full game, split into three episodes apiece.</p>\n<p>This is important for several reasons. But from a narrative perspective, this thinking guided how Ritual structured the overarching story. Each of the trilogies would frame its story around a different character, giving them a three-act arc that would provide some form of narrative resolution in each trilogy.</p>\n<h2>Original sin</h2>\n<p>The arc of the first trilogy (which includes Emergence) would have focussed on the character Viktor Radek. Like the 1998 original, Emergence sees players resume the role of John Blade, leader of the law enforcement agency HardCORPS. Emergence opens with Blade captured by his nemesis Elexis Sinclaire, a genius geneticist, CEO of SinTEK Corporation, and a transhumanism obsessive. After Elexis injects Blade with a strange substance, he is rescued by HardCORPS teammate Jessica Cannon, whereupon the pair investigate a secret research facility hidden in the dockyard of SiN's fictional metropolis Freeport City. The episode culminates in a HardCORPS assault on SinTEK's headquarters, Supremacy Tower.</p>\n<p>Radek is a drug lord and a close associate of Sinclaire, whose trail Blade and Cannon follow to discover the secret lab. Emergence ends with Blade boarding a helicopter at the summit of Supremacy Tower, having shot down a military VTOL piloted by Radek. According to Russell, Episode Two would have commenced with Blade searching for Radek's downed aircraft, before being captured by a gang holed up in an abandoned aquarium, holding him alongside Radek who was also kidnapped by the gang.</p>\n<p>Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.</p>\n<p>From here, Blade and Radek would have sprung themselves from captivity, with the pair forming an uneasy alliance. \"It would have been an 'enemy of my enemy' type thing'\" where he would be your compatriot during Episode Two for about two thirds of the episode,\" he says.</p>\n<p>Russell says the abandoned aquarium was an idea adopted from Ritual's plans for SiN 2, a more traditional sequel that was considered before Ritual opted for an episodic model. Blade and Radek would have fought through the aquarium, with Blade acquiring a new weapon called the Capacitance Cannon. \"[This] could pull electricity from various sources around the [environment] and be able to inject energy into other areas,\" Russell says. \"Basically, it's a way of being able to use the guns for puzzle solutions.\"</p>\n<p>After escaping the aquarium, Blade and Radek would have made for a nearby dam that was under construction, complete with a temporary force field holding back the water. The final third of the episode would have seen Blade leave Radek behind in a tunnel behind the dam. Upon returning, Blade would have discovered that Radek had absconded. \"He managed to escape during that window, and [the episode] would end with the force field holding the water back being deactivated, and you getting flushed out the dam and partially flooding Freeport City.\"</p>\n<h2>Cannon fodder</h2>\n<p>From here, Ritual's plan becomes much more vague. Russell can't recall much detail about what was in store for us in episode three, but says it would have concluded Radek's storyline. The second trilogy, meanwhile, would have centred around Jessica Cannon, your companion for much of Emergence, playing a role similar to Half-Life 2's Alyx Vance.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Meta knew that no license was granted by Audiam or Eight Mile Style as part of those negotiations,” the suit emphasizes here.)</p>\n    <p>Putting the Meta-Audiam agreements on the backburner for a moment, the defendant says Eight Mile’s secondary infringement claims “are unsupported by <strong> even a single example</strong> of user-based infringement.”</p>\n    <p>“It’s not enough to claim that unidentified compositions were infringed <strong> somewhere</strong> on Meta’s services at some unknown time; without a modicum of support identifying any—let alone ‘rampant’—user infringement, Eight Mile’s secondary infringement claims cannot get off the ground,” the legal text spells out.</p>\n    <h4>\n      <strong>“Eight Mile has failed to adequately allege that even a single Meta user engaged in even a single instance of direct infringement,” another section states. “The Complaint says nothing at all about any specific users, posts, dates, or infringed compositions.”</strong>\n    </h4>\n    <p>Furthermore, the “imprecise” suit is allegedly light on particular examples of direct infringement as well.</p>\n    <p>“Eight Mile’s claim for direct infringement fails at the outset because it does not sufficiently allege that any defendant actually infringed its compositions. … [F]or over 99 percent of the works, it makes no specific allegations at all—not the identity of the purportedly infringing copies, nor which defendant made the copies, nor when any alleged copying occurred,” the dismissal motion reads.</p>\n    <p>As for the aforesaid Audiam-Meta talks, the latter entity says “Eight Mile’s account of the 2020 negotiations is incomplete.” (In the end, those negotiations produced a pair of licensing tie-ups running two years apiece.)</p>\n    <p>“While Eight Mile insists that Audiam ‘did not have the authority’ to negotiate on its behalf, documents incorporated by the Complaint say otherwise,” Meta’s motion indicates. “In a May 2025 letter, Audiam confirmed that ‘prior to any agreement being in place,’ an Audiam representative had told Meta in 2020 that ‘<strong> Audiam was authorized to represent EMS in its direct negotiation with Meta</strong>.’</p>\n    <p>“Audiam told EMS that it was negotiating with Meta,” the motion continues, “and EMS even provided Audiam with ‘a list of compositions that EMS claimed to own.’”</p>\n    <p>With that, Meta is asking the court to toss the increasingly convoluted action altogether. DMN reached out to SESAC, the owner of non-party Audiam, for comment but didn’t immediately receive a response.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

This week, the body was identified as Celeste Rivas, who had been missing from Lake Elsinore since April 2024—and it’s become apparent that she and the singer in whose car she was found may have known one another.</p>\n    <p>The remaining dates on D4vd’s U.S. tour—two stops in Los Angeles scheduled for Saturday and next Wednesday—have been <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/music/news/d4vd-cancels-tour-investigation-dead-body-car-1236523556/\">removed</a> from the venue websites as of Thursday, September 18.</p>\n    <p>Tickets for tonight’s show in San Francisco (September 19) were still on sale as of Friday morning, but it seems unlikely the concert will go on as planned. According to <i>TMZ</i>, the <a href=\"https://www.tmz.com/2025/09/19/d4vd-us-tour-cancel/\">singer’s team decided</a> to cancel all remaining dates. A concert in Seattle scheduled for Wednesday was also called off earlier in the week.</p>\n    <p>Notably, tickets for the European leg of his tour, which is scheduled to kick off in Norway on October 1, are still on sale.</p>\n    <h4>Interscope, the label representing D4vd, has also reportedly suspended the release of his upcoming album and all associated promotion. Withered Deluxe: Marcescence was due to drop today. The singer has also lost some brand promotion deals with Crocs and Hollister this week as a result of the investigation.</h4>\n    <p>Since the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s report revealed the identity of the victim this week, details have circulated online indicating that D4vd, whose real name is David Burke, knew her <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/18/kali-uchis-pulls-d4vd-collab/\">from his Discord server</a>. Lyrics of allegedly unreleased music from the singer contain the name Celeste.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, both <a href=\"https://ktla.com/news/local-news/dismembered-teen-girl-15-met-d4vd-on-social-media-alleged-former-teacher-says/?ipid=promo-link-block1\">family and teachers</a> of the deceased indicate that she was seeing someone named David before her disappearance last year.</p>\n    <p>Before the grisly discovery in his car on September 8, D4vd made headlines with a new single released as the “<a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/05/d4vd-pens-anthem-for-fortnites-global-championship/\">first-ever official anthem for Fortnite</a>,” ahead of the game’s championship tournament. D4vd rose to prominence with his Fortnite gameplay videos on YouTube before he started focusing on creating music to avoid copyright strikes on his videos.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

The estate claims Apollonia’s <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/08/20/apollonia-prince-estate-lawsuit/\">assertion</a> of an “aggressive campaign” to “steal” her name is simply untrue.</p>\n    <p>In <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apollonia-v-paisley-park-2-25-cv-07769-dismiss-sept-2025.pdf\">court filings</a> on Wednesday, the estate says it has no intention of stopping Apollonia from using the name Prince bestowed on her—but her trademark conflicts with their own.</p>\n    <p>The singer and actress, whose real name is Patricia Kotero, was christened “Apollonia” by Prince in the 1980s. In his film <i>Purple Rain</i>, she plays a character of the same name, who sings in a band called Apollonia 6. And therein lies the problem.</p>\n    <h4>Prince’s estate says it only took action against Kotero because her trademark for “Apollonia” was blocking the estate’s own efforts to trademark “Apollonia 6,” the girl group from the film which Kotero led. While her use of the name was granted with the late singer’s blessing, the estate clarifies that the trademark she obtained was granted “during [the] chaotic period following Prince’s death.”</h4>\n    <p>Further, the estate says Kotero has no grounds to sue, as her claims that the estate was threatening her and demanding she give up her name were untrue. “Plaintiff’s case should therefore be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.”</p>\n    <p>“Unfortunately, this is another attack on Apollonia’s name, which will be dealt with in Apollonia’s favor,” said her lawyer, Daniel M. Cislo, in a statement to Billboard.</p>\n    <p>Prince died of a fentanyl overdose in 2016 without a written will. His assets spent over six years in probate court while heirs and advisors fought over the estate. The valuable Prince estate is now split evenly between Paisley Park Enterprises and another group controlled by Primary Wave. Only <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/08/20/apollonia-prince-estate-lawsuit/\">Paisley Park Enterprises</a> is involved in the Apollonia dispute.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

The new biopic, in which the actress plays <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/dating-irl/\">Bumble</a> founder Whitney Wolfe Herd, explores the male-dominated tech industry and the challenges a woman faces taking it on. And for the press tour, she has certainly been dressing the part—with business casual suiting and CEO-approved looks.</p>\n    <p>Styled by <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/florence-pugh-thunderbolts-press-black-and-white-looks-nyc/\">Rebecca Corbin-Murray</a>, James was captured outside ABC on Thursday in a relaxed two-piece suit perfect for an important meeting. Carrying a black <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/a65606320/how-to-style-fisherman-pants/\">Verafied</a> shoulder bag constructed from croc-embossed leather and adorned with a silver buckle, she stepped out in straight-leg black trousers, a white wrap blouse, and <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/a64825561/jimmy-choo-archive-capsule-shoe-collection/\">Jimmy Choo</a> lace-up pumps. </p>\n    <p>The following day, the actress walked into <i>Good Morning America</i> in a <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/a65091790/black-fashion-designers-2025/\">Tove</a> midi dress designed with a high neck and short sleeve silhouette, keeping things refined and minimalistic. Draped from a smooth ivory crepe fabric, the piece folds at the waistline to add a bit of intrigue to the otherwise simple elegance. To accessorize, she opted for a white <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a65860879/anne-hathaway-the-devil-wears-prada-2-set-all-black-look-meaning/\">Prada</a> bag in patent leather, little sunglasses, and suede heels.</p>\n    <p>Later, she paired the same Prada bag with a two-piece set from the house’s Fall/Winter 2025 collection. The centerpiece, a boxy jacket, features kimono sleeves, flap pockets, and an oversized silhouette, revealing just a sliver of the matching miniskirt underneath. The irregular grain of the nappa leather gives the pieces a textured feel, and the brown hue feels perfect for the fall season. James tied a belt around the waistline in the same fabric and stepped out in pointy-toe kitten heels with raw-cut edges and visible stitching.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Regardless, their versatility defies categorization. Blessed with tender skins and jammy interiors, fresh figs can offset the tang of tomatoes and bitterness of salad greens.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>It's Preptember here at BA, and that means we're bringing some of our favorite tools and tricks for meal prep, storage, and those all-important back-to-school plans.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>There’s a special type of chaos that comes with Sunday meal prep. Every pan I own is in use, the cooktop is coated in oil splatters, papery garlic skins skitter across the floor, and the sink is stacked with dirty dishes.</p>\n    <p>For years, that was my Sunday ritual: hours of chopping, blending, and washing, just to end up with five identical dishes I’d be tired of by Tuesday. Then, I got my hands on <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/TSeEb3zLmLvBXAhZcHy7LLpHDhCNr1Zwako4Tcn7uomqVg8BtHgqP9AEYhWEFk5XPQJQEY2mGCATZvWrB7tM4dcWMhEgL7UjmN3tddqySiGH2eqoaHxVYnkW1yfpci2XbYn7i4JdBRSLJ3RGsL61pRpERC9SwpS2LBa367q87YqJ3we2vSTy8WuAzyuJBL9qid7cCW53aC8qc5s2aRmovb9ViCyqQAxjEM4LvadNNXodrRPZzEgUeuU84s7BCicYDkFcjFuQMUYyYS3kBzMq18pZDG6PatkWeP9sYFwWgGy3VNHjSrcNqNvJdpB7v8nD7wmwC2TgPtkD5A9fnpa7iT2YQ62CvAHvCMkXWBwNyM9JF8xmKfmvbjgoy74iVcSYbtM2o\">Cuisinart’s Smart Stick</a> immersion blender, and everything about that routine changed.</p>\n    <p>I (perhaps embarrassingly) own three blenders, including a Vitamix and a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/beast-mighty-blender-highly-recommend\">Beast Blender</a>, but my immersion blender is the one I reach for most when I’m working ahead. It’s the tool that turned meal prep from something I dreaded into something I (almost) look forward to.</p>\n    <h2>The case for the immersion blender</h2>\n    <p>I love cooking, I write about kitchen gadgets for a living after all, but cooking in bulk when you live alone can feel like a chore. And eating the same thing four days in a row can even get downright depressing. The way I’ve figured out how to enjoy it is by starting with basics—grains, roasted veggies, versatile proteins—and then jazzing them up with sauces, marinades, and dressings so they don’t feel repetitive. That’s where the Smart Stick comes in.</p>\n    <p>The genius of an immersion blender is that it does its job without taking over your kitchen. Instead of dirtying half a dozen bowls, I blitz soups right in the pot, emulsify vinaigrettes directly in <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/gChDhNS3tFzZU66vjJXtGu9HNRAGfHwtRPmg4DRpWxudFBMchLLgLjoLp8S4FfMbwo74JWBppx7HYpNaqkV1gTTawnymQVFcLQuyK8tXzJCeYjJiftPYBVqtGRXUjAbMJhQddTNQjUJ84QXoxMvjSvrgnkwE2QMSQawMJfR2wqVNHjoU3mReHJ8HjQcEkHCf4kamtuC1xmghyk9rYLFJzgD4dG4N6YNRaMNpaJkgCA3FaKvT7y67eZJ6uAvrQ8LNbN5QmC5cB3iTxNFYnJukP8DEn8vYYTcousBEP4dRvxL5hBTznSBtZxmomK4m35gzArWoRT2bAhQdgALDVfFJpUd6uAvRKTHkGcTGpeRetpHDHY9bnE25TQjjBhzwZs8VjoiWJ3h5h\">deli containers</a>, and blend sauces in the very vessel I’m storing them in. Pop on a lid, slide it into the fridge, and you’re done.</p>\n    <p>If you’ve ever lived in a small apartment, you know counter space is a currency. Unlike my <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-vitamix-blender\">Vitamix</a>, which takes up prime real estate on my kitchen island, the Smart Stick is slim enough to tuck away in a drawer and light enough to pop on the <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-dish-drying-racks\">dish rack</a>. There’s no more giant blender jar taking over the sink. Instead, clean-up is just a 30-second soapy rinse.</p>\n    <h2>Attachments make it even better</h2>\n    <p>This immersion blender does more than blend—it’s three tools in one. Cuisinart includes two extra attachments, a small chopper/food processor and a whisk, which amplify its meal prep ability.</p>\n    <p>The chopper attachment is my shortcut for prepping onions, garlic, and herbs, saving me from one of the most tedious parts of meal prep (seriously, if you haven’t tried mincing garlic with a mini chopper, it is as close to life-changing as a small appliance gets). It’s also a game-changer for small-batch pesto, where ingredients would barely reach the blades of a full-size food processor.</p>\n    <p>The 8-inch blending shaft is another plus. It’s longer than most other models I’ve tried, which means it can easily reach the bottom of deep stockpots or tall bowls. That means no more awkward pot-tilting and no more half-blended soups.</p>\n    <h2>What I use my Smart Stick for</h2>\n    <p>Sauces, dips, spreads, soups, marinades—you name it. If you can blend or blitz it, this thing has probably handled it in my kitchen. I’ve used mine to whip up:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Chili crisp mayo for a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/spicy-salmon-bowl\">salmon roll rice bowl</a></li>\n      <li>Classic <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/easy-homemade-caesar-dressing\">Caesar dressing</a>for big lunch salads</li>\n      <li>Chris Morocco’s <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/spiced-coconut-carrot-soup\">spiced coconut carrot soup</a>, which gets silky-smooth right in the pot</li>\n      <li>Fluffy scrambled eggs for <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/make-ahead-breakfast-sandwiches\">make-ahead freezer breakfast sandwiches</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/creamy-chimichurri-roast-chicken\">Creamy chimichurri</a>to drizzle over roast chicken</li>\n      <li>A <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/green-goddess-chicken-thighs\">green goddess marinade</a>for chicken thighs</li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/rent-week-white-bean-dip\">White bean dip</a>to keep on hand for snacks</li>\n      <li>A <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/chicken-noodle-salad-with-spicy-peanut-sauce\">spicy peanut sauce</a>to dress up bouncy, chewy noodles</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Keeping sauces and dips in deli containers or <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/mKseyLofgnuondAvCPFnRBzR6StdT4KN4gq3QWrYTktKEt3Lh42RFerLtKJ5LZh4bvbuiD1sdyAvNn5J98JU8GhDB1cncEg6QySdmBDkV9ddRXnJyHhm5hna2BPUSxMd1rk6b3gL6rrH9Expnfys3vd3rzGocJRzmQJhKDGoExzXMg1njWwaD5sk6q6yW1BeHM2YWte22qsbU6sF6ESwFVGg2RXPVuXVrvhPw3hDsvT92SsxnqVzu7tGV7jPNLVkh2adhgk5d7eyiiH3Y2K2TYEdMNZdZzkPhdKThbEjUr9gysy9zdEFeT2QcA2eWt5ttLUwZSAeri73jVNu6rBMJsQxJVQ4T3v7\">OXO squeeze bottles</a> helps me transform a fridge of plain prepped components into composed meals I actually want to eat.</p>\n    <h2>The bottom line</h2>\n    <p>Could I technically make all of this in my Vitamix? Sure. But the Smart Stick makes it so much faster, easier, and way less annoying to clean.

Coe</h2>\n<h3>Played by Tom Brooke</h3>\n<p>J.K. Coe (<strong>Tom Brooke</strong>) is the newest member of Slough House, and he's quite mysterious; <strong>Coe is quiet, barely interacts with his colleagues, and doesn't show emotion</strong>. But, when push comes to shove, he's deadly and engages in physical fights easily. He eggs on the members of Slough House, mainly IT expert Roddy Ho (<strong>Christopher Chung</strong>), teasing him that his new girlfriend is an AI bot; he also <a href=\"http://collider.com/slow-horses-season-2-cast-aimee-ffion-edwards-kadiff-kirwan/\"> saves Shirley (Aimee-Ffion Edwards</a>) from having to kill a person. </p>\n<p><strong>There are hints of Coe becoming a valuable part of the Slough House team</strong>, as long as he can open up to at least being around his coworkers.</p>\n<p>Coe is played by Tom Brooke, who fans of the AMC series <a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/preacher/\">Preacher</a> might recognize from when he played Fiore. Brooke has that mysterious look; he's tall, serious, and brooding, and he's seemingly the perfect choice to play Coe. After a conversation with Jackson Lamb (</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/gary-oldman/\">),</a>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Lamb hints at Coe outing another agent's location</strong>, which is what may have landed him in Slough House. Coe also reveals he has PTSD from being tortured while on one assignment. He was previously in the Psych Eval department at MI5.</p>\n<h2>9 Min Harper</h2>\n<h3>Played by Dustin Demri-Burns</h3>\n<p>Min Harper (spoiler alert) gets killed at the beginning of Season 2, but he's quite a memorable guy. Played by <strong>Dustin Demri-Burns</strong>, Min Harper is <strong>a well-meaning but clumsy guy, and often ends up as comic relief </strong>in the series. Compared to some other members of the Slough House, he is not without heart, and his gentle nature attracts his colleague, Louisa Guy (<strong>Rosalind Eleazar</strong>). They begin a romantic relationship, as is shown at the start of Season 2, but it's cut short when <strong> Min is killed in a hit-and-run</strong>—supposedly.</p>\n<p><i>Slow Horses</i> has had four seasons so far, and Harper has appeared in Season 1 and half of Season 2, but he's somehow still a large part of the agency (and the show). Apparently, Harper ends up in the Slough House because <strong>he accidentally, and absent-mindedly, left a top-secret hard drive on a train</strong>. This mistake warrants firing, undoubtedly, but Harper is collected by Lamb and given a second chance instead. Though he remained clumsy-ish, Harper left a great mark on Slough House.</p>\n<h2>8 Marcus Longridge</h2>\n<h3>Played by Kadiff Kirwan</h3>\n<p>Marcus Longridge (<strong>Kadiff Kirwan</strong>) is practical and tough;<strong> </strong>he doesn't seek attention, and <strong>continuously proves himself as one of the more capable agents of Slough House</strong>. Marcus' biggest problems aren't the two heavy weapons he has stashed in the trunk of his car (or boot, as the Brits would say), nor the refusal to work in MI5's main tactical operations team with Nick Duffy (<strong>Chris Reilly</strong>); his biggest problem is his gambling addiction, which causes him problems in MI5 and in Slough House. <strong>Marcus gets killed after a surprise attack on Slough House</strong>, and he also leaves a big impact on the series, even if we won't be seeing him again (unless there are flashbacks).</p>\n<p>Longridge is played by Kadiff Kirwan, and he's a big guy—tall, muscular, and serious-looking, fit to play a character like Longridge. Kirwan also makes Longridge sometimes sweet and funny, and he's often seen in tandem with Shirley. <strong>He's one of the characters who proves himself valuable over time</strong>, and shines in Season 3, when the \"slow horses\" get involved in a shootout in a file-storage facility against some formidable, dangerous enemies. He even wins a tough fistfight against Duffy, proving that Duffy's tactical team would have been more than lucky to have him.</p>\n<h2>7 Roddy Ho</h2>\n<h3>Played by Christopher Chung</h3>\n<p>Roddy Ho is one of the steady members of the Slough House; he's a <strong>brilliant tech and IT expert who can manipulate data and find things out in the blink of an eye</strong>. However, he's also obnoxious, always bragging about things, and generally unpleasant to his coworkers. Though it's easy to dislike Roddy because of his constant smugness, he is a valuable asset in Slough House and a brilliant agent; it's just that, he knows it and that's why he is the way he is.</p>\n<p><strong> Roddy is portrayed by Christopher Chung</strong>, and he's an Australian actor whose TV debut was as a contestant on the singing competition </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

While disappointing box offices prove the genre isn't as dominant as it once was, superhero movies are still here to stay and have excellent entertainment value. In this genre, hundreds of sub-genres exist, with one of the most underrated being supernatural.</a></p>\n<p>Supernatural superhero movies are those that delve into a mystical, magical, paranormal, or supernatural domain. They might feature some horror elements and usually focus on the more ethereal and spiritual side of their respective universes. With so many underrated films, <strong>this list will rank the best supernatural superhero movies</strong> based on fan opinion, critical acclaim, acting, writing, directing, popularity, and overall quality.</p>\n<h2>10 'Constantine' (2005)</h2>\n<p>One of DC's most beloved characters is <a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/constantine/\">Constantine</a>, also known as Hellblazer.

As a beloved character, fans are just happy for him to get a solo movie, with some nostalgic moments and riveting demon-hunting action. Sure, the film's overall execution is uneven at best, but it's a solid entry in the superhero genre that benefits from inspired casting, including Reeves and Oscar winner <strong>Tilda Swinton</strong> as the Archangel Gabriel.</p>\n<h2>9 'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness' (2022)</h2>\n<p>Marvel is full of street-level and cosmic heroes, but it also has a surprisingly large number of supernatural heroes; however, only Doctor Strange (<strong>Benedict Cumberbatch</strong>) has gotten a solo movie. <a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness/\">Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</a> was his second film, where he and America Chavez (</p>\n<p><strong>Xochitl Gomez</strong>) had to fend off the Scarlet Witch (</p>\n<p><strong>Elizabeth Olsen</strong>) and her attempts at traveling the multiverse to find alternate versions of her children.</p>\n<p><i>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</i> was a polarizing film, largely because of its depiction of the Scarlet Witch, but in the long run, it is still an entertaining MCU entry with plenty of cameos and dark moments. <strong>The dark magic and sorcery were abundant</strong>, creating <strong>an epic supernatural atmosphere</strong> that was only held back by some odd choices that didn't fit into the story or universe.</p>\n<h2>8 'Blade' (1998)</h2>\n<p><strong>Blade</strong><strong> </strong>is one of Marvel's best properties that it hasn't treated so well, as </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://collider.com/blade-mcu-kevin-feige-update/\">fans are still waiting for the MCU's version</a></p>\n<p>to get off the ground. While this lack of development is frustrating, fans at least have a handful of original <i>Blade </i>movies to love. The first film introduces <strong>Wesley Snipes</strong> as a half-immortal on a lifelong quest for revenge after vampires killed his mother.</p>\n<p><i>Blade </i>isn't the best-reviewed supernatural superhero film, but fans can agree that it is a riveting ride of <strong>blood, gore, violence, and vampire-killing goodness</strong>. It was groundbreaking for its blend of horror and superhero themes, which combined to create a distinct movie that the audience couldn't get enough of. With <strong>stylish fights and supernatural worldbuilding</strong>, <i>Blade </i>is an unforgettable superhero movie and one of the genre's most refreshing entries.</p>\n<h2>7 'Hellboy' (2004)</h2>\n<p>Some actors are perfect fits for their comic-book counterpart, but there aren't many better fits than <strong>Ron Perlman</strong> as <a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/hellboy/\">Hellboy</a>. After the Nazi's failed to open a portal to the demon world during the Second World War, only a small baby emerged, and that child would grow up to serve the world alongside his peculiar friends in a lifelong battle against the dark forces plaguing the Earth.</p>\n<p><i>Hellboy </i>has a strong presence of both CGI and practical effects, <strong>making the most out of its supernatural atmosphere</strong> to deliver a believable and visually appealing world. Perlman is phenomenal in this role, and the direction of Oscar winner and horror maestro <strong>Guillermo del Toro</strong> adds another layer of mysticism that fans can't help but adore, creating a magnificent supernatural film that is <a href=\"https://collider.com/comic-book-tv-shows-not-for-kids/\"> a comic-book movie not for kids</a>.</p>\n<h2>6 'Shazam!' (2019)</h2>\n<p>The DCEU was a failed experiment that only had a handful of good movies, and one of those notable films was <a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/shazam/\">Shazam!</a> Following a boy who gains the powers of an ancient wizard, he naturally uses them for selfish deeds until he realizes the responsibility he faces. Now facing demons and an evil sorcerer, he must overcome his trauma and childlike tendencies if he wants to be a superhero.</p>\n<p><i>Shazam </i>is a surprisingly under-the-radar superhero film; many fans know it is excellent, but no one seems to talk about it much, probably because of its underwhelming sequel and the controversies surrounding its lead actor. While the best part of the film was its family dynamic and enjoyable moments, it was still <strong>shockingly dark with plenty of supernatural themes</strong>. The DCU needs more mystical elements, and <a href=\"https://collider.com/dc-heroes-perfect-dcu-justice-gang/\"> Shazam is perfect for the Justice Gang</a>.</p>\n<h2>5 'Blade II' (2002)</h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p><a href=\"http://collider.com/tag/edgar-wright\"> Edgar Wright</a> is finally returning to the big screen this year with his take on </p><p><a href=\"http://collider.com/tag/the-running-man\">, starring</a></p><strong/><i>The Running Man</i><p><strong>favorite</strong></p><i>Top Gun: Maverick</i><p><a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/glen-powell/\">. An adaptation of</a></p><strong>Glen Powell</strong><p><strong>Stephen King</strong>'s 1982 dystopian thriller story, the film has been long in the making for the</p><p><strong>and the</strong></p><i>Hot Fuzz</i><p><strong>director, aiming to give</strong></p><i>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</i><p><a href=\"https://collider.com/the-running-man-remake-improve-vfx-arnold-schwarzenegger-comments/\">a more accurate depiction of the original novel</a>than the 1987</p><p><strong>Arnold Schwarzenegger</strong>action flick. However, while Wright's latest feature is preparing to sprint into theaters, his last effort will be fleeing streaming soon.</p><p><strong>On October 1, the psychological horror thriller</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/last-night-in-soho/\"/></p><strong/><i>Last Night in Soho</i><p><strong>will be departing</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://collider.com/tag/peacock\">Peacock</a>, leaving only a few short weeks for subscribers to catch up before</p><p><i>The Running Man</i>'s arrival on November 14.</p><p>Released in 2021, <i>Last Night in Soho</i> was one of two features Wright delivered that year, alongside the much-lauded documentary <strong> The Sparks Brothers</strong>. In a change of pace for the director after </p><p><a href=\"https://collider.com/baby-driver-car-stunts/\">his stylish 2017 actioner</a>, it was a</p><strong/><i>Baby Driver</i><p><a href=\"https://collider.com/anya-taylor-joy-last-night-in-soho/\">more ambitious, genre-bending affair</a>, blending elements of horror and psychological thrillers with a time-traveling mystery split between modern London and its glittery past. At the center is aspiring fashion designer Eloise (</p><p><a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/thomasin-mckenzie/\">), who moves to the city to realize her dreams. Once there, however, she finds herself able to travel back to the 1960s, encountering a dazzling wannabe singer named Sadie (</a></p><strong>Thomasin McKenzie</strong><p><a href=\"http://collider.com/tag/anya-taylor-joy\">), with whom she becomes enamored. In time, though, she realizes that the glamour of her life isn't as it seems, and the dreams of the past begin to haunt her.</a></p><strong>Anya Taylor-Joy</strong><p>Joining McKenzie and Taylor-Joy are <strong> House of the Dragon</strong> star </p><p><a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/matt-smith/\">, alongside</a></p><strong>Matt Smith</strong><p><a href=\"https://collider.com/terence-stamp-last-night-in-soho-horror-movie/\">and</a></p><strong>Terence Stamp</strong><p><strong>Diana Rigg</strong>in their final film roles. Thanks to</p><p><a href=\"https://collider.com/movies-ruined-by-endings/\">an ending that missed the mark</a>in the eyes of many viewers,</p><p><i>Last Night in Soho</i>isn't quite as beloved as some of Wright's other work, but it still earned a lot of praise. It holds a Certified Fresh 75% from critics on Rotten Tomatoes and a Verified Hot 89% with audiences, with a lot of praise for the performance of the two leads and the visual style the director brought to the table.</p><h2>What Is 'The Running Man' About?</h2><p><i>The Running Man</i> <a href=\"https://collider.com/the-running-man-trailer-tone-different-from-book/\">brings Wright back to the action genre</a>, albeit with a darker, grittier tone befitting King's story. It features Powell as working-class hero Ben Richards in a near-future society where the public is enamored by a violent game show where contestants <a href=\"https://collider.com/glen-powell-the-running-man-trailer/\">must survive 30 days of being hunted</a> by professional assassins to win a life-changing cash reward. When his daughter falls ill, he's convinced by the show's slick and sinister producer to participate, where his tenacity and instincts in the face of death make him a crowd favorite and a real threat to the entire system. Wright had a star-studded cast to work with, including <a href=\"http://collider.com/tag/josh-brolin/\"> Josh Brolin</a>, </p><p><a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/colman-domingo/\">,</a></p><strong>Colman Domingo</strong><p><strong>William H. Macy</strong>,</p><p><a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/lee-pace/\"/></p><strong>Lee Pace</strong>,<p><strong>Emilia Jones</strong>, and</p><p><a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/michael-cera/\">, among others. He</a></p><strong>Michael Cera</strong><p><a href=\"https://collider.com/the-running-man-glen-powell-image-edgar-wright-stephen-king-adaptation-comments/\">told Collider for our exclusive preview series</a>, however, that Powell's addition was instrumental in capturing that everyman heart.</p><blockquote><p>“Part of the fun for me was casting someone like Glen just before they’ve made the leap to full-on action icon. I kept thinking about who</p><i>Bruce Willis</i>was before<i>, he was only known to audiences as the romantic lead in</i><i>Die Hard</i><i>. Glen is such a relatable, charming actor, and it’s fun to put him through the mill and see him spend the movie literally on the run. The whole film is more exciting with Glen being your everyman at the heart of the action. You see him sweat, you see him think, you keep him on his back foot for the whole adventure. I’m so thrilled with Glen’s performance in the lead. The Ben Richards in Stephen King’s novel is an everyman; he’s tough because he’s worked some of the worst jobs in the world, but he’s not a trained killer or superhero. He’s an out of work father, who out of desperation to get medicine for his daughter, risks everything on the deadliest game show of all time.”</i><i>Moonlighting</i></blockquote><p>Before <i>The Running Man</i> hits theaters, catch <strong> Last Night in Soho on Peacock before it leaves on October 1</strong>.

    "body": "<p><i/>(based on a novel series by </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/game-of-thrones/\">Game of Thrones</a></p>\n<p><strong>George R. R. Martin</strong>) was a massive television phenomenon due to a variety of factors, which revolutionized the entire medium of TV. With how many millions of dollars it made in its successful eight years, it's to be expected that many other showrunners are going to take a look at the trends of television and seize the opportunity, weaving their own fantasy stories that are usually based on books.</p>\n<p><i>Game of Thrones </i>came to a close in 2019, but its resounding legacy can still be felt in the modern world. People still talk about it regularly, and there are many big-budget fantasy TV series that are doing their best to make sure that it stays that way. Fantasy TV is more popular than ever, thanks to <i>Game of Thrones</i>, but <strong>now that it's done, it's up to others to make sure that the fantasy trend in TV doesn't die out</strong>. Here are seven TV shows doing just that.</p>\n<h2>7 'The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power' (2022–)</h2>\n<p><strong/>is kind of polarizing—some love it, some hate it. But there's no doubt that the series has become an undeniable success for Amazon Prime, in spite of receiving only two seasons. This series details some of the previously unseen history detailed in </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-power/\">The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</a></p>\n<p><strong>J. R. R. Tolkien</strong>'s legendarium and answers a lot of questions about the myth and origins of certain characters. Unfortunately, not everyone was pleased with the execution, or with how it tried to weave its own story instead of adapting some of the more exciting bits of Tolkien's work.</p>\n<p>However you personally feel about it, <i>The Rings of Power </i>has played an essential part in the world of fantasy television. Its monetary success has proven that the demand for fantasy television is still high, and that big-budget series on a grand scale are still profitable. <strong> Game of Thrones introduced people to a new type of television, and many other shows kept the ball rolling</strong> for viewers, which is why </p>\n<p><i>The Rings of Power</i>is still a key member of</p>\n<p><i>Game of Thrones</i>' legacy.</p>\n<h2>6 'The Witcher' (2019–)</h2>\n<p><strong/>was the show that most people immediately flocked to after </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/the-witcher/\">The Witcher</a></p>\n<p><i>Game of Thrones</i>ended, because it was released just a few short months after the latter. Like</p>\n<p><i>Game of Thrones</i>,</p>\n<p><i>The Witcher</i>is</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://collider.com/fantasy-shows-based-on-books-best-ranked/\">, this time by Polish author</a></p>\n<p><strong>Andrzej Sapkowski</strong>. The series follows Geralt of Rivia (</p>\n<p><strong>Henry Cavill</strong>&amp;</p>\n<p><strong>Liam Hemsworth</strong>), a professional monster hunter known as a Witcher, who travels across the land killing some of the creepiest and most dangerous monsters from folklore.</p>\n<p>Like <i>Game of Thrones</i>, this show features an epic scale, some pretty gnarly blood and gore, and of course, lots of sex, which it isn't afraid to show. While it definitely fell off as it went on, after the bitter disappointment many experienced with the final season of <i>Game of Thrones</i>, <i>The Witcher</i>'s gripping first season proved to be exactly what they needed. <strong> The Witcher has definitely done its part to keep the fantasy TV behemoth going</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong/></p>\n<h2>5 'Outlander' (2014–)</h2>\n<p><strong/>doesn't exactly take place in a high fantasy world—in fact, it takes place throughout human history, typically detailing some of the world's most famous rebellions and revolutions. However, this still paves the way for it to feature some truly marvelous landscapes with enormous scale, including massive battles as a companion to its main story. The story in question is more of a romantasy involving a supernatural ability to time travel, with each season taking place at a different point in history.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/tv-show/outlander/\">Outlander</a></p>\n<p><i>Outlander </i>does a lot that <i>Game of Thrones </i>did too, and was one of the first shows to really capitalize on the trends offered by the hit HBO series. Ironically, <i>Outlander </i>outlasted <i>Game of Thrones </i>by several years and is still going strong, though it is set to release its final season next year. <strong>This series also inspired a spin-off, and keeps the concepts of steamy sex scenes and massive, violent confrontations in place</strong>. It might be thematically different from <i>Game of Thrones</i>, but conceptually, <i>Outlander </i>has helped the trend continue.<strong> </strong></p>\n<h2>4 'The Wheel of Time' (2021–2025)</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/the-wheel-of-time/\">The Wheel of Time </a>is a true modern tragedy, as the show was cancelled just when it was hitting its stride. This abrupt and unexplained cancellation was met with a vehement </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://collider.com/the-wheel-of-time-petition-passes-goal-124-thousand-signatures/\">, involving hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions of people. The series is based on</a></p>\n<p><strong>Robert Jordan</strong>'s series of novels of the same name, but many book readers didn't like how it deviated from its source. That said, the show was eventually able to gain momentum, with each season being much better than the one before. Season 3 was actually awesome, which, of course, is when Amazon gave it the axe.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>There is no denying the brilliance of <a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/cristin-milioti/\"> Cristin Milioti</a>, with her recent performance in </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>garnering critical acclaim and earning her the Emmy Award for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie. However, her ability to hold her own against</strong>\n    </p>\n    <i>The Penguin</i>\n    <p><strong>Andy Samberg</strong>in the sci-fi dramedy</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/palm-springs/\">should not be understated. The movie itself is fascinating in the way it doesn't dwell on its time loop premise and instead examines the characters trapped within it.</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong/>\n    <i>Palm Springs</i>\n    <p><strong>It answers every curiosity a viewer may have about the possibilities of repeating the same day, but does so in a deeply personal manner.</strong>Andy Samberg plays to type, using sarcasm and physical humor to portray Nyles' disassociation with reality and emphasizing just how long he has been in the loop.</p>\n    <p>Cristin Milioti has a much more complex task, as Sarah <a href=\"https://collider.com/palm-springs-andy-samberg-commentary-version-hulu/\">enters into the time loop during the movie's runtime</a>. This means Milioti has to showcase a huge range of emotions that Nyles has already gone through. There is initial mania, the realization of freedom, and the eventual denial of the truth. She acts as the audience surrogate, learning about the inner workings of the loop at the same time as the audience, and therefore reacting in an authentic and relatable manner. While Samberg gets a huge proportion of the laughs, the jokes don't land without Milioti's ability to maintain the same energy and delivery. It makes<i> Palm Springs</i> one of the <a href=\"https://collider.com/best-90-minute-movies-entertaining/\">most individualistic and comforting comedies of the 21st century. </a></p>\n    <h2>Cristin Milioti's Performance in 'Palm Springs' is Charmingly Erratic</h2>\n    <p><i>Palm Springs</i> is an incredibly charming iteration of the <i> Groundhog Day</i> set-up and manages to set itself apart in </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://collider.com/amazing-time-loop-movies-arent-groundhog-day/\">a fairly formulaic sub-genre.</a>The movie makes the clever decision to open with Nyles (Samberg) attempting to impress Sarah (Milioti) by perfectly predicting each guest's actions and bailing her out of giving a speech at her sister's wedding. Milioti has to sow the seeds of Sarah's apathy towards life and general distaste for her family's affairs while keeping Sarah likable and believable. Her more muted performance, through her quick retorts towards Nyles, allows the shifts in character after the night's events to be even more impactful.</p>\n    <p>The reveal of the time loop is shown through Nyles relaxing on a pizza-shaped pool float, with a purposefully idyllic and calm tone.<a href=\"https://collider.com/cristin-milioti-30-rock-abby/\"> Milioti enters the scene like a hurricane</a>, screaming at Nyles as she throws beer cans his way. <strong>The contrast from her unbothered, relaxed manner to this raging whirlwind is a jolt to the movie's pacing and allows it to become much more high-octane and erratic</strong>. Through her presence, Milioti shifts the whole feel of the movie and <a href=\"https://collider.com/palm-springs-best-time-loop-movies-to-binge-over-groundhog-day/\">cements the rage Sarah feels towards the situation</a> and that tendency to become quickly agitated, a theme that returns later in the movie.</p>\n    <h2>Cristin Milioti Gives Emotional Depth to 'Palm Springs'</h2>\n    <p> <i>Palm Springs</i> may begin as a standard exploration of tropes, with Nyles and Sarah's romance feeling inevitable. However, the pair's chemistry means <a href=\"https://collider.com/palm-springs-cristin-milioti-interview/\">their exploration of their newfound freedom is incredibly charming</a> as they try out different possibilities of the day. One moment of the pair tenderly exchanging words of admiration while watching drug-induced dinosaurs is equally adorable and bizarre, and perfectly shows that the pair have found camaraderie in their existence on the fringes of normality.</p>\n    <p>However, <a href=\"https://collider.com/seven-sisters-cast-elizabeth-olsen-cristin-milioti/\">Milioti's performance becomes much more introspective</a> as she uncovers the truths of the wedding day. The framing device means each day, Sarah and Nyles learn more about each other, but also the actions of other wedding guests. After Sarah makes a huge mistake, Milioti conveys the weight of guilt on her as she attempts to reflect on her errors and the repercussions of these actions on other people. Through these moments of sadness, Milioti balances the emotional weight of the movie and allows it to transcend the comedy genre and carve its own identity. Although <a href=\"https://collider.com/andy-samberg-best-movies-ranked/\">Samberg reaches his usual levels of hilarity</a>, it is Milioti who serves as the beating heart of <i>Palm Springs </i>and is ultimately the catalyst for the plot, as Sarah doesn't have Nyles' sense of nihilism.</p>\n    <p><strong>Despite her incredibly emotive performance at times, Milioti knows when to switch back to a more comedic style and steadily navigates the differing states of Sarah's psyche.</strong> Even when her character is irate or dejected, she still leans into physical comedy and sharp line delivery when it allows <i>Palm Springs</i> to <a href=\"https://collider.com/palm-springs-ending-explained/\">retain its neon sheen, which makes it such a comforting watch</a>. The movie manages to tackle existential issues and moral dilemmas in a serious manner without feeling didactic. Andy Samberg's witty, carefree performance only works because he has Milioti to bounce off, and her role gives both characters layers and nuances. Through this, the predictable romance still feels earned, and the movie is able to push its concept beyond its limits.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://static0.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2024/04/palm-springs-movie-poster.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=contain&amp;w=480&amp;dpr=2\" alt=\"palm-springs-movie-poster.jpg\"/>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n                                            <strong>Release Date</strong></li>\n      <li>July 10, 2020</li>\n      <li>\n                                            <strong>Runtime</strong></li>\n      <li>90 minutes</li>\n      <li>\n                                            <strong>Director</strong></li>\n      <li>Max Barbakow</li>\n      <li>\n                                            <strong>Writers</strong></li>\n      <li>Andy Siara</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3>Cast</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n                                                                                <graphic width=\"100\" height=\"130\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"low\" alt=\"instar52500299-1.jpg\" data-img-url=\"https://static0.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2025/01/instar52500299-1.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=50&amp;h=65&amp;dpr=2\" src=\"https://static0.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2025/01/instar52500299-1.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=50&amp;h=65&amp;dpr=2\"/>\n        \n                                        \n                                    </li>\n      <li>\n                                                                                <graphic width=\"100\" height=\"130\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"low\" alt=\"Cast Placeholder Image\" data-img-url=\"https://static0.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2024/07/screen-hub-cast-placeholder-1.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=50&amp;h=65&amp;dpr=2\" src=\"https://static0.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2024/07/screen-hub-cast-placeholder-1.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=50&amp;h=65&amp;dpr=2\"/>\n        \n                                        Jena Friedman</li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>A complex heroine with incredible fighting skills who raised the bar for on-screen depictions of women in general. A red-haired young woman who started out as a plucky and somewhat naive sidekick only to mature into a far more complex and capable figure. A comic relief companion who proved to have far more emotional substance than their initial appearance would suggest. A 1990s-born fantasy-action TV series that could be shamelessly silly and self-aware (so much so that it even included a musical episode, itself essentially unheard of for its genre at the time), yet was also willing and capable of going to some dark places and would continue to do so the further along it went.</p>\n<p>Throw in a crucial behind-the-scenes creative who would later evolve from a cult favorite artist into a big-name filmmaker thanks to their work on a Marvel superhero blockbuster, and what do you get? \"Xena: Warrior Princess,\" a show so influential that I almost tricked myself into thinking I was actually talking about the \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" TV series and ruined my own joke.</p>\n<p>If there is, broadly speaking, a crucial difference between \"Xena\" and \"Buffy\" (other than \"Xena\" executive producer Sam Raimi being still widely admired, <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1421172/buffy-sequel-slayers-actors-address-joss-whedon-allegations/\">unlike \"Buffy\" creator Joss Whedon</a>), then it would probably be their queer subject matter ... or, more accurately, the lack of explicit queer material in \"Xena.\" Of course, if those familiar with the show's reputation are confused right about now, I don't blame you. As anyone who's ever seen the series could tell you, '90s television didn't get much queerer than \"Xena.\" Frankly, the relationship between Lucy Lawless' titular, \"Alalaes!\"-yelling, chakram-chucking warrior princess and her other half Gabrielle (Renee O'Connor) is a better portrayal of a same-sex couple than a lot of the actual queer representation we've gotten from mainstream media in the 21st century.</p>\n<p>If you're wondering why the minds behind \"Xena\" didn't just cut to the chase and make XGab aka Xabrielle aka Warriorward (and other <a href=\"https://shipping.fandom.com/wiki/Shipping\">ship names</a> that've never quite caught on) canon, it all came down to the same thing that it so often does in this industry: money.</p>\n<h2>Xena's studio backers didn't want to scare advertisers away</h2>\n<p>As much as \"Xena\" helped get the ball rolling for the \"Buffy\" TV show and its many descendants (<a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/643639/the-daily-stream-can-we-finally-admit-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-the-movie-is-good-actually/\">director Fran Rubel Kuzui's delightful \"Buffy\" movie</a> had indeed come out three years before \"Xena\" debuted in 1995, but it was a very different beast), it also had somewhat bad timing. The LGBTQ+ small screen revolution ushered in by the likes of \"Will &amp; Grace\" didn't occur until late into the series' run, so studio executives were profoundly wary of the notion of a Xena-Gabrielle romance. \"That's like one of the few times that [studio execs] ever said, 'You can't do that, we'll lose advertisers,'\" as \"Xena\" co-creator Robert Tapert explained to <a href=\"https://ew.com/xena-warrior-princess-oral-history-lucy-lawless-11778932\">Entertainment Weekly</a> for its 30th anniversary oral history of the making of the show.</p>\n<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, this only encouraged the minds behind \"Xena\" (who clearly had a sense of humor about their work) to misbehave by playing up the show's queer subtext. \"It took a little time before we realized ... I mean, we were really not doing it for the audience. We were doing it to be naughty,\" Tapert admitted, recalling that the series' studio backers wouldn't even allow Xena and Gabrielle to appear in the same shots in the show's opening titles (lest anyone get the \"wrong\" idea about the pair's feelings for one another). \"They were that strict about not wanting to make any insinuation that there was more between them than just good buddies. It was never really meant to be about two gay women on the road together, that developed on its own,\" Tapert added.</p>\n<p>Had the timing been just a little different, it's possible \"Xena\" would've even made Xena-slash-Gabrielle fully canonical as well. Lest we forget, the \"Buffy\" TV series gave its own red-haired lead, Alyson Hannigan's Willow Rosenberg, an honest-to-goodness girlfriend in the form of Amber Benson's magic-wielding Tara Maclay just as \"Xena\" was winding down. (It ended after six seasons in 2001.) In spite of that, the latter's place in queer TV history remains secure to this day, in no small part thanks to Lawless and O'Connor themselves.</p>\n<h2>Xena/Gabrielle isn't canon, but it also basically is</h2>\n<p>Part of the problem with modern mainstream queer media is that it tends to be overtly timid and meek. Too often, acts of queer intimacy and affection are reduced to blink-and-you'll-miss-them moments, while queer characters themselves aren't always allowed to be multifaceted or have much in the way of personality (see also: <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1920823/netflix-sandman-season-2-ruins-comic-moment-wanda/\">how Netflix's \"The Sandman\" season 2 did trans comic book icon Wanda dirty</a>). It's all a result of studios and streamers wanting to earn brownie points for being inclusive without drawing too much controversy in the process. But considering <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/snoop-dogg-lgbt-representation-lightyear.html\">certain folks apparently can't even handle</a> a same-sex duo sharing a chaste kiss for less than a second in a Pixar film, there's really no point in trying to appease them.</p>\n<p>This is also what makes \"Xena\" so refreshing, as its crew \"embraced the lesbian subtext with unbridled glee\" upon learning of the show's popularity in the queer community, as R.J. Stewart (who co-developed the series) told EW. He later added:</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

As the most popular and mainstream vehicle for sketch comedy since 1975, \"SNL\" has not only kickstarted the careers of some of the greatest comedic voices of all time (Eddie Murphy, Tina Fey, Will Ferrell, etc.), but also has influenced modern life both culturally and politically. </p>\n<p>Yet, for many people, their knowledge of sketch comedy starts and ends with \"SNL,\" when even the show itself owes so much to comedies that came before it. Some \"SNL\" stars have gone on to make their own sketch-driven series since starring on the NBC show, while other popular sketch shows rose into the mainstream to challenge the relevance of \"SNL\" for a time. These 15 TV shows include the forefathers of \"SNL,\" the sketches spawned from its comedic influence, and even a glimpse at what the future of sketch comedy looks like thanks to the Internet.</p>\n<h2>Monty Python's Flying Circus</h2>\n<p>Talk to any professional comedy writer, and you'll likely hear a story about their first exposure to Monty Python. The British sketch troupe (which included John Cleese, Eric Idle, Michael Palin, Graham Chapman, Terry Gilliam, and Terry Jones) created one of <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1861921/best-british-tv-shows-ranked/\">the best British TV shows of all time</a> in \"Monty Python's Flying Circus,\" which is as timeless as it is laugh-out-loud funny, with premises as unexpected as the Spanish Inquisition.</p>\n<p>Among the series' most famous sketches include the \"Dead Parrot\" sketch, in which Cleese tries to return a dead parrot to an incompetent pet store owner, and \"The Ministry of Silly Walks,\" a dead-pan sketch documenting a municipal organization inventing new, ridiculous ways to walk. Many of these sketches later appeared in the film adaptation of the series, \"And Now for Something Completely Different,\" which predated the troupe's venture into film with \"Holy Grail\" and \"Life of Brian.\" If you were teaching Sketch Comedy 101 class, \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" would simply be required viewing.</p>\n<h2>Second City Television</h2>\n<p>\"SNL\" famously poached <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1685571/saturday-night-live-first-episode-actors-still-alive/\">its main actors and writers for the first ever season</a> from two places: \"The National Lampoon Radio Hour,\" and \"The Second City\" improv theaters in Chicago and Toronto. However, many members of the latter community who weren't initially invited to join \"SNL\" took their comedic efforts to a Canadian sketch series, \"Second City Television,\" which aired from 1976 to 1984 and starred future comedy legends like Rick Moranis, Catherine O'Hara, John Candy, Martin Short, and Andrea Martin.</p>\n<p>Although the show never broke through in the mainstream like their comrades at \"SNL,\" many comedy fanatics at the time preferred it over the NBC-produced series for being more off the beaten path. While some characters, like Short's Ed Grimley, would later move over to \"SNL,\" others, like Moranis and Dave Thomas' Bob and Doug of \"Great White North,\" even got their own film in 1983, \"Strange Brew.\" Ultimately, \"SCTV\" was always overshadowed by its New York rival, but re-watching it offers an idea of what else was going on in the comedy scene during \"SNL's\" heyday.</p>\n<h2>Kids in the Hall</h2>\n<p>\"The Kids in the Hall\" began as a Canadian sketch troupe in the early '80s before they were discovered by none other than Lorne Michaels, who rather than adopt them over on \"Saturday Night Live,\" helped them develop their own series on CBC (HBO in the states). The group consisted of Dave Foley, Mark McKinney, Kevin McDonald, Scott Thompson, and Bruce McCulloch, and in the vein of \"Monty Python's Flying Circus,\" they played ostensibly every role in the series, whether it be male or female.</p>\n<p>What was notable about \"The Kids in the Hall,\" compared to other sketch shows at the time, was how willing it was to tackle difficult subjects of everyday life, <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/634562/the-daily-stream-kids-in-the-hall-taught-me-its-ok-to-be-uncomfortable/\">teaching viewers it's ok to be uncomfortable</a>. Sadly, most of the show's cast is better known for their later work (Foley starred in \"NewsRadio,\" McKinney joined \"SNL\" in the late '90s, and McDonald has lent voice work to several animated franchises), but they made a well-deserved reunion in 2022 on Amazon Prime, which saw <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/855334/the-kids-in-the-hall-review-the-canadian-quintet-returns-mostly-to-comic-form/\">the Canadian quintet return mostly to comic form</a>. </p>\n<h2>In Living Color</h2>\n<p>\"In Living Color\" may have only been on the air for four years, but its impact on the sketch comedy landscape can still be felt to this day. The Emmy-winning Fox series stood out from the crowd when it premiered in the early 90s by having a cast that was predominately black, especially compared to \"SNL,\" which back then only had non-white representation in Chris Rock, Tim Meadows, and Ellen Cleghorne. \"In Living Color\" boasted David Alan Grier, Jamie Foxx, and the Wayans family, but by far the biggest star to come from the sketch show was Jim Carrey.</p>\n<p>Though many might not think of \"In Living Color\" as <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/773185/the-jim-carrey-role-that-changed-hollywood-forever/\">the Jim Carrey role that changed Hollywood forever</a>, the comedian originated iconic characters like Fire Marshall Bill (<a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1278324/liar-liar-gave-jim-carrey-a-second-sneaky-role-that-you-probably-missed/\">who makes a stealthy cameo in \"Liar Liar\"</a>) and Vera de Milo on the program, which also included characters and sketches like Homey the Clown and Calhoun Tubbs. Sadly, it was cancelled by Fox after the Wayans brothers left the program due to creative differences. </p>\n<h2>The State</h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

There is a scene about halfway through the film, you see, where the post-apocalyptic badass Snake Plissken (Russell) is being forced by the evil Duke of New York (Isaac Hayes) to fight a monstrous wrestler named Slag (<a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1575434/kurt-russell-escape-from-new-york-faced-real-wrestler/\">real-life wrestler Ox Baker</a>) in a gladiatorial arena. Both Snake and Slag are armed with nail-encrusted baseball bats and trash can lids that serve as shields. Carpenter recalls filming the fight, and noted that Baker, used to actual wrestling matches, was thwacking at Russell a little too hard. It was all Russell could do to block Baker's aggressive blows. </p>\n    <p>Evidently, Russell, tired of actually fighting for his life, called Baker aside in between takes and told him to pull his thwacks a little better. To emphasize his point, Russell reached forward and flicked Baker directly on a very sensitive part of his anatomy. Baker got the hint and stopped hitting Russell quite so hard.</p>\n    <p>The deathblow in the \"Escape from New York\" wrestling match was pretty brutal. Snake was able to work his way behind the Slag and swing his bat directly into the back of his skull. Because the bat was encrusted with nails, the bat stuck deep into the Slag and remained in place when Snake took his hands away. To achieve this effect, a block of wood was strapped to Ox Baker's head, and Russell was instructed to swing a nailed bat directly at the block. It would hurt Baker, but it would certainly not kill him. Well, provided Russell did it right. Yes, he actually bonked Ox Baker in the head. Luckily, it all went according to plan.</p>\n    <h2>Kurt Russell hit Ox Baker in the head with a baseball bat</h2>\n    <p>Baker might have been worried about the stunt, as Russell had already given him a warning. Russell, however, wasn't going to play around at that point and actually hit the block of wood as assigned. Russell has commented multiple times (<a href=\"https://collider.com/kurt-russell-escape-from-new-york-capetown-film-fest-recap/\">at fan conventions and the like</a>) on how difficult the entire experience was. The wrestling ring was built in the St. Louis Union Station, and it took three days to shoot. The day of the thwacking was \"a nightmare.\" Russell said that he was really just fighting for his life, and that a trash can lid hit him in the face at least five times. The actor was grateful he wasn't more seriously injured. </p>\n    <p>Some of the shots of the wrestling match floated around the ring, a result of Carpenter's fondness for the Panaglide, which was Panavision's version <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/533297/the-art-of-steadicam/\">of the Steadicam</a>. Those are the branded names for a specialized type of body-strapped camera rigs worn by a camera operator. The rigs allowed operators to keep the giant film cameras steady as they walked around a scene and shoot from every angle. In 1981, when \"Escape from New York\" was being filmed, those kinds of shots were novel; Steadicams weren't in common usage until \"Bound for Glory\" in 1976. Carpenter loved using the Panaglide on \"Halloween\" in 1978, and he made his shots more ambitious for \"Escape from New York.\" </p>\n    <p>The camera was locked down, however, for the wood block shot. It was required that Ox Baker stay perfectly still as Russell drove the nail into his head, and it made sense — both for safety and for visual clarity — to keep the image static.</p>\n    <p>Ox Baker passed away in 2014 at the age of 80, but \"Escape from New York\" was certainly a career highlight,</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Not by a long shot. Several new spin-off shows set in this ever-expanding universe are currently in development, <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1820154/luke-grimes-kayce-dutton-yellowstone-spin-off/\">including one that will bring back Luke Grimes as Kayce Dutton, this time on CBS</a>. Named \"Y: Marshals,\" the show will bring Kayce from Paramount+ to network television, and he's bringing a lot of company with him. But one key face will be missing, it seems.</p>\n    <p>Several casting updates for the series have been shared ahead of its premiere, which is slated for sometime in 2026. In an August report from <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/y-marshals-cast-gil-birmingham-brecken-merrill-yellowstone-1236499002/\">Variety</a>, it was revealed that the show will see returning cast members Gil Birmingham (Thomas Rainwater), Mo Brings Plenty (Mo), and Brecken Merrill (Tate Dutton). The ensemble also includes the likes of Logan Marshall-Green (\"Upgrade\") as Pete Calvin, Arielle Kebbel (\"Ballers) as Belle, Ash Santos (\"Mayor of Kingstown\") as Andrea, Tatanka Means (\"Reservation Dogs\") as Miles, Brett Cullen (\"Joker\") as Harry Gifford.</p>\n    <p>Notably absent from that list is Kelsey Asbille, who plays Monica Dutton on \"Yellowstone.\" <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1725764/yellowstone-dutton-family-tree-explained/\">For those who need a refresher on the Dutton family tree</a>, Kayce and Monica are married. Kayce is the son of Kevin Costner's John Dutton III. They share a son, Tate, with Brecken Merrill reprising his role in the new show. So, where is Monica? That's a big question that will need to be answered. As for what the show is about? The synopsis reads as follows:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>With the Yellowstone Ranch behind him, Kayce Dutton (Grimes) joins an elite unit of U.S. Marshals, combining his skills as a cowboy and Navy SEAL to bring range justice to Montana, where he and his teammates must balance family, duty and the high psychological cost that comes with serving as the last line of defense in the region's war on violence.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <h2>Why isn't Monica Dutton in Y: Marshals?</h2>\n    <p>All we can do is speculate about Monica's absence from the show. Kayce and Monica may be separated in \"Y: Marshals,\" at least at the beginning. Is it possible that the show is going to kill off Monica, <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1878807/kevin-costner-yellowstone-ending/\">just as Costner's John Dutton was killed off in \"Yellowstone\" during season 5?</a> It's certainly not impossible, though that would undoubtedly unleash a wave of big thoughts and opinions from fans of the show.</p>\n    <p>Undoubtedly, the show's producers are aware of this glaring absence, and it will be addressed; that much is certain. It could be something as simple as a contract negotiation getting in the way of Asbille wanting to sign on for the show. What we know for sure is that <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1845739/taylor-sheridan-upcoming-yellowstone-series-spin-offs/\">there are several other \"Yellowstone\" spin-off shows in development</a>, including a new sequel series, another prequel, and the much-discussed \"The Madison.\" It's hard to imagine that Monica is going to just be left on the sidelines.</p>\n    <p>Spencer Hudnut (\"SEAL Team\") wrote the pilot for \"Y: Marshals,\" in addition to serving as showrunner and executive producer. Greg Yaitanes (\"Presumed Innocent\") is directing the first episode. Sheridan executive produces alongside David C. Glasser, John Linson, Art Linson, Grimes, Ron Burkle, David Hutkin, Bob Yari, Greg Yaitanes, Michael Friedman, and Keith Cox.</p>\n    <p>\"Y: Marshals\" doesn't currently have a release date, but stay tuned.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

We had guest appearances by old \"Trek\" villains like Trelane (Rhys Darby), a holodeck episode, the beginning of <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1940069/strange-new-worlds-season-3-star-trek-most-important-relationship-kirk-spock/\">the Spock (Ethan Peck) and Jim Kirk (Paul Wesley) bromance</a>, and more.</p>\n    <p>We at <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1885439/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-season-3-review/\">/Film mostly loved \"Strange New Worlds\" season 3</a>, but it left many other Trekkies underwhelmed. Showrunners Henry Alonso Myers and Akiva Goldsman have reassured those fans that <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1969123/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-season-4-change-tone-serious/\">season 4 is going to be more serious</a>. Discussing other parts of the season, though, they've been less forthcoming. </p>\n    <p>Speaking to <a href=\"https://trekmovie.com/2025/09/13/exclusive-strange-new-worlds-eps-on-why-s4-will-be-better-and-which-star-trek-character-not-to-expect/\">TrekMovie</a>, Myers and Goldsman played it coy when asked if \"Strange New Worlds\" season 4 will also bring in any classic \"Trek\" characters. Currently, we've seen about half of the original series' Enterprise crew on \"Strange New Worlds.\"</p>\n    <p>Spock and Uhura (Celia Rose Gooding) have been main characters from the beginning. So has Nurse Christine Chapel (Jess Bush), who was a recurring character (played by Majel Barrett) in the original \"Star Trek.\" Captain to-be Kirk debuted during season 1 finale \"A Quality of Mercy\" (in an alternate future, granted) then became a recurring character in season 2. Future Chief Engineer Scotty (Martin Quinn) then debuted in the season 2 finale, \"Hegemony,\" and joined the Enterprise crew/main cast in season 3.</p>\n    <p>That leaves three major absences: Dr. \"Bones\" McCoy (originally DeForest Kelley), Enterprise pilot Hikaru Sulu (originally George Takei), and Ensign Pavel Chekov (originally Walter Koenig). Goldsman told TrekMovie that \"We cannot confirm or deny\" if McCoy or Sulu will appear, so count them as \"maybe.\" They were much blunter about Chekov.</p>\n    <p>\"There's no Chekov,\" Goldsman said, with Myers concurring: \"Yeah, Chekov doesn't make any sense.\"</p>\n    <p>Chekov has always been a bit of a black sheep or B-player compared to the rest of the original \"Star Trek\" cast. That's because he is and isn't a member of the original Enterprise crew.</p>\n    <h2>Don't expect Pavel Chekov on the Enterprise in Star Trek: Strange New Worlds</h2>\n    <p>Chekov did not appear in the first season of \"Star Trek\" — he debuted in the season 2 premiere, \"Amok Time.\" <a href=\"https://www.scifinow.co.uk/interviews/star-treks-walter-koenig-talks-chekov-and-his-favourite-captain/\">According to Koenig</a> many years later in 2012, Chekov was added to the show to appeal to young viewers; that's why he wore a wig resembling Davy Jones from the Monkees.</p>\n    <p>\"Star Trek\" may have been chasing ratings (what show doesn't?) but Chekov's inclusion became a powerful statement; having a heroic Russian main character on \"Star Trek\" spoke to the show's utopian internationalism. Remember, in the 1960s, Russians were the stereotypical \"enemy\" nation in American media. In the future of \"Star Trek,\" the Cold War was such a distant memory that Americans like Kirk and Bones would serve on the same vessel as a Russian like Chekov.</p>\n    <p>To account for him not showing up in \"Star Trek\" season 1, a lot of Trekkies take it as unspoken canon that Chekov was only recently assigned to the Enterprise in season 2. He <i>was</i> an ensign and clearly the youngest of the main cast. This doesn't quite fit, though. Since Chekov wasn't in \"Star Trek\" season 1, he never met the villain Khan Noonien Singh (Ricardo Montalban) in the episode \"Space Seed.\" Yet in \"The Wrath of Khan,\" Chekov and Khan recognize each other. So, was he on the Enterprise, but just unseen? </p>\n    <p>Myers and Goldsman seem to be leaning towards the \"new assignee Chekov\" interpretation. It <i>would</i> be a tad awkward if \"Strange New Worlds\" set him up joining the Enterprise crew, then (retroactively) he vanished for one season, only to return later in the next. So, if Chekov is your favorite of the \"TOS\" characters, you're out of luck this time.</p>\n    <p>\"Star Trek: Strange New Worlds\" is streaming on Paramount+; season 4 is expected to be released in 2026.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p><strong>Noir westerns </strong>combine the best of both worlds, and tell complex stories of violence and betrayal set against the backdrop of the Old West. Unlike the slickly-produced westerns that have come to typify the genre, noir westerns feature lower budgets and an overall gritty tone that dispels the idealized mythology of the American West.</p>\n<p>Hearkening back to the earliest days of film, westerns were cheap and easy to produce, and usually featured edgy stories. That trend continued into Hollywood's Golden Age, even as mainstream westerns grew into legitimate first-run features. There were dozens of so-called B-movies in the western genre during that period, and some of them were downright classics.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/film-noir-movies-defined-genre-list/\">Noir film burgeoned</a> around the same time as westerns, and it had its own set of gray morals. Often showing the seedy underbelly of modern life, noir was the one genre that continuously pushed boundaries in an era of puritanical censorship. Trading in gumshoes for cowboys, the noir western reflects the highlights of both genres perfectly.</p>\n<h2>Johnny Guitar (1954)</h2>\n<p> <i>Johnny Guitar</i> is an interesting addition to the noir western subgenre because <strong>it combines the vibrant imagery of mainstream Hollywood with a classic noir story</strong>. The Nicholas Ray film stars Joan Crawford in one of her best roles as a fiery saloon owner who is beloved by all the seediest characters in town.</p>\n<p>Unlike most '50s films, <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/great-westerns-women-in-leading-roles/\">the western is led by a compelling female character</a> who isn't just a prop for her male co-stars. It's violent and gritty, and <strong>certainly exists in the morally grey zone</strong>, but still has stunning color photography that lends the film a larger-than-life look.</p>\n<h2>High Noon (1952)</h2>\n<p> Besides being one of the great noir westerns, <strong> High Noon is also one of the most important westerns in film history</strong>. The Gary Cooper vehicle sees the screen legend play a small town sheriff who has a few hours to prepare for a deadly showdown. Exploring Kane's mental state, </p>\n<p><i>High Noon</i>is a dissection of common western themes.</p>\n<p><i>High Noon </i>drew the ire of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) and screenwriter Carl Foreman was blacklisted.</p>\n<p>The movie has a low budget and rugged look, and its black and white photography lends gravity to the action. <strong>The ticking clock element is pure genius</strong>, and it allows the audience to become fully invested in Kane and his dilemma. <i>High Noon </i>is an inherently political movie, but it uses the trappings of the western to obfuscate its messaging.</p>\n<h2>Rawhide (1951)</h2>\n<p> Not to be confused with the TV series of the same name, <strong> Rawhide is a dire and violent western that perfectly exemplifies the genre's crossover with noir cinema</strong>. Bandits take over a waystation and hold several townsfolk hostage. A tense battle ensues, and the film has none of the usual grandeur and exaggerated heroics of other westerns.</p>\n<p><i>Rawhide </i>is not a pretty movie, but that's one reason that the Tyrone Power film is so effective. The minimalism of <strong>the locations adds an element of claustrophobia</strong>, and even the Old West vistas look bleak. The so-called hero isn't morally certain, and in that way it is closer to a noir than a classic western.</p>\n<h2>The Gunfighter (1950)</h2>\n<p> Gregory Peck's westerns are usually overlooked, but <strong>movies like  The Gunfighter are worth remembering</strong>. Henry King directs a fascinating character study of a man who is trying to put his violent past behind him. Typically, the heroes of westerns are inspired by their own violence, but Peck's Ringo is dragged down by his dark history.</p>\n<p><i>The Gunfighter </i>is <strong>structured more like a noir film in that it explores the consequences of violence instead of glorifying it</strong>. It also has some interesting twists which are unusual for the western genre. <i>The Gunfighter </i>is <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/saddest-westerns-of-all-time/\">a sad western</a>, and Peck's acting is top-notch as he brings the haunted man to life.</p>\n<h2>I Shot Jesse James (1949)</h2>\n<p> Samuel Fuller was one of the best directors of Hollywood's Golden Age, and his debut feature was a shining example of the noir western. <i>I Shot Jesse James </i>follows legendary Old West villain, Robert Ford, as he tries to live his life after the titular assassination. <strong>The film has an edgy realness</strong> that lends even more weight to the story.</p>\n<p>Robert Ireland's tragic performance as Ford is a highlight, and <strong>the movie has that distinct cynicism found in classic noir films</strong>. Not only does it explore the consequences of violence, but it dissects the idea of justice and doesn't portray the law as any more heroic than the villains themselves.</p>\n<h2>Blood On The Moon (1948)</h2>\n<p> <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/robert-mitchum-best-western-movies-ranked/\">Robert Mitchum's best western films</a> feature a lot of crossover with noir, especially since the actor was quite accomplished in that genre too. <i>Blood on the Moon </i>sees Mitchum play a cowboy-turned-detective who uncovers a conspiracy while mediating a cattle dispute. Strip away the spurs and hats, and<strong> the movie could easily be a modern noir story. </strong></p>\n<p><i>Blood on the Moon </i>dispels the notion of heroes, and doesn't glorify a single aspect of the Old West. The violence is <strong>noticeably more realistic than other contemporary westerns</strong>, particularly the brutal barfight. Mitchum's performance isn't as a swaggering cowboy, but as a complex man who can't distance himself from the corrupting influence of evil.</p>\n<h2>Forty Guns (1957)</h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/db/tv-show/matlock/\">Matlock</a> season 1 was built around the mystery of who hid the Wellbrexa documents, indicating that whoever was behind this illegal scheme was the true villain of the series. Without that inciting incident, Kathy Bates’ Madeline Kingston would never have gone undercover as poor, widowed Madeline Matlock to get a job at Jacobson Moore.</p><p>While the <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/matlock-season-1-episodes-18-19-explained/\"> Matlock season 1 finale</a> definitively answered that it was Julian (Jason Ritter) who physically took the documents, though he was just the puppet under the masterminding of his father, Senior (Beau Bridges). </p><p><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/matlock-season-2-senior-downfall-with-justina-machado-introduction/\">Senior seems like the obvious</a>, but the new trailer for season 2 proves there is a more subtle enemy working against Madeline’s best interests.</p><i>Matlock</i>villain<p>There are still <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/matlock-season-1-finale-unanswered-finale-list/\">many unanswered questions from  Matlock season 1</a>, and Madeline is constantly stressed about whom she can trust. Her husband, Edwin Kingston (Sam Anderson), seems like a sweet and supportive spouse, but as season 1 proved, he is more than capable of telling lies by omission and going behind Madeline’s back when it suits his needs. The </p><p><i>Matlock</i>season 2 trailer drives this home.</p><h2>Matlock Season 2 Trailer Exposes Edwin As Its True Villain</h2><p> The <i>Matlock</i> season 2 trailer shows a frustrating new twist: Edwin is stepping into the role of villain this season, actively working to turn Madeline against Olympia (Skye P. Marshall). Madeline increasingly struggled with her divided loyalty between her mission in her daughter’s name and her new friendship with Olympia.</p><p>Matlock is a stronger series with Matty and Olympia on the same side, as Madeline grows to respect Olympia’s integrity and Olympia trusts Madeline’s sharp instincts. Together, they balanced each other and helped countless clients, making Matty and Olympia's friendship one of <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/matlock-kathy-bates-successful-reasons/\">the reasons  Matlock was so successful</a> right out of the gate.</p><p>However, the season 2 trailer emphasizes new fractures in their relationship, as Olympia has even more at stake following her big promotion. Edwin is fueling the rift - whispering in Madeline’s ear that Olympia is “<i>manipulating</i>” her, while warning her she can’t have it both ways - exposing the truth and keeping the friendship.</p><p>Edwin is playing a dangerous game by stoking the feud - Olympia can be a formidable enemy. She is compiling a list of blackmail against Matty - but as Madeline shrewdly observes in the trailer, “<i>you only need leverage if you’re not on the same side</i>.”</p><h2>How Edwin Can Be The Downfall Of Madeline In Matlock</h2><p> Edwin has already proven that he’s willing to deceive Madeline when it suits his agenda, no matter the fallout. He outright lied about not having contact information for the man who claimed to be Alfie’s father. Then, in the shocking <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/matlock-season-1-finale-review/\"> Matlock season 1 finale</a>, Madeline was blindsided when Edwin secretly invited Alfie's father into their lives.</p><p>This betrayal underscored a key truth: Edwin isn’t a lawyer, but he’s every bit as manipulative and persuasive as Matty or Olympia. He gaslit Madeline when he changed his mind about her and Alfie’s involvement in the scheme, even though he had agreed beforehand.</p><p>Now, with Olympia, Madeline’s personal loyalty will make her hesitate—but Edwin won’t. Just as he bypassed Madeline to contact Alfie’s father, he could easily take explosive evidence against Julian to the press without her.</p><p>Edwin may appear to be a harmless, sweet old man, but he has shown he’ll do whatever it takes to get his way—leaving others to pick up the pieces. He may well end up being the biggest villain in <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/matlock-season-2-updates/\">Matlock season 2</a>.</p><graphic src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/03196615_poster_w780.jpg?q=70&amp;fit=contain&amp;w=480&amp;dpr=1\" alt=\"03196615_poster_w780.jpg\"/><ul><li>\n                                            <strong>Release Date</strong></li><li>September 22, 2024</li><li>\n                                            <strong>Network</strong></li><li>\n                                            \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/cbs/\">CBS</a></li><li>\n                                            <strong>Directors</strong></li><li>Kat Coiro, Brad Silberling, Gina Lamar, Hanelle M.

For instance, while many appreciated Paulie and Reacher's rivalry throughout the series, some viewers were dissatisfied with Reacher's chemistry (or lack thereof) with Duffy.</p><p>Similarly, many viewers loved how the season began with a compelling twist in its early moments but struggled to ignore some underlying plot holes in Reacher's covert mission. <i>Reacher </i>season 3 seemingly had another major issue, which, as <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/reacher-season-4-alan-ritchson-update/\">Alan Ritchson's update confirms</a>, will be rectified in season 4.</p><h2>Alan Ritchson Has Revealed How Action-Packed Reacher Season 4 Will Be</h2><p>Alan Ritchson previously revealed that <i>Reacher</i> season 4 will have the best action scene in the series to date. This was a big claim, given how <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/reacher-season-3-finale-best-gunfight-op-ed/\">Reacher and Paulie's fight in  Reacher season 3</a>'s finale was easily among the best action scenes that have ever graced television. In a recent interview (via Men's Journal), Ritchson offered more insights on the show's upcoming action sequences.</p><p>He revealed that he and the show's cast and crew shot a total of 11 fight sequences in the first four weeks alone. He added that Jack Reacher faces a new challenge in every corner in <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/reacher-season-4-explained/\"> Reacher season 4</a> and said that they have not done anything like the next installment yet. Furthermore, he even assured viewers that it will be the best season yet and even the bloodiest. </p><p>Here is his full statement:</p><blockquote><p>\"We shot 11 fights in the first four weeks, and we’ve never shot anything close to that pace. Everywhere Reacher turns, he’s got another group on his heels. It’s fun, wild, and nonstop, and we haven’t done anything like it yet. If you follow the other seasons, you know that they’ve gotten progressively better, more interesting. Season 3, I think, was especially well received. I thoroughly enjoyed the way we put that together, and the mystery and the reveals. It was true to Reacher, and it was him at his best so far. So, with that in mind, I say this with confidence: We’re somehow upping the stakes quite a bit. This is going to be the best season we’ve had yet. And definitely the bloodiest.\"</p></blockquote><p><i>Reacher</i> season 4 is adapting Lee Child's <i>Gone Tomorrow</i>, which is often touted as one of the <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/jack-reacher-books-ranked-worst-best/\">best  Jack Reacher books</a>. While only time will tell how Prime Video's adaptation of the novel will turn out, Alan Ritchson's statements about its action and higher stakes suggest that it could deliver the most intense and compelling chapter of the series yet.</p><h2>Alan Ritchson's Reacher Season 4 Update Makes The Upcoming Installment Even More Exciting</h2><p><i>Reacher</i> season 3's final showdown was incredible and set sky-high expectations for the show's future installments. However, when compared with its predecessors, <i>Reacher</i> season 3 had significantly fewer action scenes. Almost throughout its runtime, the show was seemingly trying to pave the way for the finale's Reacher vs. Paulie showdown.</p><p>Alan Ritchson's <i>Reacher </i>season 4 update confirms that it will be jam-packed with many fight sequences. His statement suggests that season 4 will not repeat its predecessor's mistake of featuring fewer action scenes. Following the new update, <strong> Reacher </strong>season 4 seems all the more exciting, making it hard not to eagerly anticipate its release.</p><graphic src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/03180045_poster_w780.jpg?q=70&amp;fit=contain&amp;w=480&amp;dpr=1\" alt=\"03180045_poster_w780.jpg\"/><h5>\n    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/db/tv-show/reacher/\">\n\t\t\t\tReacher\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\n\t</h5>\n                                                                                                        \n                                                     \n                                                \n                                                                                 \n                                                                                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <ul><li>\n                                            <strong>Release Date</strong></li><li>February 3, 2022</li></ul><p>Reacher follows Jack Reacher, a former military police investigator, as he navigates civilian life.

    "body": "<p>The main characters in <strong/> were meant to be women of a certain age, but many people don't know the ages of the actors in the TV show. Centering on four single women living in the same house in Miami, </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/the-golden-girls/\">The Golden Girls</a>\n    </p>\n<p><i>The Golden Girls</i>is known for its cast. It follows Blanche (Rue McClanahan), who opens her home to other lonely single ladies.</p>\n<p>In response, widows Rose (Betty White) and Sophia (Estelle Getty), and divorcee Dorothy (Bea Arthur) come to live with her. The sitcom ran successfully for seven seasons from 1985 to 1992, with several spinoffs and series set in the <i>Golden Girls</i> universe. <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/golden-girls-seasons-ranked-worst-best/\">Every season of  The Golden Girls</a> is worth watching.</p>\n<p>A major aspect of <i>The Golden Girls </i>is the older age of the lead cast and their status as widows. While the show has a fairly wide age range, it is interesting to see the diversity of ages. More important than that is how the ages of <i>The Golden Girls' </i>characters can be compared to the ages of their respective actors.</p>\n<h2>How Old Every Main Character Was In The Golden Girls</h2>\n<p>Though their ages are not exactly confirmed on the show, <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/golden-girls-cast-character-guide/\">the main characters in </a><i> The Golden Girls,</i> including Dorothy, Sophia, Rose, and Blanche, are between their 40s and late 80s. Other characters, such as Stan and Blanche's siblings, are presumably also in this age range. Dorothy's son, Michael, and her daughter Kate were likely in their 20s or 30s during the show.</p>\n<p>All three women were older actresses at the time, ranging in age from 53 to 63, and despite most shows having younger stars, the show became an instant hit. The series let the women be individuals, never willing to act their age, while saying and doing things that shocked audiences. Every actress won a Primetime Emmy Award during the show's seven-season run.</p>\n<p>Character Name</p>\n<p>Character Age in Season 1</p>\n<p>Dorothy</p>\n<p>55</p>\n<p>Rose</p>\n<p>55</p>\n<p>Blanche</p>\n<p>53</p>\n<p>Sophia</p>\n<p>79</p>\n<p>Stan</p>\n<p>57</p>\n<p>Clayton Hollingsworth</p>\n<p>45</p>\n<p>Angelo Grisanti</p>\n<p>82</p>\n<p>Angela Grisanti Vecchio</p>\n<p>84</p>\n<p>Michael</p>\n<p>23-29</p>\n<h2>Rue McClanahan's Blanche Devereaux Was The Youngest In The Golden Girls</h2>\n<h3>Rue McClanahan Was 53</h3>\n<p>Blanche Devereaux was approximately 53 years old at the start of <i>The Golden Girls, </i>making her the youngest of the main characters. McClanahan's character, Blanche, was a promiscuous widow who grew up in Atlanta, Georgia. She is portrayed as a Southern Belle with a flirtatious attitude. Blanche owns the house and is 60 at the end of the series.</p>\n<p>Rue McClanahan was actually a few years younger, 51 years old, at the start of the series. McClanahan was also the youngest actor in the main cast. She starred on <i>Maude</i> as Vivian Harmon and then in <i>Mama's Family </i>as Aunt Fran Crowley before joining <i>The Golden Girls</i>. McClanahan died in 2010 at 76.</p>\n<h2>Bea Arthur's Dorothy Zbornak Was In Her 50s When The Golden Girls Started</h2>\n<h3>Bea Arthur Was 63</h3>\n<p>Dorothy Zbornak is portrayed to be around 53-55 at the start of <i>The Golden Girls</i> and 60-62 by the end. Dorothy is the only <i>Golden Girl </i>who isn't a widow in the series. She has a deadbeat ex-husband, Stan, whom she was married to for 38 years before he cheated. Dorothy is sarcastic, and part of why <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/golden-girls-episodes-proved-tv-show-ahead-of-its-time-list/\"> Golden Girls was ahead of its time</a>.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, Dorothy's actor, Bea Arthur, was a decade older, 63. In fact, Arthur was tied with Betty White for the oldest lead actor. Bea Arthur's vastly different age from her character is the biggest surprise among <i>The Golden Girls </i>cast. She was the lead in the <i>All in the Family </i>spinoff, <i>Maude</i>, as Maude Findlay. Bear Arthur died in 1990 at 86.</p>\n<h2>Betty White's Rose Nylund Was Older Than Blanche &amp; Dorothy</h2>\n<h3>Betty White Was 63</h3>\n<p>One of the few <i>Golden Girls </i>with a confirmed age is Rose Nylund. It's confirmed that Rose is 55 years old in season 1, making her 62 by the finale. Rose is known for her sweet attitude and perceived lack of intelligence. She begins a romantic relationship with a college professor, Miles Webber. Rose is also famous for telling stories about her upbringing in Minnesota.</p>\n<p>Similar to Bea Arthur, Betty White was 63 at the start of <i>The Golden Girls, </i>making her almost a full decade older than her character. White was in <i>The Mary Tyler Moore</i> <i>Show</i> as Sue Ann Nivens, moving on to <i>The Golden Girls</i> eight years later. She also starred in <i>Mama's Family</i> alongside Rue McClanahan. White died in 2012, just before her 100th birthday.</p>\n<h2>Estelle Getty's Sophia Petrillo Was The Oldest In The Golden Girls</h2>\n<h3>Estelle Getty Was 62</h3>\n<p>Of the four <i>Golden Girls, </i>Sophia Petrillo is the oldest, written to be 79 at the start of the series and 86 by its end. Sophia is Dorothy's widowed mother in <i>The Golden Girls</i>. She was born in Sicily and escaped an arranged marriage. She is witty, blunt, and depicted as a great cook. Sophia's wisecracking makes her a fan-favorite in <i>The Golden Girls</i>.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/anime/\"> Anime</a> spans a wide range of genres, from epic adventures to deeply introspective narratives. However, some series stand out most for a very different reason: bold, unapologetic entertainment. These series embrace absurdity, melodrama, or breaking social norms, leaning into their own storylines no matter what some viewers may think, and some fans have latched on to them with equal enthusiasm.</p>\n<p>Guilty pleasures in anime thrive on indulgence and charm, rewarding viewers who are willing to embrace their storylines. With over-the-top humor, flashy battles, romantic tension, or simply \"out-there\" narratives and twists, they combine to create unforgettable experiences. While critics may debate their merits, loyal fans know that the series is around to offer pure entertainment.</p>\n<h2>Ghost Stories (Dub)</h2>\n<p><i>Ghost Stories </i>begins as a classic small-town mystery when Satsuki and her friends discover that restless spirits haunt their town. What starts as simple ghost hunting quickly spirals into a mission to seal away each entity that Satsuki’s late mother once sealed away. However, the original <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/ghost-stories-funny-dubh-aged-horribly-still-love-it/\">Japanese version differs significantly from the English-dubbed</a> version.</p>\n<p>When the anime underperformed in Japan, ADV Films, the dubbing company, abandoned the original script to create a chaotic and unhinged comedy rather than following the structure of a straightforward children’s series. Seizing this unlikely opportunity, the dub cast improvised wildly, loading each episode with sharp jokes, pop-culture rip-offs, and unforgettable chaotic dialogue that keeps fans coming back for more.</p>\n<h2>High School DxD</h2>\n<p><i>High School DxD</i> follows Issei Hyodo, a pervy but good-hearted student whose ordinary life ends when a first date turns fatal. He’s revived by the crimson-haired demon Rias Gremory and drafted into her household of supernatural fighters as a demon himself. With battles against angels, devils, and exorcists, Issei trains to master his new powers while balancing his school life.</p>\n<p>The series is known for its high-stakes battles mixed with comedy and over-the-top fan service with harem and ecchi aspects. With its animation quality and fight choreography paired with its surprisingly character-driven development, the series is all the more worthwhile. <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/junior-high-school-dxd-new-manga/\"> High School DxD is proof that anime can offer both</a> intense fan service and an engaging story.</p>\n<h2>Food Wars</h2>\n<p><i>Food Wars</i> centers around Soma Yukihira, a confident teenager who dreams of surpassing his father’s cooking skills in the prestigious Tōtsuki Culinary Academy. There, he faces off against rivals and takes on high-stakes cook-offs where one wrong seasoning can end a career. Every meal becomes a spectacle that blends mouthwatering culinary creations with intense cooking battles.</p>\n<p>Friends and foes alike push Soma to become a better chef, while judges and dramatic cook-offs add to the thrill and excitement. Many of the reactions are heavily exaggerated and paired with risqué visuals that burst across the screen whenever a dish exceeds expectations. However, despite the “foodgasms,” the series explores a genuine love for cuisine and competition.</p>\n<h2>Vampire Knight</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/netflix-anime-streaming-vampire-knight/\">Vampire Knight</a><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/netflix-anime-streaming-vampire-knight/\"> draws viewers into Cross Academy</a>, an elite boarding school divided between Day Class and Night Class students. Except the Night Class is composed entirely of vampires. The story follows Yuki Cross, the adopted daughter of the headmaster, who serves as a guardian responsible for maintaining peace between humans and vampires while keeping the existence of vampires a secret.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Yuki tries to make sense of her forgotten past while she is caught between her childhood friend, Zero, a vampire hunter, and the vampire who saved her life, Kaname. It’s an anime that thrives on drama and romantic tension, packed with deeper secrets and unexpected twists that keep fans hooked on the story.</p>\n<p>The love triangle between Yuki, Kaname, and Zero dips into themes of forbidden romance and is intensified by shocking revelations. <i>Vampire Knight</i> has a richly detailed world with characters who come to life with unique personalities, making it a binge-worthy series that fans can’t get enough of.</p>\n<h2>High School of the Dead</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/best-zombie-anime/\"> High School of the Dead takes place during a sudden zombie apocalypse</a>, following a group of high school students and a school nurse as society collapses around them. To survive, the students must take on hordes, face a world with increasingly scarce resources, and the constant threat of betrayal while navigating what’s left of society.</p>\n<p>Each character has their own unique skill set with dynamics and moral dilemmas that add depth to the series. It’s a horror anime that blends cinematic visuals, intense action, and is loaded with fan service. While the zombie gore is intense, the series leans into exaggerated moments and dramatic tension to keep viewers hooked.</p>\n<h2>Hetalia</h2>\n<p><i>Hetalia</i> takes world history and turns it into a comedic narrative where countries are personified as quirky characters whose interactions mirror political events, cultural stereotypes, and historical conflicts. Through short, episodic sketches, audiences watch the nations clash, cooperate, and misinterpret each other, turning real-world history into comedic entertainment that fans can’t get enough of.</p>\n<p>The series is best known for its satirical style and exaggerated humor. With fast-paced episodes and a unique premise, <i>Hetalia</i> hooks its fans with its creativity and wit. However, many viewers have also criticized <i>Hetalia</i> for problematic representations and its lack of depth when addressing serious historical events like World War II.</p>\n<h2>No Game No Life</h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>\n\t<strong>SPOILER ALERT:</strong> <i>This article contains</i> <i>spoilers from the first season of “ Black Rabbit” now available to stream on Netflix.</i></p>\n<p>\n\tRestaurant hospitality is the last thing to be found inside Netflix’s latest crime thriller, “<a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/reviews/black-rabbit-review-jude-law-jason-bateman-1236515363/\">Black Rabbit</a>.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe series, created by married couple <a href=\"https://variety.com/t/zach-baylin/\">Zach Baylin</a> and <a href=\"https://variety.com/t/kate-susman/\">Kate Susman</a>, drew inspiration from New York’s dynamic nightclub and restaurant culture, which laid the groundwork for the show’s atmosphere. Its stars Law and Bateman also serve as executive producers.\n\n\t</p>\n<h3>Popular on Variety</h3>\n<p>Although set in the present day, the series draws inspiration from New York City’s dark past — specifically the downfall and eventual closure of the influential gastropub, the Spotted Pig. Once the hottest restaurant in the mid-2000s, it shut down in 2020 after owner Ken Friedman settled lawsuits from former employees alleging sexual harassment.</p>\n<p>The high-stakes tale centers on estranged Brooklyn brothers and restaurant co-founders Jake (Law) and Vince Friedken (Bateman) and the chaos that unravels after Vince unexpectedly returns home.</p>\n<p>Jake is the ambitious and charismatic owner of Black Rabbit, a restaurant and VIP lounge that is on the cusp of becoming the city’s hottest spot. Vince returns to their shared business, bringing immeasurable trouble along the way with his gambling debt that places both brothers in a never-ending spiral of madness and havoc.</p>\n<p>\n\tBelow, Law and the creators spoke with <i>Variety </i>about Jake and Vince’s destructive relationship, pulling inspiration from New York City’s toxic nightlife and dining culture, that shocking final death and more.\n\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong> Jude Law:</strong>  Working with Zach and Kate drew me to the project. We’ve had positive experiences as friends and creatives on “The Order.” It’s important that if you meet people that you can trust and work well with,  it’s great to nurture those relationships. Also, this was an irresistible piece. I knew the New York they wanted to recreate and the energy that was going to permeate a story. I loved the potential of this relationship at the heart of it. These brothers were good guys, but they were doing bad things and making a mess. I loved Jake, because he looked incredibly together from one angle. Then, slowly, he’s unpeeled. You realize that it is a facade and he has problems, a past and a relationship with a destructive brother.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Law:</strong> It was important that he wasn’t likable. I find complicated, contradictory and dark characters fascinating to bring to life. It doesn’t mean that you don’t necessarily empathize with them or understand where they’re coming from. I liked that he was multifaceted. You see a side of him where he’s very charming and good at handling people. Then you see an underbelly revealing that is reminiscent of holding a microscope up to one’s life. People have many sides to them.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Law: </strong>He is incredibly well-prepared. He knows himself and what he can do so incredibly well, which is vital. When you’ve got a great map and know what you need to get from a scene, you can play within that loosely. That’s a great place to be. He has a superpower, and you can’t help but like him. He can do awful things as a character, and you can forgive. That was a smart piece of casting and a cool contribution to this character in particular.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Law:</strong> What happens is you express yourself in certain ways, and you’ll get lost in a scene. The longer we played these parts, the more I felt Jake’s love for his brother. The first time when we shot the scene when Vince first came back, I didn’t know how I was going to greet him. When we hugged, it felt right to be like, “Oh man, he’s back and alright.” It taught me very quickly about how they felt about each other. I didn’t necessarily plan for that.\n\n\t</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Law: </strong>The best way to understand Jake away from Vince is really in that very first section, before Vince comes back. As soon as Vince is in his orbit, his consciousness changes. When you see him at the beginning, he is ambitious, reaching for another goal, keeping himself together, moving on, thinking it’s all right to paper over the cracks and get on with life. He puts on a smile and works hard. That’s him at his best. As soon as Vince steps back into his orbit, he’s constantly aware that he has to put out a fire. It puts him on edge. </p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Law:</strong> It stems back to what happened between them as children with their father. He recognizes that it altered his brother’s course irrevocably and left him with guilt and a broken sense of morality and spirit. Before that, not only was he his big brother and he idolized him, but he was also an inventive, creative spirit who continues to put the band together. But he also has the capacity to blow the band up. That’s the idea of the Rabbit. He protects him boundlessly because he recognizes the damage that he’s carrying.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>\n\tDid the <a href=\"https://variety.com/t/nexstar/\">Nexstar</a> and <a href=\"https://variety.com/t/sinclair/\">Sinclair</a> station groups overplay their hands by aggressively taking on Disney this week? The decision to yank “<a href=\"https://variety.com/t/jimmy-kimmel/\">Jimmy Kimmel</a> Live” off their ABC affiliates — repping a combined 25% of the TV audience — may have an impact on several fronts, including the relationship between Disney and those two station groups moving forward, as well as the ongoing debate over loosening or abolishing the nationwide TV station ownership cap.\n\n\t</p>\n<p>Nexstar is looking to acquire fellow station group Tegna in a $6.2 billion deal, and many insiders in broadcasting believe that the company’s decision to pre-empt Kimmel (which led to his show being benched by ABC parent Disney) was done to curry favor with the Federal Communications Commission to approve that purchase. A Nexstar/Tegna combo would put the combined company over the current legal limits of how many local stations that one entity can own, which is why Nexstar and other broadcasters are pushing hard for the FCC to abolish that rule. The “station cap,” as it’s known in broadcast jargon, is set at a total reach of 39% of U.S. TV households. Broadcasters would like to see the FCC abolish the station cap entirely, or at lift it to 50% or more.</p>\n<p>\n\tNexstar denies that its move on Kimmel that spurred ABC’s decision had political motivations for the parent company. “The decision to preempt “<a href=\"https://variety.com/t/jimmy-kimmel-live/\">Jimmy Kimmel Live</a>!” was made unilaterally by the senior executive team at Nexstar, and they had no communication with the FCC or any government agency prior to making that decision,” Nexstar said in statement Thursday. But nonetheless, Nexstar’s announcement came only after FCC chairman Brendan Carr appeared on a podcast and strongly criticized Kimmel and ABC. A seemingly coordinated campaign of outrage against Kimmel began to build in right-wing media circles on Monday night and Tuesday after Kimmel’s Sept. 15 show.\n\n\t</p>\n<h3>Popular on Variety</h3>\n<p>Meanwhile, Sinclair Broadcast Group also has business with the FCC: Like Nexstar, the company would like to expand should the ownership cap be lifted; plus, it’s pushing hard on the new ATSC 3.0 standard which would allow it to monetize spectrum. (Sinclair, which has traditionally championed conservative viewpoints and commentators, took a harder line than Nexstar on Kimmel, demanding an apology from the host and a donation to Charlie Kirk’s Turning Point USA organization.) Sinclair didn’t respond to requests for comment.</p>\n<p>Besides the question of whether Nexstar and Sinclair were catering to the FCC, the announcements by Nexstar and Sinclair also come as the relationship between the broadcast networks and their affiliates have become highly contentious as of late.</p>\n<p>Local TV outlets receive retransmission payments from cable and satellite operators, and the networks take a cut of those retrans dollars. (That money sent to the networks is called “reverse compensation,” because once upon a time, the networks used to pay its affiliates to carry its lineups. Now, it’s the reverse and stations pay the networks.)</p>\n<p>But affiliates have grown concerned that networks are demanding too much of that retrans money. Right now, most stations pay fixed fees to networks for the right to carry their fare (including sports), but as the payments local stations receive from pay TV distributors declines, they’re looking for a more variable payment model with the networks.</p>\n<p>At the FCC, Carr has been quick to highlight the growing tension between national network operations attached to media giants and the interests of local station owners.</p>\n<p>Did the Nexstar/Sinclair gambit work? Perhaps, at least in winning over Carr, who thanked Nexstar on social media “for doing the right thing,” seemingly putting the company in the FCC’s good graces. It was already likely this administration would lift or raise the ownership cap; now that Nexstar and Sinclair have found favor with Carr and Trump, it’s probably a done deal.</p>\n<p>But this week’s events also now put Nexstar and Sinclair right in the middle of a national conversation about free speech and the First Amendment — and many more people who hadn’t heard of those companies before now see them as opponents in the free speech debate. That could lead to more push back from the public, guilds, unions and other entities that might aggressively fight against the idea of abolishing the station cap. “I think they’re going to hear from a lot of groups that would normally not speak up,” says one observer. (Ironically, Nexstar owns a news network, News Nation, that would seemingly be hurt by further free speech restrictions.)</p>\n<p>The vast majority of TV stations are owned by a handful of broadcast TV giants such as Nexstar, Sinclair, Hearst, Scripps, Gray Television and Tegna, the group that Nexstar is hoping to acquire — and fears about local TV’s monopolies, exacerbated by this week’s Kimmel suspension, might make it tougher for even the FCC to rubberstamp an end to ownership caps.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, what’s to come of “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” should it return, on those Nexstar and Sinclair ABC affiliates? Nexstar and Sinclair may be loath to bring the show back, but execs familiar with the network/affiliate relationship say there are a number of possibilities for ABC in keeping “Jimmy Kimmel Live” around even without some affils. For one thing, the network could just put Kimmel back on the schedule without those station groups’ blessings, march forward “and see what those guys do,” one observer suggested.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

The prize, granted by the Culture Ministry’s Institute of Cinematography and Audiovisual Arts (ICAA), carries a cash award of €30,000 ($35,100).</p>\n    <p>The award ceremony was attended by various cultural figures and institutional representatives, including El Deseo producer Esther García who had received the Donostia Career Achievement award at the festival’s opening ceremony the night before.</p>\n    <p>After briefly reflecting on his early days in cinema, a visibly moved Fernández ended his speech by whipping out a keffiyeh shawl to wrap around his shoulders, saying: “The atrocity that is happening in Palestine, the savagery of arguing over a word– genocide or not – is irrelevant, even though it’s legally important. Allowing children to starve to death is barbaric, regardless of the term you use,” he stated, reading out the names of children under the age of two who had died as a result of the war.</p>\n    <h3>Popular on Variety</h3>\n    <p>He repeated a cry that began at the San Sebastian’s opening night where protesters bearing Palestinian flags disrupted the red carpet proceedings outside the festival venue, the Kursaal, and where Pedro Almodóvar, after handing the award to García at the ceremony, also called for an end to the war. “Stop it now!” García exclaimed in her acceptance speech.</p>\n    <p>“They want to kill them all in the most cruel and brutal way,” Fernández continued, adding that “those who are not moved by the atrocities we see every day on television have a deep problem with their humanity.”</p>\n    <p>\n\t“<a href=\"https://variety.com/t/gaza/\">Gaza</a> is a mirror in which we all appear, whether we like it or not,” he declared.</p>\n    <p>The jury of the 2025 National Cinematography Award unanimously selected Fernández “for being one of the most outstanding actors in our cinema and for having had an exceptional 2024 with two remarkable performances in two completely different films: the noble man who fights for the common good in ‘The 47’ (‘El 47’), and the role for which he won the Goya for best actor for, ‘Marco,’ where he transforms into the complex and contradictory figure of Enric Marco.”</p>\n    <p>He had also made his directorial debut with his short film “El otro,” they noted.</p>\n    <p>\n\tThe coveted award recognizes the most outstanding contributions to Spanish cinema. The award, which is usually presented by the Minister of Culture during the festival, recognized “Alcarràs” producer María Zamora in its previous edition, joining a list of luminaries in Spanish cinema, including Penélope Cruz, José Sacristán, Isabel Coixet, <a href=\"https://variety.com/t/antonio-banderas/\">Antonio Banderas</a>, <a href=\"https://variety.com/t/fernando-trueba/\">Fernando Trueba</a>, Carla Simón and many others.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>\n\tWhen <a href=\"https://variety.com/t/josh-duhamel/\">Josh Duhamel</a> initially pops up on screen in Allan Ungar’s new action comedy “London Calling,” he’s barely recognizable. The perennially good-looking leading man went bald for his first few scenes.</p>\n<p>“That was me trying to be Jason Statham for a second,” Duhamel tells me. “I was like, ‘OK, Allan, I got an idea. I really want to be bald because I want there to be a visual difference between the first part of this movie and when we see him a year later. I want to be bald, I want to be a badass, I want to look like a badass hit man, like Jason Statham.’ But then we realize quickly that he’s not quite that guy. In a movie that doesn’t have a ton of money, those bald caps are not cheap. That’s a full process. I think it was worth it. It tells that little story.”</p>\n<p>Duhamel plays an ex-pat assassin-for-hire who flees his London home base for Los Angeles after a crime boss (Aidan Gillan) puts a hit on him after he accidentally kills one of his family members. When he decides to return to London, his shady L.A. boss (Rick Hoffman) agrees to help keep him safe if he agrees to bring his son (Jeremy Ray Taylor) along to toughen him up.</p>\n<h3>Popular on Variety</h3>\n<p>Did I mention that Duhamel’s anti-hero’s vision is a bit off because he needs a new eyeglass prescription?</p>\n<p>\n\tI spoke to Duhamel just days before he was set to start shooting the second season of his hit Netflix series “<a href=\"https://variety.com/t/ransom-canyon/\">Ransom Canyon</a>.” </p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>How much fun is it to play an action hero who can’t see where he’s shooting?</strong></p>\n<p>That action hero who lost his fastball? That, to me, is what makes movies like this fun. I love the idea of characters that don’t have it all together, that aren’t perfect, that have to face these insecurities that they have turned away from for years. He has to face the fact that he’s not what he once was. That just gives you a whole other room to play in.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Your character is also facing getting older.</strong></p>\n<p>It’s like that moment for every athlete who has ever played a professional sport. There comes that moment where you’re like, “You know what? I’m now too old for this.” It’s a tough pill to swallow. I think for him, he hasn’t done much else for the last 20 years, 25 years. What does a guy do with himself when he’s really good at contract killing? This really forces him into hiding in Los Angeles. But the irony of this movie is that we start in London and then he has to flee London and ends up in Los Angeles. I left Los Angeles to fly to Cape Town to shoot a movie that’s in Los Angeles. There’s something wrong with that. We got to figure this out. Let’s put these crews back to work here in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>How does the industry get filming back in L.A.?</strong></p>\n<p>I think there needs to be more incentives. I think that we need to make it more conducive. Right now, there are so many obstacles to getting it done. I just directed a movie in London called “Preschool.” It’s about two dads who are fighting to get their kid into this last spot in this super high-end, pretentious preschool. It was originally scripted to take place in Malibu, but we couldn’t shoot it there. It was just too expensive. We rejiggered it for London and made it more like a Hogwarts-y style 500-year-old preschool that’s highly revered. It’s become so cost-prohibitive on so many different fronts, and I’m all for the unions, but it just balloons your budget. We have to figure out a way to bring it back because I have a lot of friends who are having a hard time finding work.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>You can feel it in the air in Los Angeles. Everyone seems to be on edge for any number of reasons, especially because of the uncertainty in the industry.</strong></p>\n<p>Then you add AI to the mix — that’s going to make it even more difficult because now that’s going to really reduce the need for so many of those key crew members. I’m hoping that we can somehow find a way to make it work. There’s not really anything that’s going to stop AI. You can put guardrails on it, but man, if you can make a $100 million movie for $10 million, they’re going to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>It doesn’t make sense that movies aren’t being made in the movie capital of the world.</strong></p>\n<p>I think there needs to be a real push to get it back. We could do it. We could definitely do it. Whether it’s incentivizing it more or working with the unions to make it more conducive. I don’t know what the answer is, but it sure would be nice to work here so I don’t have to travel so much.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Even with the obstacles, how much do you love directing?</strong></p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

But if we had to pick another, it’s comedy, which is widely ignored at the Oscars despite being one of the most challenging genres to master. They have such a hard time being recognized by the industry that they have their own category at the Golden Globes — you know, so laugh-out-loud knee-slappers like <i>The Martian</i> can thrive.</p>\n    <p>The topic of comedy movies at the Oscars was brought up on a recent episode of Amy Poehler’s <i>Good Hang</i> podcast, where she had Olivia Coleman on as a guest. Calling in was Benedict Cumberbatch, who declared, “If you can do comedy, you can do anything. I really do believe that.” As Poehler responded (via <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/amy-poehler-oscars-comedy-movies-1236521054/\">Variety</a>), “Of course. You don’t have to tell me, babe! Every single year at the Oscars, everybody [in comedy] gets blanked and all the serious people get up and accept and accept…It’s some hot bullsh*t! Because comedy is not easy. And I got to tell you, both you and Olivia can do both.”</p>\n    <p>Yes, comedy movies have been given some attention at the Oscars but it’s extremely rare, especially in the Best Picture category. Think about it: how many comedies have won Best Picture? If you don’t think <i>Anora</i> deserves to be called a comedy (I sure don’t), <i> Everything Everywhere All at Once</i> is no doubt the most recent (but even that’s a hybrid), but what about before that? </p>\n    <p><i>Birdman</i>, if you want to count that, but then you’d have to go back to</p>\n    <p><i>Shakespeare in Love</i>back in 1999 — which only reminds us that it didn’t deserve to win at all! Sure, there are more nominees and other categories to explore, but when it comes down to it, AMPAS has been historically straight-faced.</p>\n    <p>Whatever the reason — bias against the genre, inability to recognize how hard comedy is, falling for “prestige” and bait — there have been so many comedy movies that deserved Oscar consideration.</p>\n    <p>With that, we want to hear from <i>you</i>! Which comedy movies legitimately deserved Best Picture nominations? Why do you think AMPAS shies away from proper recognition? Chime in and let us know below.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/film/news/amy-poehler-oscars-comedy-movies-1236521054/\">Variety</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

To help celebrate this welcome upswing in anime’s visibility, we’re sussing out the Top 10 Anime Films of All Time!</p>\n<p>A bold task, I know. I’m ready for your torches and pitchforks. However, before you burn me at the stake, consider the assignment. It’s damn-near impossible to play to all tastes, so I’m laying down the gauntlet with my gut, heart, and soul. Animation is one of humankind’s greatest gifts to art and entertainment, and the following films are the cream of the crop. Each title offers something special, infinitely imaginative, and game-changing about animation and expression through pictures and sound. Enjoy the list. Tell me why I’m wrong in the comments. Let’s do this!</p>\n<p><strong> 1</strong>. </p>\n<p>\n      <strong/>\n    </p>\n<p>If we were to carve a Mount Rushmore of Anime, Katsuhiro Ôtomo’s dystopian cyberpunk opus <i>Akira</i> would be the George Washington. In this universally celebrated epic, a secret military project endangers Neo-Tokyo when it turns a teenage biker gang member, Tetsuo Shima (Nozomu Sasaki), into a rampaging psychic psychopath whose best friend, Shôtarô Kaneda (Mitsuo Iwata), is the only one who can stop him.</p>\n<p>Mention <i>Akira</i> to any anime fan, and they will immediately begin shouting at you, “Tetsuo! Kaneda! Help me!” And rightfully so. It’s impossible not to feel the power of this essential anime overflowing with pangs of <i>Blade Runner</i>, <i>Alita: Battle Angel</i>, and <i>12 Monkeys</i>. In addition to featuring some of the most mind-blowing animation of the time, the soundtrack from Shōji Yamashiro, filled with ethereal chants, frenzied taiko drums, and atmospheric glitch pop, positively rips. If Tetsuo and Kaneda’s friendship is a legend, and it is, history will write their story in gold ink upon gilded pages in a tome kept safe in a diamond display.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>2. Spirited Away (2001)</i>\n    </p>\n<p>The debate about which <a href=\"https://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/\">Studio Ghibli</a> film is the best is never-ending. However, if you plant your flag next to <i>Spirited Away</i>, the argument is over, and we can be friends. Hayao Miyazaki’s 2001 epic is a glittering gem in the Infinity Gauntlet of the anime genre. In case you’re wondering, it’s the Soul Stone. During her family’s move to the suburbs, a sullen 10-year-old girl, Chihiro (Daveigh Chase), wanders into a world ruled by gods, witches, and spirits, hoping to rescue her parents who have transformed into ravenous beasts.</p>\n<p>After its initial and anniversary releases, Studio Ghibli’s <i>Spirited Away</i> is one of the genre’s most successful films, with a global box office of $360M+. Numbers aside, <i>Spirited Away</i> is as whimsical as <i>Labyrinth</i>, as sinister as <i>The Dark Crystal</i>, and as intrepid as <i>The Green Knight</i>. Running rampant with drop-dead gorgeous visuals, a world-building narrative with endless possibilities, and a love everlasting between Chihiro (Rumi Hiiragi) and the mysterious Haku (Miyu Irino), it’s impossible not to feel the magic of one of the Godfather of Anime’s most enigmatic films.</p>\n<p><strong> 3</strong>. </p>\n<p>\n      <strong/>\n    </p>\n<p>I’m just going to say it. Masamune Shirow’s <i>Ghost in the Shell</i> walked so the Wachowskis’ <i>The Matrix</i> could run. Considered by many to be the pinnacle of science-fiction action anime, <i>Ghost in the Shell</i> is hard-coded into any 90s-era anime fan. The original film that started a cyberpunk franchise introduces Atsuko Tanaka (Kusanagi Motoko), a cyborg police woman, and her partner, Batô (Akio Ôtsuka), who hunt a mysterious and powerful hacker called the Puppet Master.</p>\n<p>Easily one of the most recognizable anime ever, Shirow’s <i>Ghost in the Shell</i> is sleek, sexy, visually daring, action-packed, and relentlessly cerebral. Discussions about <i>Ghost in the Shell</i> could last until sun-up, with themes of identity, the dangers of technology, and organizations pulling strings from the shadows. The list of anime series and features inspired by Shirow’s classic film is infinite, with sci-fi as a genre altered by its influence. Whether <i>Ghost in the Shell</i> was your first anime, sexual awakening, or another feather in your cinephile cap, life is better because you’ve experienced this masterpiece.</p>\n<p><strong> 4</strong>. </p>\n<p>\n      <strong/>\n    </p>\n<p>Whenever someone mentions <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0464804/\">Satoshi Kon</a>‘s deranged psychodrama <i>Perfect Blue</i>, the typical (and correct) response is, “Yo, that movie is f@&amp;ked up!” <i>Perfect Blue</i>, a film about a pop singer turned actress, Mima Kirigoe (Junko Iwao), navigating stardom and an obsessed fan while descending into madness, is on par with films like <i>The Substance</i>, <i>Promising Young Woman</i>, and Aronofsky’s <i>Requiem for a Dream</i>. Flawless in its presentation, <i>Perfect Blue</i> taps into something dark and sinister as Kon <i>300</i> kicks audiences down a jagged rabbit hole of stardom, violence, and nightmarish truths.</p>\n<p>Despite its overwhelmingly positive critical reception, <i>Perfect Blue</i> never fared well at the box office, but the film’s cult following is legion. Any anime fan worth their salt knows the traumatic power of <i>Perfect Blue</i>, and how Kon’s cautionary tale serves as a warning for the naive as they swim in shark-infested waters with open wounds.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>5. Princess Mononoke (1997)</i>\n    </p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

And that’s the case with the latest endeavor, <i>Batman #1</i>, which is being marked as the best-selling comic of the year, with 500,000 copies sold.</p>\n    <p>Released on just September 3rd, <i>Batman #1</i> has, according to reports, took over that top spot from, well, another <i>Batman</i> comic: <i>Batman #158</i>, which hit in the neighborhood of 400,000 copies. The run of <i>Batman #1</i> has been so successful that it’s headed back to its second print, which is set to hit shelves on <strong>October 15th</strong>, complete with a new variant cover.</p>\n    <p><i>Batman #1</i> comes courtesy of Matt Fraction, who broke through in the early 2000s and has <a href=\"https://www.joblo.com/tag/matt-fraction/\">proven a reliable and respect figure in the comic book world</a> via his work with Image and especially Marvel, doing work on X-Men, Iron Man and Spider-Man. Speaking with <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/batman-no-1-comic-sales-1236374496/\">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Fraction – who grew up reading <i>Batman</i> comics – said, “I was lucky enough to attend the Rose City Comic Convention in my beloved Portland the weekend of <i>Batman No. 1</i>’s incredible launch, and have never felt such a thunderous, immediate embrace from readers before. It was an astonishing end to an incredible week, and it’s only the beginning.” Jorge Jimenez did the artwork for <i>Batman #1</i>.</p>\n    <p>Here is a brief rundown, as per DC: “A new day dawns for the Dark Knight Detective as Eisner Award-winning writer Matt Fraction (Hawkeye, Superman’s Pal Jimmy Olsen) joins forces with superstar artist Jorge Jiménez (Batman, Summer of Superman Special) for an unforgettable new era of Batman! The best superhero in comics gets a brand-new first issue to kick off this new era that will test Batman and Bruce Wayne like never before.”</p>\n    <p>Regardless of the success of <i>Batman #1</i>, Matt Fraction isn’t going far from Marvel. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.joblo.com/fantastic-four-first-steps-comic/\">he wrote the tie-in for  The Fantastic Four: The First Steps</a>, which arrived in July a few weeks ahead of the MCU installment.</p>\n    <p>Have you picked up <i>Batman #1</i>?

    "body": "<p>Not every movie can be a box office success. With so many films released year-round, there will inevitably be winners and losers. However, the truly great films go on to become something even bigger than a box office draw: bona fide cult classics. People discover films somewhere outside of the theater, and eventually, they end up becoming such a classic that no one even remembers that it didn’t do well when it was originally released.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, the initial box office numbers are beginning to matter less and less (or more and more if you’re a film studio), and films will either stand on their own or become a footnote in streaming history. For movie fans though, they know what they like when they see it. Even if the movie stumbled, the fans will find it. What classics finally found their audience after a less-than-stellar theatrical run?</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.joblo.com/tag/blade-runner/\">Blade Runner</a> (1982)</h2>\n<p>Ridley Scott took the story <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep</i> from Phillip K. Dick and created a futuristic noir masterpiece. Fans at the time didn’t seem to think so. The initial reviews seemed to think the film was slow and confusing. A detective hunting robots that look like people must not have been a hook many were looking for. It didn’t help that it came out the same year that <i>E.T.</i> destroyed everything else in theaters.</p>\n<p>After a while, fans and critics began re-evaluating the film and realized that the themes and characters were much deeper than they initially thought. The question of life and everyone’s place in it grabbed film fans, and Ridley Scott even made a new director’s cut of the film that opened even more questions. Eventually, this became one of the most influential sci-fi films ever made without the words “Star” or “Wars” in the title. It could be one of the most copied of the cult classics.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.joblo.com/tag/citizen-kane/\">Citizen Kane</a> (1941)</h2>\n<p>If you take any film class or read most reference books on the subject, you will run across this film. It has become a code word for a masterpiece for any kind of artwork. “That’s the <i>Citizen Kane</i> of rock music.” “The <i>Citizen Kane</i> of its time.” “It’s no <i>Citizen Kane</i>.” Well, most people don’t realize that back in 1941, people hated this movie. And I don’t mean were ambivalent about it. Hated it. It was so bad that during the 1941 Academy Awards, the film was booed every time one of its nominations was announced.</p>\n<p>The studio RKO sealed the film away in its vaults and figured it was done with it. In the mid-1950s, they gave it another shot and re-released it. Back then, the only way to catch a film more than once was to send it out to theaters again. It caught on very quickly, and audiences seemed to finally get it. The movie itself was a technical marvel, with Orson Welles creating brand new filmmaking techniques and lenses during production that were put into regular use going forward. It has since become the highest standard for all films.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.joblo.com/tag/office-space/\">Office Space</a> (1999)</h2>\n<p>In the mid-nineties, Mike Judge was flying high. <i>Beavis and Butthead</i> had become a pop culture phenomenon, their movie had been successful, and his new show, <i>King Of The Hill</i>, had garnered a good following. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsl7XpmBI7Q\">He decided to try his hand at directing a live-action film about his time in corporate America, and  Office Space was born.</a> Even though he had one of the biggest TV stars in the world at the time, Jennifer Aniston, it failed to find an audience.</p>\n<p>All of that changed when it hit video store shelves. It quickly outsold tentpole movies from Fox and was so unexpected that studio executives didn’t even know until a reporter told them during an interview. People had finally discovered it at their local video store and could easily identify with hating your job. It caught on quickly, and Mike Judge now says it’s what he gets asked about the most when talking to his fans. This is a prime example of cult classics.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.joblo.com/tag/the-wizard-of-oz/\">The Wizard Of Oz</a> (1939)</h2>\n<p>This one is a mild cheat, but bear with me. With <i>Wicked</i> doing so well at the box office and the sequel waiting to hit screens, it’s hard to imagine that <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> wasn’t always a huge hit. The film did excellent business around the world but was only considered an okay movie in its home country of the United States. Even with the marvel of the change between black and white footage of Kansas and the Technicolor wonder that was Oz, audiences weren’t all that impressed.</p>\n<p>In 1956, the film started showing on TV and quickly became a yearly tradition. This led to the film finally gaining a large following in the United States and becoming a certified classic. A recent study even declared that the film had become the most-watched movie in history. Every generation seems to find this film, and it now has numerous official and unofficial sequels and prequels. One of the earliest cult classics.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.joblo.com/tag/highlander/\">Highlander</a> (1986)</h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

While it’s to be expected, there isn’t any insight into the reshoots that took over the movie. We may have to wait several years for more to come out about that. It’s pretty much what you would expect with multiple featurettes and some deleted/extended scenes.</p>\n    <p>On the technical side, the 4K is near reference level, fully taking advantage of both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. This shouldn’t be a shocker for anyone that’s seen those John Wick 4K’s, as they’re also absolutely beautiful.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.joblo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ballerina4k-1.png\"/>\n    <p>Special Features:</p>\n    <p><strong>The Making of Ballerina</strong> (10:54) – A pretty by-the-numbers behind the scenes featurette that doesn’t really have the length to properly go over the film in any deeper capacity. It’s pretty basic and doesn’t give much of a look in its relatively short runtime and feels more like an advertisement for the film versus something that will reward those that are already fans of the film.</p>\n    <p><strong>Building a Frozen Underworld</strong> (6:10) – Getting into the ice house set piece, how they built it, and help differentiate it from similar scenes from the series.</p>\n    <p><strong>The Art of Action</strong> (11:10) – Gets into more of the action of the film, and what their approach was to some of the major set pieces. This is easily the most interesting of the docs, as it goes more into the process of “why” they shot scenes a specific way. From Norman Reedus talking up the professionalism of the stunt crew to how some of the stunt performers have actual roles in the film. It was also cool to see how much Len Wiseman was involved with some of the props.</p>\n    <p><strong>Deleted/Extended Scenes</strong> (29:49) – There’s honestly a lot more here than I was expecting. Usually these scenes are quite brief with small moments being cut out. But there’s actually a lot in terms of character moments with Eve, as well as the people hunting her down. I get why they cut these as they were clearly going for a film that had relentless pacing, but it’s a shame as there are some good moments in here that may have resulted in a better, more well-rounded film.</p>\n    <p>If you’re a fan of the John Wick series, then <i>Ballerina</i> is a fun enough time, although definitely doesn’t quite live up to those films. As far as the Physical Edition, there are some entertaining enough special features, although it really only goes surface level. This is really just for <strong>Fans Only.</strong></p>\n    <p>For those that don’t know, here’s the plot to <i>Ballerina</i>: “Taking place during the events of <i>John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum</i>, <i>Ballerina </i>follows Eve Macarro (Ana de Armas), who is beginning her training in the assassin traditions of the Ruska Roma. As Eve’s story unfolds, she uses her marksmanship, cunning, and hand-to-hand combat skills to rip through a sect of the assassin order that destroyed an aspect of her life.“</p>\n    <p>Ana de Armas leads <i>Ballerina</i>, with Anjelica Huston, Gabriel Byrne, Lance Reddick, Catalina Sandino Moreno, Norman Reedus, Anne Parillaud, David Castañeda, Abraham Popoola, Ian McShane, and Keanu Reeves rounding out the cast.</p>\n    <p><i>BALLERINA</i> IS NOW AVAILABLE ON 4K ULTRA HD, BLU-RAY, DVD AND DIGITAL.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

The company also announced key updates to its Ninja TX, introduced the Shinobi 7 RX, and expanded Ninja Phone compatibility.</p>\n    <p>For years, Atomos has been best known for its on-camera monitor-recorders, but the Studio Pro 2710 marks a bold step into post-production. Described as a “technology preview,” the monitor is aimed at colorists, editors, and finishing artists who require reference accuracy yet have been constrained by the size and price of traditional grading displays.</p>\n    <p>Traditional reference monitors often cost between $30,000 and $40,000 and take up significant desk space. Atomos positions the Studio Pro 2710 below $10,000 while introducing features typically found only in high-end post houses.</p>\n    <p>At its core is a vertically aligned OLED subpixel structure that eliminates common QD-OLED issues such as color fringing and fine-detail distortion. The result is sharper rendering of edges, text, and fine detail, while maintaining precision across the full frame.</p>\n    <p>Color management is handled through true 33³ 3D LUTs with tetrahedral interpolation, ensuring accurate tonal transitions and gradients. A patent-pending LUT preview interface lets users spin and visualize LUTs in real time, turning color transforms into an interactive part of the grading process.</p>\n    <p>Atomos extends accuracy beyond the panel itself with a patent-pending sensor-calibrated surround lighting system. Integrated into the back of the monitor, the system calibrates not only the screen but also the grading environment, ensuring that ambient light matches the reference standard. A color-calibrated work light is also built in, useful for scripts or grading consoles.</p>\n    <p>Calibration is supported by the new Atomos Studio K-100 spectral probe, which can be used across multiple monitors and locations, allowing distributed teams and clients to see identical images. Factory presets are included for immediate use, but users can fine-tune with on-site recalibration.</p>\n    <p>The Studio Pro 2710 supports HDR and SDR workflows with 4K UHD resolution. Connectivity includes 12G-SDI, HDMI, and network inputs, enabling use in both traditional facilities and modern cloud-based pipelines. Out-of-the-box compatibility includes Atomosphere, Frame.io, and Grass Valley AMP.</p>\n    <p>Additional workflow refinements include front-facing I/O, four USB-C ports for peripherals and calibration probes, and a touchpad-driven interface inspired by mobile devices. Inside, a next-generation FPGA processor ensures uncompromising pixel-level precision.</p>\n    <p>The Ninja TX continues to evolve as Atomos’ flagship monitor-recorder. Supporting up to 8K ProRes RAW capture over SDI and HDMI, it now benefits from full ProRes RAW support in DaVinci Resolve without transcoding. A forthcoming update will also add camera control, demonstrated in beta form at IBC.</p>\n    <p>Atomos also expanded its monitoring line with the Shinobi 7 RX. Building on the compact Shinobi 2, this 7-inch, 2200-nit HDR display adds touchscreen camera control, SDI/HDMI inputs, and integrated Wi-Fi. It can serve as an on-camera monitor or as part of a wireless video workflow.</p>\n    <p>First launched as a way to connect higher-end iPhones for ProRes capture, the Ninja Phone now supports all iOS 18-compatible iPhones and iPads, including older Lightning-based models. This opens the device to a broader user base, integrating mobile workflows with mirrorless and cinema cameras.</p>\n    <p>By combining its established on-set expertise with a serious push into reference-grade post-production, Atomos is positioning the Studio Pro 2710 as a disruptive entry into a category long dominated by expensive, legacy players. Its integrated calibration features, workflow integration, and sub-$10,000 pricing make it accessible to a much wider professional base.</p>\n    <p>Will Atomos succeed in redefining the reference monitor landscape with the Studio Pro 2710?</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Stay current with regular CineD updates about news, reviews, how-to’s and more.</p>\n    <p>You can unsubscribe at any time via an unsubscribe link included in every newsletter.

    "body": "<p>Podcast: IBC highlights: Show coverage &amp; CineD awards &amp; DJI Mini 5 Pro – Focus Check Episode 82 - TUNE IN now!</p>\n<p>NEW PODCAST EPISODE:IBC Highlights | DJI Mini 5 Pro</p>\n<p>Education for Filmmakers</p>\n<p>Language</p>\n<p>The CineD Channels</p>\n<p>Info</p>\n<p>New to CineD?</p>\n<p>You are logged in as</p>\n<p>We will send you notifications in your browser, every time a new article is published in this category.</p>\n<p>You can change which notifications you are subscribed to in your notification settings.</p>\n<p>At IBC 2025, we touched base with Roman Rabitsch, CEO at Angelbird, to talk about the future of CFexpress and what CFexpress 4.0 really means for filmmakers. While highlighting their latest cards, readers, SSD drives, and cables at the booth, the real discussion was about timing, industry needs, and how workflows can benefit long before cameras catch up.</p>\n<p>As an editor, I get especially excited when new technology tackles bottlenecks in post. Faster cards, readers, and cables might not sound glamorous to many people, but they mean less waiting and a smoother workflow. Every hour saved in offloading or prepping media is an hour I can spend actually editing, and that makes a big difference.</p>\n<p>For those of you who may have missed it, we recently reviewed the Performance Card Reader and covered the Solid Flex USB 4.0 cables. Earlier this year, we also wrote about the Angelbird AV PRO SE CFexpress B v4 cards.</p>\n<p>At IBC, though, the focus was not just on the hardware. It was about what CFexpress 4.0 means for workflows and how the industry is preparing for the next step forward.</p>\n<p>CFexpress 4.0 doubles throughput compared to the previous generation, with max reads up to 3700 MB/s and sustained reads around 3500 MB/s.</p>\n<p>Sometimes it is referred to as Version 4 or Gen 4, but the official CFA name is CFexpress 4.0. On paper, it is a big step forward. Roman explained that the focus is on read speed. CFexpress 4.0 is something that cameras do not need yet, and it may be another few years before they actually do.</p>\n<p>So, where does it help right now? In offloading and post. Large shoots and live productions often generate terabytes of data. Being able to back that up and get it into the edit bay faster can make or break a deadline.</p>\n<p>Angelbird’s Angelbird AV PRO SE CFexpress B v4 cards are built for exactly this. They range from 512GB to 4TB, with sustained reads near 3500 MB/s across the line. The 512GB card starts at $179.99 at B&amp;H, and goes up to $1,199.99 for the 4 TB option.</p>\n<p>It will take time for cameras to catch up, since write speeds are not the limiting factor yet. For now, the immediate advantage is shaving hours off the transfer process. As Roman put it, if your reader, computer, and cables all support CFexpress 4.0, “you really get the high speed out of it.”</p>\n<p>Angelbird is aiming to cover the entire chain with their ecosystem. The Performance Card Reader supports CFexpress 4.0 and includes an internal fan to prevent transfers from throttling. In our earlier review, it was even fast enough to serve as an SSD replacement for editing. It sells for about $249.99 at B&amp;H.</p>\n<p>The same thinking extends to cables. Angelbird’s Solid Flex USB 4.0 models support 40 Gb/s transfers and use reinforced connectors to avoid accidental disconnects. They may look like standard cables, but Roman reminded us that a weak link here can kill performance.</p>\n<p>Roman also touched on the pricing of CFexpress 4.0 cards. While memory chip costs rise and fall, he pointed out that they are already competitive per gigabyte compared to many V90 SD cards. For professionals who move large volumes of data, that price-to-performance ratio matters as much as speed.</p>\n<p>He also stressed that buying into CFexpress 4.0 now is not just about today’s workflows. It is about positioning yourself for the future. When cameras eventually demand higher throughput, the cards, readers, and cables will already be ready. That means less scrambling to upgrade gear under pressure and more confidence that your media pipeline will keep pace with production demands.</p>\n<p>Just six years ago, a client sent me 4TB of 8K RED footage on a bargain USB 2.0 drive and wanted a two-day turnaround. It was entirely doable; however, it took nearly 20 hours just to offload the footage to my system!</p>\n<p>With speeds like Angelbird is showing, jobs like that become possible, letting me start editing right away instead of waiting a day just to copy files. Angelbird is part of a push to ease bottlenecks and keep workflows moving forward, and I welcome it.</p>\n<p>We will keep following how Angelbird shapes fast media solutions. Be sure to visit Angelbird’s official site for more on their products and ecosystem.</p>\n<p>What about you? Would you use CFexpress 4.0 cards mostly for editing, backup, or both? Let us know in the comments below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Stay current with regular CineD updates about news, reviews, how-to’s and more.</p>\n<p>You can unsubscribe at any time via an unsubscribe link included in every newsletter.

He explains why he mixed formats, how vintage glass informed the look, why he did not miss internal RAW, and what he actually saw regarding rolling shutter.</p>\n    <p>As context, FUJIFILM’s GFX ETERNA 55 centers on a large-format 44×33 mm sensor, with the “55” in the name pointing to the sensor’s 55 mm image diagonal. Our release coverage video and article detail the concept and positioning behind this camera and how FUJIFILM’s film heritage feeds into the digital color pipeline.</p>\n    <p>Oren Soffer had previously collaborated with FUJIFILM by shooting stills on The Creator with a GFX-series body, which led to the invitation to make a short for the ETERNA 55 launch. He partnered with writer-director Andrew Kightlinger, who developed a script from a personal experience. The team aimed to put the camera through varied situations, day and night, interior and exterior, while keeping the story grounded in a single location. Production was tight: testing, LUT development, and prep were condensed around a four-day shoot in Portland, Oregon.</p>\n    <p>Testing pushed the team toward two complementary capture modes. For spherical work, Soffer shot full open-gate 4:3 to showcase the unique rendering of the large sensor with fast vintage glass. He likens the compositions to medium-format stills, only now in motion. For widescreen sequences, the production used 2× anamorphic on the full sensor height and kept the unsqueezed 2.66:1 frame rather than cropping to 2.39, embracing the edge aberrations and extra breadth. Spherical lenses were rehoused Fujinon optics from the 1970s (TLS and Ancient Optics). Anamorphic scenes used Xelmus Apollo primes, with the 75 mm and 100 mm covering the format to his surprise.</p>\n    <p>Shooting occurred on early firmware, so the new electronic variable ND was not ready at the time. After trying it on a demo unit later, Oren Soffer called it a particularly useful control for dusk-to-blue-hour work where you ride filtration as exposure drops. On recording formats, he did not miss internal RAW. The production ran ProRes 422 HQ, which he describes as robust for color depth and dynamic range. For the kinds of indie and documentary projects this class of camera targets, he argues internal RAW is often unnecessary, while the option to add an external recorder remains for higher-end needs.</p>\n    <p>Concerns about rolling shutter followed the camera’s development lineage, yet Oren says it never became a practical issue on Okay. Even with dynamic handheld work and assertive pans, he did not find artifacts distracting in context. He stresses that tolerance is subjective and recommends users test the camera or review footage to judge acceptability for their own work.</p>\n    <p>Oren sees the GFX ETERNA 55 as particularly compelling for independent narrative and documentary filmmakers. It can build up for larger sets, yet it also packs a distinctive large-format look into a relatively compact package. He says he would gladly use it again and is eager to try it with more motion rigs, such as steadicams, gimbals, and drones.</p>\n    <p>For the camera’s positioning and technical background, watch our detailed GFX ETERNA 55 release explainer.</p>\n    <p>Curious what you think after watching the interview: does the mixed 4:3 and 2.66:1 approach suit the story, or would you have framed it differently?</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Stay current with regular CineD updates about news, reviews, how-to’s and more.</p>\n    <p>You can unsubscribe at any time via an unsubscribe link included in every newsletter.

But rather than try and make such bodily feeling static, he attempts to convey the invisible vibration of it visible. Significant works in the show include several examples of his “Point des Observations,” constructions that could be mistaken for toadstools or footrests.</p>\n<p>“I would love for visitors to wander into the show almost on their own, to sit for a while on the ‘Point des Observations,’ allowing time to slow and the senses to sharpen as they contemplate the space, the light, the sculptures—simply witnessing how each pure image unfolds into a new story, and how unexpected narratives appear.” When asked what he hopes for the viewer experience, Creten noted, “An essential trembling—not of fear, but the trembling one feels when falling in love.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2690148\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/09/installation-view-ulrich-wolff-alfonso-artiaco-2025-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"A contemporary gallery installation featuring abstract geometric paintings by Ulrich Wolff.

Before the <em>Britannic</em> could enter service as a transatlantic passenger liner, however, World War I broke out and she was requisitioned as a hospital ship by Britain’s Royal Navy.</p>\n<p>In 1916, while transporting wounded soldiers across the Mediterranean, the <em>Britannic</em> struck a German mine and sunk off the Greek island of Kea. Although all of the ship’s passengers escaped, 30 died after two lifeboats got caught on the vessel’s propellers.</p>\n<p>“Between the sixth and thirteenth of May, a research program carried out the first-ever selective recovery of objects from the wreck site,” the Greek Ministry of Culture said in a <a href=\"https://www.culture.gov.gr/el/Information/SitePages/view.aspx?nID=5451&amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawM3gKlleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFqU3VBVFVTYzY2Q3ZVU2pjAR6seoJUjv_VprHpnW2tKYXyA6rNZ-uCABDyH8fghll0UCXsZNLQ8-5OIMNXnA_aem_a5RGWYAfYsm78M6fg_k-Vg\">statement</a>, noting that a team of 11 divers had descended to a depth of nearly 400 feet.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2689621\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/09/bucket-britannic.jpeg\" alt=\"cleaning bucket with old silver objects being cleaned\" srcset=\"https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/09/bucket-britannic.jpeg 810w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/09/bucket-britannic-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/09/bucket-britannic-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/09/bucket-britannic-50x33.jpeg 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-2689621\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Silver-plated serving tray from the ship’s First Class equipment.

Next, they were transported to the department’s specialized laboratories in Athens for further conservation and research. The items will go on display in a section dedicated to World War I at the new National Museum of Underwater Antiquities, which is under construction in the Greek city of Piraeus.</p>\n<p>Despite the successes, the expedition did not collect all of the artifacts it had hoped to recover. The Ministry noted that “the conditions at the wreck site were particularly difficult, due to the currents, great depth, and low visibility.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2689614\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/09/britannic-1024x579.jpeg\" alt=\"a black and white image of a 20th century ship\" srcset=\"https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/09/britannic-1024x579.jpeg 1024w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/09/britannic-300x170.jpeg 300w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/09/britannic-768x434.jpeg 768w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/09/britannic-1536x869.jpeg 1536w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/09/britannic-50x28.jpeg 50w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/09/britannic.jpeg 1800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-2689614\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The <em>Britannic</em> repurposed as a hospital ship.

For Mills, one motivation for purchasing the wreck from the British government was reexamining the story of the <em>Titanic</em> and its sister ship. “We have the technology to visit their last resting places and analyze the events as they actually happened,” Mills said in a 2016 <a href=\"https://thehistorypress.co.uk/article/qa-with-simon-mills-owner-of-the-hmhs-britannic-wreck/\">interview</a>. “These techniques can help us to rewrite history in a meaningful way.”</p>\n<p>The <em>Britannic</em> was first located and explored by the celebrated French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau in 1975 and is the largest intact passenger ship on the seabed in the world. The third vessel from the White Star Line’s 1910s steamships was the <em>RMS Olympic</em>, which sailed for 24 years before being sold for scrap in 1935.</p>\n\n                                        </div>\n\n                                        \n                                                                            </div>",

    "body": "<p>There are​ few pictures of rich Jews as enchanting as Renoir’s 1881 portrait of the young Cahen d’Anvers sisters, Elisabeth and Alice, with their chubby cheeks, pearly teeth, sturdy legs and frilly dresses. Or take Ingres’s earlier but equally celebrated portrayal of the Baronne de Rothschild, a woman Heinrich Heine compared to an angel. It is at once lush and restrained. Betty de Rothschild’s glorious full pink skirt is set against a rich brown background; she wears pearls and a large ruby, but her pose is informal, her eyes thoughtful. Such paintings illuminate a moment when Jews entered European high society on new terms. They were no longer simply tolerated as the financiers and estate managers whose expertise, money and contacts facilitated the lifestyle of the old aristocracy. At last they could aspire to a different status: as near-equals whose wealth, intellect or artistic talent gave them access to previously closed social worlds.</p>\n<p>Samson Wertheimer, a rabbi and financier who served as court factor to three Holy Roman Emperors in the early 1700s and was even known as the <i>Judenkaiser,</i> didn’t inspire great art; portraits of him exist, but they are pedestrian and by unknown artists. The Jews who figure in so many of Rembrandt’s greatest paintings are, with a single exception, not individuals but social types: the old Jew, the young Jew, the Jewish bride. So when the Rothschilds, the Cahen d’Anvers and the British Wertheimers commissioned portraits that showed them as individuals, they were not only indulging the impulse to preserve their faces for posterity, but revealing a sophisticated understanding of what art was and why it mattered.</p>\n<p>In Britain, the end of the 19th century was marked by tumultuous economic upheaval, agricultural crisis and appalling poverty, but also by diversification in the social hierarchy. Constrained by social and economic forces, members of the old landowning families began to mingle with the families of ‘Randlords’, captains of industry and financiers. Sometimes they even married their daughters. Art dealers like the Wertheimers joined this composite elite. Dealing was a profession that rose dramatically in prestige precisely because the old families were losing money and new ones sought to acquire ‘the furniture of the great’. Prices were soaring. In 1882, Ferdinand de Rothschild instructed another Samson Wertheimer – a Jew from Fürth now settled in London – to spend six thousand pounds on Marie Antoinette’s writing table, which he purchased at Christie’s from the duke of Hamilton. As Edmond de Goncourt cattily noted at the end of the 1870s, the scrapmongers of yesteryear were now ‘gentlemen dressed by our tailors who buy and read books and have wives as distinguished as the wives in our own circles, gentlemen hosting dinners served by servants wearing white cravats’.</p>\n<p>Less than 3 per cent of the very rich in Edwardian Britain (those leaving estates of more than £100,000) were Jews, but attacks on the ‘new plutocracy’ were often antisemitic in nature and to be Jewish attracted a particular opprobrium. This was certainly true in the art world, a sector that comprised other mercantile minorities, though none carried such a weight of prejudice as the much maligned Jewish dealer. This was also the Dreyfus moment, when vicious caricatures and sinister pen-portraits of Jews became ubiquitous. Yet it remained the task of the society portraitist to give wealth a human face. The results were ambiguous, and this tension is the subject of Jean Strouse’s book, a group biography that navigates the relationship between Jews, art and money in the years around 1900.</p>\n<p>John Singer Sargent seems to be in fashion: his ‘dollar princesses’ are on display at Kenwood House (until 5 October); his early years are the subject of a major show at the Musée d’Orsay, opening this month. For a long time, however, his work provoked ambivalence. Admirers saw him as an heir to Velázquez, Van Dyck, Manet and the great English portrait painters; dissenters thought his work shallow, commercial and derivative. He was, the critic Michael Kimmelman argued in 1999, ‘the gold standard during the Gilded Age. But he invented nothing; he changed nothing.’ As the chronicler of a world in flux, perhaps he did not need to. If turn-of-the-century Britain was a society, as Strouse writes, ‘precariously balanced between centuries, between tradition and modernity, between a past dominated by Europe and an indistinct American future, between longstanding social hierarchies and disruptive forces of new power and wealth’, then Sargent was – as Max Beerbohm commented – its ‘supreme interpreter’. That ability stemmed in part, Strouse suggests, from his peripatetic upbringing. Sargent was a certain kind of rootless American. Born in Italy, where he first learned to sketch and paint, he set foot in the US only at the age of twenty and spent most of his adult life in Europe. In short, he was himself a product of the new society, and was instinctively drawn to its more dynamic protagonists.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>The Expansion Project​ is Ben Pester’s first novel. There is little about its opening that hints at the weirdness of the imagination which created it, though a reader familiar with Pester’s short stories may have some suspicions. The title story of <i>Am I in the Right Place?</i> (2020) features a ‘Mondelux single-man-in-a-bedsit oven with rotisserie setting’ that turns out to be a portal to childhood memories. In ‘Lifelong Learning’, from the same collection, a person at a party climbs into a kitchen cupboard to escape an abusive flatmate and finds a ‘one-time hole’ leading to a utopian community known as ‘the village’. And then there’s ‘Mother’s Day Card from a Wooden Object’: ‘Perhaps you’re wondering why I have chosen this moment to send this card – which, as you know, I cannot actually send or write in a physical sense because I am entirely made of wood.’</p>\n<p>One could say that the novel is about a man who loses his mind at work, but that’s not really right, because the categories of ‘man’, ‘mind’ and ‘work’ are somehow looser and more porous than one might expect. The man’s name is Tom Crowley. We meet him on his way to work at the Capmeadow business park, accompanied by his eight-year-old daughter, Hen. It’s Bring Your Daughter to Work Day, or Crowley thinks it is. Hen is not short for Henrietta, the child explains to ‘Steve from reception’. Actually she was named on account of her ‘hen-headedness’: when she was a baby her head was as narrow as a chicken’s.</p>\n<p>Crowley is prone to panic and sudden rages; he clings on to sanity through parenthood: ‘My children, since they were born, have been a miraculous way for me to confirm that I am all right. I certainly couldn’t have said it before they arrived. I was not all right.’ Their existence, however, is sometimes itself a source of panic and rage. The mundane details that unfold could be lifted from any stressed father’s morning routine: an untidy kitchen, train station croissants, a frantic scroll through unread emails, a lost napkin. But it’s within the mundane that Pester lodges (or dislodges) the strangest things. Many of his characters experience some version of being en route to work when they find themselves on the cusp of slipping through a portal into an alternate universe. In ‘All Silky and Wonderful’, a man on a train wakes from a doze to learn that his carriage is about to be decoupled from the rest of the train because a set of ‘expressive teal leather luggage’ abandoned by its owner is emanating a ‘bone-level sense of doom’. ‘Please don’t decouple me!’ he cries. ‘You don’t understand – I’ve got to run a workshop.’</p>\n<p>For Crowley, the difficulty is how to be a person who goes to work, and also a father and a husband, when work is in many ways hostile to real human connection, a place where language is ‘messaging’ and emotions are unprofessional. The Capmeadow liaison officer explains:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Whenever they seem to be about to talk about something they are forbidden to mention (not</p><i>forbidden</i>, I apologise, this word has crept into my language recently and I think it’s because one of my team used to work in the copywriting division; there has been a spread, only a mild one, of off-message language – so, not<i>forbidden</i>but<i>non-accepted</i>), something gently happens to move them back onto a more appropriate track. Certain topics cannot be discussed with me for data and privacy reasons. There are counsellors and things like that for very personal issues.</blockquote>\n<p>The daily grind of parenthood brings different challenges, but these are more than compensated for by transcendent love. Crowley observes his daughter passing through his workplace:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>As always, she moved as a different shape to the people around her, brighter and more fluid than any other form in the office. At least, this is how I saw her. It’s fairly difficult to know how the rest of the world would have seen it, but to me, she was like a blaze in the presence of others.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>Of course, work and family have always been inextricably intertwined, as Crowley acknowledges: ‘I might as well be honest and say I was never good at my job. Until it was for them, I never had a single second at work that felt like a productive use of my time. Not here, not in any of my jobs before this one.’ In Bring Your Daughter to Work Day, an occasion that probably doesn’t exist, he seems to have hallucinated a merging of his two roles, a fantasy that both occurs and doesn’t occur, during which Hen goes irrevocably missing but also turns out to have been at school the whole time.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>Idon’t​ think I ever dobbed anybody in – or if I did, I would have told myself I was doing something else. Dobbing is the preferred Australian word for denunciation or snitching to the bosses, and it is taken to be a shameful betrayal of one’s fellow subalterns. I’m quite sure that, as a child, I never sneaked to a teacher about other girls: that would have been contemptible in schoolyard culture and I would remember if I’d done such a thing. For adults, it’s easier to obfuscate the act. A university dean of my acquaintance once told me that faculty members at his Ivy League school regularly dropped in to his office for casual chats whose real purpose, usually not directly stated, was to let him know that ‘there might be a problem’ with some other colleague.</p>\n<p>When I first went to the Soviet Union as a British exchange student in the 1960s, I found that Soviet attitudes on the matter were similar to those I had grown up with in Australia. To be a snitch (<i>donoschik</i>) was and remains contemptible in Russian eyes, no matter how much governments – from 17th-century Muscovite to Soviet – have encouraged it, and how common the practice is in real life. Of course, as a principled position, this blanket ban on informing the authorities about anything has its problems. In the 1980s, when I had become interested in denunciation as a social historian, I asked one of my Soviet/Russian friends what he would do if he found out his neighbour was a serial murderer. Would he break his own rules and go to the police with a <i>donos</i>, or remain silent and risk more people dying? ‘I would tell them,’ he said, after a moment’s thought. ‘But I would hate myself for doing so.’</p>\n<p>America, as I realised soon after arriving there as a budding Sovietologist in the Cold War, is different. Telling the authorities about another citizen’s wrongdoing becomes an ipso facto betrayal of subaltern solidarity only in context of a strong dichotomy between ‘us’ and ‘them’; and this dichotomy seems to be only partially and episodically present in American life. It was ‘us’ and ‘them’ for the anti-Vietnam protesters of the 1970s, and for intellectuals in the McCarthyist 1950s, outraged at the pressure put on witnesses before the House Un-American Activities Committee to ‘name names’ of communists and sympathisers. But in general, Americans have seemed to accept the idea that government is their representative, not a thing apart, so they don’t feel so bad about telling the authorities something the authorities should know.</p>\n<p>Among the difficulties of talking about denunciation is that there are so many words for it, along with sharply opposed understandings of its morality. If you denounce me, you’re a snitch with a personal agenda. If I denounce you, it’s because I’m a public-spirited citizen. Many of the terms in different languages are negative or at best neutral officialese, but Americans, uniquely, have invented a term for denunciation that is wholly positive: ‘whistleblowing’. This word, reportedly coined by Ralph Nader in the early 1970s to avoid the pejorative connotations of ‘snitching’ and ‘informing’, refers specifically to the reporting of abuses on the part of bosses of corporations, government departments and the like. Since whistleblowers risk retaliation by speaking out, they are seen (except by their targets) as brave, public-spirited truth-tellers.</p>\n<p>By contrast, denunciation was seen by US Sovietologists, as well as a broader Cold War public, as a distinctively Soviet phenomenon, part of the ‘atomisation’ fostered by the totalitarian state through the breaking of traditional family and friendship loyalties, and wholly negative. The case always cited was that of Pavlik Morozov, a Young Pioneer who denounced his own father during collectivisation, whose example was recommended to generations of Soviet children.<a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v47/n17/footnotes/diary-footnote-1\">*</a></p>\n<p>In the course of my research on Soviet history, I became interested in Stalin’s Cultural Revolution of the late 1920s and early 1930s, a precursor to (and no doubt an inspiration for) Mao’s better known Cultural Revolution in China decades later. The Soviet Cultural Revolution was an assault on the entrenched power of elites (the ‘bourgeois’ intelligentsia and ‘rightist’ bureaucrats) in the arts and education. The campaign was taken up with enthusiasm by young communist militants eager for a fight as well as people with grievances in all fields of culture. Denunciation of opponents to the Party was a major weapon in these conflicts. Such denunciations were known as ‘signals from below’, a positive Soviet term for denunciation which, despite official endorsement, never caught on in ordinary Russian speech.</p>\n<p>The Great Purges of the late 1930s, which were initiated by Stalin but gathered their own momentum, offered a different kind of mass-denunciation experience. Communist elites were the main target, and popular denunciation was a common way of identifying the victims (‘spies’ and ‘enemies of the people’) who were to be arrested, executed or banished to Gulag. In contrast to the Soviet Cultural Revolution, which was not usually hysterical, this became a real moral panic – a witch hunt in which ‘enemies’ might be suddenly and intuitively recognised with no real evidence offered or required. Citizens thus accused were unable to defend themselves, and if well-wishers tried to step in, even just by calling for due process, they instantly became ‘enemies’ too.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

In the late 1980s, as Vincent notes, Nauru briefly became the richest country per capita in the world. But what also happened is that the Nauruans, with 80 per cent of their land devastated by mining, became almost wholly dependent on imported food (often from countries whose fields were fertilised with their phosphate). Severe obesity developed, and with it one of the world’s highest rates of type 2 diabetes.</p>\n<p>Their main competitor for this unwanted title were the Akimel O’odham (Pima), indigenous to southern Arizona, whose traditional way of life depended on the waters of the Gila River, which they used to irrigate their crops. Successive damming of the river to provide water for the cities of Tuscon and Phoenix reduced flow in the Gila by nearly 90 per cent and traditional Akimel O’odham food production came to an end. Record levels of obesity and type 2 diabetes followed and by the 1970s cases of type 2 diabetes – until then a disease of middle-aged and older adults – began to emerge in children and adolescents.</p>\n<p>Instead of paying attention to the environmental catastrophes underlying these population health disasters, researchers embarked on fruitless genetic studies looking to explain the apparently unique susceptibility of the Akimel O’odham and Nauruans to type 2 diabetes and the modern world (‘the thrifty genotype’). Alas, much of the modern world has now caught up, and type 2 diabetes in young people has become commonplace.</p>\n<p>A footnote to this story is that exendin-4, a protein isolated from the venom of the Gila monster, a lizard of spiritual importance to the Akimel O’odham, was the molecular base from which today’s weight-loss drugs were developed.</p>\n<p><strong>Tim Cundy</strong><br/>\n\t\t\t\tAuckland\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Reviewing Zachary Leader’s book about Richard Ellmann’s 1959 biography of James Joyce, Seamus Perry gives a fine sense of Ellmann’s geniality, tenacity and biographical artistry (<a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v47/n16/seamus-perry/beaverosity\"> LRB, 11 September</a>). In the early 1980s Ellmann was my doctoral supervisor. Having heard him lecture on several literary biographies, I asked him which he regarded as the greatest. Without hesitation he answered: ‘Boswell’s Life of Johnson.’ Hearing the awe in his voice, I was pleased but a little surprised: he hadn’t mentioned Boswell in the lecture. When I asked why he was so sure, Ellmann pointed to the way Boswell built up his text out of so many minute vivid details, such as the precise manner in which Johnson moved his tongue against his gums.</p>\n<p>I had at the time been reading Adam Smith’s <i>Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres</i>. Boswell attributed something of his own detail-amassing ‘Flemish picture’ style of biography to Adam Smith, who ‘in his rhetorical lectures at Glasgow, told us he was glad to know that Milton wore latchets in his shoes, instead of buckles’. As is clear from his biography of Joyce, Ellmann, too, loved the kind of minutiae that enabled the biographer to develop a painstaking portrait in which, as Boswell puts it, ‘every little spark adds something to the general blaze.’ Leader points out that Ellmann was educated at Yale at a time when Frederick Pottle’s enthusiasm for Boswell was strong. Yet by the time the second edition of <i>James Joyce</i> was published in 1982, not everyone welcomed Ellmann’s style and method. In the 1980s one Oxford don denounced him to me as a ‘card-indexer’, and there were tensions between his American cultural co-ordinates (his ‘dialect’, as he sometimes put it) and some of the attitudes he encountered in Oxford.</p>\n<p>In combining resonant detail with style, Ellmann’s biography of Joyce owes much to his American background and training. The book’s arresting first sentence – ‘We are still learning to be James Joyce’s contemporaries, to understand our interpreter’ – remains splendid. In retrospect, it also seems a Cold War sentence, presenting Joyce as the developer of a superior modern technology dauntingly far in advance of everyone else’s.</p>\n<p><strong>Robert Crawford</strong><br/>\n\t\t\t\tEdinburgh\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>  Seamus Perry says that Leopold Bloom’s tender care for his cat is ‘hardly Homeric’. Is it not? The difference is merely canine versus feline: Odysseus is almost betrayed back on Ithaca by Argos,  his faithful dog, whose final breath is a whimper of recognition that almost gives his master away. Joyce chose the <i>Odyssey</i> as his model, surely, because Odysseus is the most human of  heroes and the most heroic of humans.</p>\n<p><strong>Steve Carey</strong><br/>\n\t\t\t\tMentone, Victoria\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p>  Like the imperial state in J.M. Coetzee’s <i>Waiting for the Barbarians</i>, Jackson Lears writes, ‘the US and Israel are convinced of their exalted status as Chosen Nations; their leaders are  drunk on exceptionalist fantasies and committed to conquering populations they deem inferior’ (<a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v47/n13/jackson-lears/the-righteous-community\"> LRB, 24 July</a>). In C.P. Cavafy’s poem of 1904 which gives  Coetzee’s novel its title, the way the empire imagines such populations is exactly what enables it to constitute itself. Eventually, when the enemy fails to appear at the gates, uncertainty reigns:  ‘And now what is to become of us without barbarians? Those people were a solution of a sort.’</p>\n<p><strong>Ian Ellison</strong><br/>\n\t\t\t\tWadham College, Oxford\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Zhao noted that during these sessions, the attackers often claim there is a problem with Zoom and then send a link to an “update” carrying a virus, or they provide coding questions followed by “sample code” embedded with malware.</p><p>Another tactic involves pretending to be users who file customer support requests containing malicious links. CZ added that hackers also pay or bribe employees and hired vendors to gain access to data, pointing to a recent case in India where an outsourcing service was compromised, resulting in the leak of data from a major U.S. exchange and losses exceeding $400 million.</p><p>This alert follows the release of a report by cybersecurity group Security Alliance (SEAL), profiling over 60 impostors linked to North Korean operations. The report <a href=\"https://x.com/_SEAL_Org/status/1968396194805088754?t=FbsWeZogxBVNL6yWMTD-Fw&amp;s=19\">says</a> that these attackers built fake LinkedIn profiles, set up GitHub portfolios, and used forged government IDs to make their applications look real.</p><h2>Shift in Methods</h2><p>North Korean hackers have always been a major threat in the crypto industry, with over $1.3 billion worth of assets stolen in 2024 alone. Traditionally, they have relied on phishing, malware, and private key compromises to loot from exchanges. However, recent reports suggest they are moving towards targeting human resources.</p><p>A separate investigation by ZachXBT also <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/google-docs-upwork-and-linkedin-inside-north-korean-it-workers-secret-crypto-operations/\">uncovered</a> how a small DPRK team of five IT workers operated over 30 fake identities at crypto firms. Elsewhere, Coinbase also recently reported a similar threat from these bad actors. The exchange shared that they are increasingly targeting their remote worker policy to infiltrate sensitive systems.</p><p>CEO Brian Armstrong has since <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeVny5KHj4g\">announced</a> changes to the company’s internal security protocols, including mandatory in-person onboarding in the U.S., fingerprinting, and U.S. citizenship requirements for employees with system-level access. The exchange also introduced stricter interview procedures, such as requiring cameras to remain on, to prevent impersonation and AI-assisted coaching.</p><p>In light of the growing threat to the job market, CZ has urged crypto platforms to train their employees not to download files and to screen potential candidates carefully.</p><p><strong>Binance Free $600 (CryptoPotato Exclusive):</strong>(</p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600f/\">Use this link</a>to register a new account and receive $600 exclusive welcome offer on Binance<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600d/\">full details</a>).</p><p><strong>LIMITED OFFER for CryptoPotato readers at Bybit:</strong></p></body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>Something just pulled in $100,000 in a single day, and it might be the answer to XRP’s institutional limitations. DigiTap, the world’s first omni-bank, managed to raise six figures in 24 hours by solving what XRP couldn’t – making crypto accessible to everyone, not just banks.</p>\n<p>For years, investors have watched XRP try to convince financial institutions to adopt its technology. The results have been mixed at best. Regulatory battles, limited retail access, and dependence on institutional adoption have left many wondering if there’s a better way to capture the cross-border payments market.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://presale.digitap.app/\">DigiTap</a> decided to skip the whole “please adopt our technology” dance that most fintech companies do with banks. They just built something that works whether banks participate or not. People can handle regular banking, crypto, and international transfers from one place. No need to wait for some bank executive to give the green light.</p>\n<h2>Money That Actually Moves Fast</h2>\n<p>Here’s the thing about money today – it’s embarrassingly slow. Text messages travel around the world in milliseconds. Money? Still takes three business days to move between banks. That’s not just annoying, it’s economically destructive.</p>\n<p>Digitap fixes this by developing a solution that works in real-time. A freelancer in Manila can get paid by a client in Miami the moment they finish the work. A small business can move funds between different currencies in seconds, not days. Payroll can happen instantly across any border.</p>\n<p>This creates opportunities that simply didn’t exist before. New types of businesses become possible when cash flow isn’t constantly stuck in transit. Remote work becomes more viable when payment delays disappear. International trade gets easier when currency conversion happens instantly.</p>\n<p>The technical setup makes this possible through smart routing. The platform connects traditional banking rails like SWIFT and SEPA with blockchain networks. An AI system picks the fastest, cheapest route for each transaction. Users don’t need to understand the technical details – they just see money that moves when they want it to move.</p>\n<p>People have been talking about the “future of payments” for years. Digitap actually built it.</p>\n<h2>DigiTap vs XRP: Different Games, Different Rules</h2>\n<p>XRP carved out its niche as the go-to token for banks moving money across borders. The technology works well – transactions settle in seconds using a consensus system that’s much more efficient than Bitcoin’s energy-hungry mining. Ripple Labs positioned XRP specifically to help traditional financial institutions modernize their cross-border payment systems.</p>\n<p>But XRP operates within the existing banking world. Banks have to integrate XRP into their infrastructure. Regular people rarely interact with XRP directly. The ongoing legal battle with the SEC hasn’t helped either – it’s created uncertainty and limited XRP’s availability on major exchanges.</p>\n<p>Digitap takes a completely different approach. Instead of trying to convince banks to change, it built a new system that works with or without them. People can access both traditional banking services and crypto functionality through one interface. No waiting for institutional adoption. No regulatory uncertainty about whether the token counts as a security.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://presale.digitap.app/?&amp;utm_source=marketing&amp;utm_campaign=cpsp&amp;utm_id=89\">$TAP</a> token powers the entire ecosystem. Users can stake it for rewards, use it to pay lower fees, and vote on platform decisions. The utility is immediate and practical, not dependent on banks deciding to upgrade their systems.</p>\n<p>XRP focuses on institutional adoption. Digitap focuses on giving everyone – individuals, small businesses, corporations – the tools they need right now. One approach requires permission. The other just works.</p>\n<h2>$TAP: More Than Just Another Token</h2>\n<p>The $TAP token isn’t just there for speculation. It actually does things within the platform. Token holders can stake their $TAP to earn up to 100% APR. They get discounts on transaction fees. They can vote on platform decisions and new features.</p>\n<p>The economics make sense, too. Total supply is capped at 2 billion tokens with no inflation. As more people use the platform, more tokens get burned permanently. Half of all platform profits are allocated to buying back and burning $TAP tokens. More usage means fewer tokens in circulation.</p>\n<p>Higher-tier stakers get perks that extend beyond the digital world. Airport lounge access. Concierge services. Priority customer support. These aren’t promises for someday – they’re available now for users who meet the requirements.</p>\n<p>The token creates a direct connection between platform success and holder rewards. As Digitap grows, $TAP becomes more useful and more scarce. That’s a setup that tends to work out well for early participants.</p>\n<h2>Getting In Early Matters</h2>\n<p>The financial world is changing, whether traditional institutions like it or not. People want their money to move as fast as their messages. They want to use both crypto and regular money without switching between multiple apps. They want banking that actually works for a global, digital economy.</p>\n<p>The platform sits at the intersection of several massive markets. Cross-border payments. Digital banking. Cryptocurrency exchange. Mobile finance. Each of these markets is worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Digitap potentially captures value from all of them.</p>\n<p>The $TAP presale offers early access to what could be the next major shift in how money moves around the world. The $100k raised in 24 hours suggests investors might be ready to bet on this approach.</p>\n<p>Learn more about Digitap ($TAP) <a href=\"https://presale.digitap.app/?&amp;utm_source=marketing&amp;utm_campaign=cpsp&amp;utm_id=89\">here.</a></p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>Bitcoin (BTC) declined modestly on Friday, as its rally lost steam as enthusiasm about lower US borrowing costs tapered off.</p><p>New data suggest that the crypto asset may be approaching a cycle top.</p><h2>BTC Rally Nearing Its Breaking Point</h2><p>According to the latest analysis from crypto trader CasiTrades, Bitcoin has <a href=\"https://x.com/CasiTrades/status/1968743994373849119\">reached</a> the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level at around $117,900, which she described as a “textbook target” for a potential Wave 2 pivot. This level, she argued, is one of the most common bearish turning points in a market cycle.</p><p>CasiTrades revealed that several technical patterns are converging at this point, including the completion of a larger Wave 2 ABC pattern and the alignment of five clear subwaves within the C wave, all targeting the same retracement zone. She added that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is flashing multiple bearish divergences up to the four-hour chart, which indicates that momentum may be weakening.</p><p>A decisive move below $113,000 would serve as confirmation of a downward trend, and potential downside targets stand near $96,000 or even $90,000. For now, the analyst believes the recent $118,000 high may represent the long-awaited market top, unless Bitcoin manages to invalidate the bearish setup by breaking RSI resistance and pushing to new all-time highs.</p><blockquote><p>“We are getting all the classic signs that the market is topping here.”</p></blockquote><h2>Fears of Deeper Correction</h2><p>On September 19, Michigan’s Bitcoin Reserve Bill (HB 4087) <a href=\"https://x.com/Bitcoin_Laws/status/1968774724344742198\">advanced</a> through its second reading in the state House before moving to the Government Operations Committee. While the proposal, which would allow up to 10% of state funds to be allocated into crypto, could set the stage for broader institutional entry, its near-term effect remains limited.</p><p>In fact, the bigger risk lies in political resistance. In a statement to <i>CryptoPotato</i>, Bitunix Analysts warned that any pushback could spark sharp, liquidation-driven pullbacks in Bitcoin.</p><p>BTC risks facing $113,000 as the first downside level, followed by $111,000 and $108,000. A breakdown below these supports could intensify selling pressure and open the door to deeper declines, and end up overshadowing optimism tied to the bill.</p><p>Similar warnings have been made by different market watchers. Ali Martinez, for one, had previously <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-btc-bulls-eye-137k-but-only-if-this-support-holds-strong/\">stated</a> that a breakdown below the $115,440 threshold could trigger sharper corrections and even expose the market to declines toward $93,600. Holding above support, on the other hand, leaves room for upside targets near $137,300.</p><p><strong>Binance Free $600 (CryptoPotato Exclusive):</strong>(</p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600f/\">Use this link</a>to register a new account and receive $600 exclusive welcome offer on Binance<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600d/\">full details</a>).</p><p><strong>LIMITED OFFER for CryptoPotato readers at Bybit:</strong></p></body>\n</html>",

Notably, the premier cryptocurrency continues to trade within the $115,000 price region after earlier price gains on Thursday were followed by a correction of equal measure.<br/>\n</p><h2><strong>SOPR Ratio Trends Up: Market Signals Point To New Bitcoin Rally</strong></h2>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/68cd886e756c0b23f07c54fd-The-Power-of-Long-Term-Holders-Returns-Is-Bitcoin-Entering-a-New-Bull-Phase\">QuickTake post</a> on September 19, PelinayPA shares some potential insights into Bitcoin’s future trajectory based on the latest Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) developments. For context, the SOPR is an on-chain metric that reflects whether Bitcoin investors are selling their coins at a profit or a loss. </p><p>However, this metric can also be used to gauge the balance of profitability between <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-lths-realized-profits/\">long-term holders</a> and <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sths-are-selling-at-a-loss/\">short-term holders</a> when we compare the SOPR Ratios of both parties, i.e, LTH/STH SOPR. When the ratio is high (LTH &gt; STH), it indicates that seasoned investors are more profitable, often signaling the beginning or continuation of a sustainable bull market.</p><p/><graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/img.cryptoquant.com/363886/quicktake/gdySNVpu_f0e12d182d7c720cb40a2b25fc3553c1428f0376dd01664ba2457f0fb3ee78e1.png?resize=1280%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Bitcoin\"/><p>Conversely, when the ratio is low (LTH &lt; STH), it suggests that short-term traders are outperforming, typically occurring during market tops or in the early stages of bear markets. Looking at historical cycles, PelinayPA explains that the indicator has proven to be a reliable lens into Bitcoin’s investor dynamics and various market conditions. For example, in the 2020–2021 bull run, the ratio remained moderate as short-term traders recorded substantial gains alongside long-term holders, establishing an unsustainable rally and weak market top, eventually triggering a significant price correction. <br/>\n<br/>\nPelinayPA also references the depths of the 2022–2024 bear market during the SOPR ratio remained suppressed, reflecting weak profitability among long-term holders, but as Bitcoin began its recovery through 2023 and 2024, the metric started climbing again, hinting at a potential structural shift to a new bull phase. </p><p>In the present market,  the LTH/STH SOPR ratio is balanced but moving upward, a sign that long-term holders are regaining their advantage. PelinayPA suggests this could mark the early stages of a new bull cycle, with indicators pointing to $120,000 as the next major upside technical target.<br/>\n</p><h2><strong>Bitcoin Whale Accumulation Remains High</strong></h2>\n<p>In other news, US-based institutions and whales continue to accumulate substantial levels of Bitcoin regardless of price movements. Market analyst Darkfost <a href=\"https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/68cda9847a7f093d36f76728-Institutions-and-whales-keep-accumulating-BTC\">reports</a> that Coinbase Premium has turned consistently positive since April, reflecting stronger institutional demand from US traders compared to entities on other trading platforms, such as Binance. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $115,668 after a net 0.35% loss in the past seven days. </p><graphic src=\"https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/BTCUSDT_2025-09-20_08-09-55.png?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C379\" alt=\"Bitcoin\"/><p><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/xg17RJqK/\">BTCUSDT chart on Tradingview.com</a></p><graphic src=\"https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/safe.png\"/><p><strong>Editorial Process</strong>for bitcoinist is centered on delivering thoroughly researched, accurate, and unbiased content.

At the time, the US Treasury was interested in gathering feedback on different technologies to identify and combat the risks associated with these dollar-backed digital assets.</p><h2><strong>Call For Public Comment On Stablecoin Act To Close In 30 Days</strong></h2>\n<p>On Thursday, September 18, the US Department of the Treasury <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0254\">issued</a> an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM), calling on the public for comments on the implementation of the GENIUS Act. This request will allow a wide range of stakeholders to contribute, by offering data and other information, to the implementation of this law.</p><p>The press release read:</p><blockquote><p>The GENIUS Act tasks the Treasury with issuing regulations that encourage innovation in payment stablecoins while also providing an appropriately tailored regime to protect consumers, mitigate potential illicit finance risks, and address financial stability risks.</p></blockquote><p>This notice asked for comments and views on a plethora of questions, including whether extra clarity is needed on the amount of reserve assets required to be held in custody. “Are there foreign payment stablecoin regulatory or supervisory regimes, or regimes in development, that may be comparable to the regime established under the GENIUS Act?” another question posed.</p><p>Some of the other questions asked in this notice include marketing restrictions, balancing state-level and federal oversight, and the application of Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), anti-money laundering regulations, and sanctions obligations. The <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-faces-patriot-act-crackdown/\">Treasury Department</a> noted that the public should submit their comments in response to the ANPRM within 30 days of publication in the Federal Register.</p><h2><strong>Crypto Market Structure Bill To Undergo Vote In September</strong> </h2>\n<p>Indeed, signing the GENIUS Act into law represented a major breakthrough in regulating the crypto landscape in the United States. In its next move, the US Senate is looking to hold a vote on the crypto market structure bill, titled the Responsible Financial Innovation Act 2025, before the end of September.</p><p>The digital market structure bill is aimed at clarifying the roles of various financial agencies in the oversight and enforcement of crypto regulations. In an updated version, the Senate Banking Committee <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-regulation-senate-updated-market-structure/amp/\">addressed</a> the issue of blockchain developers being treated as financial institutions and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) being treated as securities.</p><blockquote>The total crypto market cap on the daily timeframe | Source: TOTAL Chart on<a href=\"\">TradingView</a></blockquote><graphic src=\"https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/safe.png\"/><p><strong>Editorial Process</strong>for bitcoinist is centered on delivering thoroughly researched, accurate, and unbiased content.

With the U.K. establishing itself as a hub for digital assets and the U.S. seeking stronger ties with London, Ripple’s role in these discussions positions the company at the center of the conversation.</p>\n    <h2>Ripple Joins High-Level Talks On Crypto Cooperation</h2>\n    <p>In a tweet shared on X, analyst Nietzbux wrote that Ripple just met with the U.S. and U.K. <a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-to-clear-trillion-dollar-debt/\">governments on crypto cooperation.</a> According to the post, Ripple’s involvement in the high-level discussion could shape the next phase of crypto regulation and collaboration. The meeting, which took place on Tuesday when the President of the United States and members of the U.K. Royal family talked, gave the crypto discussions even more weight.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://x.com/nietzbux/status/1968524226958164459\">According to Nietzbux’s report</a>, UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent led the meeting. Both parties discussed new ways the two countries could cooperate on digital assets and how to establish stronger systems for the crypto industry. Reeves and Bessent met with representatives from Bank of America, Barclays, Circle, Citi, Coinbase, and <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-swell-2025-agenda/\">Ripple</a>.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-deal-southeast-asia-largest-bank/\">Banks and crypto companies </a>sat in the same room, as Reeves and Bessent pointed out that the governments of the U.S. and the U.K. are considering their differing opinions before implementing crypto rules that may impact the global crypto market. This kind of gathering highlights the international attention now focused on crypto. </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-endgame-with-ripple/\">Ripple’s expanding influence</a> in bridging traditional finance and blockchain systems could have earned it its seat at the table. Cassie Craddock, Ripple’s managing director for the U.K. and Europe, points to the governments and crypto companies working together, saying the gains can spread past cryptocurrency and help the global economy. </p>\n    <h2>Ripple’s Cassie Craddock Says Cooperation Could Shape Global Standards</h2>\n    <p>Discussing the significance of this partnership, Cassie Craddock said the planned collaboration between the two governments has “the potential to set a template for international cooperation in our industry.” By this, she explained that the talks are not only about the U.S. and U.K., but could also guide how <a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cryptos-turning-point-us-promises-to-end-crypto-debanking/\">other countries decide to work together</a> on digital assets.</p>\n    <p>Ripple’s Craddock highlighted the strengths of the U.K. financial sector, noting its strong economy, deep financial markets, and skilled workforce as factors that have made the U.K. one of the world’s top financial hubs for many years.</p>\n    <p>According to her, the countries are ready to use their existing strengths to lead in digital assets and innovation, which is why Ripple is <a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/ripple-2/ripple-agreement-with-gemini/\">advocating for deeper cooperation</a> at this level. She added that cooperation between the U.S. and the U.K. could help both countries <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-new-deal-dbs-bank-franklin-templeton/\">use blockchain technology more effectively.</a></p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/wiXoLEun/\">Tradingview.com</a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/safe.png\"/>\n    <p><strong>Editorial Process</strong>for bitcoinist is centered on delivering thoroughly researched, accurate, and unbiased content.

On average, activity drops back to 20-40% above pre-airdrop levels within weeks, and about 88% of airdropped tokens lose value within three months, showing that while airdrops succeed as marketing events, they “rarely secure long-term token strength,” DappRadar’s analyst Sara Gherghelas wrote in a Sept. 18 <a href=\"https://dappradar.com/blog/88-of-airdropped-tokens-lose-value-within-3-months\">research report</a>.</p>\n    <p>“Airdrops are unmatched in their ability to accelerate user acquisition, but long-term retention depends on product-market fit,” Gherghelas added.</p>\n    <h2>‘Holder Scores’</h2>\n    <p>Haseeb Qureshi, managing partner of crypto VC firm Dragonfly Capital, calls airdrops “dumb,” arguing in <a href=\"https://x.com/hosseeb/status/1967639851089662278\">a Sept. 15 post on X</a> that projects “spend months attracting farmers who generate artificial activity, only to watch those same farmers dump tokens immediately after TGE.”</p>\n    <p>Instead of handing out free tokens, Qureshi says projects should adopt “meta-incentives,” somewhat like a traditional credit score, where airdrops “incorporate how users behaved in previous airdrops.”</p>\n    <p>“If users know future protocols will see this Holder Score and incorporate it into their own airdrops, those users will adjust their behavior today,” Qureshi explains.</p>\n    <p>But big projects still favor airdrops to reward long-term supporters. For example, Jesse Pollak, founder of Coinbase’s Base network, <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/news/blockchains/coinbase-s-layer-2-base-teases-native-token\">recently hinted</a> at a potential native token launch, sparking speculation about an airdrop for the network’s active users.</p>\n    <p>Consensys-backed Layer 1 Linea also launched its token via airdrop, even though a lot of <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/news/blockchains/consensys-lubin-teases-further-rewards-for-linea-holders-as-token-tanks-50\">recipients sold immediately</a>, partly because the token didn’t have much use at launch, which pushed the price down more than 50%.</p>\n    <p>In response, Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/web3-wallet-wars-rage-on-as-rabby-and-metamask-tease-tokens\">promised extra rewards</a> for users who hold their tokens, seemingly hoping to encourage long-term participation and help stabilize the token’s value.</p>\n    <h2>Related Posts</h2>\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n    <h3>Get an edge in Crypto with our free daily newsletter</h3>\n    <p>Know what matters in Crypto and Web3 with The Defiant Daily newsletter, Mon to Fri</p>\n    <p>90k+ Defiers informed every day.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>As we start nearing the last quarter of 2025, nearly all crypto are getting ready for the final push of the year. SOL is coming in strong, while PI holders are anticipating a massive rally.</p><p>But while traders are glued to the latest Solana price prediction or looking at Pi Network news, one Ethereum L2 token is popping up on everyone’s list.</p><p>Layer Brett is an Ethereum Layer 2 token, merging the raw appeal of meme with the practicality of ETH and SOL, but it is faster and cheaper. The <a href=\"https://layerbrett.com/\">$LBRETT presale</a> is also attracting traders looking for hidden gems.</p><h2>Layer Brett: The Need for Speed</h2><p>Momentum around Layer Brett is building, and much of it comes down to what’s on offer for early participants. Right now, staking yields sit at almost 680% APY, though they decline as adoption grows. Those who move quickly secure the highest rewards, while hesitation cuts into potential gains.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://layerbrett.com/\">presale itself is attracting attention at $0.0058</a>, with traders pointing to the possibility of 5,000% returns if the project scales as expected. That entry point has made Layer Brett one of the most talked-about launches in recent weeks.</p><p>The broader market trend only strengthens the case. Analysts estimate that by 2027, Ethereum’s Layer 2s could be handling more than $10 trillion annually, making scalability and efficiency more vital than ever. Layer Brett’s promise of fast transactions (10,000 TPS), minimal fees ($0.001 average), and meme-powered community energy is well aligned with that growth.</p><p>To amplify exposure, the project has rolled out a $1 million giveaway, ensuring the presale keeps pulling in new eyes and engagement.</p><h2>Solana’s New Horizon</h2><p>SOL’s rapid ecosystem growth is solidifying its position as a top-tier blockchain. New upgrades, such as Alpenglow, are set to slash SOL transaction finality, while its expansion into key sectors like gaming and DePIN proves that SOL is far more than just a home for meme coins.</p><p>The market is taking notice. Despite a recent delay in the SEC’s decision on a spot Solana ETF, analysts are still forecasting an overwhelming probability of approval by the end of 2025. Solana price predictions say a powerful rally is imminent, targeting $300-$350 by, with some even seeing $500 if the bullish SOL momentum continues.</p><h2>PI’s Global Movement</h2><p>The latest Pi Network news shows a project that is strategically expanding its global reach. PI is opening up KYC services to users in new regions. With over 65 million users and a focus on real-world utility, Pi Network is poised to be one of the most significant digital currencies of our time.</p><p>The core team’s focus on building a robust ecosystem, including new apps and integrations, sets the stage for a powerful burst. The expected PI demand from its user base alone is expected to create a parabolic rally.</p><h2>Layer Brett Presale Ready To Do 50x</h2><p>Solana price predictions have never been better, and positive Pi Network news is fueling its momentum. Both SOL and PI trajectories are good.</p><p>However, as crypto traders demand faster services and lower fees, even SOL and PI blockchains are struggling. Layer Brett’s clever use of Ethereum L2 technology not only gives it the speed and efficiency to satisfy hungry traders, but also infuses meme with utility.</p><h6>With 5,000% gains expected, the <a href=\"https://layerbrett.com/\">$LBRETT presale at $0.0058</a> is being hailed as the perfect entry point.</h6>\n<h6>Discover More About Layer Brett ($LBRETT):</h6><p>Presale: <a href=\"https://layerbrett.com/\">LayerBrett | Fast &amp; Rewarding Layer 2 Blockchain</a></p><p>Telegram: <a href=\"https://t.me/layerbrett\">View @layerbrett</a></p><p>X: <a href=\"https://x.com/LayerBrett\">Layer Brett (@LayerBrett) / X</a></p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>This is a Press Release provided by a third party who is responsible for the content.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The crypto chessboard is getting a major shake-up, and while the usual suspects are making their moves, a few hidden pawns are preparing to become queens.</p>\n    <p>The crypto world is buzzing with talk that the XRP price could rally to new highs, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. A few select projects are showing signals that point to an absolute moonshot. We’re talking about a potential 50,000% profit for the truly daring. For traders with an appetite for serious gains, the classic XRP price surge might be just a prelude to something far more explosive.</p>\n    <h2>The Rise of a New Challenger: $LBRETT</h2>\n    <p>This new crypto is turning heads for all the right reasons. Layer Brett is not just another meme coin; it’s a game changer, proving that viral culture and real utility can, in fact, make for a killer combination. Its Ethereum L2 technology gives it serious DeFi firepower, making it faster and cheaper to use than many of its rivals. This potent mix is precisely why its presale is attracting traders from across the board. The <a href=\"https://layerbrett.com/\">$0.0058 presale price is a steal</a>, and with pundits whispering about expected 50,000% gains, it’s easy to see why.</p>\n    <h2>The Mainstream Giant’s Big Play</h2>\n    <p>XRP, the coin designed for lightning-fast cross-border payments, is showing signs of its long-awaited revival. Following its latest win in court, the XRP price has been on a slow but steady climb. Technical indicators are now screaming a bullish outlook for the token. The 50 EMA is currently sitting well below the current price, a textbook bullish signal. The MACD shows a strong upward trajectory, while the RSI is suggesting plenty of room to run before it’s overbought. A 500% rally from here would place the XRP price at an impressive level.</p>\n    <h2>Catching a Rocket: The Aster Opportunity</h2>\n    <p>Then there’s Aster (ASTER), a project with the kind of fundamental tech that could truly disrupt the space. While ASTER may seem modest, technicals on ASTER are off the charts, supporting a potential 50,000% gain. ASTER is currently trading above all key moving averages, with a MACD showing a clear upward trend.</p>\n    <h2>Layer Brett: The Token That’s Built to Break Records</h2>\n    <p>The Layer Brett phenomenon is real, thanks to its tech-backed meme at steeply discounted prices in presale. Its massive APY and practical utility have the presale selling out at a frantic pace.</p>\n    <p>Here’s the breakdown: $LBRETT is built on Layer 2 Ethereum for high-speed, low-cost transactions, secured by the most trusted smart contract blockchain. The presale of just <a href=\"https://layerbrett.com/\">$0.0058 per token</a> allows cheap entry. Backers can lock staking APY, which is around 680%. These rates are dropping quickly as more users join, causing traders to scramble to get in before the APY falls too low.</p>\n    <p>Oh, and there is a $1 million giveaway, too. Participation requires no KYC and gives full decentralization and self-custody.</p>\n    <p>Unlike typical meme coins, $LBRETT has real utility, offering genuine value in DeFi and Web3.</p>\n    <h2>A Crossroads in Crypto</h2>\n    <p>While the XRP price movements suggest a potentially strong rally, the real action is happening elsewhere. The market is drawn to projects with both innovation and outsized growth potential. XRP has its place, but projects like ASTER and $LBRETT are redefining what’s possible.</p>\n    <p>The appeal of $LBRETT and its Layer 2 functionalities is a testament to its expected growth. The project’s unique combination of a strong tech stack and a vibrant community makes it a standout contender for 50,000% gains.</p>\n    <p>Want 50,000% gains? <a href=\"https://layerbrett.com/\">Layer Brett presale</a> is your answer.</p>\n    <p>Discover More About Layer Brett ($LBRETT):</p>\n    <p>Presale: <a href=\"https://layerbrett.com/\">LayerBrett | Fast &amp; Rewarding Layer 2 Blockchain</a></p>\n    <p>Telegram: <a href=\"https://t.me/layerbrett\">View @layerbrett</a></p>\n    <p>X: <a href=\"https://x.com/LayerBrett\">Layer Brett (@LayerBrett) / X</a></p>\n    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>This is a Press Release provided by a third party who is responsible for the content.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><h2>Hype’s 120% Surge: What It Means for the Meme Coin Market</h2><p>The crypto market is roaring, and Hype is leading the charge with a 120% surge in just weeks, driven by viral trends and NFT collaborations. Investors are scrambling to catch the momentum, but this frenzy leaves questions about sustainability.</p><p>Meanwhile, Cardano continues its steady, research-backed rise, supporting over 1,000 dApps and deploying upgrades like the Vasil hard fork. Amid this contrast, <a href=\"https://www.moonshotmagax.com/\">MAGAX</a> emerges as a high-potential presale opportunity combining early-stage growth with solid governance.</p><h2>When Hype Outpaces Reality</h2><p>Hype’s explosive growth is undeniable. Its meteoric <a href=\"https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/25957201188978?utm\">rise of 120%</a> in under a month highlights the power of community-driven speculation and viral marketing. Short-term investors are attracted to the promise of rapid returns.</p><p>Yet the coin’s foundation is fragile. Without a robust technological framework, Hype’s value depends heavily on social trends and hype cycles. Volatility is high, and the risk of sharp pullbacks remains.</p><h2>Forget the Flash — Cardano Is Built to Last</h2><p>Cardano’s appeal lies in long-term sustainability. The platform supports <a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/0xbA6ef5916426AE9835AC0268C4165ef0b5BC7267/X1l1JvkbXeIYq37JnwaNhKh3tHmA4HSnEMqicpB1L-Q?\">more than 1,000 dApps</a>, from NFT marketplaces to DeFi protocols, and has achieved significant performance improvements through upgrades like Vasil.</p><p>Investors seeking stability see Cardano as a strong choice. Its methodical approach ensures fewer vulnerabilities and positions the blockchain for steady adoption, though short-term gains lag behind Hype’s explosive movements.</p><h2>MAGAX: Early Access Advantage</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.moonshotmagax.com/\">MAGAX</a> is not just another presale token—it combines community-driven growth with DAO governance, giving holders influence over major project decisions. This structured approach fosters sustainability while empowering participants.</p><p>Projections show that modest community adoption could propel MAGAX into 10–100× growth by the end of 2025. Early investors gain an advantage often missing in high-volatility tokens like Hype, making this presale a unique entry point.</p><h2>Technology and Innovation Comparison</h2><p>Cardano and MAGAX, however, offer technological credibility. Cardano is established, but MAGAX combines a growing ecosystem with innovative features and governance that actively involve the community, offering both stability and upside potential.</p><p>Moreover, by including <a href=\"https://magax-dev-public-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/pdfs/Rep.pdf\">CertiK-verified</a> security with community-driven governance, MAGAX aims to offer a safer and more transparent investment environment compared to many speculative meme coins.</p><h2>Why Moonshot MAGAX Is Built for Sustainable, Long-Term Growth</h2><p>Not all communities give investors the same level of influence. Here’s how MAGAX compares:</p><ul><li>Hype Token Communities: Large and vocal, but often speculative—holders have little control over project direction.</li><li>Cardano: Offers moderate community influence but remains primarily developer-driven, limiting direct governance participation.</li><li>MAGAX: Built on structured community governance, giving holders voting power and a real say in development decisions.</li><li>Investor Empowerment: This governance model enhances credibility, strengthens loyalty, and improves the chance of long-term, sustainable growth.</li></ul><p>In short, MAGAX doesn’t just ride community hype—it elevates investors into decision-makers, creating a deeper sense of ownership.</p><h2>Why the Next-Gen Meme Coin Is Redefining Crypto Growth</h2><p>Hype’s adoption is momentum-driven, relying on social media trends, NFT tie-ins, and influencer campaigns. Its short-term growth is impressive but lacks underlying infrastructure for long-term expansion.</p><p>Cardano continues to expand steadily in enterprise and dApp adoption, but MAGAX targets both momentum and sustainability. Its <a href=\"https://www.moonshotmagax.com/overview/details\">presale structure</a>, governance model, and early access incentives give it a unique position to capture market attention while remaining grounded in utility and strategic growth.</p><h2>MAGAX has Strategic Timing Advantage</h2><p>Timing is everything in crypto, and MAGAX leverages this with presale access before public release, giving early participants a potential edge. The window for securing positions is limited, and investors who act now may benefit disproportionately as the project scales.</p><p>Unlike Hype, which relies on reactionary trends, MAGAX is backed by structured planning, strong community involvement, and innovative technology, creating a more calculated path to growth. Early entry offers the dual benefit of strategic positioning and active participation in shaping the project’s trajectory via <a href=\"https://www.moonshotmagax.com/ecosystem\">meme-to-earn ecosystem.</a></p><h2>The New Market Dynamic: Why a Small Project is Stealing the Spotlight</h2><p>For those watching the crypto landscape, MAGAX presents a rare combination: early-stage growth, governance power, and structured innovation. Unlike Hype, it avoids pure speculation, and unlike Cardano, it offers presale upside potential.</p><p>Early participants can secure a strategic position in a project poised for massive growth, backed by a strong roadmap, community involvement, and technological credibility. In a market where timing is everything, MAGAX stands out as a chance to get ahead before the wider crypto world catches on.</p><h6>Don’t wait until the world catches up—<a href=\"https://www.moonshotmagax.com/\">buy MAGAX now</a> at $0.000293 and secure your position before Stage 3 begins.</h6>\n<p/><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>This is a Press Release provided by a third party who is responsible for the content.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The search for the best crypto to buy now has never been more intense, as meme coins continue to dictate market narratives in 2025. Shiba Inu and Pepe, once favorites in the sector, are now showing signs of fatigue. At the same time, <a href=\"https://littlepepe.com/?utm_source=Blockonomi&amp;utm_medium=Blockonomi20091\">Little Pepe (LILPEPE)</a> has emerged as a serious rival, with its presale already raising over $25,650,000.</p>\n    <p>LILPEPE presale is at stage 13 is now open. Stages 1–12 are already sold out, with $25,475,000 raised in those stages. Each token is currently priced at $0.0022 in stage 13, and stage 14 will open soon with a price increase to $0.0023. These milestones highlight how Little Pepe is rapidly building demand and setting itself apart as one of the best cryptos to buy now.</p>\n    <h2>Little Pepe Gaining Unstoppable Traction</h2>\n    <p>Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has finalized its audit by FreshCoins.io, earning a score of 81.55 out of 100 with no critical issues found. This confirms the project’s secure foundation, supported further by a Certik audit. The project has also been listed on CoinMarketCap, boosting visibility at a crucial moment. What sets LILPEPE apart is its Layer 2 chain dedicated solely to meme coins, where transactions are cheaper and faster than competitors. Additionally, the chain is designed to block sniper bots, which makes it more appealing for fair investors.</p>\n    <p>Moreover, LILPEPE is preparing to launch its own meme coin launchpad, a feature no rival project currently offers. Anonymous experts who have previously guided top meme tokens are backing its growth. To add to the excitement, the project has confirmed listings on two leading centralized exchanges at launch. It is also planning a future listing on the biggest exchange in the world. Such steps show the depth of preparation behind LILPEPE’s rise.</p>\n    <p>The presale hype is also being fueled by community-driven events. The $777,000 giveaway will reward 10 winners with $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens each. Alongside this, participants from stage 12 through stage 17 are competing for massive ETH prizes.</p>\n    <p>The biggest buyer will earn 5 ETH, the second-largest 3 ETH, and the third-largest 2 ETH, while 15 lucky buyers will receive 0.5 ETH each. Every holder automatically qualifies for the $777k giveaway, creating further incentives to join now.</p>\n    <p>Transitioning to broader trends, the “ChatGPT 5 Meme Coin Question Volume Trend (Jun–Aug 2025)” has revealed soaring interest in Little Pepe. Demand peaked near 100 in August, while Pepe and Dogecoin lingered between 40–70, and Shiba Inu stayed below 50. This data shows how Little Pepe has captured the spotlight, outpacing its competitors at the perfect time.</p>\n    <h2>Shiba Inu Holders Losing Faith</h2>\n    <p>Shiba Inu’s recent rally to $0.00001291 looked promising on the surface, but heavy selling has already shaken confidence. Long-term holders offloaded 906 billion SHIB, worth $11.6 million, into exchanges over five days. This activity has weakened trust in the token’s ability to sustain momentum.</p>\n    <p>While Shiba Inu has managed to touch a three-week high, its reliance on long-term holder support is now clear. If the current selling pressure continues, the support level at $0.00001285 may collapse, leaving prices vulnerable to $0.00001182. Even if a rebound pushes SHIB to $0.00001391, confidence among investors has already been dented. In 2025, when assessing what crypto to buy now, Shiba Inu no longer appears sustainable compared to stronger meme coin projects.</p>\n    <h2>Pepe Unable to Hold Ground</h2>\n    <p>Pepe has also faced difficulty sustaining value. A massive whale dump of 500 billion PEPE, worth about $4.8 million, dragged the price down to $0.0000094 last month. This put its $0.00001 support level in jeopardy, as daily active wallets fell below 3,000. Trading volumes have slowed, leaving experts warning of possible drops to $0.0000090 or even $0.0000085.</p>\n    <p>Even if a short-term bounce lifts Pepe to $0.0000115, the broader technical picture remains bearish. Moving averages continue pointing down, while the token struggles to remain relevant in the expanding meme coin sector. When compared with Little Pepe (LILPEPE), which is offering innovation and security, Pepe looks less like the best crypto to invest in and more like a project fading in importance.</p>\n    <h2>Why Little Pepe Stands Out</h2>\n    <p><a href=\"https://littlepepe.com/?utm_source=Blockonomi&amp;utm_medium=Blockonomi20091\">Little Pepe (LILPEPE)</a> has positioned itself as more than a speculative meme coin. Its audit results, exchange plans, and Layer 2 development show structured growth. The project has also shown strong presale momentum, raising over $25,650,000 as stage 13 continues. The presale design ensures early investors buy in at the lowest price, with each stage increasing in cost. A launch price prediction between $0.50 and $5 in 2025 has been discussed by market watchers, signaling the potential for enormous gains.</p>\n    <p>For anyone asking what is the best cryptocurrency to invest in during 2025, the answer lies in momentum, utility, and security. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has already checked these boxes. Shiba Inu and Pepe are struggling with confidence and technical weakness, while LILPEPE has surged ahead with innovation, listings, and a dedicated community. Investors now have clarity on the best crypto to buy.</p>\n    <p/>\n    <h6>For more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:</h6>\n    <p>Website:<a href=\"https://littlepepe.com/?utm_source=Blockonomi&amp;utm_medium=Blockonomi20091\"> https://littlepepe.com</a></p>\n    <p>Whitepaper:<a href=\"https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\"> https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf</a></p>\n    <p>Telegram:<a href=\"https://t.me/littlepepetoken\"> https://t.me/littlepepetoken</a></p>\n    <p>Twitter/X:<a href=\"https://x.com/littlepepetoken\"> https://x.com/littlepepetoken</a></p>\n    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>This is a Press Release provided by a third party who is responsible for the content.

    "body": "<p>Sir Keir Starmer is expected to announce the UK's recognition of a Palestinian state in a statement on Sunday afternoon.</p>\n<p>The move comes after the prime minister said in July the UK would shift its position in September unless Israel met conditions including agreeing to a ceasefire in Gaza and committing to a long-term sustainable peace deal that delivers a two-state solution.</p>\n<p>It represents a major change in British foreign policy after successive governments said recognition should come as part of a peace process and at a time of maximum impact.</p>\n<p>The move has drawn fierce criticism from the Israeli government, hostage families and some Conservatives.</p>\n<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu previously said such a move \"rewards terror\".</p>\n<p>However, UK ministers argue there was a moral responsibility to act to keep the hope of a long-term peace deal alive.</p>\n<p>Government sources said the situation on the ground had worsened significantly in the last few weeks. They cited images showing starvation and violence in Gaza, which the prime minister has previously described as \"intolerable\".</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y8l46m5evo\">Israel's latest ground operation in Gaza City,</a> described by a UN official as \"cataclysmic\", has forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee. </p>\n<p>Earlier this week, a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8641wv0n4go\">United Nations commision of inquiry concluded Israel had committed genocide </a>against Palestinians in Gaza, which Israel denounced as \"distorted and false\".</p>\n<p>Ministers also highlighted the continued expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, which are illegal under international law, as a key factor in the decision to recognise Palestinian statehood.</p>\n<p>Justice Secretary David Lammy, who was foreign secretary in July when the path to recognition was announced, cited the controversial E1 settlement project which critics warn would put an end to hopes for a viable, contiguous Palestinian state.</p>\n<p>He said: \"The recognition of a Palestinian state is as a consequence of the serious expansion that we're seeing in the West Bank, the settler violence that we're seeing in the West Bank, and the intention and indications that we're seeing to build for example the E1 development that would run a coach and horses through the possibility of a two-state solution.\"</p>\n<p>Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas welcomed the UK's recognition pledge when he visited Sir Keir earlier this month, with Downing Street saying both leaders had agreed Hamas had no role in future governance of Palestine.</p>\n<p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said she wanted to see a two-state solution in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>But writing in The Telegraph over the weekend, she said: \"It is obvious, and the US has been clear on this, that recognition of a Palestinian state at this time and without the release of the hostages, would be a reward for terrorism.\"</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in an open letter to Sir Keir on Saturday, family members of some of the hostages taken by Hamas urged the Prime Minister not to take the step until the remaining 48, of whom 20 are believed to still be alive, had been returned.</p>\n<p>The announcement of the forthcoming recognition had \"dramatically complicated efforts to bring home our loved ones\", they wrote. \"Hamas has already celebrated the UK's decision as a victory and reneged on a ceasefire deal.\"</p>\n<p>During a state visit to the UK this week, US President Donald Trump also said he disagreed with recognition.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpdjvn1eeplo\">Sir Keir had set a deadline of the UN General Assembly meeting,</a> which takes place this week, for Israel to take \"substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza, agree to a ceasefire and commit to a long-term, sustainable peace, reviving the prospect of a two-state solution\".</p>\n<p>Speaking in July, he said: \"I've always said we will recognise a Palestinian state as a contribution to a proper peace process, at the moment of maximum impact for the two-state solution.</p>\n<p>\"With that solution now under threat, this is the moment to act.\"</p>\n<p>A number of other countries including <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yek72jqk4o\">Portugal, </a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckg5g4p3245o\">France</a>, Canada and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg33351n61o\">Australia</a> have also said they will recognise a Palestinian state, while Spain, Ireland and Norway took the step last year.</p>\n<p>Palestine is currently recognised by around 75% of the UN's 193 member states, but has no internationally agreed boundaries, no capital and no army - making recognition largely symbolic.</p>\n<p>The two-state solution refers to the creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital. Israel currently occupies both the West Bank and Gaza, meaning the Palestinian Authority is not in full control of its land or people.</p>\n<p>Recognising a Palestinian state has long been a cause championed by many within the Labour Party. The PM has been under mounting pressure to take a tougher stance on Israel, particularly from MPs on the left of his party.</p>\n<p>Shortly before he gave his speech in July, more than half of Labour MPs signed a letter calling for the government to immediately recognise a Palestinian state.</p>\n<p>However, critics questioned why the government had appeared to put conditions on Israel but not on Hamas, when it set out its path to recognition.</p>\n<p>The Chief Rabbi, Sir Ephraim Mirvis, called on the government to pause its decision.</p>\n<p>\"The intended recognition is not contingent upon a functioning or democratic Palestinian government, nor even upon the most basic commitment to a peaceful future,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"Astonishingly, it is not even conditional upon the release of the 48 hostages who remain in captivity.\"</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Rest in peace, Matt.\"</p>\n    <p>After his reappointment in 2021, Beard led the Reds to promotion back to the WSL and helped them to a seventh-placed finish on their return to the top flight.</p>\n    <p>Beard also managed Liverpool during their first ever Champions League campaign.</p>\n    <p>His brother Mark paid tribute to the \"most amazing, caring man who was loved by anyone who had the pleasure to meet him\".</p>\n    <p>\"We will love you forever Matt Matt,\" he said in a social media post.</p>\n    <p>The Football Association called Beard a \"key figure\" in women's football, adding that its \"thoughts go out to his family and friends during this difficult time\".</p>\n    <p>The WSL posted a tribute on X, saying: \"Everyone at WSL Football extends its deepest sympathies to the family, friends and loved ones of Matt Beard following news of his passing.</p>\n    <p>\"Matt played an instrumental role in the growth of women's football and will be missed by everyone associated with the game.\"</p>\n    <p>Beard was appointed Burnley manager in June but resigned after just two months in charge.</p>\n    <p>He had previous spells at Millwall Lionesses, Chelsea, West Ham and National Women's Soccer League side Boston Breakers, as well as an interim period in charge of Bristol City.</p>\n    <p>The Clarets paid tribute, saying: \"The thoughts and prayers of everyone at the club are with Matt's family and friends.\"</p>\n    <p>Millwall Lionesses, where Beard started his managerial career, said in a statement: \"Everybody at the club is deeply saddened by the passing of former Lionesses manager, Matt Beard.</p>\n    <p>\"We send all our love and support to his family, friends and colleagues across the many clubs he managed at this very difficult time.\"</p>\n    <h2>'A character who lit up a room'</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1024/cpsprodpb/e924/live/47cdba10-966a-11f0-90f2-5f87cb020b24.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Beard\"/>\n    <p>Matt Beard was twice named WSL manager of the season</p>\n    <p>'Beardy', as he was known to those in the game, was an ever-present in the WSL and a character that lit up the room. He was funny, loud and straight to the point.</p>\n    <p>He was often likened to 'a giant teddy bear' - a loving man from London who gave out hugs to anyone and everyone in the stands - a contrast to the bellowing manager who shouted instructions to his players from the dugout.</p>\n    <p>Liverpool fans were particularly fond of him as he led the club to back-to-back WSL trophies and returned for a second spell, guiding them back to the top-flight with a Women's Championship title.</p>\n    <p>In the successes, he celebrated hard and happily, enjoying a pint (or two) with staff and supporters in the pub next to Prenton Park, where Liverpool Women used to play their home matches.</p>\n    <p>He invited those of us in the media to join him and discussed further his tactics or what luck was on his side, often teasing us on whether we had been too harsh in the match reports or in our questioning of him in the news conferences.</p>\n    <p>Away from the pitch, he was a family man and always spoke about his children, sometimes joking about how he was struggling to help his son with his maths homework.</p>\n    <p>He told me he wanted to start a podcast where he could discuss \"the real issues\" in women's football and what it was really like to be a football coach. He found a cheap deal on some recording equipment online and practised.</p>\n    <p>There were ups and downs in his football career but he always cared deeply for his players and the supporters. He will be remembered fondly in the game and the positive impact he had on the people he worked with will remain for a long time.</p>\n    <h2>Players pay tribute</h2>\n    <p>A number of players have taken to social media to pay their own tribute.</p>\n    <p><strong>Alessia Russo: </strong>\"Warmest guy with the biggest heart\"</p>\n    <p><strong>Toni Duggan: </strong>\"So very, very sad.

The underdogs trailed 7-5 at half-time but could easily have led as England errors gave them a wealth of possession and territory.</p>\n<p>The Red Roses improved after the interval, with a familiar driving maul delivering a try for hooker Amy Cokayne, before a short-range effort from Abbie Ward gave the hosts breathing space on the scoreboard.</p>\n<p>Kildunne, who had scampered in for the game's opening try after four minutes, then seized on Marine Menager's heavy attempt to control the ball with her foot and weaved through the remnants of the France defence to make it 28-12 with a little over 10 minutes to go.</p>\n<p>France centre Nassira Konde crossed for her second try to close the gap, but Meg Jones ensured England had the final say as she latched on to replacement Holly Aitchison's kick to dot down.</p>\n<p>The cheers that greeted Kildunne's player of the match award from the 25,478-strong crowd were just as loud.</p>\n<p>Canada, who outplayed defending champions New Zealand on Friday night, await in the 82,000 sell-out at Twickenham's Allianz Stadium next Saturday.</p>\n<p>Kildunne scores fantastic try to give England early lead</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Published2 hours ago</li>\n        </ul>\n<ul>\n          <li>Published3 hours ago</li>\n        </ul>\n<h2>England outlast France after nervy first half</h2>\n<p>'Kildunne is pretty special' - England coach reaction to reaching World Cup final</p>\n<p>Without a clutch of first-choice players missing through injury and suspension, France's odds had lengthened in the build-up.</p>\n<p>However, the visitors seemed to relish the chance to defy expectations.</p>\n<p>With Fabien Galthie, France's men's coach, backing them from the stands, a rousing rendition of La Marseillaise brought second row Hina Ikahehegi and several of her team-mates to tears.</p>\n<p>Kildunne killed some of that buzz inside the first five minutes. Showing no ill-effects from her lay-off, the full-back had already beaten three defenders on a jagging kick return, when she was sprung down the blindside a minute later.</p>\n<p>Quick hands from Cokayne, Alex Matthews, Ward and Hannah Botterman sent Kildunne down the touchline and her quick feet did the rest, burning Konde and cutting inside the covering Kelly Arbey.</p>\n<p>Hannah Botterman counted the number of turnovers she had secured in the match</p>\n<p>England were fortunate, however, that an apparent knock-on from Natasha Hunt at the base of the final ruck escaped the attention of the officials.</p>\n<p>With Jones and Botterman hoovering up penalties at the breakdown, Ward and Maud Muir putting the brakes on France's rolling maul and Cokyane waving off her opposite number after getting the better of a scrum, England were winning plenty of battles.</p>\n<p>But still the war turned against them as England's inaccuracy in attack kept France in the contest and their belief growing.</p>\n<p>Centre Konde dived over to cut the hosts' lead to 7-5 as England's goalline defence was finally stretched thin after Arbey's break down the opposite wing.</p>\n<p>A spill by Tatyana Heard meant England surrendered a fine attacking platform five out from the French line, but it was Les Bleues who had the better chance to add to the scoreline before the break.</p>\n<p>With Jess Breach in attendance, Menager just failed to get a pass away to Lea Champon with the line beckoning. The French captain then thought she had crossed herself shortly after, but Carla Arbez's mis-pass drifted forward en route.</p>\n<p>England's senior leaders, led by Jones, convened a hasty on-pitch conference at the half-time whistle.</p>\n<p>They used the break well. England emerged sharper for the second half. Abby Dow had already seen a try wiped off for a forward pass by Kildunne, shortly before a shock-and-awe line-out drive, powered by 10 of the team and covering 22m, ended with Cokayne dotting down.</p>\n<p>France, who fought back from 13 points down to win their quarter-final against Ireland last weekend, stuck in the fight longer than any of England's previous opponents in this World Cup.</p>\n<p>Arbey crossed after a series of short-range forward thrusts to cut the deficit back to 14-12, but Ward restored England's cushion, burrowing over after Dow had sat down Morgane Bourgeois.</p>\n<p>Ultimately England were always one step ahead in the second half, with their bench once again giving them the legs on their opponents in the final quarter.</p>\n<p>However, considering Canada's heroics in dumping out the Black Ferns, the Red Roses may need more next weekend.</p>\n<p>'All we've been dreaming of' - Kildunne</p>\n<h2>Line-ups</h2>\n<p><strong>England: </strong>Kildunne; Dow, Jones, Heard, Breach; Harrison, Hunt; Botterman, Cokayne, Muir, Talling, Ward, Aldcroft (capt), Kabeya, Matthews</p>\n<p><i>Replacements:</i> Atkin-Davies, Clifford, Bern, Galligan, Feaunati, L Packer, Aitchison, Rowland</p>\n<p><strong>France:</strong> Bourgeois; Arbey, Konde, Vernier, M Menager (capt); Arbez, Bourdon Sansus; Brosseau, Gerin, Bernadou, Fall Raclot, Ikahehegi, Squire, L Champon, T Feleu.</p>\n<p><i>Replacements: </i>Riffonneau, Deshaye, Khalfaoui, Maka, Okemba, A Chambon, Tuy, Boulard.</p>\n<p>England's Kildunne 'proved why she's world's best player'</p>\n<h2>Match officials</h2>\n<p><strong>Referee:</strong> Maggie Cogger-Orr (New Zealand)</p>\n<p><strong>Assistant referees:</strong> Clara Munarini (Italy) and Kat Roche (USA)</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>Being ignored is a nightmare for any politician.</p>\n<p>You don't win votes if no-one knows who you are. You don't get a tick in the box if the name on the ballot paper means nothing to the voter clutching their stubby pencil in the voting booth.</p>\n<p>In the last couple of years the Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Ed Davey, has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/videos/c4ngpj07rpjo\">bungee-jumped</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/videos/czrmg1vr3pno\">jet-skied</a>, and even ridden a hobby horse into the public's imagination in a way that helped his party to success in the general election, surpassing their own hopes.</p>\n<p>He proved there is wisdom in playing the clown in politics - if it gets you attention. But too much clowning around might not look so smart.</p>\n<p>And while the government is unpopular, and the Conservatives seem miles from any kind of recovery, the Lib Dems have not been the main beneficiaries from their mutual misery.</p>\n<p>As the Lib Dems gather in Bournemouth this weekend for their annual get together, there will be a certain amount of understandable jollity.</p>\n<p>That's not just because of the Lib Dems' traditional glee club, or the fact that political activists enjoy their conferences the way that many of us might enjoy a minibreak with mates. It's a different kind, with warm, not cold, wine, and earnest discussions in stifling rooms, rather than a walk on the beach or a lie-in, although the budget hotels and deep fear of rail replacement services to get there are the same.</p>\n<p>But the Lib Dems are broadly in a good place after the general election, and they had more <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/creqr4x18leo\">gains in council elections in May</a>. They have dozens of new MPs, and a rebooted team on their front bench.</p>\n<p>The question hanging over their conference in Bournemouth this weekend is expressed by one of their MPs: \"Where do we go now, to make sure it's not a false start?\"</p>\n<p>In other words – what next, where, and how? No doubt, there is opportunity for the Lib Dems.</p>\n<p>In the words of one party insider: \"What are a lot of Labour people talking about? Plotting against the leader. What are a lot of Tory people talking about? Plotting against the leader.\"</p>\n<p>The two big parties are both partly distracted by their own woes, which could provide the Lib Dems plenty of political space.</p>\n<p>Look at the numbers and the map. In the general election the Lib Dems swept up 60 seats from the Conservatives – nearly all in the South.</p>\n<p>The party relentlessly focused on places where they had a decent shot at winning, rather than run vigorous campaigns in every corner of the country. They were, as a result, only in second place in 27 seats.</p>\n<p>They were also predominantly in the south of England, and 20 were won by the Conservatives.</p>\n<p>So if you follow the logic, the obvious next tranche of seats and voters for the Lib Dems to target are Tory-held parts of the country, and Tory-leaning voters.</p>\n<p>\"Look at what's happening on the right, there's a ferocious split, and the Tories are crumbling,\" says one party figure excitedly.</p>\n<p>Another says: \"There is a continuing opportunity to drive down those centrist remainer Conservatives who are still left in that camp – where we were in second place, that is a serious opportunity.\"</p>\n<p>But the party is already looking at other seats where they were in third place last time round.</p>\n<p>One MP tells me: ''The conventional wisdom would be where we were second to the Tories, the natural ambition would be to take on all of those seats.</p>\n<p>\"But the interesting things come about in other parts of the country, we might be in third or fourth place but an insurgent Reform UK could completely change the race – the numbers and where we might have ambition might be very different.\"</p>\n<p>But how do you make the most of that chance?</p>\n<p>Polling by research group More in Common suggests the party should perhaps lay off the stunts.</p>\n<p>Data shared with me suggests most voters, even those who back the party, have had enough of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdjeepdl4l1o\">the water slides and wet suits</a>.</p>\n<p>Fresh polling, being published this weekend suggests three in five Britons (61%), think Sir Ed's campaign antics make the party look less serious, compared to 21% who believe they are a good way to grab attention.</p>\n<p>Even nearly half of Lib Dem backers, 47%, reckon the stunts aren't appropriate and make the party look less serious.</p>\n<p>And when it comes to what the party is all about, many voters aren't really that sure.</p>\n<p>When the pollsters asked people to express their opinion of the Lib Dems and the leader, the top phrase this time round was \"don't know\", even though \"good\" and \"nice\" were also common descriptions.</p>\n<p>Yet there seems zero chance Sir Ed is going to retire what one of his allies openly describes as his \"embarrassing dad\" stunts.</p>\n<p>Without question, that tactic grabbed attention in the general and council elections: \"He does these photo opportunities where he comes across as a slightly embarrassing dad, but he can do serious speeches about foreign affairs and care and hold his own – we are going to keep doing all of those things.\"</p>\n<p>The party is proud of what he and it has achieved in the last couple of years.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Forecasters expect the weather system to remain over open waters for the next several days. </p>\n    <p>Gabrielle is forecast to become a hurricane by late Saturday or Sunday, according to the Miami-based National Hurricane Center, and its center was expected to pass by Bermuda on Sunday night or Monday. No watches or warnings were in effect, however.</p>\n    <p>As of Saturday evening, Gabrielle was situated roughly 575 miles north-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands and nearly 580 miles southeast of Bermuda. It was tracking northwest at 10 mph, the hurricane center said, and maximum sustained winds of 65 mph.</p>\n    <p>Tropical-storm-force winds extended outward some 140 miles from Gabrielle's center, the hurricane center said.

The agency <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hurricane-names-list-2025-season/\">revised the outlook</a> slightly in August, predicting that the season would see 13 to 18 named storms, including five to nine hurricanes, two of which could be major.</p>\n    <p>Of the six named tropical storms that have developed this year before Gabrielle, only one, Chantal, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tropical-storm-chantal-forms-south-carolina-coast/\">made landfall</a> in the U.S.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

It does not apply to renewals or current visa holders, the official said.</p>\n    <p>This comes after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick had told reporters Friday that the fee was \"annual.\"</p>\n    <p>\"President Trump promised to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down wages,\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers told CBS News in a statement Saturday. \"It also gives certainty to American businesses who actually want to bring high-skilled workers to our great country but have been trampled on by abuses of the system.\"</p>\n    <p>The additional charge would impact employers including technology giants such as Amazon, IBM, Microsoft and Google, which have <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-h1b-work-visa-tesla-technology/\">relied on the program</a> to hire foreign workers. </p>\n    <p>The plan was <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-19/trump-to-add-new-100-000-fee-for-h-1b-visas-in-latest-crackdown?srnd=homepage-americas\">reported</a> earlier by Bloomberg News.</p>\n    <p>H-1B visas are already expensive, with the cost ranging from about $1,700 to $4,500, depending on whether the visa is expedited. The fees are typically considered a business expense for the employer.</p>\n    <p>The new fee comes amid a debate over the H-1B visa, which some critics say enables companies to hire foreign applicants at lower salaries than American workers. Some employers also award H-1Bs for entry-level roles rather than for senior positions with greater skill requirements, detractors of the program say.</p>\n    <p>Tech companies have been among the primary beneficiaries of the visa program. Amazon received the <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-h1b-work-visa-tesla-technology/\">most H1-B visas</a> of any business in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. This year, the online retailer remains the leading recipient of the visas, with more than 10,000 awarded, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple and Google.</p>\n    <p>\"This will ensure that the people they're bringing in are actually very highly skilled and that they're not replaceable by American workers. So it'll protect American workers, but ensure that companies have a pathway to hire truly extraordinary people and bring them to the United States,\" a White House aide said.</p>\n    <p>Still, Stuart Anderson, executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan research group, said the plan could backfire if it incentivizes U.S. companies to shift jobs overseas, especially in specialized areas like research and development.</p>\n    <p>\"The second impact will further decrease the number of international students who have an interest in coming to study in the U.S. If there's no opportunity work in the U.S., it's much less likely they'll enroll in U.S. programs,\" Anderson told CBS News.</p>\n    <p>Last year, the most popular type of job for H-1B visas was <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/h-1b-visa-technology-industry-elon-musk-donald-trump/\">software developer.</a> To receive an H-1B visa, which is awarded by lottery, an applicant needs to have at least a bachelor's degree in their field and have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company.</p>\n    <p>President Trump plans to order the Labor Secretary to start a new rule-making process that would update wage levels for the program, Bloomberg reported. Currently, U.S. companies must offer the prevailing wage or the actual wage of similarly qualified workers, whichever is higher, <a href=\"https://flag.dol.gov/programs/prevailingwages\">according</a> to the U.S. Department of Labor.</p>\n    <p>The program is capped at 65,000 new visas each year, although an additional 20,000 can be issued for employees with a master's degree or higher, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The cap and higher-degree exemption quota is already filled for fiscal year 2026, according to the USCIS.</p>\n    <p>The H-1B program is already the most restrictive visa program in the U.S., with about 20% of applications resulting in approved workers, according to a March <a href=\"https://nfap.com/studies/h-1b-is-the-most-restrictive-visa-category/\">study</a> from the nonpartisan National Foundation for American Policy. </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>— With reporting by Aaron Navarro.</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Gavin Newsom signed a series of bills in Los Angeles on Saturday, enhancing protections for residents as what he referred to as \"secret police\" continues to roam the streets for <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/immigration-crisis/\">ongoing immigration enforcement operations</a> at the direction of President Trump.</p>\n    <p>The<a href=\"https://x.com/CAgovernor/status/1969477585257316859\"> signing of five bills</a>, all aimed at curbing the reach of federal officers toward potentially vulnerable populations, came as Newsom was joined by several members of the California legislature, LA Mayor Karen Bass and Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent Alberto Carvalho.</p>\n    <p>The headliner of the bills was the No Secret Police Act (<a href=\"https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/governor-newsom-signs-senator-wieners-ban-extreme-masking-ice-other-law-enforcement\">SB 627</a>), which will ban federal and local law enforcement, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement, from wearing face coverings while on duty. It goes into effect on Jan. 1 of next year.</p>\n    <p>Officers must also be identifiable by name and badge number.</p>\n    <p>\"To ICE, [which is] unmasked. What are you afraid of,\" Newsom said on Saturday. \"You're gonna do enforcement? Provide an ID.\"</p>\n    <p>U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, a Trump appointee, said in a post to X that Newsom has \"no jurisdiction over the federal government,\" and that he must go through Congress to enact the law.</p>\n    <p>\"I've directed our federal agencies that the law signed today has no effect on our operations,\" Essayli said. \"Our agents will continue to protect their identities.\"</p>\n    <p>Sen. Scott Wiener, who represents San Francisco and penned the bill, called the presence of ICE in the state a \"terror campaign.\"</p>\n    <p>\"No one wants masked officers roaming their communities and kidnapping people with impunity,\" he said. \"As this authoritarian regime expands its reach into every aspect of daily life — including terrorizing people where they work, where they live, where they go to school, where they shop, where they seek health care — California will continue to stand for the rule of law and for basic freedoms.\"</p>\n    <p>The legislation comes after the <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-los-angeles-immigration-stops/\">Supreme Court ruled</a> that immigration enforcement stops in Los Angeles can continue without officers needing reasonable suspicion that a person may not be in the U.S. legally. The ruling allows officers to question and detain people based on their skin color, accents and languages spoken.</p>\n    <p>\"It's like a dystopian Sci-Fi movie,\" Newsom said. \"Unmarked cars. People in masks. People are quite literally disappearing. No due process … Immigrants have rights and we have the right to stand up and push back.\"</p>\n    <p>Other bills protect children from immigration enforcement operations while at school. Under SB 98, introduced by Sen. Sasha Renée Pérez of Pasadena, and Assembly Bill 49 by Al Muratsuchi of Torrance, families will need to be informed when officers arrive at their children's schools.</p>\n    <p>Student information and classrooms are also protected under these new laws.</p>\n    <p>Nonpublic areas of hospitals and emergency rooms are off-limits to officers who don't have judicial warrants or court orders.</p>\n    <p>Elected officials who spoke on Saturday viewed the bills as a resistance to \"authoritarian tendencies\" exhibited by the Trump administration.</p>\n    <p>\"I would characterize all of the bills as representative of legislative resistance,\" said Bass.</p>\n    <p>Mr. Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114690267066155731\">says the push to conduct immigration enforcement</a> is to \"reverse the tide of Mass Destruction Migration that has turned once Idyllic Towns into scenes of Third World Dystopia.\"</p>\n    <p>In a statement on Saturday, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called the new legislation \"despicable\" and a \"flagrant attempt to endanger our officers.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Sanctuary politicians' rhetoric comparing ICE to 'secret police' — likening them to the Gestapo—is diabolical,\" she said. \"The men and women at CBP, ICE, and all of our federal law enforcement agencies put their lives on the line every day to arrest violent criminal illegal aliens to protect and defend the lives of American citizens. Make no mistake, this type of rhetoric is contributing to the surge in assaults of officers through their repeated vilification and demonization.\"</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/09/19/violent-rioters-assault-law-enforcement-ice-broadview-processing-center-police\">According to the DHS</a>,  ICE enforcement officers are facing a more than 1000% increase in assaults against them.</p>\n    <p>A list of the signed laws on Saturday can be found below:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>SB 267</strong>: Bars local and federal law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings unless absolutely necessary</li>\n      <li><strong>SB 805</strong>: Requires law enforcement officials to identify themselves while conducting duties</li>\n      <li><strong>Assembly Bill 49</strong>: prohibits school officials and employees from allowing federal agents conducting immigration enforcement to enter school sites without a warrant, court order or judicial subpoena.</li>\n      <li><strong>Senate Bill 81</strong>: prohibits immigration enforcement officers from entering health facilities without a judicial warrant or court order.</li>\n      <li><strong>Senate Bill 98</strong>: requires schools to notify parents, teachers, administrators, and school personnel on the confirmed presence of immigration enforcement agents/activity on school campuses.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Martel, agriculture specialists initially flagged the traveler's belongings for prohibited plants, undeclared cigars, and other items. Inside a foil-wrapped duffel bag, officers uncovered bones, including part of a human skull, Martel said.</p>\n    <h2>Passenger told CBP human remains were for ritual use</h2>\n    <p>The passenger told officers the remains were intended for ritual use.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://x.com/DFOFlorida/status/1968677695765545443\">Photos shared by CBP</a> showed what looked like a skull and vertebrae partially wrapped in aluminum foil. Other images showed officers wearing gloves and inspecting luggage on a table, with the seized items laid out in evidence bags.</p>\n    <p>CBP said the bones posed serious health risks and were destroyed.</p>\n    <p>Martel emphasized that the case highlights the unpredictable nature of international travel inspections.</p>\n    <p>\"At CBP, we never know what baggage may hold, but smugglers should know we'll always have a bone to pick,\" he said in <a href=\"https://x.com/DFOFlorida/status/1968677695765545443\">a post on X</a>.</p>\n    <p>No further details were released about the passenger, including nationality or possible charges.</p>\n    <h2>CDC sets strict rules for transporting human remains</h2>\n    <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/importation/human-remains/index.html\">require specific documentation</a> when human remains are brought into the United States, depending on whether they are embalmed, cremated, or if the person died of an infectious disease. </p>\n    <p>In most cases, a death certificate stating the cause of death must accompany the remains, along with official export and import clearances.</p>\n    <p>When a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident dies abroad, next of kin are instructed to notify the U.S. State Department, which provides consular assistance around the clock. Consular officials help families obtain required paperwork, including death certificates, mortuary certificates, and permits, as well as coordinating transport with airlines and local authorities.</p>\n    <p>Federal rules also require that non-cremated remains be shipped in leak-proof containers to prevent the spread of potential pathogens. Even when infectious disease is not listed as the cause of death, public health agencies warn that blood and body fluids may still pose risks to handlers.</p>\n    <p>The CDC notes that cremated remains, embalmed bodies, and clean, dry bones can generally be imported without a permit. However, remains of individuals who died from infectious diseases, if not embalmed or cremated, fall under stricter regulations and may require a CDC import permit before entry.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Using the Civil Contingencies Act is one way of doing that.\"</p>\n    <p>The government has said it wants to end the use of asylum hotels by 2029 at the latest and is working to reduce the backlog of asylum claims.</p>\n    <p>At the end of June 2025, around 70,500 asylum cases were pending an initial decision, down from 134,000 at the end of June 2023, <a href=\"https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN01403/SN01403.pdf\">according to official statistics.</a></p>\n    <p>Smart said: \"We want to see Nightingale processing centres set up, increase the number of case workers processing those applications from 2,000 to 4,000, process those applications far more quickly.\"</p>\n    <p>She argued this was the \"right thing to do\" for asylum seekers living in hotels, communities hosting hotels, and taxpayers.</p>\n    <p>The party says it would also end the ban on asylum seekers working and get them out of hotels and into \"their own accommodation\", as part of a move to a more \"humane\" system.</p>\n    <p>The Liberal Democrats are focusing on law and order on the first day of their annual conference in Bournemouth.</p>\n    <p>The party is also calling for police desks to be opened in supermarkets, libraries and other public places to boost confidence in policing and make it easier for people to report crime and share information.</p>\n    <p>Smart told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that people \"don't see the police often enough\" and that it \"shouldn't be as hard as it is\" to give evidence.</p>\n    <p>In her conference speech, she said \"too many crimes go unreported and unsolved\" and her plan would bring police \"back into the heart of communities\", and make them more visible and accessible.</p>\n    <p>The Lib Dems have not specified exactly how many new counters should be opened, but its own \"police desk promise\", if it was in power, would see at least one counter opened in every local council area across England and Wales.</p>\n    <p>The party says the cost of the scheme would be covered by axing police and crime commissioners, which the party has previously estimated cost more than £100m in the four years to 2023 - cash it has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c87py17y572o\">also earmarked</a> for rural crime teams.</p>\n    <p>The Labour government has announced plans for PCC responsibilities to be taken on by a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn0xz4938z9o\">new wave of elected mayors</a> in the coming years.</p>\n    <h2>'Few people'</h2>\n    <p>The Lib Dems say the desks would not fulfil all the functions of police stations, but would allow members of the public to share information and report crime.</p>\n    <p>This would mean they have a more extensive role than engagement centres or pop-up desks typically used by neighbourhood police teams, which are sometimes set up in places such as libraries and community centres.</p>\n    <p>Some forces have also experimented with <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-68566622\">installing touch-screen terminals</a> in supermarkets in order to boost crime reporting rates.</p>\n    <p>Almost half of London's remaining station front counters are <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c784e76lj3yo\">set to close</a> in an attempt to save costs. The Metropolitan Police began closing front counters in 2013.</p>\n    <p>The capital's Labour mayor Sir Sadiq Khan had previously pledged to retain at least one 24-hour counter in each of the 32 boroughs.</p>\n    <p>But last week he said he had changed his mind, arguing counters were used by \"very few people\" and the £7m savings generated by the cuts would be better spent on an improved command and control centre.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox every day”.

They <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce834ynnlqgo\">did the same thing to the Education Authority chairman</a>, Mervyn Storey, last month.</p>\n    <h2>'Rooted in reality'</h2>\n    <p>Robinson expressed support for being part of Northern Ireland's devolved government, saying \"things happen\" when DUP ministers hold office.</p>\n    <p>\"Those who argue we would be better off with Starmer than with Stormont cannot point to a single area, or a single policy, where it would be better without devolution,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>The DUP leader also argued that his party stands for \"fairness\" and \"common sense\".</p>\n    <p>\"For policies rooted in reality, not in radical ideology,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>The DUP was previously the largest party in Northern Ireland at Stormont, Westminster and in local councils.</p>\n    <p>But it has been overtaken in recent elections by Sinn Féin, with the party last year taking up the first minister post in the Northern Ireland Executive for the first time.</p>\n    <h2>Analysis: DUP say 'Stormont not Starmer'</h2>\n    <p>\n      <strong>By Gareth Gordon, BBC News NI political correspondent</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Time after time, the same themes came up during the conference speeches.</p>\n    <p>Attacks on Sinn Féin. Check.</p>\n    <p>Attacks on the TUV and Alliance. Check.</p>\n    <p>The DUP was the party of \"common sense\". Check.</p>\n    <p>And devolution good, any other form of government bad.</p>\n    <p>Or as DUP figure after DUP figure put it \"Stormont not Starmer\".</p>\n    <p>That is aimed as those within and without.</p>\n    <p>There will be no repeat of the two-year Stormont boycott over the protocol which somehow takes the edge off the constant attacks on Sinn Féin.</p>\n    <p>There were also the usual calls for unionist unity to maximise unionist seats at the next assembly election in 2027.</p>\n    <p>Problem with that is one of the parties it is aimed at – the TUV – would happily bring Stormont down tomorrow, and that is the last thing on Robinson's agenda.</p>\n    <p>Read the live coverage of Robinson's speech <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c98lzejzq2pt\">here</a>.  </p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>South Carolina legislators are not getting paid for the rest of the year over a lawsuit about a recent pay raise</p>\n<p>ROCK HILL, S.C. -- South Carolina legislators have not been getting paid for months since a state senator sued over <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/pay-raise-legislators-south-carolina-general-assembly-92c685410e6be35f8f802959bd6dd117\">the first raise</a> in the General Assembly's compensation in three decades.</p>\n<p>The issue involves what lawmakers call “in-district compensation” which is money set aside for legislative duties but has few limits on how it can be spent. A line in the budget, passed by both chambers, increased that compensation from $1,000 a month to $2,500 a month for all 46 senators and 124 House members starting July 1.</p>\n<p>Republican state Sen. Wes Climer sued the state in June, saying the South Carolina constitution bans legislators from immediately increasing their pay. Instead, any raise has to wait until the next election.</p>\n<p>As it sorts through the lawsuit, the South Carolina Supreme Court handed down a decision in late June just before the extra pay kicked that <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/south-carolina-legislature-pay-raise-lawsuit-ae6e91640e3f80d6bccfb4fb55cbf702\">stopped not only the raise</a>, but the payment of $1,000 a month in the same budget line.</p>\n<p>The move took legislators by surprise. Some lawmakers said they have had to use their own private salaries for town halls, equipment needed to help constituents or common expenses to serve the public.</p>\n<p>Lawmakers won't get any more money for their General Assembly duties until the case is decided or when the 2026 session starts in January. Part-time legislators, who meet three days a week for about four months, will then get a lump sum of $10,400 to account for their $260 a day compensation.</p>\n<p>For Democratic state Rep. Hamilton Grant that means no town halls in his Columbia district nor framed resolutions unless he dips into his own wallet</p>\n<p>“Whether you’re a Republican or Democrat — as lawmakers we should not be coming out of pocket for expenses to take care of our constituents,” Grant said.</p>\n<p>Climer said he understands the difficulties lawmakers face having to use their own money, but the law is the law. For 250 years it's mostly been frowned on, if not illegal, for legislators to immediately raise their own pay, he said.</p>\n<p>While it might be an unpopular with fellow lawmakers, suing them was the only way to do the right thing, said Climer, whose lawyer is Dick Harpootlian, a former Democratic senator known for fighting what he saw as backroom deals.</p>\n<p>“This is the consequence of a poorly drafted proviso and bad intentions on the part of a handful of legislators who knew better,” Climer said.</p>\n<p>The in-district compensation raise <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/south-carolina-senate-legislators-pay-raise-7c2a3ec068c5316a019c529abd3358f9\">was first suggested</a> toward the end of the budget process by Republican Sen. Shane Martin. He spent about 30 seconds on the Senate floor saying the first raise in 30 years was needed because inflation and a world where there are more expenses means the amount was no longer adequate.</p>\n<p>The budget line passed easily and no senator challenged it for the remaining hours of debate. Stories <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/south-carolina-senate-legislators-pay-raise-7c2a3ec068c5316a019c529abd3358f9\">were in the news</a> the next day and opposition started to grow.</p>\n<p>A few weeks later, House and Senate budget negotiators agreed on the amount. Lawmakers like Climer continued to challenge the proposal, but to derail it would have required rejecting the entire spending plan.</p>\n<p>South Carolina already has some of the lowest compensated legislators in the country. Comparing pay is hard because it includes salary, expenses and mileage, but the combination of $22,400 for salary and in-district expenses is well below other states with part-time legislatures like Alabama and Tennessee, according to the <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/center-for-legislative-strengthening/legislative-compensation-overview\">National Conference of State Legislatures</a>.</p>\n<p>It is a lot more than the $100 a year plus mileage that New Hampshire lawmakers get, but well below California and New York, where being a legislator is considered a full-time job with a salary over $100,000 a year.</p>\n<p>Before the state Supreme Court stepped in, about 40 legislators in South Carolina refused to take the raise. All were Republicans.</p>\n<p>Both sides just finished submitting their legal briefs and the justices will hear the case Oct. 22.</p>\n<p>Lawyers who said the raise is illegal wrote “only action by this Court can vindicate our Constitution from the General Assembly’s open contempt.”</p>\n<p>Attorneys for the Senate replied “in Petitioners’ attempt to paint the General Assembly as morally challenged children who must be constantly monitored to keep their hands out of the proverbial cookie jar, they undermine the judgment of the South Carolina electorate and Petitioner Climer’s duly elected colleagues.”</p>\n<p>Grant, who is finishing his first year in the House, said doing his job as a lawmaker feels like a full-time position if he does it right. As a leader of a nonprofit, he said it also stretches his finances and he thinks low pay and weekday hours leaves anyone working a regular job, like a teacher or a factory worker, out of luck. Instead, the General Assembly ends up with a glut of lawyers and retirees.</p>\n<p>“I firmly believe that if compensation is raised, South Carolina will get better candidates running for office because they can now afford to bring their everyday South Carolina experience and issues that they see and face,\" Grant said.</p>\n<p>Climer said the legislators fighting the suit have their priorities out of place.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>It's dawn, the birds are chirping, and the mist is dissipating—revealing a sun that looks strangely like a crescent moon. That's the scene folks in <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/air-new-zealand-business-class-review\">New Zealand</a> will wake up to on the morning of September 22, 2025, when a partial solar eclipse coincides with sunrise. Up to 86% of the solar disk will be obscured depending on the viewing location, creating that unique crescent sunrise. This event is the final solar eclipse of the year—the next one will occur on Feb. 17, 2026. Below, everything to know about the partial solar eclipse of <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/september-2025-horoscope\">September 2025.</a></p>\n    <h2>What is a partial solar eclipse?</h2>\n    <p>A solar eclipse happens when the moon passes directly between Earth and the sun, casting a shadow onto our planet. During a <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/solar-eclipse-cruises-2026-complete-guide\">total solar eclipse</a>, the moon completely covers the sun and darkens the skies in the path of totality. But during a partial eclipse, the moon only blocks part of the solar surface. As such, the sun will appear as if a bite has been taken out of it.</p>\n    <p>While partial solar eclipses don’t produce the <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/total-solar-eclipse-buffalo-new-york-photo-essay\">eerie daytime darkness that total eclipses</a> are famous for, they can still be quite exciting to see—particularly when they coincide with sunrise or sunset, as is the case this month. The key is to don the appropriate eye protection so you can clearly see that crescent shape.</p>\n    <h2>When and where can I see the eclipse?</h2>\n    <p>Unfortunately, this eclipse will only be visible from a few populated areas. Maximum coverage will occur largely over the <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/best-places-to-go-in-australia-new-zealand-and-the-south-pacific-2025\">Southern Ocean between New Zealand and Antarctica,</a> as well as part of <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/an-arctic-dogsledder-takes-on-challenging-new-terrain-antarctica\">East Antarctica</a>. Substantial coverage will be visible across <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/in-lake-takapo-new-zealand-reconnecting-with-darkness-the-maori-way\">New Zealand</a>, some <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/australia-south-pacific-top-resorts\">South Pacific</a> nations, and more of Antarctica, while eastern <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/destinations/australia\">Australia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/reconnecting-with-my-best-friend-in-tasmania\">Tasmania</a> will catch only the tiniest bit of the show.</p>\n    <p>New Zealand is undoubtedly the standout destination for this eclipse (unless you happen to be <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/meet-the-chief-scientist-at-viking\">working in Antarctica</a>). Across the country, viewers will see the sun rise already partially eclipsed, with as much as 72% of the disk covered at maximum on the <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/kiwirail-new-zealands-south-island\">South Island</a> and up to 66% on the North Island.</p>\n    <p>As for timing, the eclipse begins at 17:29 UTC and ends at 21:53 UTC on September 21, with the maximum coverage lasting from 19:41 to 19:43 UTC. If you're within the path of the eclipse—you can check on sites like <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/solar/2025-september-21\">Time and Date</a> to see what's visible from your location—be sure to convert UTC to your local time. For the majority of destinations where the eclipse will be visible, this translates to the early morning of September 22.</p>\n    <h2>How can I watch the partial solar eclipse safely?</h2>\n    <p>Unlike <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/where-to-see-blood-moon-total-lunar-eclipse-september-2025\">lunar eclipses</a>, which you can view with the naked eye, solar eclipses require protective eyewear or specialized filters for binoculars and telescopes. Never look directly at the sun without certified solar eclipse glasses—ordinary sunglasses won't work. If you look directly at the sun without protection, you can permanently damage your vision. Alternatively, you use indirect viewing methods to see solar eclipses, such as a pinhole projector.</p>\n    <p>Since this eclipse occurs early in the morning, you'll want to have clear eastward views—coastal areas are ideal, since you'll watch the sun come up over the water. But you can also position yourself near open fields or on hilltops. And if you don't happen to be in the path of the partial solar eclipse, you can still enjoy the views via livestreams; <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/solar/2025-september-21\">Time and Date</a> will host one, for example.</p>\n    <h2>When is the next solar eclipse?</h2>\n    <p>The next solar eclipse will be an annular eclipse on Feb. 17, 2026. Annular eclipses are also known as \"ring of fire\" eclipses, as the moon is positioned in such a way that the sun's corona surrounds it like a bright ring. The annular eclipse will be visible in Antarctica, while a partial solar eclipse will be visible across <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/at-a-wellness-retreat-in-south-africa-learning-the-art-of-doing-less\">Southern Africa</a> and the southern tip of <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/best-places-to-go-in-central-and-south-america-2025\">South America</a>.</p>\n    <p>Following that eclipse will be a blockbuster show: a total solar eclipse on Aug. 12, 2026. Visible across <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/greenland-new-airport\">Greenland</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/best-hotels-in-iceland\">Iceland</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/best-hotels-in-spain\">Spain</a>, it’s set to be one of the longest total solar eclipses of the 21st century, with more than six minutes of totality in some locations.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>The Netherlands (or Holland, if you prefer) might just be twice the size of <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/best-airbnbs-in-new-jersey\">New Jersey</a>, but somehow stacks up more variety per square mile than most US states. There are polder farmlands drained by dykes, rolling hills in its far south, and more than 250 miles of wind-whipped dunes hemming its coast.</p>\n<p>Few of its 20 million annual visitors see beyond <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/the-best-hotels-in-amsterdam\">Amsterdam</a>'s canal belt, though. They shuffle through the <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/activities/amsterdam/rijksmuseum\">Rijksmuseum</a>, snap some pictures on a bridge, then roll their suitcases back to Schiphol or the Centraal Station, off to the next European capital. But they're missing out: Even within cycling range from Amsterdam, you'll find old-timey fishing villages and cheese markets where time has seemingly stood still. There are polder scenes, windmills and all, that seem to have been plucked straight out of a Vermeer painting, and come spring, technicolor fields carpeted in tulips.</p>\n<p>A solid train network makes pushing farther out just as painless. It takes just four hours to cross the entire country from north to south. That puts cities like Groningen and Haarlem, with crowd-less canal belts and histories as rich as Amsterdam's, within day-trip distance, but also helps you discover some of the country's wilder side: deer roaming in the pine forests of Hoge Veluwe, endless hiking trails through the De Biesbosch's tidal wetlands, or the Wadden Sea islands, where seals laze the day away on the beach. Below are 23 of Holland's highlights, one in almost every corner of the country (with hotel tips to boot) to add to your next Netherlands itinerary.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>This gallery has been updated with new information since its original publish date. Additional reporting by Katherine LaGrave and Caitlin Morton.</i>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>TPopova/Getty<h2>Zaandam</h2><p>Wrapped in the Dutch countryside within easy day-trip distance from Amsterdam, Zaandam once stood at the heart of the Dutch milling industry. Remnants of these glory days can be found at Zaanse Schans, a short drive north from downtown, where a stroll through its jumble of windmills and clapboard houses feels like stepping into a real-life version of an Old Masters painting. Downtown, the ubiquitous Zaan-style architecture has gotten a mind-bendingly modern makeover at the landmark Inntel Hotel (an Escher-esque mash-up of traditional Zaanse houses), and the Zaandam City Hall, which reinterprets the shapes of Zaanse houses into minimalist masterpieces.</p><strong>How to get there</strong>: Direct trains from Amsterdam bring you to Zaandam in 15 minutes.<strong>Where to stay</strong>: Right in Zaandam’s heart, the<a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/2KCmFSX1hptUdQRPBAwatmE6U3F8ghyKEiqemAgLienhVMBAAgVrv5JVWxFAjKiZoq2MAXkCcPiEBzScCyr1a238T52TaoUGm7WKbrHMJ13bdXdthMD459LVyU3pU41FYVhiUdZZvMNZbwhGymK5cHzT3j2BdWJzPXZG3Xas3VpuYEnZn2ogexDe8MrEMZDBChAeevHCyUudqb31EhQ5nhdxF3t2wTcguToMNJrzAmWnpHh2TYffH9BZNHvqZQB6y3xUC5RqbwLb1MmYh4dtKZaKae2tSqkWufgvLrXgyx21o2c9WyAZZGR5Ay49U27xDZ6BDWGdcFLVwAoZ2gv1aDAb8XA2V9cuhvtCT84NZGjsWPG7svyngJ9eXJA58n7DJ827qig5XXCWDEm9NpPw5bpXUxpgBXdviUWZDBtpZLN3yXHQax1iAP5gYQ4\">Inntel Hotel</a>, is hard to miss: its building is an eye-popping Jenga-stack of traditional Zaanse gabled houses. The suites, many with slanted ceilings and walls bedecked in black-and-white historic photographs, further hammer down the local touch.</li>\n      <li>Daniel Bosma/Getty<h2>Groningen</h2><p>For Dutch standards, the two-hour train ride to this northern city is a nearly impossible schlep, but the picturesque journey through rolling farmlands is well worth it. Criss-crossed with canals and dotted with monumental churches, Renaissance-era gardens, and warehouses dating back to the 16th century, Groningen is packed with history. But as one of the country’s main university towns, the city has a surprisingly forward-thinking nightlife scene too. Most of the action happens around</p><a href=\"https://www.visitgroningen.nl/nl/plekken/stad/grote-markt\">de Grote Markt</a>(Big Market) square, which hosts a lively fish and food market by day, and turns into a party hub after dark.<strong>How to get there</strong>: Trains from Amsterdam with a transfer in Utrecht or Almere bring you to Groningen in about two hours.<strong>Where to stay</strong>: A solid mainstay smack in the center of town, the<a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/4usQ6Put9VSSN73oXEtnLgEmM5uMbicURDLS8FyonjYV9wLxoALwjp3FGvYo1vG1iGiY8ES5NQSbwc5PudQLvY3SmGM8AkjyReeBDym8FhgfeMdp35QhKcFaXE5wdN6iW2aeiht5nPxErBkJZFLZnkCpQ9GmXCf4jgTHpDg2wZwubzAjijzzNoRV4NBdnEsB968LC8ndaeUjXxwqrjDAw712TXTGFM7x5juge2tn1agkzSgN6ehFAw8XyfnZJhMTPBDhg7oqUrsDtTPBhbUHWGJjvf2HuJ7KQ8drGvHpULiZvhTFeXAbGrt2hRXRc4vdVr2iUj6nC29GwHquFQ6FfAM746heF7igXzVnL4GXbCX9TxyWiiu9LSGMK8pUC2sMv9bp3RVq7uSsPgxQXbyrhqToSvP4x2abK31yXXwLHiEU5G5Us3gsZTSU\">Market Hotel</a>delivers smart rooms, a sprawling wellness center (welcome after a day around town) and a gorgeously atmospheric bistro-cafe at a perfectly reasonable price point.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

In 1837 Michigan became a state, and Colonel Peter VanEvery purchased a property on the banks of the Franklin River. In what was certainly a smart business move, he built a grist mill on the river, and all the farmers from the surrounding area came right to the mill to get their grain ground into flour. </p>\n<p>The mill was wheat-based until the early 1900s, when a flood damaged it and forced it to close. It was purchased in 1918 by Robert McKee and reopened as a cider mill, operating during the apple season. Since 1966 it has been owned and operated by the local Peltz family. </p>\n<p>The Franklin Cider Mill is an autumnal wonderland. The fresh-baked apple donuts and the cider itself are obviously main attractions, but there’s also a plentiful fall market open every day, with produce and gifts from the mill and across Michigan (including pumpkins and seasonal gourds) plus live music, face-painting, and hot dogs. </p>\n<p>The best part is the mill itself. Visitors can walk right inside the mill for a glimpse behind the scenes: Watch the massive waterwheel and the original 90-ton cider press work, and peek inside the kitchen to watch the cider getting bottled and the donuts being baked as well. Before the end of your visit, make sure to toss some breadcrumbs or donut bits to the very spoiled ducks that paddle up and down the water. </p>\n\n\n                \n            </div>\n\n              </div>",

From fragile, untouched ecosystems to familiar but unexplained occurrences in our own backyards, Untold Earth chases insight into natural phenomena through the voices of those who know them best.</span></em></p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Diane Davis: </strong>There’s no safe iceberg to be close to. They can turn, break, implode in a second with no warning.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Skipper Bob Bartlett: </strong>It’s a sense of awe, it’s a sense of fear.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Dr. Stephen Bruneau: </strong>It’s kind of like an asteroid or a meteor that we see coming towards us. We have a temperate climate, but we have an Arctic ocean. And we have these arctic visitors, which are seemingly so far out of place.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Diane: </strong>You can just look out your kitchen window and see an iceberg. We’re that lucky here.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Narrator: </strong>Icebergs are typically found in the world’s most remote, coldest, and dangerous seas. But each spring, along Newfoundland’s northeast coast, thanks to one singular geological phenomenon, something remarkable happens.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\">Hundreds of icebergs collide with everyday life. What are these icebergs doing here, and why is it imperative that we keep our eyes on them?</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Diane: </strong>There’s something about cresting a hill or coming around a corner, and all of a sudden realizing that there’s an iceberg in the community that is twice as tall as the church.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\">So that would be about a medium to small iceberg. That’s a large one out there.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\">The past two years we’ve had very few icebergs, and this year it has been wild. Our icebergs come from Greenland. It takes them two to three years to get here. And the path has become known as Iceberg Alley.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Dr. Bruneau: </strong>What is Iceberg Alley? It is a pretty narrow lane that icebergs come barreling down the coast seasonally here in Newfoundland and Labrador. And these are big buffalo. They might well average half a million tons each.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\">Icebergs are an artifact of continental glaciation. Glaciers creep their way towards the waterline to the ocean, and large chunks of ice break off. We could go out and find an iceberg that is from ice that’s 10,000 years old.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Bob: </strong>There’s a lot of life associated with these icebergs. There’s a lot of krill that’s generated from sea ice and icebergs. There will be a lot of fish that gather around icebergs.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Diane: </strong>Icebergs in the spring bring us seals and many more polar bears. Because polar bears travel on the ice after the seals.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Bob: </strong>You get waterfowl as well, and I know in particular sometimes you get snowy owls on them. Because they’ll follow with the sea ice and they’ll basically make the icebergs their home.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Diane: </strong>Icebergs can be dangerous in a number of ways. Historically we know that over 100 years ago the Titanic sank off Newfoundland, southeast of St. John. So that iceberg made the full circuit from Greenland around Iceberg Alley and all the way down.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Dr. Bruneau: </strong>That incident precipitated the creation of the International Ice Patrol. Each year a specially equipped Hercules aircraft flies out and does a lawnmower type pattern of surveillance to determine what is the boundary for safe passage.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Bob: </strong>Icebergs damage nets. They destroy fishing gear. I started off doing whale watching tours. Now the industry has changed completely. Icebergs are a prominent feature of our tourism industry.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\">We’re getting ready to go. We’re going to get everybody to load onto the boats. We’ll go down this ladder right here. For posterity’s sake.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\">And what particularly holds icebergs in this area—there’s a lot of deep water channels with shallow shelves. They are nine tenths below the surface, one tenth above. And once they get in there, if the currents don’t change, they’re basically locked in position. Each one is unique. They’re all different sizes.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Diane: </strong>A tabular iceberg is like a table. It’s flat. There are pinnacle icebergs that are pointed like cathedrals and things like that. The rounded ones are often shaped by the waves because they’ve had water wash over them.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Dr. Bruneau: </strong>The most beautiful, I think, perhaps a dry dock type iceberg, as its name would imply, has almost a shallower area like a bowl.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Bob: </strong>You can see in the center there, this would be called a pinnacled iceberg. It has a nice peak on it. It is also a dry dock. You can see that some parts have broken off. You’ve got some huge chunks of ice over here.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Dr. Bruneau: </strong>One of the things that becomes more evident when bergs get close is just how different the ice appears to be. The glistening ice surface with water melting on it just makes it look almost artificial or plastic.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Bob: </strong>I’d say we’re just going to go past the debris field. This is all founder from underneath, actually. So you have to be really careful with the ice chunks.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Dr. Bruneau: </strong>It’s like an ocean full of seltzer. The bubbles that are in the ice are really trapped air from the successive snowfall before the industrial age.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Diane: </strong>Newfoundlanders like to collect clean iceberg ice from the ocean with a dip net. They’ll scoop it up and they enjoy it in a cold drink.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

It served generations of children whose families worked in the island’s conservation, marine science, and tourism industries.</p>\n<p>Before the schoolhouse opened in 1987, children in Two Harbors faced a grueling daily commute, boarding a boat at sunrise, hiking up a hill, and taking a bus to reach Catalina’s only other public school in Avalon. The perilous journey, coupled with a near-tragic accident where a young student fell overboard, led local families to demand a school of their own. With the help of community members, boaters, and donors, the Little Red Schoolhouse was built, complete with a brass bell and a single teacher overseeing multiple grade levels.</p>\n<p>Despite its charm, the school constantly struggled with low enrollment, at times serving as few as three students. In 2005, it nearly shut down, but locals and yachters raised $100,000 to keep it running. For years, it remained one of California’s last true one-room schoolhouses, with older students helping teach younger ones, much like in the pioneer days.</p>\n<p>However, by 2014, enrollment had dwindled below the district’s required minimum, and the school was forced to close. Today, the schoolhouse still stands on Two Harbors Road, its red walls weathered by sea air, its windows now silent. It remains a poignant reminder of the island’s fading small-town life, waiting for the day when enough children return to ring its bell once more.</p>\n\n\n                \n            </div>\n\n              </div>",

    "body": "<p>An insider guide to a break in Yorkshire, from wild moors and rolling dales to local breweries and beautiful beaches</p>\n<p>It would be a cheap shot to say <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/yorkshire/\">Yorkshire</a> is England’s best county simply because it’s the largest. The latter is obviously true but what makes it such a cracking place to spend a weekend (preferably longer) is the variety. Take the scenery; not one but two National Parks: the sheep-and-dry-stone-wall-dotted Dales and the wild and horizon-stretching North York Moors. Plus, a swathe of beaches, breezy clifftop walks, thrilling waterfalls (including England’s highest single-drop waterfall) and weirdly wonderful rock formations that pop up out of nowhere. </p>\n<p>It’s not all for the hearty action-seeker though. There are sumptuous stately homes, romantically ruined abbeys, steam railways and world-class art from Salts Mill’s collection of David Hockney to the 500-acre Yorkshire Sculpture Park. Market towns still hold markets, cities buzz with shops, music and theatres (Leeds, for one), there’s the occasional slice of posh (Harrogate, for example), and you'd be hard-pushed to find a village without a pub.</p>\n<p>But, of course, it’s the people that make a place. Direct, maybe, but always big-hearted, keen to crack a joke and proud to share their beautiful county with others.</p>\n<p>For further inspiration, see our guides to the best <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/yorkshire/hotels/\">hotels</a>, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/yorkshire/articles/yorkshire-nightlife/\">pubs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/yorkshire/articles/yorkshire-beaches/\">beaches</a>, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/yorkshire/articles/yorkshire-restaurants/\">restaurants</a> and <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/yorkshire/articles/yorkshire-attractions/\">things to do</a> in Yorkshire. If you're planning a city break, see our guide to the perfect <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/yorkshire/york/articles/york-travel-guide/\">weekend in York here</a>. </p>\n<h2>In this guide:</h2>\n<h2>How to spend a weekend</h2>\n<p><a href=\"\">A weekend in Yorkshire presents a dilemma: it’s a huge county with almost too much choice. But the Yorkshire Dales possibly has the edge; each valley has a different character, plus there are well-resourced towns and villages if a wet-weather or shopping fix is required. </a></p>\n<p>Base yourself in Burnsall, in Wharfedale, sitting on a curve of the river and with a choice of the riverside <a href=\"https://redlion.co.uk/\">Red Lion</a> (from £130) or, for valley views, <a href=\"https://boltonabbeyescapes.co.uk/fell-hotel/\">The Fell Hotel</a> (from £154). Explore the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/yorkshire/articles/yorkshire-attractions/\">Bolton Abbey Estate</a> five miles downriver with its 12th-century church ruins, stepping-stones, paddling and bosky walks to the Strid where the river squeezes through a rocky chasm. Dog-friendly Cavendish Pavilion, with an outside terrace, is a good lunch spot.</p>\n<p>Afterwards, drive to <a href=\"https://www.yorkshiredales.org.uk/places/malham_cove/\">Malham Cove</a> in Malhamdale, a spectacular 230-foot (70m) limestone cliff, the result of glacial action. If feeling energetic, extend the walk past Janet’s Foss waterfall, up the rocky Gordale Scar onto Malham Moor’s limestone pavement and back to the Cove. Enjoy an early supper at the <a href=\"https://listerarms.co.uk/\">Lister Arms</a> overlooking the village green.</p>\n<p>The next day, take the scenic drive up Wharfedale, perhaps stopping at Grassington (location for much of Channel 5's All Creatures Great and Small) or for home-baking at <a href=\"https://www.theoldschooltearoom.com/\">The Old School Room Tea Room</a> in Hebden. Look out for the overhang of Kilnsey Crag where rock-climbers hang like spiders before enjoying views of Buckden Pike where the road climbs over into Wensleydale. Hardraw Force, on the outskirts of <a href=\"https://www.yorkshiredales.org.uk/places-to-go/welcome-to-hawes/\">Hawes</a> is England’s highest single-drop waterfall while the town, with its <a href=\"https://www.dalescountrysidemuseum.org.uk/\">museum</a>, is a good spot for presents including the valley's eponymous cheese. Watch it being made before a cheesy blow-out in its café.</p>\n<p>On the drive back, enjoy a drink at the riverside <a href=\"https://www.thegeorge-inn.co.uk/\">George</a> in Hubberholme and an early supper at <a href=\"https://www.bestpubinthedales.co.uk/\">The White Lion</a> in nearby Cray. Prefer fine dining? Head back to Bolton Abbey and <a href=\"https://thedevonshirearms.co.uk/\">The Devonshire Arms</a>. Find more of the best restaurants in the area in <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/yorkshire/articles/yorkshire-restaurants/\">our guide</a>.</p>\n<h2>How to spend a week</h2>\n<p><a href=\"\">After a couple of days in the soft green dales, move east to the wilder expanses of the North York Moors, but take your time. Either detour south to wander the glories of the </a><a href=\"https://ysp.org.uk/\">Yorkshire Sculpture Park</a>, near Wakefield, from monumental Sean Henry to the curves of Henry Moore. Alternatively, dally in Harrogate with its Pump Room Museum, antique shops and indulgent <a href=\"https://www.bettys.co.uk/cafe-tea-rooms/our-locations/bettys-harrogate\">Betty’s café tea rooms</a>.</p>\n<p>Motor on to Helmsley, on the southern edge of the moors; options include the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/yorkshire/north/helmsley/hotels/the-black-swan-hotel/\">Black Swan</a> overlooking the Market Place (from £104) or <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/yorkshire/north/helmsley/hotels/Feversham-Arms-Hotel-and-Verbena-Spa/\">The Feversham Arms</a> with its spa (from £179). Stride out on a walk on the moors perhaps out of Rosedale Abbey to Lastingham, or around the amphitheatre of the Hole of Horcum. On the way back, call at the <a href=\"http://www.newinncropton.co.uk/\">New Inn</a> at Cropton for a well-deserved pint from its microbrewery.</p>\n<p>For a less energetic option, take a steam-train ride on the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/yorkshire/articles/yorkshire-attractions/\">North Yorkshire Moors Railway</a> from Pickering to Whitby. Hop off at Goathland for a pint in the pocket-sized <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100057231117244\">Birch Hall</a> Inn at Beck Hole. Finish the perfect day with dinner at Michelin-starred <a href=\"http://www.thestaratharome.co.uk/\">The Star Inn</a> at Harome, two miles from your hotel.</p>\n<p>The following day, potter around the town with its 12th-century <a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/helmsley-castle/\">Helmsley Castle</a>, Walled Garden (with Vine House Café), independent shops and, just outside, the romantic ruins of <a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/rievaulx-abbey/\">Rievaulx Abbey</a> before driving 30 minutes south to Malton, the self-styled ‘food capital of Yorkshire’ for lunch. You’ll need the energy as you’re now heading to the showstopper <a href=\"https://www.castlehoward.co.uk/\">Castle Howard</a> with its Baroque and Palladian flourishes, lavish furnishings and 1000-acre parkland dotted with follies.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

You can actually stay in one at the all-inclusive, adults-only Sandals Royal Caribbean in Montego Bay, Jamaica. Not only do you get that dreamy overwater bungalow, but the bungalows are actually built into the shape of a heart on a private island off the main resort.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, guests can enjoy food ranging from Thai to French to Indian to Caribbean at nine different restaurants on the property, as well as premium liquor at most of the on-site bars. Add that to top-notch pools, water and land activities like land chess and volleyball, live entertainment, and the option to get PADI scuba certified.

Want a little more excitement? Why not join a cattle drive to learn the true art of the cowboy or take to the adventure course for a ropes course challenge?</p>\n<p>Food is as diverse as the activities, with a focus on elevated ranch cuisine served in a number of beautiful spots.

In its most recent waste report, recycling stood at 77 per cent, plastic bottles have been eliminated and food waste per cover has been more than halved.</p>\n    <p>Beyond operations, the hotel supports local suppliers, invests in young people and drives conservation projects – from rainwater harvesting to providing a nesting site for Cornish choughs, and has introduced a lobster release scheme with the National Lobster Hatchery.</p>\n    <p>Veryan Palmer, family director at <a href=\"https://boutiquehotelnews.com/?s=The+Headland\">The Headland</a>, said: “We are absolutely thrilled to have our sustainability efforts recognised by EarthCheck. As a team, we have put a huge amount of work into ensuring The Headland is a place we can be proud of when it comes to taking care of the environment for future generations so achieving the Silver certification is a great way to celebrate that.”</p>\n    <p>Bethany Branigan, sustainability lead at <a href=\"https://boutiquehotelnews.com/?s=The+Headland\">The Headland</a>, added: “In just two years since partnering with EarthCheck, we have come a very long way and this latest achievement means a huge amount for the work that has been done in that time. We are so determined to keep improving and innovating to make a tangible difference to our business and its impact on the planet, we are really excited for the future and how we can keep growing.”</p>\n    <p>André Russ, <a href=\"https://boutiquehotelnews.com/?s=EarthCheck\">EarthCheck</a> vice president – business development and sales, said: “The Headland has shown outstanding leadership by putting sustainability at the heart of how they operate. With EarthCheck Certification, their efforts are independently recognised. By measuring their footprint, putting plans into action, and delivering results such as cutting waste and saving energy, this much-loved Cornish hotel is showing how hospitality can protect the environment and support people while ensuring its legacy for future generations.”</p>\n    <h5>Highlights:</h5>\n    <p>• The Headland Hotel in Cornwall has earned EarthCheck Silver certification,</p>\n    <p>• Energy use per guest night is down 4.5 per cent, and 95 per cent of lighting is now LED.</p>\n    <p>• The hotel has cut water consumption by five per cent and recycles 77 per cent of its waste, with food waste per cover halved.</p>\n    <p>• Conservation projects include rainwater harvesting, chough nesting, and a lobster release scheme.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>The first thing you’ll notice on your way into Marquette, Michigan, is the forest. Miles and miles of thick, verdant forests surround the city on three sides, and they’re crisscrossed and shot through with hundreds of miles of trails to explore. On the east side, Lake Superior provides a watery playground for a variety of outdoor activities, while Marquette at large is a veritable paradise for outdoor enthusiasts. With a history rich in iron ore and the machines made from it, Marquette was forged in iron and tempered by the lake.</p>\n<p>Its location on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, only 82 miles from the Canadian border, provides Marquette with a snowy winter and a warm summer, and the city has activities to correspond with each. In winter, you have skiing (both cross-country and downhill), fat biking, and snowshoeing. When the weather is nicer, these same trails can be enjoyed on a mountain bike, with your running shoes, or to watch the birds or seek out waterfalls. There’s even climbing to be done, on either winter ice or summer rock.</p>\n<p>The people of Marquette know how to throw a party — particularly if the kind of party you enjoy starts with some monstrous endurance event, like a 48-mile mountain bike race or a 50-mile ultra-running race, and ends with live music, good food, and locally brewed beer. The area hosts many exciting events throughout the year that take advantage of the extensive trail system. And, for when you’ve finished your romp through the woods, Marquette has at least six brewpubs — and a distillery — within the city, and several more in nearby towns. Marquette also has the Downtown Social District, a designated area encompassing the two main entertainment streets where it’s legal to bring your drink out of the bar or restaurant.</p>\n<p>Photo: Craig Benson</p>\n<p>My visit to Marquette coincided with the Honor Credit Union Ore to Shore Mountain Bike Epic. Ore to Shore has six separate races, from a 0.5-mile kids’ race up to the big 48-mile Hard Rock. It’s practically a whole festival, and there’s even a family competition that combines results from different races and age groups and comes with an actual cash prize for the fastest family. This year, the 26th running of the race had over 2,500 total competitors and was supported by extensive involvement from the local community. In addition to the public trails and roads, the routes traverse 60 privately owned lands, with permission from all landowners. Over 400 volunteers from local communities ensure a smooth event, and partner organizations, like Start the Chain and Noquemanon Trail Network, provide finish line services.</p>\n<p>I didn’t get to race, but I definitely had FOMO when I saw the camaraderie and fun the racers were having. I caught the exciting start of the 48-mile Hard Rock in the historic mining town of Negaunee and then made my way to the Forestville railroad crossing aid station, where I was just in time to cheer for the intrepid tail end of the 28-mile Soft Rock race. The small lead pack of elites for the Hard Rock came through so fast that I couldn’t even get my camera out in time. Finally, I ended up at the big party that was the finish area.</p>\n<p>I’d suggest that the best way to visit Marquette is to pick one of the big races or festivals and plan your vacation around the event. Watch the regional elite athletes compete, or compete yourself, and spend the rest of the week exploring the area with your chosen sport. Or if you’re like me, mix it up and do all the sports.</p>\n<h2>Things to do in Marquette</h2>\n<h3>Take a historical lighthouse tour</h3>\n<p>Photos: Craig Benson and <a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/marquette-harbor-lighthouse-catwalk-on-sunny-1494855065\">Craig Sterken</a>/Shutterstock</p>\n<p>The Marquette Maritime Museum is housed in an old city waterworks building and is full of information about the long history of shipwrecks on Lake Superior and corresponding lifesaving innovations. A couple of highlights for me were hearing a recording of the last radio transmission made by the captain of the <i>Edmund Fitzgerald</i> (the largest and most famous ship to sink in the Great Lakes) and looking out over Marquette Bay with a periscope.</p>\n<p>The lighthouse tour begins and ends in front of the museum. It takes you on a short walk, past the Coast Guard station, the lifesavers’ barracks next door, and into the lighthouse. You’ll learn about the history of lifesaving in Marquette, who really invented the first outboard motor, the foghorns that were surreptitiously blown up by the coast guard (thereby raining bricks all over the town), and, of course, the lighthouse itself.</p>\n<p><strong> Marquette Maritime Museum:</strong> 300 N. Lakeshore Blvd, Marquette, MI 49855</p>\n<h3>Visit the Marquette Regional History Center</h3>\n<p>Photo: Craig Benson</p>\n<p>Modern-day Marquette history — that’s to say Western European history — begins around 1844 with the discovery of iron ore deposits, which are still mined to this day. The area is known as Gichi-namebini Ziibing by the Anishinaabe Council of Three Fires, a confederacy of three Indigenous tribes: Ojibwe (or Chippewa), Odawa (or Ottawa), and Potawatomi. All of this you can learn in the extensive exhibits of the Marquette Regional History Center.</p>\n<p><strong> Marquette Regional History Center:</strong> 145 W.

    "body": "<p>I’ve wanted to visit <a href=\"https://matadornetwork.com/trips/travel-guide-bryce-canyon-national-park-utah/\">Bryce Canyon National Park</a> for over a decade. Overshadowing its existence, however, are the ethereal landscapes found within Zion National Park, which happens to be the most visited of Utah’s “Mighty Five” national parks, attracting close to five million visitors annually. I’ve been there twice and plan to return at some point, but Bryce Canyon has remained in the back of my mind.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://matadornetwork.com/author/melissamahoney/\">Melissa Mahoney</a>Sep 19, 2025</p>\n<p>Recently, a friend of mine went on a national parks tour, and I found myself looking longingly at her social media posts, wishing that I, too, could be there. And then the opportunity came. When I was offered a spot on a hosted trip to two glampgrounds in <a href=\"https://matadornetwork.com/read/bryce-canyon-country-guide/\">Bryce Canyon Country</a>, I couldn’t say no. So, I found myself on a bucket-list adventure, discovering a new-to-me national park while staying in rather luxurious accommodations. </p>\n<p>Photo: Melissa Mahoney</p>\n<p>After spending four nights and five days in Bryce Canyon Country, I realized that it’s so much more than Bryce Canyon National Park. It’s also home to numerous charming small towns that people often drive right through without stopping, the 1.9-million-acre Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument that’s overseen by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and Escalante Petrified Forest State Park for an outdoor geological history lesson.</p>\n<p>With so much unspoiled and protected land featuring natural wonders from hoodoos and badlands to cliffs and slot canyons, this region is ripe with adventure. And these two distinctly different glampgrounds make perfect base camps for exploring in Utah’s Bryce Canyon Country.</p>\n<h2>For tiny homes with big comfort: Escalante Escapes</h2>\n<p>Photo: Melissa Mahoney</p>\n<p>After landing at Salt Lake City International Airport (SLC) and meeting my group, we embarked on a five-hour ride in a Sprinter van through <a href=\"https://www.southwestadventuretours.com/\">Southwest Adventure Tours</a> to the glamping destination where we’d spend the first two nights of our Bryce Canyon Country journey. As we traveled through Salt Lake City, commercial buildings and overpasses gave way to mountains and desert. While the journey was long, it was never boring, but by the time we arrived at <a href=\"https://escalanteescapes.com/\">Escalante Escapes</a>, we were ready to settle in.</p>\n<p>We pulled off the main road onto a dirt road that leads to a quiet parcel of land with mountain views and a few residential homes. On the property are nine tiny homes, which became our homes for the next two nights. A code was emailed for contactless check-in, and off we went to our separate accommodations at the adorable boutique glampground.</p>\n<p>As I entered the space of my tiny home, named Moon Lily, I was struck by how roomy the 400-square-foot abode felt, most likely because of the high ceilings and how the space was used. The main room features a living room area with a pull-out couch, a TV, and a small yet fully equipped kitchen, complete with a full-sized fridge with a freezer, a dishwasher, and utensils, pots, and pans.</p>\n<p>Photos: Melissa Mahoney</p>\n<p>Off the open-concept kitchen and living room area was a tiny room with a set of bunk beds. Since it was just me, I set my carry-on suitcase on the bottom bunk to organize my clothing. A full bathroom featuring a shower, toilet, and sink was in the room next door. I also discovered a surprise luxury item that I rarely see in even the nicest hotels: a washer and dryer. It made me so happy to know that I could wash my clothing after the planned hike in the heat the following day. Finishing the tiny home tour at Escalante Escapes was the primary bedroom with a queen-sized bed (quite comfortable, I must say) and a flat-screen TV.</p>\n<p>While there are no amenities to speak of aside from what’s in your tiny home, along with a small deck and personal fire pit just outside, that gives guests a chance to not be bothered by anything but the sounds of nature. There is strong WiFi, and the peaceful nature of the Escalante Escapes’ property can certainly help get you into a solid work flow, but you may choose instead to disconnect, make yourself a cup of tea, and take in the peaceful surroundings from the deck located through sliding doors off the living room.</p>\n<h3>Things to do near Escalante Escapes</h3>\n<p>Left: 4th West Pub. Right: Kiva Koffeehouse. Photos: Melissa Mahoney</p>\n<p>A half-mile from Escalante Escapes is downtown Escalante, so it’s up to you to take a walk or a short drive to get to shopping and dining options. Dinner on our first night was at <a href=\"https://www.4wpub.com/\">4th West Pub</a>, which has the only bar in town along Scenic Highway 12. Walking inside, there’s a small game room, dining areas, and, of course, the bar. We sat in a small dining room and ordered a variety of delicious appetizers, such as the garlic parmesan fries, the 4th West Loaded Nachos, and tortilla chips with queso blanco. For my main course, I opted for the California Street Tacos.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Once a sleepy fishing village, Tulum is certainly having its moment — so much so that there’s a new airport on the way to cater to the growing demand for the quintessential Tulum experience of sea, sand and spirituality. To help you plan your beach getaway, here are the best Tulum boutique hotels with beach-bohemian vibes.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100291011-11552045?sid=tulum+boutique+hotels&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.expedia.com%2FTulum-Hotels-Ahau-Tulum.h11901840.Hotel-Information\">Expedia</a>\n    </p>\n<blockquote><h3>Taking a trip to Mexico?

Here, sustainability is a benchmark, not a buzzword, but a raft of awards for its pioneering environmental and community initiatives is only part of Ahau’s story.</p>\n<p>There’s also an electrifying program of beach club events, which have confirmed Ahau’s reputation as one of Tulum’s trendiest hangouts — their world-famous New Year’s Eve party is the place to be seen. Ahau is also home to Tulum’s best-known monument, the wooden sculpture Ven a La Luz (Come to the Light). Hordes of influencer wannabes wait in line for just a single allocated minute of manic selfie-snapping with the Ven a La Luz, but Ahau’s guests have privileged access outside of opening hours to enjoy it as an artwork and not just a photo prop.</p>\n<p><strong>Ahau:</strong> Carr. Tulum a Boca Paila Km. 7.5, Tulum, QROO, 77760 </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Price per night: $560</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://expedia.stay22.com/matadornetwork/Dwo1iy82P_\">Book Now</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>La Valise</h2>\n<p/>\n    <p>Built for the Instagram era, <a href=\"https://expedia.stay22.com/matadornetwork/6AszHwE637\">La Valise</a>’s design adheres to the hippy-chic Tulum template. Expect the usual sustainably sourced woods, thatched-roof villas and furniture woven in textured fabrics, but there are also some novel design features that you’ve probably already seen on social media, like the sliding bed in the beachfront master suite that guests can roll out onto their sea-facing terrace. La Valise has recently opened eleven new guestrooms on their Jungle Side, where their signature suites have been replicated to provide a rolling bed experience high in the jungle canopy.</p>\n<p><strong>La Valise:</strong> Carretera Tulum-Boca Paila Km 8.7, Tulum, QROO, 77780</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Price per night: $520</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://expedia.stay22.com/matadornetwork/6AszHwE637\">Book Now</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Alaya</h2>\n<p/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://expedia.stay22.com/matadornetwork/zM-FNlj5kO\">Alaya</a> is the Zen little sister to Ahau’s twenty-three-guesthouse beach-party behemoth. Owned by the same collection, Alaya positions itself as an “enchanting oasis” and even the most cynical anti-yogi would struggle to deny the restorative power of waking up at the hotel to the sound of lapping waves and a gentle breeze in the palms overhead.</p>\n<p>The menu at Restaurant Alaya is on-brand, but there’s a place for freshly caught fish and tasty chicken tacos alongside vegan and gluten-free offerings. Guests can enjoy the full complement of wellness activities for free, which range from treehouse yoga to “harmonizing experiences” such as self-love workshops and sonic attunement therapy.</p>\n<p><strong>Alaya:</strong> Carretera Tulum Boca Paila Km 8.3, Tulum, QROO, 77780</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Price per night: $489</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://expedia.stay22.com/matadornetwork/zM-FNlj5kO\">Book Now</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>La Zebra</h2>\n<p/>\n    <p>Detractors might argue that over-tourism (read: Americanization) has brought about the death of authentic local culture in Tulum, but <a href=\"https://expedia.stay22.com/matadornetwork/-Fm6fmAAsr\">La Zebra</a> proves there are still places left to enjoy a taste of the Mexican experience.</p>\n<p>Part of the Colibri Boutique Hotels family, La Zebra, has thirty spacious suites, half of which boast private plunge pools with beach or garden views, but the major draw here is the restaurant. Head chef Eleazar Bonilla was born to a cook mother and a “tortillero” father, and his love for Mexican food inspired him to travel far and wide throughout his country to discover time-honored cooking traditions and flavors unique to each region. His exciting menu at La Zebra brings this wealth of delicious knowledge to Tulum, where authentic Mexican fare can be surprisingly difficult to come by. My favorite dish? Scorpion guacamole.</p>\n<p><strong>La Zebra:</strong> Carretera Tulum a Boca Paila Km 8.2, Ejido Pino Suarez, Tulum, QROO, 77780</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Price per night: $382</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://expedia.stay22.com/matadornetwork/-Fm6fmAAsr\">Book Now</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Hotel Bardo</h2>\n<p/>\n    <p>When you arrive at <a href=\"https://expedia.stay22.com/matadornetwork/6EXw5l-biN\">Hotel Bardo</a>, you’re welcomed into the brand’s family. It’s a fitting introduction to a jungle hideaway where a program of Mayan traditions and rituals are baked into the guest experience alongside more familiar wellness offerings, such as morning yoga or ice bathing.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Agentic AI allows users to build customized services that can perform specific jobs.</p>\n    <p>In the coming months, users will be able to ask the Gemini agent to do certain tasks, such as booking a haircut or ordering weekly groceries. The agentic features were previously part of an internal service called \"Project Mariner,\" which was <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/27/google-ceo-pichai-tells-employees-the-stakes-are-high-for-2025.html\">popular</a> with employees.</p>\n    <p>Before Thursday's announcement, Google required users to be signed up for certain Google subscriptions to access Gemini in Chrome.

The 66-year-old was scheduled to appear at Foxwoods Resort Casino in Mashantucket, Connecticut, on Friday night, and MGM Music Hall at Fenway in Boston on Saturday.</p>\n    <p>“In recent days, there has been a credible threat on Morrissey’s life. Out of an abundance of caution for the safety of both the artist and audience, tonight’s engagement at Foxwoods has been cancelled,” the statement reads. “We appreciate your understanding.”</p>\n    <p>Shortly afterward, a second post announced that both shows had been cancelled.</p>\n    <h4>The shows were part of the U.S. leg of Morrissey’s ongoing world tour. He is still set to appear in Philadelphia on Tuesday, with performances scheduled across the country before the singer heads to Mexico on October 31.</h4>\n    <p>Earlier this week, a man from Ottawa, Canada, was released on bail after allegedly threatening to kill Morrissey at his performance in the city. The 26-year-old is accused of issuing a threat against the musician on Bluesky on September 4, according to court documents <a href=\"https://ottawacitizen.com/news/morrissey-alleged-death-threat\">cited</a> by <i>The Ottawa Citizen</i>. The Ottawa performance went ahead as planned.</p>\n    <p>Morrissey’s decision to cancel the two U.S. performances is odd, given that the death threat that was made public referred to a show in Canada. However, some speculate the abundance of caution may be due in part to the shooting of prominent conservative activist Charlie Kirk at an event in Utah last week.</p>\n    <p>The former Smiths frontman announced earlier this month his <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/04/morrissey-catalog-sale-proposal/\">intention to sell his business interests</a> in the Smiths. According to the post on his website, titled, “A Soul for Sale,” the deal would include the band’s name and artwork, as well as his share of merchandising rights, lyrical and musical compositions, synchronization rights, recordings, and publishing contract rights.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>One of my most shameful beauty editor secrets is that I don't always <i>love</i> a facial. I know! Blasphemy aside, it's because not all facials are created equal. Some are basic to a fault, others can leave my skin red and irritated for days. Others, still, can sculpt and lift—but do little by way of pore care and overall texture. It's not easy to find a facial that addresses every skincare concern in a single treatment. I'm a full-time working mom in New York City who commutes on NJ Transit. My facials need to deliver on all fronts. Dior's does.</p>\n    <p>In case you haven't heard, Dior Beauty recently opened its first permanent U.S. spa location in New York City, at the new House of Dior located on the corner of 57th Street and Madison Avenue. You might want to arrive at least an hour before your appointment instead of the recommended 15, as the store itself is spectacular—a treasure-filled and fully immersive shopping experience. But the spa is sure to become one of my most frequented haunts in the city.</p>\n    <p>I was lucky enough to try the top-of-the-line facial, the Haute Couture Treatment with renowned facialist <a href=\"https://sarahakram.com/?srsltid=AfmBOooWbzx1-6SJflmEAnPO_xN502ftGydtrZel1LmpPPE222DSbhEt\">Sarah Akram</a>, who worked with the House to tailor every treatment there to the lives of busy New Yorkers (the treatment clocks in at $1,300, $800 with an Akram-trained wellness expert). After a quick consultation, Akram got to work cleansing, massaging, and prepping my skin before moving on to microdermabrasion, Oxylight Ionix LED light combined with cryotherapy, and oxygen infusion. The 90-minute facial was as relaxing as it was utilitarian, moving from one therapy to another to stack results. I was luxuriating in having my skin pampered to the highest degree. </p>\n    <p>At one point, my hands were even covered in LED mitts. The spa offers a whole suite of technologies, some custom-made just for this one location, including microstimulation, cold laser, microcurrent, ultrasound, and negative ions therapy. There's even a room with LED light therapy built into the ceiling, an offering designed to boost serotonin and dopamine production, aka happiness, during any 90-minute treatment. And couldn't we all use that? Now more than ever?</p>\n    <p>Akram is a genius, and after the treatment, my skin glowed for <i>days</i>. I DMed her the morning after letting her know that, even though I stayed out late the night before and got little sleep, I couldn't believe how incredible I looked. Smooth, glowing, even, soothed—the results were as luxurious as promised. I'm a facial convert, but only for Akram and only for Dior.</p>\n    <p>If for no other reason, the spa is worth a visit merely to stuff your tired, achy feet into the spa's cloud-like slippers, slip on the best, plushest bathrobe of all time, and sip on a wellness elixir. But it also offers a <a href=\"https://christiandior.dam-broadcast.com/pm_11872_1129_1129896-l4axsxraia.pdf\">range of classic services</a>, including several massage options, streamlined facials, and bespoke makeup applications, if that's more your speed. </p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Top scientists are intrigued by the ingredient's ability to protect life in extreme environments and soon uncovered that it also has powerful implications for skin health.</p>\n    <h2>Featured in this article:</h2>\n    <p>Acting as a microscopic shield, ectoin wraps skin cells in a hydration cocoon, helping them resist daily stressors like UV rays, blue light, and pollution. “On skin, it forms a protective hydration shell around cells and proteins, reducing water loss, calming inflammation, and shielding against environmental stress,” explains dermatologist <a href=\"https://www.apderm.com/team/okereke-uchenna-md-msc-faad/\">Uchenna Okereke</a>. More than just a trend, ectoin is leading a new wave of barrier-supportive skincare. “It’s not just hype,” adds dermatologist <a href=\"https://drjessiecheung.com/\">Jessie Cheung</a>. “Ectoin has decades of medical research behind it, and now we’re finally seeing it used to strengthen and future-proof the skin.”</p>\n    <p>Ahead, discover the derm-approved ectoin products worth adding to your routine to protect, calm, and strengthen your skin for the long haul.</p>\n    <h2>Readers Also Read</h2>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/gray-blending-hair-color-technique/\">\n        <graphic src=\"https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-2180928561-68c9bbf635a28.jpg?crop=0.6666666666666666xw:1xh;center,top&amp;resize=360:*\" alt=\"new york, ny october 28: sarah jessica parker is seen on the set of and just like that on october 28, 2024 in new york, new york.

It's been seven years since Cardi B took over the hip-hop scene with her quadruple-platinum breakthrough, <i>Invasion of Privacy,</i> and while most artists couldn't get away with such a long gap between projects, not all artists are Cardi B. Whether she's releasing music or not, she demands attention—who else can stop traffic and serve a look while headed to court? Safe to say, she has us fully invested once again.</p>\n    <p>While <i>Am I The Drama?</i> puts Cardi's love of New York hip-hop front and center, she still embraces other genres throughout the album. “Bodega Baddie” is a merengue-tinged track that pays homage to the star's Dominican roots (can we get a <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/art-books-music/a40772052/bad-bunny-icons-interview/\">Bad Bunny</a> remix, please?), while “Pick It Up” featuring Selena Gomez perfectly blends elements of throwback pop and R&amp;B. </p>\n    <p>Belcalis has done it again. Ahead, read through our top takeaways from Cardi B's latest.</p>\n    <h2>Cardi B is more confident than ever.</h2>\n    <p>The star rapper has said time and time again that she didn't want to drop a half-baked follow-up to her debut record, <i>Invasion of Privacy</i>. No one was more aware than Cardi herself that the music world would be ready to count her out if her long-awaited return didn't deliver—but thankfully for Belcalis and her longtime loyal fans, <i>Am I The Drama?</i> does just that. Cardi brings her booming Bronx energy to the forefront of the 23-track long project, waxing poetic on love, loss, and a life of luxury. It wouldn't be a Cardi project without a few words for her haters; the album is stacked with a number of lethal diss tracks on which she asserts her status as rap's leading lady (there are plenty of stats to back the claim up). “Pretty &amp; Petty” stands out as one of her most scathing moments—we’ll let you decide who it might be about.</p>\n    <h2>The features are stacked.</h2>\n    <p>If anyone can rally the girls, it's Cardi B. <i>Am I The Drama?</i> is loaded chock full of collaborations with some of the most exciting women in music today, including Summer Walker, Selena Gomez, Kehlani, Lizzo, Tyla, Lourdiz, and more. Cardi has also made history with her sophomore release by being the first woman to have Janet Jackson feature on an album. Sampling Jackson’s 1986 hit “The Pleasure Principle” on the track “Principal,” she injects a dose of ‘80s energy into the project. Cardi also revisits fan favorites, including two of her biggest hits:<a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/art-books-music/a33544562/cardi-b-megan-thee-stallion-wap-music-video/\">“WAP”</a> featuring <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a35496164/megan-thee-stallion-march-2021-cover-story/\">Megan Thee Stallion</a> and her 2021 single “Up.” “Those are two of my biggest songs, my fans have been asking me to put them on an album, and people search for them on IOP all the time…,” the rapper shared with <i> Billboard</i>. “They deserve a home.”</p>\n    <h2>She gets real about what went down during her divorce—and sheds light on her new relationship.</h2>\n    <p>There are a number of songs on the rapper's new album that are very clearly about her ongoing divorce from Offset, and Cardi doesn't hold back. “Man Of Your Word,” “What's Goin' On,” and “Shower Tears” are three of the more vulnerable tracks on the album that peel back the curtain on why she chose to walk away—and return—to Offset a number of times over the years. But Cardi makes it clear that she's done with the past; she's moved on and happy with a new man, the NFL star Steffon Diggs. She even dedicates the NSFW track “On My Back” to just how good he makes her feel. Go off, Cardi!</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

They can add polish to a sofa, warmth to a bed, or personality to an otherwise pared-back space. They’re also one of the easiest ways to experiment with pattern, texture, and color without committing to a major investment piece. “Throw pillows are the jewelry for upholstered pieces,” says Toronto-based designer Cynthia Ferguson of <a href=\"https://cynthiafergusondesigns.com/\">Cynthia Ferguson Designs</a>. “Your room wouldn’t be nearly as fabulous without them.”</p>\n<p>Still, as with jewelry, there’s a fine line between just enough and way too much. How many pillows should you actually pile onto a sofa? Should you change them out with the seasons? Is it finally time to retire the <a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/a64309938/is-it-ok-to-chop-a-pillow/\">pillow chop</a>? We asked five designers to share their best advice. The result? A masterclass in the art of the throw pillow.</p>\n<h2>Start With Scale</h2>\n<p>It doesn’t matter how gorgeous the fabric is—if the pillow is the wrong size for the furniture, it won’t look right. “Scale is always my first consideration,” says New York–based designer Coco Greenblum of <a href=\"https://www.studiococogreenblum.com/\">Studio Coco Greenblum</a>. “I like pillows to feel proportional, never towering above the back of a chair or sofa.” Her go-to? A versatile 20-by-20 square, often layered with a long lumbar to keep things dynamic.</p>\n<p>Ferguson also begins with proportion. “I always start with the largest piece of furniture in the room and select the fabrics for the pillows on the sofa first,” she explains. Her favorite formula is foolproof: a solid linen for the largest pillow, layered with a patterned “hero” fabric up front. To keep them plush, she always oversizes her inserts—think a 26-inch insert in a 24-inch pillow cover.</p>\n<p>Designer Heather French, half of <a href=\"https://www.frenchandfrenchinteriors.com/\">French &amp; French Interiors</a>, advises clients to pay attention to both scale and comfort. “Twenty-two by twenty-two is a safe starting point for sofas,” she says, “but you can size up or down depending on the depth of the seat. Pillows should feel generous but never like they’re pushing you off.”</p>\n<h2>Don’t Be Afraid of Personality</h2>\n<p>Throw pillows are a great way to have fun. “I start with a pattern first and foremost,” says designer I<a href=\"https://www.isabelladdinteriors.com/\">sabel Ladd</a>, who is known for her fearless use of color. “Then color, then size, then quantity.” Her advice? Don’t play it safe. “Be LOUD.”</p>\n<p>French says pillows are an opportunity to introduce a “wow” moment. “They’re your chance to tie a room together, add an unexpected element, and set the tone—whether it’s a laid-back spot for lounging or a more formal space.”</p>\n<h2>Inserts Are Just as Important as Covers</h2>\n<p>The single biggest mistake? Flimsy inserts. “The most common mistake is when the insert is skimpy and flat,” says Ladd. “I prefer a down insert that has body.”</p>\n<p>French is equally adamant. “Inserts will make or break the experience,” she says. Her favorite blend is 10 percent down, 90 percent feathers—soft but structured.</p>\n<p>Ferguson insists that size is just as important as fill. “Always oversize your inserts. Nothing worse than a pillow that looks deflated after someone sits down.”</p>\n<p>When done right, a single statement pillow with a luxurious insert can carry as much weight as a pile of lesser-quality ones. “Less is often more,” Greenblum notes. “Pillows should enhance the furniture, not bury it.”</p>\n<h2>Play With Quantity</h2>\n<p>When it comes to the question, \"How many pillows are enough?\" The answer varies—but every designer has a method.</p>\n<p>For sofas, Ladd prefers asymmetry: two on each end plus one in the middle. On beds, she relies on her signature move: one oversized lumbar. “It’s unique, it shows off a big swath of pattern, and it’s way easier to tidy,” she says.</p>\n<p>French embraces abundance, layering four to five squares with a lumbar or two for depth. Ferguson often uses two pairs in different sizes, building a tailored but full arrangement.</p>\n<p>Christina Jones of <a href=\"https://twentyeighthdesign.com/\">Twenty Eighth Design Studio</a>, however, is quick to caution against pillow overload. “Too many gives ‘You can’t sit with us,’” she jokes. “They’re meant to be accents, not barriers.”</p>\n<h2>Seasonal Swap: Yes or No?</h2>\n<p>Here, designers are split; in the end, it comes down to personal preference.</p>\n<p>“I decorate for the room, not the season,” says Ladd, who always incorporates custom pillows into her projects, so they're not something you swap out every few months. “Good pillows are timeless,\" adds Greenblum. \"Their impact shouldn’t be limited to a particular season.”</p>\n<p>French is in the year-round camp too, preferring pillows that feel seasonless. But Ferguson loves a swap. \"It’s the easiest way to refresh a room without overhauling it,” she notes. She suggests velvet pillows for fall and winter, and linen for spring and summer. Jones is also pro-seasonal, noting that \"the change of season is the perfect excuse to bring in something new.”</p>\n<h2>The Chop Debate</h2>\n<p>Few topics divide designers like the infamous pillow chop. Ladd, Jones, and Greenblum all adamantly say no. “It tends to give a commercial feel,” Greenblum says. “Let the pillow be and let its natural shape do the work.”</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">In this beautiful bathroom by <a href=\"https://marieflaniganinteriors.com/\">Marie Flanigan</a>, the designer chose to add a handy towel bar to the front of the bathroom vanity. The brass hardware looks stunning against the black stone countertop, and it's extremely convenient for drying hands.  </p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\"><a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/house-tours/a60373636/marie-flanigan-dallas-texas-georgian-house-tour/\">Tour the Entire Home</a></p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">The dramatically slanted ceiling in this bathroom by Flanigan adds interest and movement to the space. With the dark color palette, the asymmetry of the vanity display truly works as a cool little corner of an already dark and stunning house. </p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\"><a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/house-tours/a60373636/marie-flanigan-dallas-texas-georgian-house-tour/\">Tour the Entire Home</a></p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">The large white oak vanity in this primary bathroom by Kate Marker anchors the neutral palette. Its wood tone is warm enough that the room doesn't feel uninviting, and the brass hardware emphasizes this. </p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\"><a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/house-tours/a62047632/kate-marker-illinois-cape-cod-style-house/\">Tour the Entire Home</a></p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">In this primary bathroom by <a href=\"https://www.thebrooklynhomecompany.com/\">Brooklyn Home Company</a>, the team really emphasized storage with the teak vanity. The countertop extends to allow room for above-the-counter glass-door cabinets, providing even more storage space with an elevated look. </p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\"><a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/house-tours/a32661987/montauk-bungalow-brooklyn-home-company/\">Tour the Entire Home</a></p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">In this crisp white bathroom by <a href=\"https://www.chandoscollective.com/\">Chandos Interiors</a>, the monochrome room achieves warmth and intrigue thanks to the little details, such as the marble waterfall countertop on the vanity. The Calacatta Vagli marble used here also surrounds the tub, and the multiple Art Deco influences in the room give the space depth. </p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\"><a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/a35046697/chandos-houston-home/\">Tour the Entire Home</a></p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">Though not a traditional bathroom vanity, designer Elizabeth Cooper-Simon chose to focus on the view in this top-floor bathroom when designing this \"getting ready\" space. The counter with the sink extends until the end of the wall, providing ample counter space to enjoy the tree tops. </p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\"><a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/house-tours/a33622569/elizabeth-cooper-mill-valley-home/\">Tour the Entire Home</a></p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">Designer <a href=\"https://markelinteriors.com/\">Elizabeth Georgantas</a> chose a vivid cobalt blue color for this double bathroom vanity. It adds a playfulness to the space, and the simple chrome hardware and sconces bring it back down to earth.</p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">If you have the storage space elsewhere, maybe skip the traditional vanity altogether and opt for a statement sink instead. Designer <a href=\"https://www.willsdesignassociates.com/\">Lauren Wills</a> chose this mint and white farmhouse trough sink for this cabana bathroom, really embracing the beachy vibes. </p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\"><a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/house-tours/a35433533/lauren-wills-quogue-family-home/\">Tour the Entire Home</a></p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">There are so many stunning bathroom vanities that don't come with built-in storage, but you can still have the best of both worlds. Add a shelf to the bottom of your vanity for storage bins and decor, like in this powder room by <a href=\"https://www.proem.studio/\">Proem Studio</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\"><a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/house-tours/a33017392/proem-studio-nyc-apartment/\">Tour the Entire Home</a></p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">Whether your bathroom is too small for a typical vanity or you like the unique look, consider placing it in the corner of your bathroom. That's what designer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/veronica.hamlet/?hl=en\">Veronica Hamlet</a> did in this powder room, and it helped to create such a cool space. </p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\"><a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/house-tours/a32055997/veronica-hamlet-michigan-home/\">Tour the Entire Home</a></p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">A normal vanity of this color would look beautiful in this bathroom by <a href=\"https://www.jensamsondesign.com/\">Jen Samson</a>, but the lifted top adds a one-of-a-kind touch you can't find elsewhere. The curved vanity is completely custom, and it gives the room so much character. </p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\"><a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/house-tours/a41825971/jen-samson-lake-tahoe-home-tour/\">Tour the Entire Home</a></p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">There are enough design decisions to make when planning your home; your double vanity bathroom shouldn't be one of them. For a sleek and sophisticated double vanity design every time, keep things symmetrical. Here, Nate Berkus opted for two of everything except sconces to allow for more light in this historic brownstone.</p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\"><a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/house-tours/a61818437/nate-berkus-upper-east-side-new-york-city-house-tour/\">Tour the Entire Home</a></p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">If you've ever done your makeup with your friends before a night out, you know how valuable mirror space is. Don't leave anyone lacking visibility by extending the mirror panel across the length of your double vanity. Holes can be cut to allow for light fixture wiring.</p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\"><a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/house-tours/a43692974/san-francisco-hour-joy-street-design/\">Tour the Entire Home</a></p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">That blank space between your two vanities can easily be filled with a chair that acts as a place to rest, a drop zone, or a landing zone for your little ones who just <i>cannot wait </i>to tell you about their day.</p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\"><a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/a34255244/fitz-pullins-jacksonville-fl-home-tour/\">Tour the Entire Home</a></p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">Your vanity and dressing table can be the same space if you carve out unused storage in favor of a functional addition. This double vanity bathroom idea cleverly allows the homeowner to tackle her entire morning routine from one place. </p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\"><a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/house-tours/a40111760/regan-baker-terremoto-medium-plenty-san-francisco-spanish-colonial/\">Tour the Entire Home</a></p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">In a small bathroom, a double vanity can feel like it takes up too much space. To reduce its visual footprint, add legs to your cabinetry and lift it off the floor. </p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\"><a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/house-tours/a61427292/allison-lind-seattle-washington-house-tour/\">Tour the Entire Home</a></p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">If your double vanity bathroom idea doesn't reach all the way to your wall, don't leave that space wasted. A hand towel ring is functional and helps keep your counters clear. </p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\"><a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/house-tours/a61731019/ward-and-gray-waverly-place-new-york-city-house-tour/\">Tour the Entire Home</a></p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">To further separate you and your loved one's bathroom zones, add a countertop cabinet for additional storage. Now there can be a place for all of your necessities without causing you to see their messy toothpaste habits. </p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\"><a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/house-tours/a61667194/fort-design-studio-forth-worth-texas-house-tour/\">Tour the Entire Home</a></p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">Maximize your bathroom's storage potential by utilizing closed spaces effectively. Instead of splitting your double vanities, consider using the middle area for extra countertop space and incorporating additional drawers or cabinets. This solution provides a convenient place for everything, from seldom-used beach towels to your everyday SPF products.<br/></p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\"><a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/house-tours/a45761086/cortney-bishop-charleston-house-tour/\">Tour the Entire Home</a></p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>After the Fourth of July, the <a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/entertaining/holidays-celebrations/g1828/fourth-of-july-decorations/\">American flag banners</a> and summertime decorations start to lose their luster. Now that September has arrived, we're officially in the dog days of summer—aka no-man's land for holiday decorations. The weeks following <a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/shopping/best-stores/g61925500/labor-day-furniture-sales-2024/\">Labor Day</a> leave many of us asking: How soon is too soon to decorate for fall? There are pumpkins and faux autumn branches just waiting to go up as you enjoy your first pumpkin spice latte and apple cider donuts. When to <a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/g956/stylish-fall-decor-ideas/\">decorate for fall</a> mostly depends on your personal preferences, but there are a few guidelines to consider when swapping out your seasonal decor. </p>\n    <h2>When Should I Start to Decorate For Fall?</h2>\n    <p>Some fall decorations, like <a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/celebrity-homes/g66124368/celebrities-who-love-halloween-decor/\">spooky skeletons</a> or turkey-themed throw pillows, are best saved for the months in which their designated holidays fall. But there are plenty of non-holiday-specific decorations we're itching to put out—and you don't have to wait until October to do it. Ahead, we break down a few of the key indicators that it's time to start decorating for fall. Some will be here faster than you might think!</p>\n    <h2>When Is the Autumn Equinox?</h2>\n    <p>If you're someone who likes to play by the rules, you'll probably want to wait until autumn <i>officially </i>starts on <strong>September 22</strong>. The autumnal equinox is the date when the fall season begins in terms of the planet's rotation and proximity to the sun. Days start to get shorter and darker after this date. </p>\n    <h2>Are Your Kids Back in School?</h2>\n    <p>The unofficial start of fall is the start of the school year. But the first day of school varies widely across the country. Some schools start on August 1, while others don't return until after Labor Day weekend. However, if you or your children are back in school, you're probably in the fall mindset already, so we give you permission to go ahead and start putting up corn husks and scarecrows on your porch.</p>\n    <h2>Have Your Neighbors Started Decorating?</h2>\n    <p>One of the easiest ways to determine whether or not it's socially acceptable to start decorating for fall is to watch what your neighbors are doing. While we recommend not judging anyone and allowing your own style to guide your decisions, you know you're not alone in your love of the colder weather if a neighbor is already decorating as well.</p>\n    <h2>What Is the Weather Doing?</h2>\n    <p>If you live in a warm or hot climate, you may not experience a true fall. However, you can still look to the weather to determine if fall decorations are appropriate. Look for a break in the heat waves, the first crisp morning, or the last true summer storm to give you the thumbs-up to hang a <a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/home-remodeling/diy-projects/g2586/stylish-fall-wreaths-2024/\">fall wreath</a> on your front door. </p>\n    <h2>Have the Leaves Started Changing Color?</h2>\n    <p>For some people, it's not truly fall until the leaves start to drop, no matter what the weather or calendar says. Leaves tend to come down toward the end of the season as winter is nearing, so it's a definitive sign that it's time to decorate for fall.</p>\n    <h2>How Long Should I Leave My Fall Decorations Up?</h2>\n    <p>Winter may not officially start until December 21, but we (along with the majority of the country, based on the evidence we've seen) mark Thanksgiving as the official transition from fall to winter. That means that as soon as the <a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/lifestyle/a28714523/watch-macys-thanksgiving-day-parade/\">Macy's parade</a> is over and the plates are in the dishwasher, you can swap your gratitude tree for an evergreen and start <a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/entertaining/holidays-celebrations/g999/christmas-home-decor/\">decking the halls</a>. </p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Your other furniture and decor choices may even be based upon the sofa, but oftentimes, we tend to opt for a plain color like cream to ensure that it’ll always match its surroundings. While a neutral backdrop is always a sure bet, some <a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/lifestyle/a63856478/how-to-hire-interior-designer/\">interior designers</a> think there’s a bit of a missed opportunity here. Since your living room sees a lot of traffic, you should consider whether a “fun” sofa might be a better choice.</p>\n    <p>Sure, a neutral sofa can go with pretty much anything and evolve with your design tastes as the years go on, but a sofa that is bold, bright, or even patterned can amplify your space in various ways. Options like pink, red, florals, stripes, and velvet are patterns and colors you wouldn’t necessarily associate with sofas, but they can be a fun way to anchor your space and add personality to your room.</p>\n    <p>We asked designers how to choose a “fun” sofa for your space, how to update the one you currently have, and even how to design a room around one.</p>\n    <h2>Rules of Thumb for Choosing a \"Fun Sofa\"</h2>\n    <p>As far as colors and patterns go, contractor and interior designer <a href=\"https://www.lucindasanford.com/\"> Lucinda Sanford</a> says that deep, rich colors have enough gusto to serve as the focal point of a room. “Almost any pattern can work, but florals with less regular designs tend to be easier to manage compared to strict stripes,” she says. At one project, Sanford used a blue and white sofa that pairs “beautifully with a floral backdrop. The freshness of the blue and white fabric really stands out.” </p>\n    <p>What’s more, finding a couch with a comfortable shape and rich, appealing texture can also create a spot in the room that people are naturally drawn toward–and not just to sit in. “It becomes the blank canvas that allows you to showcase your style through fun accessories like accent pillows and throws,” says interior designer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jolleyandco\"> Paul Jolley</a>. “Prioritizing the couch’s inherent design qualities guarantees a beautiful and functional piece in any space.”   </p>\n    <p>If you're not ready to take the plunge and get a tangerine or bubblegum-pink sofa, opt for a neutral-toned sofa with a twist, like a plaid or striped pattern that adds life to your space instantly. You can also go for a bold navy or royal blue color with a velvet finish, which can be simple enough to make a subtle statement.</p>\n    <h2>How to Make an Existing Sofa More “Fun”</h2>\n    <p>If you’re not in the market for a new sofa, but you want to dial up the fun factor on your existing one, you have options. Jolley is a fan of adding throws and pillows in “luxurious textures like velvet, bouclé, or faux fur to introduce depth and richness to your space without it being overwhelming.” He continues, “It’s all about giving your eyes a place to rest, so mixing textures and pops of bold colors can highlight your space year-round, no matter the season.”</p>\n    <p>Plus, nothing says you can't get a <a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/shopping/furniture/g38265458/best-sofa-covers/\">sofa cover</a> in a \"fun\" color to temporarily try out a bolder look before going for the real deal! </p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

The number is located on the back side of the power bank, opposite the brand’s logo.</p>\n    <p>The serial number is on the back side of the power bank next to “SN Code.” If you own one of the recalled power banks, visit the <a href=\"https://www.anker.com/rc2506\">Anker Recall Page</a> to verify your product via its serial number and register for the official recall.</p>\n    <p>“Consumers with an impacted product should contact Anker Innovations Limited to receive a full cash refund, or an Anker gift card that can be used across a variety of Anker product lines,” the CPSC <a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2025/Anker-Power-Banks-Recalled-Due-to-Fire-and-Burn-Hazards-Manufactured-by-Anker-Innovations-1\">report</a> on the recall reads.</p>\n    <p>The power banks impacted by this recall retailed at Best Buy, Target, and other stores nationwide and online at Amazon.com, AliExpress.com, eBay.com, Walmart.com, and on TikTok, from August 2023 through June 2025. They sold for $30 to $50.</p>\n    <h3>How to Register, Get a Refund, &amp; Dispose of Units</h3>\n    <p>In order to qualify for the refund, owners of recalled power banks must submit a photo to the recall page showing the model number, serial number, the owner’s name, the date of the photograph, and the word “recalled” written in permanent marker on the product.</p>\n    <p>Once Anker has received the photo and confirmed that the product is included in the recall, the brand will send further instructions on returning or disposing of the affected unit.</p>\n    <p>CPSC notes that lithium-ion batteries or devices containing them should not be disposed of in the trash, standard recycling, or battery recycling drops. Because they pose such a serious <a href=\"https://gearjunkie.com/news/anker-everfrost-cooler-recall\">risk of fire</a>, they need to be disposed of in a specific way. </p>\n    <p>Some municipal household hazardous waste (HHW) collection centers will accept lithium-ion batteries — but you should always call ahead and make sure that they do. If yours does not, CPSC recommends contacting your municipality for disposal guidance.</p>\n    <p>For more information about the recall, you can call Anker Innovations Limited toll-free at 800-988-7973 from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m. PT Monday to Friday. The brand can also be contacted at support@anker.com or through its website at https://www.anker.com/rc2506 or https://www.anker.com/product-recalls.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Thanks to my athleticism and comfort in the water, I figured out the basics, but it wasn’t until years later that I truly began to learn the ins and outs of the sport.</p>\n<p>I began my journalism career writing for a stand-up paddle magazine and, through my work, became connected with numerous athletes. One of them is world champion Candice Appleby. We became fast friends and started paddling together regularly.</p>\n<p>During our warmups, she would give me pointers before leaving me in the dust on the workouts. But through her, I learned so many skills and how beneficial it can be to learn from someone more experienced. Thanks to Candice’s expertise, I’ve improved drastically, medaled in races, gained confidence at paddling out through the surf, and become much better at riding waves.</p>\n<p>If you’re new to stand-up paddling or just looking to improve, it’s super-helpful to seek out knowledge from experts. Because not everyone knows experienced paddlers, I asked Candice to share some of her top tips.</p>\n<h2>SUP G.O.A.T. Candice Appleby</h2>\n<p>Why should you care what <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/applesteeze/\">Candice Appleby</a> has to say about stand-up paddling? Well, she’s the most decorated female SUP paddler of all time.</p>\n<p>She first picked up a paddle in 2006. By 2009, she had won her first SUP world title. Today, Candice has eight world titles to her name, as well as countless wins across multiple SUP disciplines.</p>\n<p>In addition to her own training, Candice loves sharing the joy of the sport with others. She has taught surfing for over 20 years and stand-up paddling for over a decade. In 2020, she opened her own coaching business, the <a href=\"https://www.oceanacademyusa.com/\">Ocean Academy</a>, with the goal of creating positive experiences on the ocean as athletes progress their skills.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/20221015-Scott-Shannon7.jpg\">\n        <graphic decoding=\"async\" width=\"3000\" height=\"2000\" loading=\"eager\" importance=\"high\" fetchpriority=\"high\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/20221015-Scott-Shannon7.jpg\" alt=\"SUP\" class=\"wp-image-621132 first-image\" style=\"object-fit:full\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/20221015-Scott-Shannon7.jpg 3000w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/20221015-Scott-Shannon7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/20221015-Scott-Shannon7-700x467.jpg 700w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/20221015-Scott-Shannon7-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/20221015-Scott-Shannon7-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/20221015-Scott-Shannon7-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/20221015-Scott-Shannon7-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/20221015-Scott-Shannon7-720x480.jpg 720w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/20221015-Scott-Shannon7-370x247.jpg 370w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/20221015-Scott-Shannon7-555x370.jpg 555w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/20221015-Scott-Shannon7-740x493.jpg 740w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/20221015-Scott-Shannon7-810x540.jpg 810w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/20221015-Scott-Shannon7-1215x810.jpg 1215w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/20221015-Scott-Shannon7-1620x1080.jpg 1620w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/20221015-Scott-Shannon7-400x267.jpg 400w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/20221015-Scott-Shannon7-600x400.jpg 600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/20221015-Scott-Shannon7-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/20221015-Scott-Shannon7-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Top 9 SUP Tips From Candice Appleby</h2>\n<p>After decades of experience, Candice Appleby has a wealth of knowledge. Here she shares her top nine SUP tips and how to execute them.</p>\n<p>So, let’s wade in and see what words of wisdom the world champ has for us.</p>\n<h3>1. SUP Board Selection</h3>\n<p>It’s important to have a board that’s wide enough for stability and that also has enough volume to carry your weight. If you’re new, I recommend a board that’s no shorter than 10 feet by at least 32 inches wide. As you progress in skill, you can go narrower with a sleeker design.</p>\n<p>But keep in mind, if you’re going into more turbulent conditions, you would also want to be sure and have extra stability. And if you’re going to paddle on an inflatable, as far as safety is concerned, you don’t want to go too far offshore in case you were to have a mishap. If your board were to pop, you want to be able to get back to shore.</p>\n<h3>2. SUP Paddle Selection</h3>\n<p>As for choosing a SUP paddle, 4 to 5 inches over your head is a good length, while making sure that the blade is not too large.</p>\n<p>And if you’re going to use an adjustable paddle, it’s important to make sure that the handle is lined up properly. Sometimes I see people paddling with the paddle backward, but a lot of times it’s because they’re paddling with an adjustable paddle, and they turned the handle around backward.</p>\n<p>Make sure you face the paddle the right direction with the blade angle facing forward. It seems counterintuitive; it looks like it’s designed to be a scoop, but the paddle is designed to have a positive blade angle to lift the board off the water.</p>\n<p>With paddles, you get what you pay for. If you’re opting for a paddle that’s a lower price point, it’s probably going to be heavier. You want to consider that with every stroke that you’re taking, you’re carrying the weight of the paddle.</p>\n<p>You can get a light, durable carbon-fiber paddle for more money that’s going to last you the entirety of your paddling career. If you make the investment into an expensive paddle, you want to make sure that you’re picking the right size. Paddles are somewhat like golf clubs; the deeper you get into the sport, the more the paddle can vary depending on what specifically you’re doing.</p>\n<h3>3.

You want to start in a lake or a harbor, somewhere that is protected from the wind and from big currents.</p>\n<p>Once you hone your skills in the flat water, you can venture out into more open water. But it’s important to understand the lay of the land in terms of traffic, wind, tides, etc.</p>\n<h3>4. Reading the Conditions</h3>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>I was working on my bike in my driveway when I walked into my garage for just a moment. I heard a sudden gust of wind, and turned my head to look outside just in time to see my Trek Domane, clamped in a <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a20979229/best-bike-repair-stands-mechanic/\">work stand</a>, toppling over.</p>\n<p>Violently wrenched loose from the stand, my heart sank as I saw the strands of carbon fiber poking out from the bike’s scraped top tube.</p>\n<p>Over the next few days, I considered how to repair the bike’s carbon fiber: should I replace the frame completely or get it repaired? A new frame would set me back around two grand, even with Trek’s replacement program. I reached out to Broken Carbon, LLC in Boulder, Colorado; their repair estimate was a more palatable $525, but basic paint beyond the essential clear coat would be an extra fee; shipping my bike to and from the facility would not be cheap, either.</p>\n<p>Friends on social media made another suggestion: <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/repair/g20032398/how-to-do-these-five-common-bicycle-repairs/\">fixing it myself</a>. Although I do much of my own <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/repair/a20012653/bike-repair-tips/\">basic bike maintenance</a>—cleaning and <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/repair/a23087205/how-to-use-bike-chain-lube/\">lubing</a> my bikes regularly, replacing chains and cassettes, and so on—I was reluctant to take on a task with such a high, potentially catastrophic risk. </p>\n<p>It got me thinking about whether an Average Joe cyclist should attempt certain bike repairs themselves, or leave it up to the professionals. I reached out to Charlie Revard, co-owner of the Bike Line in Indianapolis, Indiana, for his thoughts.</p>\n<p>“Working on your bike during a pandemic could be risky,” Revard told <i>Bicycling</i>. “If you unwillingly break something by accident you may not be able to easily find a fast replacement [because of the current supply chain issues].”  </p>\n<p>For me, there are few feelings as good as knowing I was able to fix a problem and keep my bike rolling myself (and often, with the help of some very good friends). But for most bike repairs, specialized tools are needed, and Revard advises riders weigh the benefits of buying the tools versus just paying your <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/culture/a32513033/local-bike-shops-communtiy-lifelines/\">LBS</a> to do it for you. What’s the likelihood of you needing to make the same repair in the future?  How much time will it take you to complete the repair versus a pro? For most people, the time and money saved makes handing it off to a mechanic more than worth it.</p>\n<p>Here are several mishaps that riders encounter, and whether you should go about attempting to repair it on your own, haul your bike into a shop for repair help, or replace the part altogether.</p>\n<h2>The Problem: Stripped Crank</h2>\n<h2>Repair It Yourself? Yes, and You Have Options</h2>\n<p>If you work on your bike often, one of the most common issues you can encounter is a stripped <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a20011684/what-you-need-to-know-about-crankarm-length/\">crankarm</a>. Typically, this happens when you accidentally cross-thread the pedal.  </p>\n<h2>How to Fix a Stripped Crank</h2>\n<p>You can repair light thread damage with a pedal tap. <a href=\"https://www.parktool.com/\">Park Tool</a>, a bike repair company, offers <a href=\"https://www.parktool.com/product/pedal-tap-9-16-tap-6\">pedal taps</a>; you can also purchase a standard pedal tap at most hardware stores. To repair, simply ratchet the tap through the damaged threads. </p>\n<p>If the damage is more severe—for example, if the threads are almost completely disintegrated—you can still salvage the cranks using something like <a href=\"https://uniortools.com/eng/product/1695MB1-626979-crank-saver-kit\">Unior’s Crank Saver Kit</a>. Basically, you’ll hollow out the old threads, then insert new sleeves in their place.   </p>\n<p>If you don’t want to invest in the tools or the time, you can simply replace the damaged <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a20011684/what-you-need-to-know-about-crankarm-length/\">crankarm</a> … assuming it’s the left side. (The right arm is attached to the crank, while the left is a standalone arm that bolts onto it.)  You’ll need to replace it with the appropriate length and preferably the same model—though I doubt anyone will notice if you replace a Shimano Ultegra arm with a 105, though.</p>\n<p>If it’s the right-side crankarm, you’re likely better off replacing the whole crank set. Both options are relatively easy and can be done with the help of YouTube tutorials, such as the one below:</p>\n<h2>The Problem: A Bent Wheel Rim</h2>\n<h2>Repair It Yourself? Yes, But Only If the Wheel Is Not <i>Too </i>Bent</h2>\n<p>If the damage is relatively slight, most riders can repair a bent wheel rim themselves with the correct-sized spoke wrench and a lot of patience. A <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00D9B7OKQ?tag=bicycling-auto-20\">truing stand</a> will help, but you can also just flip your bike over. (<a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a33318651/should-we-mourn-the-death-of-rim-brakes/\">Rim brakes</a> can be really helpful here, allowing you to better visualize where the bend is via the distance to the <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a19602100/how-it-works-brake-pads/\">brake pads</a>.) </p>\n<h2>How to Fix a Bent Wheel Rim</h2>\n<p>To fix it, tighten the spokes on the opposite side of the bend by a half turn. Depending on how bad the ding is, you may have to slightly loosen the spokes nearest the bend as well. Repeat as needed. If needed, you can find more in-depth instructions <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/repair/a34714869/how-to-true-a-bike-wheel/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>“A professional can make this repair quickly, and the repair will be more likely to last,” said Revard. But, if this is a common problem for you as a cyclist, it’s probably worth your time to learn how to make this repair.</p>\n<p>If the rim is bent severely, your best bet is replacing it. You can probably salvage the hub and rebuild the wheel with a new rim and spokes, but it’s almost always cheaper and more cost effective to buy a brand-new wheel.</p>\n<h2>The Problem: A Bent Derailleur Hanger</h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Whether you just rode multiple miles or lifted <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/training/a41635714/weight-training-for-cyclists/\">weights</a>, your muscles experience microtears, and the nutrients you include in your postworkout meal or snack can help them repair and become stronger. A key ingredient to making this happen: <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/health-nutrition/a65657254/protein-intake-for-cyclists/\">protein</a>. </p>\n    <p>Reach for a high-protein snack after your ride to start the muscle-building process right away, suggests <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mariespano/?hl=en\">Marie Spano</a>, RD, sports dietitian in Atlanta. Athletes who consume protein and <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/health-nutrition/g25459856/healthy-carbs-for-cyclists/\">carbohydrate</a> soon after they finish training tend to have more <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/training/a20011394/how-to-fuel-on-rides-of-every-length/\">energy</a> that day and a better ride the next day, says Spano.</p>\n    <p>While your protein needs will vary depending on several factors like age, weight, and the type of workout you did, you can follow a few simple guidelines to get your fill: For a workout that lasts 45 to 60 minutes at a moderate <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/news/a30895244/how-different-workout-intensities-affect-your-brain-study/\">intensity</a> or at relatively <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/skills-tips/a45339757/how-to-pace-a-century-ride/\">easy pace</a>, aim for a snack that provides 10 to 15 grams of protein, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kellisantiagord/\">Kelli Santiago</a>, RD, and owner of Inso Sports Nutrition in Lakewood, Ohio. A container of <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/health-nutrition/g44038516/high-protein-yogurts/\">Greek yogurt</a> serves up 11 to 15 grams of protein, while two hard boiled <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/health-nutrition/a28709052/are-vegan-eggs-healthy/\">eggs</a> total 10 to 15 grams.</p>\n    <p>A workout of about 60 minutes or longer or one completed at a higher intensity calls for more protein. Santiago suggests around 20 grams of the <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/health-nutrition/a34027293/how-to-count-macros/\">macronutrient</a>, which you’ll get from one cup of <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/health-nutrition/a35292820/cottage-cheese-benefits/\">cottage cheese</a>. </p>\n    <p>For more high-protein snacks you can turn to after a ride or other workout, we gathered both quick recipes and packaged options. Add these to your <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/health-nutrition/g27179116/fuel-your-rides-with-these-snacks/\">fueling plan</a> to boost your <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/training/g20008591/8-quick-recovery-tricks-to-get-you-back-on-the-bike/\">recovery</a> and prep your body for the next effort. </p>\n    <h2>1. Two-Ingredient Everything Bagels</h2>\n    <p>This might be the easiest baking recipe ever. All you need is two-cups of self-rising flour and 1 to 2 cups of nonfat plain Greek yogurt (plus an egg wash and everything seasoning!). Bake the <a href=\"https://www.bhg.com/recipes/bread/2-ingredient-bagels/\">recipe</a> ingredients ahead of time so you have a grab-and-go high-protein snack after a run. One bagel contains 9 to 10 grams of protein, and offers up <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/health-nutrition/a26023322/is-sodium-bad-for-you/\">sodium</a> and carbs for replenishment, too.</p>\n    <h2>2. Gluten-Free Blueberry Cottage Cheese Pancakes</h2>\n    <p>This special homemade <a href=\"https://www.mariespano.com/uncategorized/gluten-free-blueberry-cottage-cheese-pancakes/\"> recipe</a> is a family favorite of Spano’s. It’s high in protein thanks to cottage cheese, eggs, and milk, with each four-inch pancake containing 4 grams of the macro. Make them ahead of time and freeze them for a quick bite postride during the week, or whip them up right after a workout and top with </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/health-nutrition/a26655653/almond-butter-vs-peanut-butter/\">nut butter</a>and berries for more protein,</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/health-nutrition/a39783896/healthy-fats/\">healthy fats</a>, and</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/health-nutrition/a37280112/what-are-antioxidants/\">antioxidants</a>.</p>\n    <h2>5. Egg and Veggie Muffins</h2>\n    <p>Spano recommends using a slice of ham in place of a baking cup for these egg bites, which have 7 grams of protein per bite (9 grams with the ham).</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Ingredients: </strong>\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>1 dozen eggs</li>\n      <li>¼ cup 2% milk</li>\n      <li>roasted vegetables, diced fine</li>\n      <li>one cup spinach leaves, torn</li>\n      <li>½ cup cheddar cheese, shredded</li>\n      <li>½ tsp salt; pepper to taste</li>\n      <li>Non-stick cooking spray</li>\n      <li>Thinly-sliced ham</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p><strong>Directions:</strong> Preheat oven to 350.  In a large bowl, mix eggs and milk. Add diced vegetables, <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/news/a36384429/leafy-greens-for-better-heart-health-study/\">spinach</a>, and cheese. Stir to incorporate. Add salt and pepper, to taste.  Spray a muffin tin with non-stick cooking spray. Use thin slices of ham as the muffin cups. Pour egg mixture into each muffin cup until it’s ¾ of the way full.  Cook for approximately 20 minutes. Test for doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center. Toothpick should be clean and egg should be firm to the touch. Remove from oven and allow to rest for five minutes. To remove, use a knife to loosen the side of the egg from the pan.</p>\n    <h2>8. Tuna and Crackers</h2>\n    <p>Santiago suggests a simple snack of canned (or packet) tuna, as it contains leucine, an important <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/health-nutrition/a20019455/harness-amino-acid-power-to-boost-your-riding/\">branched chain amino acid</a> (BCAA), which helps with muscle growth. Plus, tuna is convenient, shelf-stable, and doesn’t need to be refrigerated. Try adding to crackers for a quick snack. A half a can of tuna contains <a href=\"https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/171986/nutrients\">about 21 grams</a> of protein.</p>\n    <h2>5. Steel Cut Overnight Oats With Protein Powder</h2>\n    <p>This personal fave of Spano’s contains a whopping 30 grams of protein thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/health-nutrition/a26234250/what-is-oat-milk/\">milk</a>, yogurt, and <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/news/a26716362/protein-before-bed-muscle-growth/\">protein powder</a>.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Ingredients: </strong>\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>1/3 cup steel-cut oats</li>\n      <li>1/3 cup plain higher protein Greek yogurt</li>\n      <li>2/3 cup 2% milk</li>\n      <li>1/2 scoop vanilla whey protein powder</li>\n      <li>Cinnamon, nuts, or other toppings</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p><strong>Directions:</strong> Combine oats, yogurt, milk, and protein powder in container. Refrigerate overnight and serve cold, topped with cinnamon, fruit, and nuts, if desired.</p>\n    <h2>6. Hard Boiled Eggs</h2>\n    <p>Cook these in advance for an easy source of protein to snack on after a workout or when you get home from a ride. Sprinkle on hot sauce, <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/health-nutrition/a41040340/why-do-i-crave-salt/\">salt</a>, and pepper, or everything seasoning for extra flavor. You’ll get seven grams of protein per <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/health-nutrition/a20041379/eating-whole-eggs-builds-more-muscle/\">egg</a>.</p>\n    <h2>7. Kefir Smoothie</h2>\n    <p>Meghann Featherstun, CSSD, RD, a sports dietitian, and founder of <a href=\"https://www.featherstonenutrition.com/\">Featherstone Nutrition</a>, loves a kefir and Greek yogurt <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/health-nutrition/g28099757/smoothie-causing-weight-gain/\">smoothie</a>, using a ½-cup of each protein source, along with frozen berries, bananas, or both. This combo packs in as much as 20 grams of protein.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/8e44006f-54d9-4911-8bb6-710dd0852749_1699035974.jpeg?fill=1:1&amp;resize=120:*\" alt=\"Headshot of Jenna Autuori Dedic\" title=\"Headshot of Jenna Autuori Dedic\"/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/author/217404/jenna-autuori-dedic/\">Jenna Autuori Dedic</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

I mean, how could I not? It makes my <a href=\"https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/aldi-fish-and-chips-may-2025/\">favorite freezer meal</a> and my <a href=\"https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/the-one-aldi-product-i-simply-cant-live-without/\">favorite condiment</a>. And that’s not even counting all of the goodies I’ve picked up walking down “The Danger Aisle”—you know, the one where all the <a href=\"https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/5-items-you-should-be-buying-at-aldi/\">Aldi Finds</a> live.</p>\n    <p>Despite my love for the chain, there is one aisle I’ve never been interested in: the one with Aldi’s house brand sodas. If the Aldi Finds aisle is my kryptonite, then the tonic is the beverage aisle (pun very much intended). Sure, call me a snob, but I prefer a Diet Coke over <i>any</i> store’s house brand version. Call me a sucker for marketing and branding—I don’t care. Diet Coke is life.</p>\n    <p>I was curious, though, when I started to see chatter online about Aldi’s Diet Cola being a dupe for the king of all Diet Cokes: a McDonald’s Diet Coke. <i>Well</i>, I scoffed<i>, this certainly can’t be possible</i>. Aiming to prove the internet wrong, I went and bought a case of the Summit Diet Cola.</p>\n    <h2>Is Aldi’s diet cola a dupe for a McDonald’s Diet Coke?</h2>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://www.tasteofhome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Is-Aldis-Diet-Cola-Really-a-Dupe-for-McDonalds-Diet-Coke_IMG_7030_Hayley-Schueneman-for-Taste-of-home.jpg?fit=680%2C995\" alt=\"Is Aldi's Diet Cola Really A Dupe For Mcdonald's Diet Coke Img 7030 Hayley Schueneman For Taste Of Home\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>Generic sodas are nothing new. Brands take well-known products and try to imitate them at a lower cost—both visually and in terms of taste. The result is often just <i>fine</i>. In this case, the packaging for Aldi Diet Cola is freakishly akin to that of a Diet Coke: It’s a light silver can with red lettering.</p>\n    <p>But when I took a sip of the Aldi diet cola, I was immediately blown away. I actually said, “Wow!” and then took a second sip just to make sure I wasn’t hallucinating. Yes, this generic cola is good. And not just good, it tastes <i>better</i> than a can of Diet Coke. My first impression was that it tasted like someone had canned a McDonald’s fountain Diet Coke.</p>\n    <p>Real Diet Coke fans know that what sets the McDonald’s version apart is an unmistakable, almost proprietary balance of flavor and carbonation that you usually can’t get anywhere else. So, I decided to take my testing up a notch. I poured a can over ice, and drank it with a straw. It was perfection.</p>\n    <p>I am convinced that if you poured the Aldi Diet Cola into a McDonald’s cup, I wouldn’t know the difference. Consider me impressed yet again by Aldi, because I will now be buying its Summit Diet Cola in bulk. It really is a super dupe for McDonald’s Diet Coke!</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>This mushroom gravy is a holiday must-have, especially if you'd rather skip the fuss of pan drippings.</p>\n<p>I grew up topping my Thanksgiving plate with premade, store-bought gravy—a convenient solution for a family that didn’t want to spend any more time in the kitchen after roasting the turkey, mashing the potatoes and mixing the stuffing. But then I learned <a href=\"https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/foolproof-gravy/\">how to make gravy from scratch</a> in a college cooking course. It turns out homemade gravy isn’t as intimidating as it seems. In fact, it’s one of the easiest parts of the holiday meal to master!</p>\n<p>If you’d rather skip fussing with pan drippings or gizzards, this mushroom gravy is the perfect addition to your Thanksgiving table. It’s rich, savory and packed with earthy umami from a mix of fresh cremini and dried porcini mushrooms. It’s delicious served over traditional roast turkey, and it’s a vegetarian-friendly option for pouring over mashed potatoes, stuffing and veggies.</p>\n<h2>Mushroom Gravy Ingredients</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Mushrooms:</strong>Fresh cremini<a href=\"https://www.tasteofhome.com/collection/recipes-for-mushroom-lovers/\">mushrooms</a>give this gravy earth notes, while dried porcini add deep umami flavor. To reconstitute dried mushrooms, soak them in hot water as directed on the package, then drain them well.</li>\n      <li><strong>Onion and garlic:</strong>A yellow onion and freshly minced garlic bring savory, aromatic depth. Chop the onion finely so it flavors the gravy without noticeable chunks.</li>\n      <li><strong>Butter:</strong>Melted butter forms the base of the roux, giving the gravy its rich flavor and silky texture. For a dairy-free version, swap in a vegan butter or thicken the gravy with a cornstarch slurry instead of a roux.</li>\n      <li><strong>All-purpose flour:</strong>This pantry staple thickens the gravy. Cook it long enough in the butter so the raw taste disappears and it develops a warm, nutty aroma.</li>\n      <li><strong>Vegetable broth:</strong>If you have the time, I highly recommend using<a href=\"https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/how-to-make-vegetable-broth/\">homemade vegetable broth</a>—it’s an easy way to use up veggie scraps and gives you complete control over the flavor and the salt level of your gravy. If you use store-bought broth, choose low-sodium broth and salt the gravy to taste.</li>\n      <li><strong>Fresh thyme:</strong>Thyme adds a woodsy, aromatic note that pairs exceptionally well with the mushrooms. If you don’t have thyme, swap in parsley, rosemary or sage.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>Directions</h2>\n<h3>Step 1: Saute the mushrooms and aromatics</h3>\n<p>In a large skillet, heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until they’re tender and golden brown. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for one minute longer until it’s fragrant. Remove the skillet from the heat and keep it warm.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Make the roux</h3>\n<p>While the mushrooms and onions are cooking, melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the flour and cook, whisking continuously until the mixture is light brown and no longer smells like raw flour, about three to five minutes.</p>\n<p><i>Editor’s Tip:</i> A <a href=\"https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/how-to-make-a-roux/\">roux</a> can burn quickly, so don’t crank the heat. Stay by the stove and keep the whisk moving.</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Finish the gravy</h3>\n<p>Gradually whisk the vegetable broth into the roux. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer and cook it for three to four minutes until the gravy thickens. Stir in the mushroom mixture, thyme, salt and pepper. Taste the gravy and adjust the seasoning as needed.</p>\n<p><i>Editor’s Tip:</i> If your gravy turns out thicker than you’d like, whisk in extra broth, one splash at a time, until it reaches a pourable consistency.</p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://www.tasteofhome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Mushroom-Gravy_TOHcom25_280656_DR_09_12_09b.jpg?fit=700%2C1024\" alt=\"Mushroom Gravy\"/>\n    </p>\n<h2>Mushroom Gravy Variations</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>For vegan gravy:</strong>Use a<a href=\"https://www.tasteofhome.com/collection/vegan-butter/\">plant-based butter</a>or a few tablespoons of a neutral oil in place of the butter to make a plant-powered gravy that’s just as silky and flavorful.</li>\n      <li><strong>Change the broth:</strong>If you’re not vegetarian, use chicken or turkey broth for extra depth.</li>\n      <li><strong>Go gluten-free:</strong>Swap gluten-free flour blend for the all-purpose flour, or<a href=\"https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/how-to-thicken-gravy/\">thicken gravy with a cornstarch slurry</a>instead of a roux to make a gluten-free gravy.</li>\n      <li><strong>Experiment with herbs:</strong>Thyme is classic, but rosemary, sage, parsley or a combination will give your gravy a slightly different, festive aroma.</li>\n      <li><strong>Mix up the mushrooms:</strong>Feel free to swap or add other<a href=\"https://www.tasteofhome.com/collection/mushroom-type-guide/\">varieties of mushrooms</a>, like button, shiitake, portobello or oyster mushrooms, for extra texture and deeper umami. If dried mushrooms aren’t available, a mix of fresh mushrooms will still create a rich, flavorful gravy.</li>\n      <li><strong>Add a flavor booster:</strong>Deglaze the mushrooms with sherry or white wine, or stir a dash of soy sauce or a spoonful of<a href=\"https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/what-is-miso-paste/\">miso paste</a>into the gravy while it simmers for more savory depth.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>How to Store Mushroom Gravy</h2>\n<p>Let the gravy cool to room temperature, then transfer it to an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator. It’ll keep for up to four days. To reheat gravy, warm it gently in a saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally. If needed, add a splash of broth to thin it out.</p>\n<h3>Can you freeze mushroom gravy?</h3>\n<p>Mushroom gravy freezes well for up to three months. Store it in a freezer-safe container or freezer bag, leaving room for expansion.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>If excellent eating is what you’re after, Los Angeles delivers in spades. The Southern California metropolis lays claim to some of the world’s best year-round farmers markets, and its enclaves of immigrant cuisines—Koreatown, Thai Town, and the San Gabriel Valley for Chinese—are unmatched. But here’s the thing: LA functions more like a patchwork of suburbs, each with its own culture and culinary draws. Stay in Santa Monica and you won’t be dining in the San Fernando Valley, or at least you shouldn’t be. The smarter move is to pick a pocket and dig deep, and in doing so, avoid losing hours of your trip to traffic.</p>\n<p>Getting around Los Angeles takes four wheels, even if you stick to a smaller geographic area. Public transit is limited and slow, so plan on renting a car or relying on Uber and Waymo (you’ll see the self-driving cars everywhere). With that in mind, here’s where to stay in Los Angeles if eating is your priority, and where to eat once you’re settled in.</p>\n<h2>Silver Lake and Los Feliz (and Eastside, et al.)</h2>\n<p>Silver Lake is a magnet for young creatives and, fittingly, home to one of LA’s most eclectic food scenes. It’s here you’ll find the cult-favorite <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/courage_bagels/?hl=en\">Courage Bagels</a>—open-faced and topped with California-native ingredients—and Bridgetown Roti, where chef <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/chefrashidaholmes/?hl=en\">Rashida Holmes</a> serves curry shrimp roti and honey jerk wings. Head slightly east on Sunset for <a href=\"https://www.azizamla.com/\">Azizam</a>, the Persian home-cooking phenom and <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-new-restaurants-2024/\">2024  Bon Appétit Best New Restaurant</a>, and </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tropicalcafela.com/\">Café Tropical</a>, a neighborhood landmark refreshed last year by new ownership, with dialed-in recipes for pastelitos and Cubanos.</p>\n<p>Nearby Melrose Hill has emerged as a dining pocket of its own, with <a href=\"https://cafetelegrama.com/\">Café Telegrama</a> (don’t miss the Chinese chicken salad), its elegant Italian sibling <a href=\"https://etra.la/\">Ètra</a>, and <a href=\"https://lagroceryandcafe.com/\">LA Grocery &amp; Café</a>, a hip grocery with farmers’ market produce and standout prepared foods.</p>\n<p>One neighborhood over in East Hollywood, Middle Eastern-inspired <a href=\"https://www.saffysla.com/\">Saffy’s</a> is known for dinner but also offers a stellar Arabic breakfast, while across the street is <a href=\"https://www.foundoyster.com/\">Found Oyster</a>, a cherished New England-style raw bar.

A few blocks away on Hillhurst, <a href=\"https://www.marucoffee.com/\">Maru</a> serves some of the city’s best cappuccinos, while <a href=\"https://alltimelosangeles.com/\">All Time</a> draws crowds for breakfast burritos, salmon bowls, and the occasional celebrity sighting.</p>\n<p>Staying at Hotel Covell is the closest you’ll get to feeling like you’re living in LA when you're actually just visiting.

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Bon Appétit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Welcome to 5 O’Clock Somewhere, a new series in which our network of culinary all-stars share their favorite drinks—along with everything you need to serve them in style.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>I know it’s not how everyone takes their martini, but when I drink one, I want it ice cold and <i>very dirty</i>. And while I’ll often order one at a bar or restaurant, I actually prefer the ones I make at home because, if I’m being honest, I want more olive brine than most bartenders will put in.</p>\n<p>If you’ve ever made dirty martinis at home, you’ll know that a typical jar of olives only contains enough brine to make a few drinks, leaving you with a whole lot of brineless olives after the fact (plus no juice left for a second round). So when I heard about <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/613tZGZB2ZvVxCLdHsggc616E6ktRhvaYXq3YrArDpiiAR2yr4iBLfw1sVhgvD4GtveD4CmjN2Un3uAqDLh2C8pSUFUMJio6DDgUpcCvWG291EuwXAozwnXA1ewv2Jxwvcxb63DZWM1KJ9ykUag4bvYRmPBwF5k7Sv8gm4hTbTqetJDTrauorZt7dAdVe332TdYAyatGwM1jpEQ5Y1BEpwaqP6i3bECRNCmE9kMBNBWKhNnogsetvRoCUqmfEbGedcrJM8gd5yt4VUKoPxjNVGBVdUejreHQmZusewRvAb71z4B4NF2ZPsTRwRzVXemiaKxJtJdFa3qeLyyMZcwbEwjVoZsLP1TNAb6g1e\">Quincy</a>, a company making jars of olives with the perfect ratio of olives to brine for dirty martini purposes, I was immediately intrigued.</p>\n<p>I picked up a jar in advance of my birthday party back in June and had an idea: Why not dump all of the brine in a pitcher and mix up a <i>giant</i> batch of martinis to serve my guests? Because as much as I love my friends (and this drink), I sure as hell was not signing myself up to make 10+ martinis to order. So a few hours before the party, I threw all of the ingredients into a large pitcher, stirred, and set the whole thing in the fridge to chill. When my friends arrived, I poured off freezing cold martinis and topped each with one of the olives I’d reserved—all without breaking a sweat, making a mess, or spilling olive juice on my festive outfit.</p>\n<p>To determine my brine-to-spirit ratio, I kept things simple and used the recipe on the side of the Quincy jar as a guide, multiplying the single-serving amount of vodka by 14 (which is how many .75-ounce servings of olives and brine were purported to be in each jar). Per that recipe, I rinsed each glass with vermouth rather than adding it directly to the mixture, but to each their own. Because we’re going for something briny and olive-forward here, giving just a whisper of vermouth by rinsing the glass with it lets all that olive-y goodness come through. But martini ratios are highly personal, so play around with what tastes best to you.</p>\n<p>Before you go off and start batching this weekend’s martini, here’s my biggest tip for successfully batching any shaken or stirred cocktail: add water. This <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/happy-hour-with-al-pre-batch-old-fashioneds\">isn’t a novel concept</a>. When a cocktail is mixed with ice, some of that ice melts and dilutes the final drink—so if you’re planning on pouring your martinis straight from the pitcher to a glass, you’ll want to replicate that dilution. I add around 10 ounces of water for a 14-serving batch made with a whole jar of Quincy, making sure to taste and adjust before serving.</p>\n<p>The Giant Dirty Martini (GDM?) has quickly become my go-to hosting hack. Doable in advance? Check. Crowd-pleasing and festive? Also check.</p>\n<p>Ready to give it a try? Here’s my loose recipe, plus everything you’ll need.</p>\n<h2>Batched Dirty Martini</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Adapted from  Quincy</i>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Ingredients</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>1 jar <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/613tZGZB2ZvVxCLdHsggc616E6ktRhvaYXq3YrArDpiiAR2yr4iBLfw1sVhgvD4GtveD4CmjN2Un3uAqDLh2C8pSUFUMJio6DDgUpcCvWG291EuwXAozwnXA1ewv2Jxwvcxb63DZWM1KJ9ykUag4bvYRmPBwF5k7Sv8gm4hTbTqetJDTrauorZt7dAdVe332TdYAyatGwM1jpEQ5Y1BEpwaqP6i3bECRNCmE9kMBNBWKhNnogsetvRoCUqmfEbGedcrJM8gd5yt4VUKoPxjNVGBVdUejreHQmZusewRvAb71z4B4NF2ZPsTRwRzVXemiaKxJtJdFa3qeLyyMZcwbEwjVoZsLP1TNAb6g1e\">Quincy olives</a>(or 10.5 oz. olive brine plus 14 olives)</li>\n      <li>42 oz. vodka or gin</li>\n      <li>Dry vermouth</li>\n      <li>10–12 oz. water</li>\n    </ul>\n<p><strong>Preparation</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Combine olive brine, vodka or gin, and water in a large pitcher, reserving the olives for serving. Mix and chill in the fridge or freezer until ready to serve.</li>\n      <li>When ready to serve, splash some vermouth in each glass, swirl it around, and pour it out, leaving the glass coated. Divide the chilled martini between 14 glasses and garnish with an olive.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <i>Note: Consider this recipe a starting point. Feel free to play around with the ratio of vodka/gin to brine to water, and/or to add some dry vermouth straight into the pitcher before chilling.</i>\n    </p>\n<h2>The gear you need</h2>\n<h3>Quincy Olives</h3>\n<p>To make a big batch of dirty martinis, you’ll need a big batch of olive brine. These jars from Quincy contain just enough brine and olives to make 14 dirty martinis, so you can dump the whole jar’s worth of juice into your pitcher and set the olives aside until it’s time to serve.</p>\n<h3>Dry Vermouth and Vodka or Gin</h3>\n<p>I like my dirty martinis made with vodka because it’s a clean slate that lets the briney flavor shine through in a way that gin is not,, but you do you. Just make sure to buy at least 42 ounces of vodka or gin for a batch using the full jar of Quincy.</p>\n<h3>A stylish pitcher</h3>\n<p>Elevate the presentation of your batched dirty martinis by mixing them in a chic <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/coolest-water-pitchers\">pitcher</a>. I prefer to use plastic when I’m entertaining outdoors or expecting things to get rowdy, but I’ll go for glass if I’m hosting a chill indoor function.</p>\n<h3>A bar spoon</h3>\n<p>Sure, you could mix your cocktail with a wooden kitchen spoon—but an elegant bar spoon feels more party-worthy.</p>\n<h3>Glassware</h3>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Fast-food chain Raising Cane’s hosted an entire show designed by TikTok-famous fashion designer Joe Ando-Hirsh and inspired by breaded chicken. Bon Appétit talked to Ando-Hirsh about how he approached the task and how he’s receiving the ensuing discourse.</p>\n    <p>Also this week, Trader Joe’s is back with pumpkin-spiced Chardonnay—a logical marketing move for the grocery store chain. Jerry Greenfield of Ben &amp; Jerry’s announced he’s leaving the company, citing disagreement with its parent company’s politics. Lastly, Samin Nosrat, of the famed cookbook <i>Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat,</i> is back with an encore.</p>\n    <p>Read more about chicken finger fashion and other food news around the internet below.</p>\n    <h2>\n      <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/article/raising-canes-fashion-show-chicken-fingers.html\">How does one approach designing a chicken-finger-themed fashion show?</a>\n    </h2>\n    <p>Fashion week typically challenges designers to predict and interpret future trends, tapping into street style, pop culture, and analytics to build a coherent and novel collection. Joe Ando-Hirsh, a popular fashion designer with a large following on <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@joeando?lang=en\">TikTok</a>, found himself faced with a task that was at once more circumscribed and entirely more open-ended than that of his peers: design a set of dresses inspired by…chicken fingers.</p>\n    <p>The ask came from Raising Cane’s, the chicken-focused fast-food chain, which hosted a show for New York Fashion Week. More accustomed to designing out of his small studio in Brooklyn, Ando-Hirsh was hesitant the direction would make sense with his brand, he shared with Bon Appétit. But Raising Cane’s gave him total freedom to run with the concept, encouraging him to weave in family backstory (“I can’t lie: I’m a sucker for that,” he says). Over a short (and “exhausting”) two months, he turned out a collection of five dresses, each calling on the breaded chicken in different ways. One was designed to look like Louisiana’s state flower, the magnolia. Another was crafted in the likeness of an actual chicken finger, hued golden to appear fried, with a [shimmering] hand-beaded crust. Another, draped in buttery yellow fabric, matched the chain’s canine mascot, Cane III, who was supposed to walk in the show before falling sick. The premise of the fashion show drew plenty of social media chatter, the trolls emerged from their dens like clockwork to critique, and, by the metrics of engagement, Raising Cane’s came out on top, with plenty of precious Fashion Week headlines. “I’m happy that the overall reception was positive,” Ando-Hirsh says—not too shabby for his first Fashion Week foray. —<i>Li Goldstein, associate newsletter editor</i></p>\n    <h2>\n      <a href=\"https://spoonuniversity.com/news/trader-joes-pumpkin-spice-chardonnay-is-back-perfect-for-fall/\">The Trader Joe’s Pumpkin Spice Chardonnay turns two</a>\n    </h2>\n    <p>For a second year in a row, Trader Joe’s is rounding out its autumn arsenal with a pumpkin-spiced wine. We would imagine that there’s significant overlap in the Venn diagram between the pumpkin spice enthusiasts and Trader Joe’s fanatics of America, for which this wine is optimized. Rating it a 6.5/10, publication <i> Sporked,</i> which reviews grocery store items, writes that “it tastes like spiced apple juice,” less so than Chardonnay. —</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>L.G.</i>\n    </p>\n    <h2>\n      <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOsGRq7kYgi/#\">Ben &amp; Jerry’s is now simply Ben</a>\n    </h2>\n    <p>Jerry Greenfield of Ben &amp; Jerry’s fame left his position as a salaried brand ambassador with the company he helped found and build over its nearly half-century-long history. “I never thought I would have to write this, but after 47 years Jerry has made the difficult decision to stand down from the company we built together,” wrote cofounder Ben Cohen on Instagram.</p>\n    <p>His resignation, as he explained in the open letter posted to Cohen’s Instagram, is in response to parent company Unilever’s attempts to silence both the brand and Greenfield on a number of social issues—the war in Gaza among them. “Standing up for values like justice, equity, and shared humanity has never been more important,” Greenfield wrote in the open letter, “yet Ben &amp; Jerry's has been silenced and sidelined for fear of upsetting those in power.” <i>—Sam Stone, staff writer</i></p>\n    <h4>Instagram content</h4>\n    <p>This content can also be viewed on the site it <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOwJawvkfcM\">originates</a> from.</p>\n    <h2>\n      <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/samin-nosrat-good-things-book\">Samin is back with another banger</a>\n    </h2>\n    <p>Samin Nosrat is everywhere this week.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>When it comes to wine, certain regions are undeniably more famous than others, and they tend to be the ones that carry the most prestige (think places like <a href=\"https://vinepair.com/explore/category-type/champagne/\">Champagne</a>, <a href=\"https://vinepair.com/wine-101/guide-burgundy-wines/\">Burgundy</a>, and Napa Valley). While there are certainly a number of phenomenal bottlings coming from these regions — their reputation didn’t come from nowhere — not every wine is knockout. Though one would think so given their esteem.</p>\n    <p>With that in mind, we asked six wine professionals from across the country to share their thoughts on which wine region is the most overrated. It’s important to note that “overrated” is a highly subjective term, and what one wine expert deems overrated, another could view as wildly underrated. It also doesn’t mean that these wine regions deserve to be skipped — their popularity could simply be detracting from other overlooked regions elsewhere. Here’s what they had to say.</p>\n    <h2>The most overrated wine regions, according to wine professionals:</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <i>Sancerre</i>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <i>Whatever region is currently trending</i>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <i>Burgundy</i>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <i>Willamette Valley</i>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <i>Marquee wine regions</i>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>“Sancerre. <a href=\"https://vinepair.com/wine-101/learn-sauvignon-blanc/\">Sauvignon Blanc</a> isn’t my favorite grape variety to begin with, and coupled with the fact that it’s ‘allocated’ now, it just turns me off. Most of the bottlings are not very exciting. That said, I do like crisp whites, but I lean into crisp whites with texture, not crisp whites with no malo and pyrazines.” <strong>—Anthony Anselmi, master sommelier &amp; director of global wholesale,  Lumen Wines, Los Alamos, Calif.</strong></p>\n    <p>“For me, it’s usually whatever’s considered ‘cool’ at the moment. A region bursts into the spotlight and suddenly everyone flocks to it. The Finger Lakes were all the rage a few years ago, and Sicily is shining super bright right now. It doesn’t mean the wines don’t deserve the attention, they just emerge from the dark so quickly that it’s hard to control it.” <strong>—Cedric Nicaise, co-owner &amp; sommelier,  The Noortwyck, New York City</strong></p>\n    <p>“Red Burgundy is seen as the pinnacle of <a href=\"https://vinepair.com/wine-101/learn-pinot-noir/\">Pinot Noir</a>, but in my opinion (however, controversial) it’s one of the most overrated regions. Prices have spiraled so high that the average drinker pays more for reputation than what’s actually in the glass. While top domaines can deliver absolutely beautiful wines, much of the region’s output is thin, inconsistent, or simply underwhelming given the cost. The scarcity of land and iconic names like Romanée-Conti fuel a collector’s frenzy that skew perception of quality. I often point out that equally expressive Pinot Noirs can be found in Oregon, California, and Germany at a fraction of the price. In this sense, Burgundy has become less about wine and more about status.” <strong>—Christopher Roaché, wine professional and director of restaurants,  RMD Group</strong></p>\n    <p>“What does it mean to be overrated? I’ll tell you. It’s when the mass public’s attention and hype is focused on ‘Vanderpump Rules,’ rather than the women of ‘The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City.’ This cultural phenomenon should not be ignored, simply because Tom Sandoval initiates a visceral response in each of us. The ‘Vanderpump Rules’ of regions is the Willamette Valley; I say this with all due respect to Willamette Vallians, their families, and those working in the wine industry. With that being said, I haven’t had a wine from this region that titillates me and makes me think, ‘Oh! I want a lot more of that.’ As a wine lover, I encourage the wineries from this region to send me all the wines to convince me otherwise; I’ll be waiting.” <strong>—David Mor, beverage director,  Mirra, NYC</strong></p>\n    <p>“Overrated really comes down to being overpriced with respect to the quality of the wines. If we ignore the sliver of the wine market of ‘wine as an investment’ and focus on ‘wine for drinking,’ I would say that almost every one of the marquee regions contains many wines that are overpriced with respect to quality. Napa, Burgundy, Champagne, Chianti, Barolo are some examples. Wines from these regions carry a price premium that, in this humble wine lover’s opinion, are rarely justified. There are exceptions. Winemakers like Steve Matthiasson out of Napa, Château Le Puy out of Bordeaux, and others make stellar wines that deserve every dollar of price that they convey (and they are not pricey). [They also] demonstrate the original reason why these regions became famous to begin with.” <strong>—Mark Censits, managing partner,  Maxwell Alley, Jersey City, N.J.</strong></p>\n    <p>“I think the most ‘overrated’ wine region might be Sancerre. People seem to just ask for it, probably because it is easy to say. It offers a crisp and refreshing glass of wine, but I try to help people to discover alternatives like an Albariño from Spain, a crisp and fresh <a href=\"https://vinepair.com/wine-101/riesling-white-wine-guide/\">Riesling</a>, or savory <a href=\"https://vinepair.com/wine-101/gruner-veltliner-white-wine-guide/\">Grüner Veltliner</a> from Austria. Even just across the river from Sancerre is Pouilly-Fumé, where you can find some alluring examples of Sauvignon Blanc. Whenever anyone orders a Sancerre, I try to show them that there are many more exciting and refreshing wines throughout the world.” <strong>—Jared Ian Stafford-Hill, chef &amp; sommelier,  Saint Urban, NYC</strong></p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>Late last month, I received a comment from a reader about my column on the American brewing industry’s collective overcapacity problem. Well, more of a request, really.</p>\n<p>“Dave can you put out a piece that’s happy?” they <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/dinfontay.com/post/3lxmsck6gdc2s\">asked</a>. “Love your journalism, I believe their [sic] are winners out there though. You do ask the tough questions which I appreciate.”</p>\n<p>I saw it as a teachable moment. “Generally speaking, I don’t consider it a columnist’s role to produce coverage designed to evoke a specific emotion,” I responded. “That said, you’re always welcome to send me pitches and tips about the ‘winners’ you’re seeing in the market (which, I agree, certainly exist!)” I never heard back. Maybe that’s for the best, though, because this week’s column hangs on a tough question, too. Namely: How have beer sales been looking now that both college and professional football are back in full swing?</p>\n<p>The answer is hardly happy. Data from the market-intelligence platform BeerBoard indicate beer sales <a href=\"https://www.beerboard.com/blog/2025-nfl-opening-weekend-report/\">took a beating</a> in the on-premise over the National Football League’s opening weekend (Sept. 4-7), fumbling 7.3 percent on draft and 8.3 percent in package compared to the same frame last year. “Much of that decline fell on beer and seltzers,” <a href=\"https://www.beerboard.com/blog/2025-nfl-opening-weekend-report/\">noted</a> chief marketing officer J.C. Whipple in a press release. “[W]hile RTD and NA options do not claim as much share as Light Lager and Lagers in package sales, they continued to outperform with impressive growth of +37.6 percent and +39.7 percent, respectively.” As is often the case in the contemporary beer market, if you’re looking for silver linings, you’ll strictly find them shining in small denominators. Beer proper used to be capable of delivering those sorts of gains on gameday, too, and not so long ago: BeerBoard <a href=\"https://www.brewbound.com/news/beerboard-draft-sales-21-during-nfl-opening-weekend/\">tracked</a> a 21 percent bump in on-premise draft sales during the NFL’s opening weekend in 2022, and 19 percent in 2021. Those are sobering stat lines compared to this year’s tackle for loss.</p>\n<p>Of course, for every jersey-clad jabroni yelling at a flatscreen in America’s sports bars, there are several more doing the exact same thing at home. But off-premise sales figures coming out of the NFL’s opening weekend are looking pretty gritty, too. According to off-premise scan data from the market research firm Circana, the category’s 3.4 percent dollar and 5 percent volume year-over-year declines for the week through Sept. 7 outran those of total beverage alcohol (-2.6 percent and -4.3 percent). “Upcoming, the data is likely to remain rangebound for [the] next several weeks and perhaps until Halloween when we may see [a] small spike in the data,” wrote Circana’s executive vice-president of BevAl, Scott Scanlon, in a depressing dispatch <a href=\"https://www.brewbound.com/news/circana-post-labor-day-scans-bev-alc-dollar-sales-2-6-volume-4-3-rtds-return-to-growth\">reported</a> by Brewbound. Translation: Don’t expect supermarket and convenience store sales to come blitzing back in Week Two, or thereafter.</p>\n<p>No one factor fully explains beer’s loosening grip on the pigskin. But from my spot on the sideline, a few loom particularly large. Let’s draw this up together. (All right, that’s my last football pun.)</p>\n<p>First, foremost, and football-agnostically: To the extent that the category has had a “typical” year since the pandemic, 2025 certainly hasn’t been one of them. Between the Trump administration’s <a href=\"https://vinepair.com/articles/hop-take-trump-tariff-impact-on-american-beer-exports/\">disastrous</a>, <a href=\"https://vinepair.com/articles/hop-take-craft-brewers-protest-trump-tariffs/\">deeply unpopular</a> <a href=\"https://vinepair.com/articles/hop-take-trump-tariffs-impact-on-beer-industry/\">tariffs</a>, its <a href=\"https://www.fingers.email/p/constellation-s-euphemisms-for-fascism-aren-t-cutting-it\">reign of terror</a> <a href=\"https://www.fingers.email/p/disappearing-drinkers-is-bad-for-the-booze-business\">on immigrant communities</a>, and its performative militarization of American cities more generally, there are a lot of new headwinds gusting forth from the White House and buffeting national beer sales apace.</p>\n<p>Constellation Brands, with its industry-leading exposure to both Mexican imports and Hispanic consumers, is an obvious bellwether here, and just last month, it revised down its guidance for the current fiscal year, projecting a 2 to 4-percent decline in its beer division’s net sales growth and a 7 to 9 percent decline in that division’s net operating income. (Both metrics had previously been projected to land just barely in the black.) “Over the last several months, high-end beer buy rates decelerated sequentially, as both trip frequency and spend per trip declined,” wrote Constellation chief executive Bill Newlands in a note to investors. “Notably, high-end beer buy rate declines for Hispanic consumers were more pronounced than general market declines, which has an outsized impact on our Beer Business compared to the broader beer category.”</p>\n<p>That’s certainly true, but there’s no reason to assume the broader beer category isn’t getting dragged down with it. Research from the multicultural consumer insights firm Collage Group <a href=\"https://www.nacsmagazine.com/Issues/October-2024/Mexican-Beer%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98Fighting-Spirit%E2%80%99\">reported</a> by beverage journalist Kate Bernot in October 2024 — shortly before the election that would send Trump back to Washington — showed that 77 percent of Hispanic drinkers reported drinking beer in the prior three months, 12 percent higher than non-Hispanics. Between its taste for beer and its rapid-until-recently population growth, this is a key demographic for the category (not to mention for the NFL itself). That beer sales would be suffering as Hispanic drinkers suffer — <i>because</i> Hispanic drinkers suffer — makes sense.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

It has an insanely valuable library and ancillary components, one that the streamer would love to get its hands on. </p>\n    <p>But is any of this fiscally reasonable?</p>\n    <p>Let's dive in.</p>\n    <h2>Buying Warner Bros Is Not Going to Be Cheap</h2>\n    <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is drowning in over $35 billion in debt against a $41 billion valuation. Its CEO, David Zaslav, is in the middle of an aggressive plan to reorganize the company and find profitability.</p>\n    <p>For Warner to sell now, the entire board would have to push aside the Zaslav strategy it agreed on and see greener pastures in selling the company.</p>\n    <p>Adding to the complications is that the stock for Warner is going up under speculation of a sale.</p>\n    <p>It would take a hefty cash offer to see WB absorbed, but the two richest places in town right now are Paramount, Skydance, and Netflix. And each of them has deep enough pockets and profitability to make a splash.</p>\n    <h3>Netflix Wants Everything</h3>\n    <p>Netflix is very powerful and very influential. Still, it doesn't have the prestige of a studio like Warner, which has been around for over 100 years. Taking over a place like that would be a feather in the cap and give them a history money cannot buy.</p>\n    <p>Last week, we saw Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos sitting ringside with David Zaslav at the recent Crawford–Álvarez fight in Las Vegas. On its own, it’s just two execs enjoying a night out. In this context, it feels like the two guys are possibly talking about a takeover.</p>\n    <p>If a Netflix takeover were to happen, it would cost the industry more jobs, take another buyer off the table, and hurt theatrical distribution.</p>\n    <h3>The Slow Erosion of Cinema</h3>\n    <p>Let's be brutally honest. Netflix does not care about the theatrical experience. Its goal isn't to create cinematic events; it's to acquire and retain subscribers.</p>\n    <p>That means debuting big movies in your house and not at your cinemaplex.</p>\n    <p>If Netflix were to absorb Warner Bros., it wouldn't use it as a robust theatrical distribution arm. It would use its legendary library and IP, and I'd worry about what would happen to all the classic films it houses. Would it be available on Netflix, or would it not be available to watch anywhere?</p>\n    <p>Let's not dive too deep into all the executives, assistants, and departments it might erase due to overlap. This would really hurt the potential expansion of Hollywood altogether.</p>\n    <p>Fewer places to bring ideas would have deep ramifications for writers and directors as well.</p>\n    <h2>Summing It Up</h2>\n    <p>We are still a long, long way from this nightmare becoming a reality. But the fact that this rumor even exists is a terrifying sign of the times.</p>\n    <p>Let me know what you think in the comments.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Exciting news if true for Sony shooters long anticipating a follow-up to Sony’s popular a7 line, with the <a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/sony-a7-iv-price-drop\"> Sony a7IV</a> being one of Sony’s most popular cameras of all time.</p>\n    <p>The other exciting hubbub surrounding this potential new Sony a7V has to do with a potential new sensor that could give the a7V some pretty significant recording spec upgrades over the previous model. Here’s everything you need to know about these online rumors and reports.</p>\n    <h3>Sony a7V Rumors</h3>\n    <p>Coming to us from <a href=\"https://www.sonyalpharumors.com/the-empire-strikes-back-sony-a7v-with-new-sensor-coming-oct-nov/\"> Sony Alpha Rumors</a>, it sure sounds like Sony is gearing up to announce an a7V camera here soon. The same reports indicate that Sony could be unveiling a new lens to go with the a7V, too. The reports go on to share some potential details about the Sony a7V’s potential new sensor.</p>\n    <p>It sounds like the Sony a7V will get a new sensor and not just reuse the one from the Sony a7IV model. This new sensor could therefore be larger, perhaps much larger, than the 33MP sensor in the IV model, which could further increase the potential new camera’s recording capabilities.</p>\n    <p>As a reminder, the Sony a7IV is capable of 4K 60p video in 10-bit, S-Cinetone, thanks to its 33MP full-frame Exmor R CMOS BSI sensor. What could better specs be? Most likely 6K or higher, we’d think, but that’s just speculation.</p>\n    <h3>What to Expect Next</h3>\n    <p>From the same reporting, if Sony were to officially announce anything about a new Sony a7V camera, it could be as early as next month in October, or as late as November. Just from speculation, you’d imagine Sony would want to get a new camera like this out before holiday shopping sales, so the timeline does seem likely.</p>\n    <p>As always, though, we’ll share more info once we have official news to share. So, stay tuned, and we’ll keep you up-to-date about this exciting new potential Sony a7V camera.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/sony-alpha-camera-rumors\">Sony Expected To Announce New a7C II and a7C R Cameras Here Soon ›</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/8K-Camera-News-Filmmakers\">Sony 8K News: What Does 8K Really Mean for Filmmakers? ›</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/Sony-8K-Sensor-Rumors\">Camera Rumors: Sony to Announce New Full Frame 8K Sensor ›</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/sony-cinema-camera-rumors\">Reports Indicate That a Possible New Sony Cinema Camera Could Be on the Way ›</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/sony-fx2-rumors\">Sony FX2 With 33MP Sensor and Tiltable EVF is Reportedly Set to be Announced Soon ›</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/sony-rumor-12-k-camera\">It Sure Looks Like Sony is Gearing Up to Announce a Next-Level 12K Cinema Camera Here Soon ›</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>",

When <a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/sony-a9-iii\"> Sony announced that it was adding a global shutter to the new a9 III</a>, it really put the mirrorless camera on the map for filmmakers looking for greater camera control and more filmmaking capabilities.</p>\n    <p>Well, according to reports online, Apple is possibly looking at doing the same with its iPhone cameras, too. Here’s what you need to know.</p>\n    <h3>A Rumored Global Shutter iPhone</h3>\n    <p>According to <a href=\"https://ymcinema.com/2025/09/18/apple-global-shutter-iphone-sensor/\"> Y.M. Cinema Magazine</a>, new patents reveal that Apple is developing a global shutter sensor for the iPhone. </p>\n    <p>The report cites a new 3-floor stack design that explains how Apple’s global shutter sensor will be able to process information all at once.</p>\n    <p>Here are the three floors of the 3-floor stack design from the patent:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Floor 1 is the light catcher.</li>\n      <li>Floor 2 is a small waiting room.</li>\n      <li>Floor 3 is the tiny meter that turns the light into numbers.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>This method would be more optimal than the usual “rolling” method that we associate with rolling shutter sensors, which are more common and what Apple has used for iPhone models in the past.</p>\n    <h3>What This Could Mean for iPhone Filmmakers</h3>\n    <p>For iPhone filmmakers, this could be very big news as it would give iPhones a leg-up on many mirrorless and cinema cameras that don’t offer global shutter. If you’re shooting scenes with lots of action and movement, including whip pans or other moves where the camera needs to bounce and weave, then a global shutter will vastly improve its performance.</p>\n    <p>Your viewers will be able to see everything more naturally and without those annoying rolling shutter aberrations. You’ll also be able to better work with different types of lighting and get better results when shooting in chaotic lighting environments like music concerts or anything else with lots of LEDs.</p>\n    <h3>What to Expect Next</h3>\n    <p>Yet, while this is all exciting news to unearth, it doesn’t quite lay out any tangible next steps that filmmakers can expect in the coming months, or perhaps even years. With Apple just announcing a new iPhone this month, it would be reasonable to hope that global shutter might come to a new one next year, but it might be longer too.</p>\n    <p>We’ll keep you up to date on this news, though, and let you know if and when we hear anything else about what Apple might be planning for its next generation of iPhone models.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/what-new-cameras-can-we-expect-in-2025\">What New Cameras Can We Expect in 2025? ›</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/soderbergh-presence\">Soderbergh Talks Using the Sony a9 III on his Sundance Short \"Presence\" ›</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/2013/11/blackmagic-production-camera-4k-cmosis-cmv12000-300fps-sensor\">Should Blackmagic Wait &amp; Use This 300FPS Sensor in Their 4K Camera Instead? ›</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/freefly-ember-s5k-stabilization\">The Freefly Ember S5K High-Speed Camera Gets Better Post Stabilization ›</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/freefly-ember-app\">You Can Now Connect the Freefly Ember Camera Directly to an iPhone 15 Pro ›</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>A journey through cinema’s most electrifying moments of deadlock and danger.</p>\n<p>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)</p>\n<p>Cinema has always thrived on moments where time seems to stop, where a single breath or twitch of a finger could redraw the story’s fate.</p>\n<p>Few devices capture this <a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/11-ways-improve-tension-your-scenes\"> tension</a> better than the “</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/mexican-standoff-definition-examples\">Mexican standoff</a>,” that frozen instant where no one can move without risking everything. It’s more nuanced than just a simple shootout. It’s a psychological deadlock, a test of nerve, and a cinematic ritual that stretches suspense to breaking point.</p>\n<p>When characters stand with their backs against the wall, guns raised, the audience knows one truth: not everyone will walk away. The beauty lies in that unbearable wait—the countdown that doesn’t tick but hangs in the air until someone finally snaps.</p>\n<p>That’s why these moments, across decades and genres, have stuck in our minds: they give us cinema boiled down to its purest form—conflict, consequence, and the inevitability of violence.</p>\n<h2>Defining the \"Mexican Standoff\"</h2>\n<p>The phrase might conjure up a triangle of sweaty men in wide-brimmed hats, pistols cocked at each other. But the real essence is deeper. A Mexican standoff is about equal threat, about the balance of power that leaves everyone too afraid to move first.</p>\n<p>It’s the cinematic embodiment of “checkmate without the checkmate.”</p>\n<p>Guns are often part of it, but what matters most is the psychology: everyone knows one wrong move will trigger the chain reaction.</p>\n<p>Directors exploit this frozen tension to magnify character. A villain’s grin, a hero’s steady hand, or a bystander’s panic can say more in silence than an entire page of dialogue. These fights—guns, swords, kicks, what have you—are existential coin tosses, where hesitation, pride, or desperation decides who lives and who doesn’t.</p>\n<h2>The Psychology of Cinematic Deadlock</h2>\n<p>Audiences lean in during these moments because they’re pure adrenaline dressed as stillness. The tension taps into something primal: our obsession with survival and our voyeuristic thrill at watching others gamble with it. Every glance, bead of sweat, and shaky breath is magnified, pulling us into the standoff as if we’re standing in the circle ourselves.</p>\n<p>And then there’s the style factor. Filmmakers love these scenes because they allow for extreme close-ups, wide framing, and inventive sound design. Whether it’s Sergio Leone stretching silence into eternity or Quentin Tarantino layering dialogue over dread, the standoff gives us the cinematic equivalent of a pressure cooker. The release, when it comes, is explosive because we’ve been waiting for it so long.</p>\n<h2>The Evolution of the Standoff</h2>\n<h3>The Old West Roots</h3>\n<p>The Mexican standoff owes much of its DNA to the <a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/best-western-movies\"> Western</a>. In dusty town squares and deserted canyons, lone gunmen faced each other down with the sun beating overhead. These duels were more about posture, silence, and the ultimate quick draw, rather than banter. Leone, Peckinpah, and Ford used them as climaxes that ultimately worked as moral showdowns—justice, revenge, and survival colliding in a single shot.</p>\n<p>The Westerns carved the grammar: the close-up on the eyes, the twitch of a hand, the crescendo of music. Once that template was established, it became impossible for future filmmakers to resist putting their own spin on it.</p>\n<h3>The Modern Reinvention</h3>\n<p>By the time the <a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/western-genre-history\"> Western began fading</a>, filmmakers like </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/tarantino-and-de-palma-violence\">, and Scorsese had smuggled the standoff into crime sagas and action blockbusters. Instead of cowboys, it was gangsters, assassins, and cops staring each other down. The trope evolved—guns still flashed, but the conversations grew sharper, and the irony thicker.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Today, you’ll find Mexican standoffs in action spectacles, superhero flicks, and even horror hybrids. They’ve become universal shorthand for “this is it, no turning back.”</p>\n<p>This adaptability is what’s kept the trope alive for over half a century.</p>\n<h2>The Canon: 14 Iconic Mexican Standoffs in Cinema</h2>\n<h3>1. The Triangulation of Fate (<i><i>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</i></i> - 1966)</h3>\n<p>\n      <i>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</i>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Directed by</strong>: Sergio Leone | <strong>Written by</strong>: Age &amp; Scarpelli, Luciano Vincenzoni, Sergio Leone</p>\n<p/>\n    <p><strong>The Scene:</strong> Blondie (Clint Eastwood), Tuco (Eli Wallach), and Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) face each other in a cemetery, hands hovering near their pistols as Morricone’s <i> Ecstasy of Gold</i> builds. It’s a showdown of greed, revenge, and survival.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It’s Iconic:</strong> Leone perfected the grammar of the standoff here. The cross-cutting close-ups, the music escalating to near-unbearable intensity, and the three-way geometry created a <a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-analysis\"> visual template</a> that countless films borrowed from. This scene turned the trope into cinematic legend.</p>\n<p><strong>The Fallout:</strong> One gunshot later, the balance shatters—Angel Eyes lies dead, Tuco is humiliated, and Blondie walks away, cementing himself as the ultimate puppet master of fate.</p>\n<h3>2. The Geometry of Betrayal (<i><i>Reservoir Dogs</i></i> - 1992)</h3>\n<p>\n      <i>Reservoir Dogs</i>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Directed by</strong>: Quentin Tarantino | <strong>Written by</strong>: Quentin Tarantino</p>\n<p/>\n    <p><strong>The Scene:</strong> In the warehouse finale, Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Joe (Lawrence Tierney), and Eddie (Chris Penn) draw on each other while Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) watches. Loyalties snap, and everyone knows bullets are seconds away.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It’s Iconic:</strong> Tarantino took Leone’s triangle and gave it razor-sharp dialogue. The standoff here is about more than just guns. The standoff here is about trust collapsing in real time. The handheld cameras and claustrophobic space make betrayal feel almost unbearable and unavoidable.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

CAMTE-TV is a Chinese company known for lighting and intercom systems, and now they are venturing into the high-capacity portable power market with a new brand under the name “Voltrable”. Let’s take a closer look.</p>\n    <p>CAME-TV, the company traditionally known for lighting and intercom systems in the film industry, is making a significant pivot with the launch of their new portable power division under the brand name “Voltrable.” At IBC 2025, CAME-TV’s owner, Frank Zhan, introduced their flagship product: a heavy-duty 5000-watt portable power station designed specifically for film production and industrial applications.</p>\n    <p>The move into portable power reflects the growing demand for high-capacity mobile energy solutions in film production. As LED lighting technology continues to advance with more powerful fixtures, traditional power distribution methods often fall short in remote or challenging shooting locations.</p>\n    <p>The Voltrable TR-5000 power station distinguishes itself from consumer-grade alternatives through several key features. The unit houses a robust metal construction that can withstand significant weight and abuse on set. While talking to Frank, I took the freedom to stand on the Voltrable power station and demonstrate its robustness, and indeed, it felt extremely strong!</p>\n    <p>The power station delivers 5000 watts of capacity with a matching 5000-watt inverter, providing substantial power for demanding LED lighting setups and professional equipment. Despite its impressive power output, the unit maintains portability through an integrated wheel and foldable handle system.</p>\n    <p>The device offers multiple charging methods to suit different production scenarios:</p>\n    <p>This versatility extends beyond film production applications. The power station can charge electric vehicles and power various industrial tools, making it suitable for both professional and emergency home use.</p>\n    <p>CAME-TV has positioned the Voltrable as a long-term investment piece. The unit incorporates LiFePO4 battery technology, offering an impressive 3,500 charge cycles. According to Frank’s calculations, with daily charging, the unit should provide reliable service for approximately ten years.</p>\n    <p>The company backs this longevity claim with a three-year warranty, reflecting confidence in the product’s build quality and durability.</p>\n    <p>The Voltrable power station carries a retail price of $3,200 USD. CAME-TV expects to begin shipping units within one month of the announcement, targeting both film production companies and industrial users seeking reliable portable power solutions.</p>\n    <p>For more information, please head to the product page on the CAME-TV website here.</p>\n    <p>Are you already using a portable power solution?

Sometimes, it rushes past us in a whirlwind. Other times, a single second can feel like an eternity. In filmmaking, we have the power to transform these subjective notions into something real and visual, creating a great effect on the viewers. One of the tools for that is super slow motion. Let’s break down how it works and explore some iconic film examples that wield it to different effects.</p>\n<p>If at this point you think to yourself, “Why bother reading this article, if super slow motion is only for huge blockbusters with gigantic budgets?” stop for a second. Actually, this tool is becoming more and more accessible to independent creators (which we’ll also discuss below). Thus, it is important to know what possibilities it can create and how to use it for impactful storytelling. It is not just a cool trick to make an action scene look “epic.”</p>\n<p>In simple terms, slow motion means playing footage back at a slower speed than it was recorded. And the so-called super slow motion takes this idea to the extreme. Instead of filming at the regular 24 (or 25) fps, special high-speed cameras capture hundreds or even thousands of frames per second. When played back at a “normal” amount of fps, those extra frames allow filmmakers to stretch time out in a beautiful and smooth way.</p>\n<p>(If you are just starting out in the video area and want to understand the concept of different frame rates in general, we’ve got you covered. Head over here and read our article on this important tool with film examples).</p>\n<p>Super slow motion magnifies details, allowing us to clearly see things that normally happen so fast we wouldn’t have caught them with the naked eye. I bet you know the YouTube channel “The Slow Mo Guys,” which specializes exactly in that: showing us real-life phenomena in super slow motion. (If not, check them out, but please be sure not to fall into the rabbit hole.)</p>\n<p>The most famous professional camera brand for super slow motion is probably the Phantom by Vision Research. For example, one of their fastest high-speed models is the TMX 7510. Thanks to its back-side illuminated sensor, it can achieve over 76,000 frames per second at its full 1-Megapixel resolution of 1280 x 800, and millions of fps at lower resolutions. Imagine that!</p>\n<p>No wonder their cameras are commonly used in commercials, music videos, live broadcasts of action sports, and VFX-heavy films. However, they are also massively expensive, reaching well over the price of a small house in the Swedish countryside.A more budget-friendly option for super slow motion would be the Freefly Ember. It doesn’t quite hit the extreme frame rates of a Phantom, but it gets close enough for most productions and offers 4K recording at thousands of frames per second.</p>\n<p>Let’s take it a step further. Just this week at IBC 2025, CineD’s Johnnie interviewed Pixboom CTO Dr. Honghoa Huang, who presented a compact Super 35 global-shutter camera that records continuous RAW, with 670fps in 4.6K open gate, and 2,182 fps in 2K 2.37:1, and with an early-bird price of just $7,499 for the body. Watch for yourself:</p>\n<p>While these cameras become more and more affordable, it’s important that we learn how they can enhance storytelling in our movies without overusing the effect.</p>\n<p>Remember the iconic shot from “The Matrix,” where Neo dodges Agent Smith’s bullets in super slow motion, while the camera flies around him? We don’t just see him move – we see time itself bend. The effect here is tied to storytelling and becomes a visual metaphor for Neo’s awakening powers.</p>\n<p>Naturally, this was not shot with a high-speed camera. Instead, the Wachowskis invented the “bullet time effect,” combining 120 still cameras, specialized rigs, a frame interpolation method, recordings on green screen, and lots of VFX and compositing work. That’s another topic, for sure.</p>\n<p>Yet this scene shows exactly what super slow motion achieves. It allows the viewers to perceive and experience time differently, and pulls us into Neo’s world. Suddenly, we see his reality. A reality that others can’t see.</p>\n<p>A more recent example, which actually does implement high-speed cinematography, is “X-Men: Days of Future Past.” The central idea for the effect is similar. One of the characters, called Quicksilver, has the superpower to move at an incredible speed, so the time around him flies in ultra-slow motion (from 00:30):</p>\n<p>While everything else in the kitchen feels almost stationary, Quicksilver moves around the chaos at a leisurely pace, dismantling danger and listening to a calming song, Jim Croce’s “Time in a Bottle.” Sure, the film creators didn’t invent the idea for such a shot, but it definitely feels refreshing and very well executed. Here’s a short glimpse behind the scenes:</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Democratic leaders are adamantly opposed and are threatening a government shutdown if Republicans don't let them have a say on the measure, as some Democratic support will be needed to get a bill to the president's desk for his signature.</p>\n    <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has few votes to spare as he seeks to persuade Republicans to vote for the funding patch, something many in his conference have routinely opposed in past budget fights. But this time, GOP members see a chance to portray the Democrats as responsible for a shutdown, which would begin Oct. 1, unless Congress acts.</p>\n    <p>In a sign the vote could be close, President Donald Trump weighed in Thursday, urging House Republicans to pass the bill and put the burden on Democrats to oppose it. GOP leaders often need Trump’s help to win over holdouts on legislation.</p>\n    <p>“Every House Republican should UNIFY, and VOTE YES!” Trump said on his social media site.</p>\n    <p>Republicans can pass the bill in the House if they stay united, and the speaker expressed confidence Thursday he had the votes.</p>\n    <p>“We’re going to get this government funded,” Johnson said.</p>\n    <p>Across the Capitol, though, Senate Democrats are hoping the public will support their proposal to head off a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/congress-health-care-tax-credits-obamacare-shutdown-f1ee636ddba7f65baa5234c55cb0c96e\">big increase</a> next year in health insurance premiums for millions of Americans who purchase coverage through the marketplaces established by the Affordable Care Act. They unveiled their own funding plan to extend the enhanced health insurance subsidies set to expire at the end of the year, plus reverse Medicaid cuts that were included in Republicans’ “big beautiful bill” enacted earlier this year. </p>\n    <p>“The American people will look at what Republicans are doing, look at what Democrats are doing, and it will be clear that public sentiment will be on our side,” said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, who has repeatedly threatened a shutdown if health care isn't addressed.</p>\n    <p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said the Senate will vote on the House bill Friday, if it passes, along with the dueling Democratic proposal. But neither is expected to win the 60 votes necessary for passage.</p>\n    <p>Senators could then potentially leave town until Sept. 29 — one day before the shutdown deadline. The Senate has a scheduled recess next week because of Rosh Hashana, the Jewish new year.</p>\n    <p>Democrats on both sides of the Capitol are watching Schumer closely after his <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/shutdown-trump-musk-doge-democrats-1aa4edf64103b0cf49dd26a0487ea9e6\">last-minute decision in March</a> to vote with Republicans to keep the government open. Schumer argued then that a shutdown would be damaging and would give Trump and his White House freedom to make more government cuts. Many on the left revolted, with some advocates calling for his resignation. </p>\n    <p>The vote in the spring also caused a temporary schism with House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who opposed the GOP spending bill and said he would not be “complicit” with Schumer’s vote.</p>\n    <p>The two Democratic leaders now say they are united, and Schumer says things <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/schumer-government-shutdown-budget-democrats-deadline-a0a24afe93f4a1d596fdf9093db58e3d\">have changed since March</a>. The public is more wary of Trump and Republicans, Schumer says, after the passage of Medicaid cuts. </p>\n    <p>Most Democrats appear to be backing Schumer's demand that there be negotiations on the bill — and support his threats of a shutdown, even as it is unclear how they would get out of it.</p>\n    <p>Republicans say the blame would be clearly on the other side if they can’t pass a bill — and are using Schumer's previous arguments against shutdowns against him.</p>\n    <p>“Democrats would love nothing more to put in our lap a shutdown. It’s not going to happen. If it does, it’s on them,” said Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., a member of the House Freedom Caucus, whose members have frequently opposed short-term funding bills, known as continuing resolutions.</p>\n    <p>Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, said: “Senator Schumer himself said that passing a clean CR will avert a harmful and unnecessary shutdown. Now he wants to cause a harmful and unnecessary shutdown.”</p>\n    <p>___</p>\n    <p>Associated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

The figure, which has not been widely reported, offers an early gauge of what is shaping up as a major enforcement effort that comes after similar operations were launched in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.</p>\n    <p>When asked whether he thought that amount of arrests at this point in the operation was positive, Charles said 400 is a “solid number,” adding that the figure includes arrests made by other federal agencies besides ICE who are assisting in the campaign.</p>\n    <p>“We’re going to be conducting this operation until we feel that we’ve been successful,” he said. “There’s not an end date in sight.”</p>\n    <p>ICE launched its Chicago area operation dubbed “Midway Blitz” on Sept. 8, drawing concern from activists and immigrant communities who say there’s been a noticeable uptick in immigration enforcement agents. That has deepened dread in communities already fearful of the large-scale arrests or <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/immigration-raids-los-angeles-trojan-horse-penske-1b86bc5f2ff716b89f4aba3320a96979\">aggressive tactics</a> used in other cities <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-chicago-immigration-war-department-pritzker-1f6b2a08ed8aab04f0caf02ef506aafa\">targeted by President Donald Trump</a> ’s hardline immigration policies.</p>\n    <p>The operation has brought allegations of excessive force and heavy-handed dragnets that have ensnared U.S. citizens, while gratifying Trump supporters who say he is delivering on a promise of mass deportations.</p>\n    <p>The Trump administration has promised to send an influx of immigration agents and National Guard troops to Chicago, over the fierce of objections of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/chicago-violence-crime-pritzker-national-guard-trump-2023e25445c45a3f0f4d3513e8eb2ac4\">local leaders</a> and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/chicago-trump-national-guard-crime-illinois-ef8f6e337e0a120634a350db84d60f46\">residents</a>. A military deployment to Chicago has yet to materialize even as immigration enforcement operations continue.</p>\n    <p>Officials and activists in the Chicago area opposed to the enforcement surge argue the approach is dangerous and imprecise, pointing to accounts of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/immigration-chicago-arrests-ice-trump-sanctuary-85f5dd3bfec3b5e469452223a48b75fe\">two U.S. citizens who were briefly detained this week</a> by federal officers focused on immigration enforcement. Advocates also have protested the death of a man <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ice-chicago-shooting-death-immigration-operation-ca7326ca75993984e102fe3693ae469c\">shot by an ICE officer on Sept. 12</a> after authorities said he tried to flee during a traffic stop, dragging the officer.</p>\n    <p>Charles said roughly 50% to 60% of the Chicago operation arrests were targeted arrests, meaning they were specific people that ICE was trying to find because they had committed a crime, had a final order of removal or had done something that put them on ICE’s radar.</p>\n    <p>The rest were what’s often referred to as “collateral arrests,” meaning people that ICE comes across during their operations who aren’t the person they’re looking for but are in the country illegally, so ICE can arrest them.</p>\n    <p>Collateral arrests were not allowed during the Biden administration but the Trump administration threw out those restrictions almost immediately after coming into office as part of Trump’s efforts to beef up deportations.</p>\n    <p>“It doesn’t mean that the collateral arrests are non-criminal. Some of our collateral arrests ... also have criminal convictions and arrests. They just weren’t the people we were looking for at the time,” said Charles.</p>\n    <p>The Department of Homeland Security launched “Midway Blitz” after months of Trump administration criticism of Chicago and Illinois over state and local policies that restrict law enforcement cooperation with ICE.</p>\n    <p>ICE says these policies mean that immigrants who’ve committed crimes in the U.S. and can be deported as a result are instead released into the community. ICE says it then has to go out into the community and track them down to remove them.</p>\n    <p>Many local officials and activists have said that immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility and that if they cooperate with ICE, it makes it less likely that immigrants who are victims or witnesses to crime will come forward to work with police.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>Dolphins receiver Jaylen Waddle opened the celebrations by hauling in a touchdown pass from Tua Tagovailoa and breaking out his signature penguin waddle</p>\n<p>MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- Dolphins receiver Jaylen Waddle opened the celebrations by hauling in a touchdown pass from Tua Tagovailoa and breaking out his signature penguin waddle. Tyreek Hill followed suit later in Thursday's game against the Buffalo Bills, back flipping in the end zone after scoring his first touchdown of the season.</p>\n<p>Those celebrations have been rare this season for Dolphins. But Miami showed more fight and energy in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/dolphins-bills-score-b1c81b1e49404ea7ff510a89dc0cbb07\">Thursday's 31-21 loss at Buffalo</a> than they had in the first two games of the season.</p>\n<p>The winless Dolphins battled the five-time division champion Bills closely in a game played amid growing questions about coach Mike McDaniel’s job security, which may help the team avoid a deeper spiral the rest of the season.</p>\n<p>“Things aren't going to always go your way,\" Hill said after the game. \"It's all about how do you want to be remembered. Do you want to be the 0-3 team that just was like ‘Hey, we’re going to throw in the towel,' and just say it's over with? Or are we going to be remembered as a team that started off 0-3 and found a way to turn it around. That's the mindset right now.”</p>\n<p>The Dolphins' offense rushed for 130 yards, converted 10 of 15 third-down attempts and scored on all three trips to the red zone. But McDaniel and players were not satisfied with what was ultimately a loss, especially as they fell to 0-3 for the first time since 2019 and lost for the 14th time in 15 meetings with the Bills.</p>\n<p>“No moral victories, that’s for sure,” Tagovailoa said.</p>\n<p>He completed 22 of 34 passes for 146 yards and two touchdowns in an efficient, if conservative, performance featuring mostly checkdowns — which he said was a response to the Bills' defensive looks. But with three minutes left, his pass intended for Waddle was intercepted by linebacker Terrel Bernard, who read the play the whole way, sealing the loss.</p>\n<p>That was one of two critical mistakes made by the Dolphins in the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>Miami's defense forced a punt on the previous drive with the game tied when veteran defensive tackle Zach Sieler was penalized for roughing punter Cameron Johnston. The gaffe extended Buffalo's drive and led to what ended up being the game-winning touchdown.</p>\n<p>Sieler, a team captain, took the blame afterward for the “stupid error.” McDaniel said he would use it as a teachable moment.</p>\n<p>“Heavy is the crown,” McDaniel said, “so if you’re a player that we depend on, if you’re one of the captains or some of the best players on the team, I hit them between the eyes in front of the team because part of the reason they became captains is because they responded in the appropriate way in the development of this team in the offseason.</p>\n<p>\"The team has gotten better in a couple weeks and is getting to the point where you can reasonably expect to be able to go to a game on Sunday and have the expectations to win through good football; however, there are still things that we are falling short of and we’re trying to make sure it’s not the same thing over and over.”</p>\n<p>The Dolphins put an emphasis on running the ball this week, and it paid off. Miami finished with a season-high 130 yards, averaging 5.2 yards per carry. De'Von Achane and Ollie Gordon II had strong games, both with more than eight carries apiece, and Tagovailoa added 10 yards on a pair of scrambles.</p>\n<p>Mental lapses were again an issue, beyond the two late errors. The Dolphins had two potential first downs nullified by penalties for an illegal receiver downfield. Cornerback Jack Jones was flagged for pass interference on Buffalo’s first touchdown drive, and linebacker Jordyn Brooks took an unnecessary roughness penalty for hitting Allen after teammate Tyrell Dodson secured a sack early in the third quarter.</p>\n<p>Ollie Gordon II. The rookie sixth-round pick was Miami's second-leading rusher with nine carries for 38 yards and a 2-yard rushing TD. His power-running ability has provided an effective change-of-pace option behind Achane's speed.</p>\n<p>Tagovailoa. McDaniel acknowledged that the interception wasn't solely his quarterback — backup right guard Daniel Brunskill's missed block allowed the pressure that forced the errant throw — but Tagovailoa has five turnovers in the first three games and has come up short in two straight outings when he had a chance to lead his team to victory. McDaniel noted Friday that the team's success largely depends on the play of its franchise quarterback, which hasn't quite been good enough through the first three weeks.</p>\n<p>The Dolphins are gathering more information on the extent of the hamstring injury to rookie CB Jason Marshall Jr., who left in the second quarter. TE Darren Waller (hip strain) is expected to make his season debut in Week 4.</p>\n<p>3 — The amount of sacks that LB Bradley Chubb has through the first three games of the season, making him the first Dolphin to record a sack in each of the first three games since Trace Armstrong did it in four straight to start the 2000 season.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>Colleges around the country are under intense pressure to police insensitive comments about the assassination of Charlie Kirk, which leaves them with no easy choices</p>\n<p>At first, Clemson University took a stand for free speech. It condemned employees' remarks that made light of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/charlie-kirk-conservative-activist-shot-546165a8151104e0938a5e085be1e8bd\">Charlie Kirk’s death</a> on social media, but the school said it was committed to protecting the Constitution. Three days later, under pressure from conservatives in the Statehouse, it fired one of the employees. As an outcry grew and the White House took interest, it fired two more.</p>\n<p>The swift developments at the public university in South Carolina reflect the intense pressure on college leaders nationwide to police insensitive comments about the conservative activist's assassination, which leaves them with no easy choices.</p>\n<p>Colleges can defy the Republican backlash and defend their employees’ speech rights, risking the kind of federal attention that has prompted <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/college-federal-funding-trump-a236cc302fa773e5ddd91661f61593a9\">billions of dollars in cuts</a> at Harvard and other universities. Or they can bow to the pressure and risk what some scholars see as a historic erosion of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/campus-free-speech-young-generation-tension-b931b0dd41aacaac5c50710de9549b09\">campus speech rights</a>.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/kirk-trump-cancel-culture-assassination-4d69649e382ea46d8dcf794150a1d3c9\">campaign among the right</a> to punish those disparaging Kirk has cut across industries, with some conservatives calling for the firing of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/charlie-kirk-workplace-speech-firing-29717a8612ccedebabc7cba29e7ef627\">private sector employees</a>, journalists and others they judge as promoting violence. But the stakes are especially high for colleges, which are already under intense scrutiny from an administration that has sought to reshape campuses it describes as “woke” and overrun by leftist thinking. </p>\n<p>The White House coordinated a call with federal agencies Monday to discuss “funding options” at Clemson and other universities, according to a person with knowledge of the call who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private meeting. The White House did not provide details.</p>\n<p>The federal government's increasing appetite to dictate what can and can’t be said on campuses — from protests over the Israel-Hamas war to commentary on Kirk’s death — violates the First Amendment, said Lara Schwartz, an American University scholar on constitutional law and campus speech. Distasteful as they may be, she said, many comments provoking outrage are clearly protected speech.</p>\n<p>“This could very much signal the end of free expression in the United States,” Schwartz said. “People should be reading this not as like a little social media battle, but as a full-on constitutional crisis.”</p>\n<p>Over the weekend, Clemson became the epicenter in a battle between those who revered and those who reviled Kirk. Republicans at all levels rushed to support a campus GOP club that shared <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/social-media-charlie-kirk-nepal-algorithm-d0a8baf12a16b2ed870283e64ee24a19\">social media posts</a> from campus employees mocking Kirk's death. State lawmakers showed up on campus with signs demanding the employees' firing.</p>\n<p>One screenshot circulated by college Republicans showed a professor of audio technology reposted a message on X the day of the killing that said: “According to Kirk, empathy is a made-up new-age term, so keep the jokes coming. It’s what he would have wanted.”</p>\n<p>In Congress, Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee responded to Clemson's statement defending free speech with a two-word social media post: “Defund Clemson.” State lawmakers threatened to cut funding, including one whose post was circulated by President <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-kimmel-abc-suspension-media-pressure-kirk-eb4f0fcd38499e37c94613fe8bd8e9c6\">Donald Trump</a>.</p>\n<p>South Carolina Republican Rep. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/nancy-mace-governor-south-carolina-donald-trump-0543ed431f732471195c98e0c1076bcc\">Nancy Mace</a>, who's running for governor, sent a letter to the Education Department on Monday urging it to pull all federal funding from schools and universities that fail to swiftly terminate employees “who would celebrate or justify political violence.” </p>\n<p>Ahead of an emergency meeting by Clemson's governing board Monday, the state's Republican attorney general sent a letter assuring leaders the firings would be permitted under state law. Alan Wilson said fired employees can challenge the dismissals in civil cases, but Clemson or other universities would not be prosecuted under a state law that forbids firings based on political opinions.</p>\n<p>“Fear of criminal prosecution should not deter the President of a state university, such as Clemson, from taking the appropriate corrective action against university employees for such vile and incendiary comments on a public platform,” Wilson wrote.</p>\n<p>One employee was fired prior to the meeting, and Clemson announced Tuesday it had <a href=\"https://x.com/ClemsonUniv/status/1967939044815540662\">dismissed two others</a>, both faculty members.</p>\n<p>Conservatives calling for the firings have said glorifying and celebrating violence also incites it, crossing into speech not protected by the Constitution. Attorney General <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/washington-trump-homeless-national-guard-police-a0d326fcd3731c564c2c566893385674\">Pam Bondi</a> vowed to go after those whose speech threatens violence in the wake of Kirk’s killing.</p>\n<p>“For far too long, we’ve watched the radical left normalize threats, call for assassinations and cheer on political violence,” she said. “That era is over.”</p>\n<p>Education Secretary <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-education-department-scotus-layoffs-student-loans-f24637f2a1d57432f6dc24d082e95b9b\">Linda McMahon</a> on Wednesday encouraged schools and colleges to crack down on anyone celebrating the killing. In a video statement, she said such comments are the product of universities and schools that breed “divisive ideologies.”</p>\n<p>“I commend the institutions and leaders who have acted swiftly to condemn and hold accountable those who have crossed this ethical line,” she said.</p>\n<p>Several colleges have fired or suspended employees over comments on Kirk, including the University of Miami, the University of Tennessee, Auburn University and the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>Others have warned they are investigating social media posts. Iowa’s Board of Regents, for one, empowered the state’s public universities to take immediate action, including termination. President Sherry Bates said posts made last week were \"offensive, inappropriate, and above all, unacceptable.”</p>\n<p>“We expect more from those who work at our institutions,” she said.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

For example, workers pay <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-63635185\">income tax and National Insurance</a>, everyone pays VAT on certain goods, and companies pay tax on profits.</p>\n    <p>It could, in theory, cover all of its spending from taxes and that sometimes happens.</p>\n    <p>But, if it can't, the government covers the gap by raising taxes, cutting spending, or borrowing money.</p>\n    <p>Higher taxes mean people have less money to spend, so businesses make less profit, which can be bad for jobs and wages. Lower profits also mean companies pay less tax.</p>\n    <p>So, governments often decide to borrow to boost the economy. They also borrow to pay for big projects, like new railways and roads.</p>\n    <h2>How does the government borrow money?</h2>\n    <p>The government borrows money by selling financial products called bonds.</p>\n    <p>A bond is a promise to pay money in the future. Most require the borrower - in this case, the government - to make regular interest payments.</p>\n    <p>UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid.</p>\n    <p>Gilts are mainly bought by financial institutions in the UK and abroad, such as pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies.</p>\n    <p>The government sells short and long-term gilts to allow it to borrow money over different time periods, with varying interest rates.</p>\n    <h2>How much is the UK government borrowing?</h2>\n    <p>The amount the government borrows fluctuates from month to month.</p>\n    <p>For instance, it tends to borrow less in January, when many people pay a large chunk of their annual tax bill in one go.</p>\n    <p>So, it is more helpful to look across a whole year, or the year-to-date.</p>\n    <p>In the last full financial year, to March 2025, the government borrowed £146.3bn.</p>\n    <p>The most recent figures show <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly9m4lqznro\">borrowing was £18bn in August</a>, up £3.5bn from the same month last year.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d5af/live/571c5f30-9543-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.png.webp\" alt=\"A Bar chart titled 'Government borrowing in August', showing the UK's public sector net borrowing, excluding public sector banks, from August 2020 to 2025. In August 2020, public sector net borrowing stood at £24 billion. It then fell to £13.9 billion in August 2021, and again to £7.8 billion in August 2022, before rising to £11.4 billion in August 2023, £14.4 billion in August 2024, and £18 billion in August 2025. The source is the Office for National Statistics\"/>\n    <p>The total amount the government owes is called the national debt. It is currently about £2.9 trillion.</p>\n    <p>That is roughly the same as the value of all the goods and services produced in the UK in a year, known as the gross domestic product, or GDP.</p>\n    <p>The current level is more than double that seen from the 1980s through to the financial crisis of 2008.</p>\n    <p>The combination of the financial crash and the Covid pandemic pushed the UK's debt up.</p>\n    <p>But, in relation to the size of the economy, UK debt figures are still low compared with much of the last century. They are also less than the equivalent figures for some other leading economies.</p>\n    <h2>How much money does the government pay in interest?</h2>\n    <p>The larger the national debt, the more interest the government pays.</p>\n    <p>That cost was not as great when interest rates were low during the 2010s, but became more noticeable after the Bank of England started raising interest rates in 2021.</p>\n    <p>The amount of interest the government pays on national debt also varies from month to month.</p>\n    <p>In August 2025, interest payments on government debt were £8.4bn, which was £1.9bn more than in a year earlier.</p>\n    <h2>Why does it matter if governments borrow more and pay more interest?</h2>\n    <p>If the government has to set aside more cash for paying debts and interest, it may mean it has less to spend on public services.</p>\n    <p>Some economists fear the government is borrowing too much, at too great a cost. Others argue extra borrowing helps the economy grow faster - generating more tax in the long run.</p>\n    <p>The increase in projected long-term interest rates seen in January prompted some economists to warn that the government was on course to miss its own borrowing targets.</p>\n    <p>Labour decided to stick to a rule followed by the previous government that the total amount of money owed must have fallen as a proportion of the UK economy in five years' time.</p>\n    <p>In the October 2024 Budget, Chancellor <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg745ggn3no\">Rachel Reeves changed the definition of debt that the government would use</a> in the target to enable her to raise more money for investment.</p>\n    <p>It will now track a different, broader measure of debt called public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL). This includes, for example, the money the government gets from people repaying their student loans.</p>\n    <p>Downing Street said there was \"no doubt about the government's commitment to economic stability\", and that \"meeting our fiscal rules is non-negotiable\".</p>\n    <h2>What is the difference between debt and deficit?</h2>\n    <p>Debt is the total amount of money owed by the government that has built up over years.</p>\n    <p>The deficit is the gap between the government's income and the amount it spends.</p>\n    <p>When a government spends less than its income, it has what is known as a surplus.</p>\n    <p>Debt rises when there is a deficit, and falls in those years when there is a surplus.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

The source is the Office for National Statistics.\"/>\n    <p>The expectation is Reeves will need to raise extra money or cut spending to meet her self-imposed rules for government finances.</p>\n    <p>Reeves has two main rules, which she has said are \"non-negotiable\":</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending by the end of this parliament</li>\n      <li>To get government debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament in 2029/30.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>There has been a wide range of forecasts for how much money Reeves might raise in the Budget to meet her rules.</p>\n    <p>One factor that will influence this is the latest growth forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Small changes to the forecaster's outlook can make a big difference to its projections for tax income over the years ahead.</p>\n    <p>The cost to the government through its U-turns on benefit cuts - which had aimed to save billions of pounds - will also be a factor, as will the interest rates on government borrowing.</p>\n    <p>Mr Dales at Capital Economics said the chancellor would have \"to raise £28bn, mostly through higher taxes, if she wants to keep her buffer against her rule of £10bn\".</p>\n    <p>Elliott Jordan-Doak, senior UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the latest figures suggested \"the chancellor will need to raise taxes by more than the £20bn we had previously estimated\".</p>\n    <p>\"We still expect the chancellor to fill the fiscal hole with a smorgasbord of stealth and sin tax increases, along with some smaller spending cuts.\"</p>\n    <p>On the financial markets, the value of the pound fell 0.5% against the dollar to $1.349, while government bond yields - which indicate government borrowing costs - rose on Friday.</p>\n    <p>The latest ONS figures showed interest payments on government debt rose by £1.9bn to £8.4bn, partly due to inflation pushing up costs.</p>\n    <p>Welfare spending increased by £1.1bn to £27.3bn, largely driven by inflation-linked benefit rises and higher state pension payments.</p>\n    <p>James Murray, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said the government had \"a plan to bring down borrowing because taxpayer money should be spent on the country's priorities, not on debt interest\".</p>\n    <p>\"Our focus is on economic stability, fiscal responsibility, ripping up needless red tape, tearing out waste from our public services, driving forward reforms, and putting more money in working people's pockets,\" he added.</p>\n    <p>But shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride, wrote on X: \"Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves are too weak and distracted to take the action needed to reduce the deficit.</p>\n    <p>\"The chancellor has lost control of the public finances, and Labour's weakness means much needed welfare reforms have been abandoned.\"</p>\n    <h2>Warm weather boosts stores</h2>\n    <p>Separate data from the ONS showed that good weather brought a boost to the High Street in August.</p>\n    <p>Retail sales rose by 0.5% during the month, slightly higher than analysts had expected, with butchers, bakers, clothing stores and online shopping all reporting growth.</p>\n    <p>The figures come despite warnings from some retailers in recent days of cost pressures and price rises.</p>\n    <p>However, the monthly shop sales data from the ONS can be volatile.</p>\n    <p>Over the three months to August sales declined by 0.1%, the ONS said, compared with the three months to May.</p>\n    <p>\"Overall, August caps off a better-than-expected summer, particularly for non-food retailers, with sales of seasonal lines boosted by the hottest summer temperatures on record,\" said Jacqueline Windsor, head of retail at PwC.</p>\n    <p>\"However, overall sales volumes remain below pre-pandemic levels, so the high street is far from being out of the woods.\"</p>\n    <p>Alice Cowley, managing director in Accenture's retail practice, said retailers were \"facing fresh headwinds as we head into the autumn\".</p>\n    <p>She said factors such as uncertainty over possible Budget measures, and ongoing energy and labour cost pressures, would continue to put profit margins \"under greater strain\".</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Built in 1901 by Ralph and Christena Palmer, this establishment and its restaurant/pub have been welcoming guests for well over a century.</p>\n<p>The hotel is a three-story brick building, standing on the corner of Sinclair Lewis Avenue and Main Street. Nobel prize winner Sinclair Lewis, who grew up in Sauk Centre and once worked here, later immortalized it in his novel <em>Main Street</em>.</p>\n<p>It was built on the grounds of the town's first hotel, the Sauk Centre House, after it burned down in 1900. From the very start, it's been the talk of the town, with locals embracing it as a first-class hotel. It was the first building in Sauk Centre with electricity.</p>\n<p>Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, it was renovated in 1993 to include modern amenities while preserving the vision of its creators. There are now 19 rooms, each with its own bathroom, so guests no longer have to share a common \"necessary room\" down the hall.</p>\n<p>The hotel lobby includes big arched windows and stained glass windows that were imported all the way from Vienna.</p>\n<p>The Palmer House is surrounded by spooky lore, with tales of ghosts and spirit children said to lurk on the stairs, play in the hallways, and inhabit certain rooms. It's a magnet for paranormal investigators and curious thrill-seekers alike. Sure, when you first step inside, it feels more like a cozy retreat than a haunted mansion, but don't let that fool you. Owner Kelley Freese, who's been at the helm for over 20 years, has plenty of spine-tingling stories to share about the hotel's spectral inhabitants. Legend says Sinclair Lewis himself haunts its halls.</p>\n\n\n                \n            </div>\n\n              </div>",

    "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/\">Nvidia</a> CEO Jensen Huang said that the company's $5 billion investment and technology collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/INTC/\">Intel</a> comes after the two companies held discussions for nearly a year.</p>\n<p>Huang said that he communicated personally with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan about the partnership. He called Tan a \"longtime friend\" on a Thursday call with reporters after the companies announced that Nvidia would co-develop data center and PC chips with Intel as part of the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/18/intel-nvidia-investment.html\">investment deal</a>. On the call, Tan said he and Huang have known each other for 30 years.</p>\n<p>\"We thought it was going to be such an incredible investment,\" Huang said.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/\">Nvidia</a> said it will collaborate with the chipmaker to create artificial intelligence systems for data centers that combine Intel's x86-based central processors with Nvidia's graphics processors and networking.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/INTC/\">Intel</a> will also sell CPUs for PCs and notebooks that integrate Nvidia graphics processors, or GPUs.</p>\n<p>The transaction itself took a few months to come together, Intel's revenue chief Greg Ernst wrote in a LinkedIn <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7374427655842099200/\">post</a>, adding that the agreement was reached on Saturday.</p>\n<p>The investment highlights how the fortunes of the two companies have switched atop Silicon Valley's pecking order as a result of the AI explosion ushered in by OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT in late 2022.</p>\n<p>Intel shares are down 31.78% in the last five years, while Nvidia shares are up 1,348% as of opening prices on Thursday. Nvidia is worth over $4.25 trillion, while Intel is only worth $143 billion.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"\"/>How Intel and Nvidia will collaborate</h2>\n<p>For decades, the most important part in a PC or server was the central processor, and Intel dominated the market for those chips. But AI infrastructure, like the machines in the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/18/microsoft-wisconsin-data-center.html\">$4 billion data center Microsoft announced on Thursday</a>, often needs two or more Nvidia GPUs for every one CPU.</p>\n<p>Nvidia AI systems, like the NVL72 used by Microsoft, come with <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ARM/\">Arm</a>-based CPUs, instead of Intel x86-based CPUs. On the call, Huang said Nvidia will soon support Intel's CPUs in its NVLink racks for AI.</p>\n<p>\"We'll buy those CPUs from from Intel, and then we'll connect it into super chips that then becomes our compute node, that then gets integrated into a rack scale AI supercomputer,\" Huang said.</p>\n<p>Nvidia will also contribute GPU technology to Intel chips that ship in laptops and PCs, which is an underserved market, Huang said. In total, the addressable markets for the two product collaborations are worth $50 billion, Huang said.</p>\n<p>\"We're going to become a very large customer of Intel CPUs, and we're going to be a large supplier of GPU chiplets into Intel\" chips, he said.</p>\n<p>Huang said the deal with Intel will have \"no\" impact on Nvidia's business relationship with Arm.</p>\n<p>Thursday's investment deal is focused on the relationship between Nvidia and Intel's product division, not its foundry. The two companies, however, did not rule out future foundry partnerships.</p>\n<p>\"We've always evaluated Intel's foundry technology, and we're going to continue to do it, but today, this announcement, is squarely focused on these custom CPUs,\" Huang said. Nvidia currently uses <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSM/\">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company</a> to manufacture its chips.</p>\n<p>The collaboration will use Intel's packaging, which is a part chip manufacturing that occurs toward the end of the process and combines several chip components into a single part that can be installed in machines.</p>\n<p>Tan said he was grateful for Nvidia's vote of confidence.</p>\n<p>\"'I'd like to thank Jensen for the confidence in me, and our team and Intel will work really hard to make sure it's a good return for you,\" Tan said.</p>\n<p>Last year, Intel's board removed previous CEO Pat Gelsinger because of rising costs in its manufacturing business and the company's failure to gain a foothold in AI chips. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/13/intel-pops-after-naming-new-ceo-wall-street-backs-turnaround-effort.html\">In March</a>, Intel named Tan, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/29/intel-ceo-lip-bu-tan-long-track-record-in-chips-needs-big-customer.html\">a well-connected investor</a> who had turned around chip software firm Cadence Design Systems, its new chief executive.</p>\n<p>Tan has focused on cutting costs and raising money in his short tenure leading Intel even as the future of the company's manufacturing business, called Intel Foundry, remains unclear.</p>\n<p>In addition to the $5 billion from Nvidia and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/22/intel-goverment-equity-stake.html\">$8.9 billion</a> from the U.S. government, Intel has <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/18/intel-is-getting-a-2-billion-investment-from-softbank.html\">taken</a> a $2 billion investment from SoftBank, sold <a href=\"https://ir.mobileye.com/news-releases/news-release-details/mobileye-announces-pricing-secondary-offering-shares-class-0\">a majority stake</a> in its ASIC subsidiary Altera to Silver Lake for $3.3 billion and sold <a href=\"https://ir.mobileye.com/news-releases/news-release-details/mobileye-announces-pricing-secondary-offering-shares-class-0\">$1 billion in stock</a> from Mobileye, its self-driving car subsidiary.</p>\n<p>Intel has also cut significant staff, saying<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/25/intel-drops-9percent-as-ceo-warns-of-chip-manufacturing-issues.html\"> in July</a> that it would eliminate 15% of its workforce by the end of the year.</p>\n<p>The company develops its own chips as well as manufacturing them. It wants to manufacture chips for companies like Nvidia or <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/\">Apple</a>, but has yet to secure them as customers. Analysts say Intel needs a big foundry client to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/29/intel-ceo-lip-bu-tan-long-track-record-in-chips-needs-big-customer.html\">signal</a> that its technology is stable and ready for volume production.</p>\n<p>But cutting-edge chip manufacturing is expensive, and Intel has signaled that if it can't get enough customers, it may not continue investing in its foundry. That could spark a reaction from Washington, whose politicians and lobbyists consider Intel to be strategically important for the nation because it is the only American company capable of manufacturing the most advanced chips.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

The company invented the BeeHome, a robotic, AI-directed beehive that growers can rent.</p>\n    <p>\"A robotic beehive is essentially like a traditional beehive. It's completely backwards compatible, so it uses the same frame, same bees. We populate these robotic beehives, and in that robotic beehive, there's cameras that monitor the bees,\" said Saar Safra, CEO of Beewise.</p>\n    <p>The cameras connect with AI software that monitors each individual bee and identifies its needs. The robotic apparatus can then treat the bees according to their characteristics.</p>\n    <p>\"So if there's not enough food in the hive, there's a food container inside this robotic beehive and the robot will take some food supply to the bees. Same thing with medicine, thermoregulation, too cold, too warm, there's a storm. We can keep the bees comfortable in their home without them being harmed by external weather patterns,\" said Safra.</p>\n    <p>Last year, hurricanes Helene and Milton damaged or destroyed thousands of commercial beehives in Florida, Georgia and North Carolina alone.</p>\n    <p>The BeeHome costs about the same as the traditional wooden beehive and can robotically manage up to 10 hives each, saving growers on labor costs. Next-gen products could scale that up dramatically — a feature particularly attractive to investors.</p>\n    <p>\"You'll be looking at a BeeHome in a few years that can not only manage 10, but go up to 40 or more. And that's where you get a lot of operating margin and operating profit off of the same investment,\" said John Caddedu, co-founder and general partner at Corner Ventures.</p>\n    <p>Safra said the Beehome results in 70% lower bee colony loss and healthier hives. There are already thousands of these operating in the field. Safra said revenue, device and customer growth have been enormous, adding that the devices are seeing gross margins of 40%.</p>\n    <p>In addition to Corner Ventures, Beewise is backed by Insight Partners, Fortissimo, Lool Ventures, and APG. Its total funding so far is $170 million.</p>\n    <p><i>CNBC producer Lisa Rizzolo contributed to this piece.</i> </p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>OpenAI's public launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 is widely viewed as the event that kicked off the generative AI boom, which remains the dominant theme in the tech industry almost three years later.</p>\n    <p>Notion jumped on the bandwagon early.</p>\n    <p>Two weeks before ChatGPT hit the market, the productivity software startup <a href=\"https://www.notion.com/blog/introducing-notion-ai\">announced</a> its own artificial intelligence feature using an OpenAI model. Notion AI was designed to be a \"writing assistant\" that could help a user with brainstorming, editing and summarizing, the company said.</p>\n    <p>\"We're at an important inflection point,\" CEO Ivan Zhao wrote in a blog post at the time. \"The potential of artificial intelligence has grown exponentially, and will continue to grow.\"</p>\n    <p>The AI wave has pushed Notion past $500 million in annualized revenue, the company now tells CNBC, which ranked the company 34th on its 2025 <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/notion-cnbc-disruptor-50.html\">Disruptor 50 list</a>. The latest developments landed on Thursday as Notion launched a customizable agent that can create documents to pull in data from many sources, using models from the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic.</p>\n    <p>Akshay Kothari, Notion's co-founder and operating chief, said in an interview that the company is racing to keep up with enterprise demand for AI tools. Corporate clients include Kaiser Permanente, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/\">Nvidia</a> and Volvo Cars.</p>\n    <p>\"We're doubling this year and likely going to double the sales team next year,\" Kothari said. He added that about 90% of the business comes from \"multiplayer usage,\" or teams of workers.</p>\n    <p>Notion was founded in 2013, two years before OpenAI was created as a nonprofit AI lab. The company, which now has about 1,000 employees, launched the first version of its product in 2016 and says it has over 100 million users.</p>\n    <p>But unlike most startups that have boomed with the rise of generative AI, Notion hasn't raised outside capital in a long time. Its <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/10/08/notion-raises-at-10-billion-valuation-boosted-by-remote-work-tiktok/\">most recent fundraising round</a> came in 2021, when the big driver for cloud-based collaboration software was the Covid pandemic and remote work. In October of that year, Notion raised $275 million at a $10 billion valuation.</p>\n    <p>Kothari says the company has more cash on hand than the $330 million it's raised to date.</p>\n    <p>In May, Notion introduced Ai products for summarizing meetings and searching through corporate files. Annual revenue growth has accelerated every month since then, Kothari said, though he declined to provide growth rates.</p>\n    <p>Thursday's announcement includes the rollout of a preview of an additional feature called custom agents, which can perform actions in the background. As an example, a custom agent can be instructed to produce and send a list of articles that are relevant to a person's interests every week.</p>\n    <p>Kothari said that last year 10% to 20% of Notion customers were paying for AI add-ons. That shot up to 30% or 40% earlier this year and recently crossed 50%, he said.</p>\n    <p>At that point, the company started including AI in its business and enterprise plans, without charging extra, Kothari said, adding that the company is talking with clients about a fair pricing model for custom agents.</p>\n    <p>Productivity software is a highly competitive space, with <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/\">Microsoft</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/\">Google</a> at the center. </p>\n    <p>Weeks after Notion's big financing round in 2021, Microsoft <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/02/microsoft-launches-loop-office-app-for-real-time-collaboration.html\">announced Loop</a>, an app for working on documents. The product, which resembles Notion, became available to organizations with Microsoft 365 productivity software subscriptions in 2023. </p>\n    <p>Microsoft is also pushing Copilot, an AI assistant that can spit out Word documents and Outlook emails. Google, meanwhile, offers the Gemini AI option for its Google Workspace applications.</p>\n    <p>Ramp, a business credit card startup, pays for the Gemini AI option for Google Workspace apps. But the company has encouraged people to migrate documents and project tracking to Notion, said Ben Levick, Ramp's head of operations, in an email.</p>\n    <p>Levick said that nine out of 10 employees at Ramp, which has a workforce of 1,200, now use Notion's AI features every month, and the company is testing custom agents to answer internal inquiries and to connect sales feedback with forthcoming products that could address requests from clients.</p>\n    <p><strong>WATCH:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/09/12/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-on-what-the-market-is-getting-wrong-about-ai.html\">Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff on what the market is getting wrong about AI</a></p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108198369-6ED4-REQ-091225-BrennanBenioff-FULL.jpg?v=1757706413&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff on what the market is getting wrong about AI\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>",

CEO Francesco Milleri said in February that two million units had been sold since its debut.</p>\n    <p>EssilorLuxottica revealed in its second-quarter<a href=\"https://www.essilorluxottica.com/cap/content/259500/\"> earnings report</a> that revenue from Ray-Ban Meta glasses more than tripled during the first half compared to the year before.</p>\n    <p>The company said the success of the smart glasses and the Oakley Meta Performance AI glasses, which launched in June, helped it hit overall sales during Q2 of 7.2 billion euro, or $8.5 billion.</p>\n    <p>While it's still unclear whether Meta's bet on smart glasses will pay off, the company is facing growing competition.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/\">Google</a> announced a $150 million partnership with <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/20/warby-parker-google-glasses-xr.html\">Warby Parker</a> to develop AI glasses in May, while <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SNAP/\">Snap</a> revealed in June plans to release its sixth generation of augmented reality glasses in 2026.

They can't, however, sell physical items, such as t-shirts.</p>\n    <p>While developers will \"ordinarily\" earn 50% of the V-Bucks value from item sales, from December 2025 until December 2026, the rate will be 100%.</p>\n    <p>However, that doesn't mean they'll creators will earn 100% of sales revenue.</p>\n    <p>In the press release announcing this new sales feature, Epic Games explained how the share of in-game sales is distributed to creators.</p>\n    <blockquote><p>\"In recent years, Epic has been investing and operating the business at a loss\"</p>Epic Games</blockquote>\n    <p>To determine the V-Bucks value in US dollars in a given month, the company totals all customer real-money spending on V-Bucks (converted to US dollars) and then subtracts platform and store fees. These can range from 12% on the Epic Game Store to 30% on current consoles. Epic Games then divides this by the total V-Bucks spent by Fortnite players.</p>\n    <p>Fortnite's average platform and store fees are currently 26%, Epic Games said, with \"specific fees\" ranging from 12% to 30% on consoles.</p>\n    <p>So, from December 2025 to December 2026, the 100% V-Bucks value creators will earn will translate to a roughly 74% cut of in-game sales.</p>\n    <p>From January 1, 2027, however, that amount will drop by half, a 50% V-Bucks value equating to a roughly 37% cut of in-game sales for creators.</p>\n    <p>Epic Games said the other 50% enables the company \"to cover the costs of servicing the Fortnite ecosystem.\"</p>\n    <p>\"The funds that don't go back to creators contribute to server hosting costs, safety, and moderation costs, R&amp;D and other operating expenses,\" Epic Games said. \"In recent years, Epic has been investing and operating the business at a loss.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Share-of-In-Game-Sales.png?width=690&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp\"/>\n    <p>In addition, Epic Games is updating its engagement payout formula, which issues payouts to creators based on engagement in their islands, to \"better reward creators for bringing in new or reengaging lapsed players in Fortnite.\"</p>\n    <p>The current payout formula adds 40% of the net revenue from Fortnite's Item Shop and related real-money purchases into the engagement pool, which is distributed among creators' and Epic's islands.</p>\n    <p>But, from November 1, 2025, Fortnite creators \"that bring in new or lapsed players\" will receive 75% of those players' contributions to the engagement payout pool for their first six months.</p>\n    <p>To identify players and islands that fall under this banner, Epic Games will factor in \"signals from direct links, in-game search usage, and first-day playtime patterns.\"</p>\n    <p>Epic Games is also changing the retention component of these engagement payouts, now rewarding \"island-specific retention, rather than ecosystem-wide retention\" to \"better align with creators' own efforts in growing this metric.\"</p>\n    <p>However, to combat fraudulent engagement, this engagement payout formula will only consider players who have made purchases on their accounts.</p>\n    <blockquote><p>\"Since UEFN launched, players have spent over 11.2 billion hours across 260,000 live creator-made islands\"</p>Epic Games</blockquote>\n    <p>Epic Games has said this will \"not reduce the total engagement payout pool,\" it instead \"shifts the calculation\" so that the playtime of non-payers isn't considered.</p>\n    <p>As such, the engagement payout formula now covers minutes played, new user acquisition, lapsed user acquisition, playtime surrounding V-Bucks spend, and island retention.</p>\n    <p>Epic Games is also introducing a \"prominent\" Sponsored Row in Discover on November 24 2025, so that \"creators can choose to spend money to receive increased visibility for their islands.\"</p>\n    <p>\"All creators will have transparent market data to bid for placement in the row and enter an auction to surface islands in the new Sponsored Row,\" Epic Games said. \"All other rows in Discover will remain unchanged, continuing to provide organic visibility to islands.\"</p>\n    <p>In the \"long-term,\" 50% of revenue from sponsorship generated by this feature will go into the engagement payout pool, but from launch until the end of 2026, 100% will enter the pool.</p>\n    <p>Other creator-focused additions coming to Fortnite include the ability for creators to set up campaigns in the creator portal, starting November 17, 2025, and the launch of Fortnite Creator Communities \"in the next few months,\" allowing creators to connect and share updates with their players.</p>\n    <p>\"Since UEFN launched, players have spent over 11.2 billion hours across 260,000 live creator-made islands, which has resulted in $722,000,000 paid out to date,\" Epic Games said.</p>\n    <p>\"We'll continue investing in new tools that unlock more development possibilities for creators.\"</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Almost £1.5 million has been raised by the concert so far.</p>\n    <p>Among the highlights were Neneh Cherry, Greentea Peng and Dan Smith of Bastille who joined forces for a spine-tingling version of Cherry’s 1994 hit 7 Seconds.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, Annie Lennox contributed a pre-recorded new version of Why, with rewritten lyrics. It will be available on streaming platforms over the coming days with all proceeds going to the Together For Palestine fund.</p>\n    <p>The London Arab Orchestra were joined by Damon Albarn and played a medley of Palestinian traditional songs to some of the loudest cheers of the night. The lights then dimmed to reveal Yasiin Bey (formerly known as the rapper Mos Def) who recited a profound prayer. He was then accompanied by Albarn and Omar Souleyman for a preview of a brand new Gorillaz track Damascus.</p>\n    <p>Want all the hottest music and gear news, reviews, deals, features and more, direct to your inbox?

It was a very rare public appearance from the group, who proved that even if they’re unable to make new music, they can still move many to tears with their old songs, in this case a version of Roads from the 1994 debut album.</p>\n    <p>Then there was Eric Cantona, and Mahmoud Sarsak. Sarsak was the teammate of Suleiman al-Obeid, the so-called ‘Palestinian Pele’ who was killed by Israeli Defence Forces last month whilst was doing nothing more than waiting for humanitarian aid.</p>\n    <p>Cantona unequivocally called on football authorities to boycott Israel, saying “clubs everywhere must refuse to play Israeli teams… football fans around the world, recognise your power - those teams represent you. It’s time for everyone to get off the sidelines, who will follow me?”</p>\n    <p>There were others, of course.

And later, the platform you may have used to buy and download music.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Of course, for people of a certain age, ‘iTunes’ never really went away - it’s still the name they use for Apple Music, the app that replaced it - but in reality, it now exists only in the memory and on older computers.</p>\n    <p>But wait, because thanks to - you guessed it - Taylor Swift, iTunes is back in the headlines.</p>\n    <p>Swift has long been a fan of releasing multiple physical versions of her albums (and long been criticised for it in some quarters) but for her latest release, The Life of a Showgirl, she’s offering an exclusive digital edition… via iTunes.</p>\n    <p>Which means that, to the internet’s excitement, <a href=\"https://x.com/iTunes/status/1965856114500853910\">Apple’s long-dormant iTunes X/Twitter account has sprung back to life</a>, with a first post since 2019 saying: “The Life of a showgirl era takes center stage. <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-life-of-a-showgirl-a-look-behind-the-curtain/1838812720?ct=mrd-gb-1145822629556838701&amp;itscg=30200&amp;itsct=music_box_link&amp;ls=1\">Pre-order Taylor Swift’s new album on iTunes now</a> and get exclusive content once it drops on October 3rd.”</p>\n    <p>That ‘exclusive content’ appears to be different cover art and a video titled A Look Behind the Curtain - some kind of short behind-the-scenes ‘making of’ documentary, we assume.</p>\n    <p>It should be noted that, if you’re a subscriber to Apple Music, you’ll be able to listen to the album at no extra cost - and watch the video, too, presumably. If not, you can head to the iTunes Store section in Apple Music (there’s no need to download a different app) and purchase it for $/£11.99.</p>\n    <p>Want all the hottest music and gear news, reviews, deals, features and more, direct to your inbox? Sign up here.</p>\n    <p>It’s not hard to see why Swift is keen to get people to pay for a download of her album rather than stream it. Not only will the royalties be higher, but it may also help with chart performance - in most charts, paid-for downloads carry a heavier weighting than streams.</p>\n    <p>Although this all feels anomalous in the streaming era, it’s worth remembering that iTunes exclusive releases and other partnerships with artists used to be quite the thing. The most famous and controversial of them came in 2014, when <a href=\"https://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/u2-release-new-album-songs-of-innocence-free-on-itunes-606920\">a deal between Apple and U2 saw the band’s new Songs of Innocence album being automatically ‘sent’ to the ‘Purchased’ section of around 500 million iTunes account holders</a>, whether they wanted it or not.</p>\n    <p>While <a href=\"https://www.musicradar.com/tag/u2\">U2</a> fans who got the album for free were doubtless delighted, many other people weren’t too impressed with being force-fed the band’s new record, and <a href=\"https://www.musicradar.com/news/bono-u2-itunes-first-rehearsal-edge\">Bono reflected on the episode in his 2022 memoir, Surrender: 40 Songs, One Story</a>.</p>\n    <p>\"If just getting our music to people who like our music was the idea, that was a good idea,” he wrote. “But if the idea was getting our music to people who might not have had a remote interest in our music, maybe there might be some pushback. But what was the worst that could happen? It would be like junk mail. Wouldn’t it? Like taking our bottle of milk and leaving it on the doorstep of every house in the neighbourhood.</p>\n    <p>\"On 9 September 2014, we didn’t just put our bottle of milk at the door but in every fridge in every house in town,\" he continued. \"In some cases we poured it on to the good people’s cornflakes. And some people like to pour their own milk. And others are lactose intolerant.”</p>\n    <p>Seemingly accepting that it probably wasn’t such a good idea, Bono was happy to take responsibility: \"I’d thought if we could just put our music within reach of people, they might choose to reach out toward it. Not quite,” he said.</p>\n    <p>Whether Taylor Swift’s fans will be happy to pony up for a digital download of The Life of a Showgirl remains to be seen, but with dedicated portable audio players apparently enjoying something of a resurgence, maybe that finely-tuned business brain of hers might be onto something yet again...</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aYg5YZu3zHChqtca23nm9i.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Rogerson\"/>\n    <p>I’m the Deputy Editor of MusicRadar, having worked on the site since its launch in 2007.

Aimed primarily at DJs and producers, there are a number of focused models available at different price points. </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The latest additions to the range are the M-100 Pro, which is an upgraded version of the M-100, and our review model, the M-10. Both have Hi-Res Audio certification from the Japan Audio Society, and the M-10 is one of V-Moda’s more affordable designs, replacing its popular <a href=\"https://www.musicradar.com/news/roland-v-moda-rolling-stones-headphones\">Crossfade LP2</a>.</p>\n    <p>M-10 is a <a href=\"https://www.musicradar.com/news/best-closed-back-headphones\">closed-back</a> over-ear design with V-Moda’s distinctive ear cup shape. The drivers are 50mm dual diaphragm units that incorporate Japanese-made hi-res CCAW coils. Meanwhile, the ear pads use memory foam for excellent comfort and good passive isolation.</p>\n    <p>The ear cups feature black metal shields on the outer face and like other V-Moda headphones, these can be swapped out for a number of other designs and colours. Alas, this visually appealing aspect is being gradually phased out by Roland and moving forward, it will not be replenishing stock. Whether third-party vendors step in, as is the case with replacement ear cups, remains to be seen.</p>\n    <p>Finally, M-10 comes with 2 cables – a 1.5m braided straight cable (⅛” to ⅛” with ¼” converter) and a 3m coiled cable (¼” to ⅛”). In the box, you also get a drawstring storage pouch.</p>\n    <p> <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6ZfKKwX9DG7tVm2dk5BKKm.jpg\" alt=\"V-Moda M-10 headphones\"/></p>\n    <h3>Performance</h3>\n    <p>M-10 is a solidly built headphone and the combination of metal and plastic is robust without feeling bulky. The slimline metal arm and flexible branded headband are common features with V-Moda headphones and help keep the headphones pretty compact. Unlike the more DJ-friendly M-100 and reference style M-200, the M-10 arms do not include their CliqFold hinge, so you can’t fold them away.</p>\n    <p>In terms of comfort, at 275g these are a very reasonable weight for a closed-back design. Meanwhile, with them on, the passive isolation is also very good. You’ll find left/right labelling hidden on the inside of the headband, although a more obvious indicator is the red flashing on the right ear cup cable. The cable only connects to the left ear cup, which, although not as flexible as some of their models, does assist with orientation.</p>\n    <p>Want all the hottest music and gear news, reviews, deals, features and more, direct to your inbox?

Unsurprisingly, we found it sounded great with beat-heavy genres such as trap and hip hop, where low-end sounds are clearly separated. It also sounded good with techno and house sounds.</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>Low-end sounds are clearly separated</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>What’s more, the aforementioned high-end clarity is also a key aspect, and even though the headphones are not obviously enhanced in the high frequencies, the separation is clean and smooth. For these genres the tonal balance is pretty satisfying even if it’s not particularly neutral, plus you can turn the headphones up pretty loud, which will please some users.</p>\n    <p>With genres such as rock, where the low and low mid frequency instrumentation is often more blended, the M-10 is less forgiving and we found this quite fatiguing. This is no surprise and clearly the M-10 is not tuned for this type of music.</p>\n    <p> <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8y5Zbts6TWknc2bT2wJRJm.jpg\" alt=\"V-Moda M-10 headphones\"/></p>\n    <h3>Verdict</h3>\n    <p>All told, the M-10s are well-made headphones with a specific target user in mind, and from a sonic perspective, they deliver precisely what they aim to. That said, they are clearly less flexible than the M-100 and M-200 models.</p>\n    <h3>Alternatives</h3>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1021&amp;xcust=mrd_gb_1157856151803853349&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sennheiser.com%2Fen-gb%2Fcatalog%2Fproducts%2Fheadphones%2Fhd-25%2Fhd-25-506909%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOoq0e3X4gXZ3UCL2rftxaSb1Hku11yE492fXLsfzheiqGfdHnbfU&amp;sref\">Sennheiser HD 25:</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1021&amp;xcust=mrd_gb_1157856151803853349&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sennheiser.com%2Fen-gb%2Fcatalog%2Fproducts%2Fheadphones%2Fhd-25%2Fhd-25-506909%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOoq0e3X4gXZ3UCL2rftxaSb1Hku11yE492fXLsfzheiqGfdHnbfU&amp;sref\">£117 at sennheiser.com</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>These classic over-ear headphones are compact, robust and popular for location recording and DJ use.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Read the full </strong>\n      <strong>Sennheiser HD 25 review</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.adam-audio.com/en/headphones/h200/\">Adam Audio H200:</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.adam-audio.com/en/headphones/h200/\">£139 at adam-audio.com</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>If you’re after a more general purpose closed-back design, this model offers great value.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Read the full </strong>\n      <strong>Adam Audio H200 review</strong>\n    </p>\n    <h3>Specifications</h3>\n    <table>\n      <row span=\"2\">\n        <cell>\n          <p>Price</p>\n        </cell>\n        <cell>\n          <p>$180 / £152 / €179</p>\n        </cell>\n      </row>\n      <row span=\"2\">\n        <cell>\n          <p>Key features</p>\n        </cell>\n        <cell>\n          <p>Design: closed-back over-ear</p>\n          <p>Driver: 50mm dual diaphragm</p>\n          <p>Frequency response: 5 - 40,000 Hz</p>\n          <p>Impedance: 32ohms +/-3 ohms</p>\n          <p>Sensitivity: 102+/-3dB at 1kHz 1mW</p>\n        </cell>\n      </row>\n      <row span=\"2\">\n        <cell>\n          <p>Weight</p>\n        </cell>\n        <cell>\n          <p>275g</p>\n        </cell>\n      </row>\n      <row>\n        <cell>\n          <p>Contact</p>\n        </cell>\n      </row>\n    </table>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>Jon is a London based platinum award winning mixer, producer, composer and club remixer with a diverse CV that spans dance, pop, rock and music for media.

It was the first song the group – then just Byrne, Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth - wrote when they were still The Artistics.</p>\n<p>It was the first Talking Heads hit single and, famously, it provides an unforgettable opening to the Stop Making Sense concert film; Byrne walking onto an empty stage, playing an acoustic guitar with a portable cassette player by his side.</p>\n<p>The bulk of the material on the band’s first album Talking Heads 77, which was reissued in a super deluxe edition last year, was written by Byrne alone. But Psycho Killer was a true collaboration with all three Heads contributing.</p>\n<p>It dates back to when the band, then still at Rhode Island School of Design, were preparing for their debut gig in the winter of 1973/1974.</p>\n<p>Talking to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/11/01/1209679558/david-byrne-talking-heads-stop-making-sense\">Fresh Air</a> on NPR in November 2023, Byrne remembers it as “an experiment to see if I could write a song.” The initial idea was to cross Alice Cooper with Randy Newman.</p>\n<p>“I thought I'd have the kind of dramatic subject that Alice Cooper might use, but then look at kind of an interior monologue, the way Randy Newman might do it.

Sign up here.</p>\n<p>\"So we're not going to talk about the violence or anything like that, but we'll just get inside this guy's kind of muddled-up, slightly twisted thoughts.”</p>\n<p>Chris Frantz, speaking to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1021&amp;xcust=mrd_gb_1028256807261061629&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thevinyldistrict.com%2Fstorefront%2Fchris-frantz-the-tvd-interview%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3D%25E2%2580%259CI%2520said%252C%2520%27Whoa%21%2Cwe%2520went%2520to%2520New%2520York.%25E2%2580%259D&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.musicradar.com%2Fartists%2Fsingles-albums%2Fi-dont-know-what-he-was-thinking-but-he-went-into-the-little-kitchen-behind-the-control-room-and-returned-with-a-carving-knife-how-david-byrne-created-a-sinister-new-wave-classic\">The Vinyl District</a> in 2021 remembers the day Byrne presented his bandmates with his idea: “One day Tina and I were painting,” he recalled. “There was a knock on the door and it was David.</p>\n<p>\"He said, I’ve got a song, it’s pretty cool, it’s sort of based on the style of Alice Cooper. And I thought, wow! Because Alice Cooper was the No. 1 hit artist of the time, he had hit big with Billion Dollar Babies and songs like that.</p>\n<p>\"So David sat down in our studio with his little acoustic guitar—a very beat-up, funky, guitar that had paint splatters on it. And he started to play:</p>\n<p>\n      <i>I can’t seem to face up to the facts</i>\n      <i>I’m tense and nervous and I can’t relax</i>\n      <i>I can’t sleep ‘cause my bed’s on fire</i>\n      <i>Don’t touch me cause I’m a real live wire.\"</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Byrne envisaged the bridge part spoken in a foreign language. He asked a Japanese student to contribute some lyrics, but when Byrne told her the song title, she turned him down flat.</p>\n<p>Tina Weymouth though knew some French and wrote the lyrics from the perspective of a Norman Bates-style character. Their English translation is:</p>\n<p>\n      <i>What I did that night</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>What she said that night</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Realising my hopes</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>I launch myself towards a glorious destiny.</i>\n    </p>\n<p><br/>“The voice of a true psycho killer speaking,” Chris Frantz wrote in his memoir Remain In Love.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the drummer came up with the verse that starts: ‘You start a conversation, you can’t even finish it’ and before they knew it the trio had come up with something that, in Frantz’s words, sounded “like a mash-up of the Velvet Underground and Otis Redding.”</p>\n<p>The song would be a staple of the band’s set through their evolution into Talking Heads and throughout their CBGB years. But when it came to recording the track for their debut album, producers Tony Bongiovi and Lance Quinn thought Byrne’s vocals on the track needed a little something extra.</p>\n<p>“Tony was bugged by David’s singing style,” wrote Frantz. “I don’t know what he was thinking, but he went into the little kitchen behind the control room and returned with a carving knife.</p>\n<p>\"With great seriousness, he told David to get into character and to hold the knife in his hand while singing the words. In the control room, jaws with dropping.”</p>\n<p>“David said ‘No that’s not going to work.’ We decided to take a break. David told us he could not sing with Tony in the room and wanted Ed (Stasium, engineer) to kick him out of the studio. Ed had another idea.</p>\n<p>\"He said ‘Why don’t we try moonlighting when Tony isn’t around? You know, before he gets here or after he leaves.’ That was agreeable to all and Tony never even knew the difference.”</p>\n<p>The album was released in September 1977 and in December, Psycho Killer was pulled from it as a single. It was a Top 20 hit in the Netherlands and Belgium and reached No 92 in the US Billboard chart, a not inconsiderable achievement for a still-largely unknown band in a genre (new wave) that had yet to make any sort of national impact.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

And, yes, he’s playing this fretted, in Open E, which kind of blows our mind twice over. Trucks admits that he sometimes forgets he even has the slide with him.</p>\n    <p>“Yeah, I’m still in open E and it’s funny, I don’t even think about it anymore,” he says. “We change our setlist every night, and I don’t really think about those details when I’m writing a setlist, but there was, I think last night or the night before, an hour-and-a-half set, we were playing before another band, and I think we got about an hour in, and I was like, ‘I haven’t even pulled the slide out of my pocket yet! [Laughs] I forgot!’ I was like, ‘I should probably probably rip that thing out here sooner or later!’”</p>\n    <p>Seeing Tedeschi Trucks Band live and not seeing some slide playing from Trucks would be like seeing Little Richard and him not playing Good Golly, Miss Molly, or Motörhead not playing Ace Of Spades. But the truth is, Trucks leaves that decision on whether or not to use the slide to the last minute – if you could even call it a decision at all.</p>\n    <p>“Some nights you just feel more inspired one way or the other, definitely depending on the tune,” he says. “There’s some songs that just call for a certain things. A lot of the tunes, it’s last minute.</p>\n    <p>Want all the hottest music and gear news, reviews, deals, features and more, direct to your inbox?

But it’s fun to be able to kind of dip back and forth into those worlds.”</p>\n    <p>And it doesn’t mean a solo needs to be always slide or always fretted; it might change the grammar of the solo, how it’s phrased, where the accents go, but it still retains the same musical information – the solo is still delivering the same message.</p>\n    <p>It is like how Trucks’ friend and fellow <a href=\"https://www.musicradar.com/artists/warren-haynes-the-whisper-sessions\">Allman Brothers Band alumnus Warren Haynes put his own spin on Blue Sky</a> by performing it live with a slide. Trucks says the tune will tell you what it needs.</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>You hear guys like Jeff Beck and you’re like, ‘Oh, you you can play without a slide and make it sound like a slide</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>“You hear guys like <a href=\"https://www.musicradar.com/tag/jeff-beck\">Jeff Beck</a> and you’re like, ‘Oh, you you can play without a slide and make it sound like a slide,’” he says. “There are some nights where maybe you play more lyrical without the slide and a little more angular with it. It’s fun to be able to to kind of challenge yourself that way.”</p>\n    <p>In other Tedeschi Trucks Band news, <a href=\"https://www.musicradar.com/artists/derek-trucks-on-tedeschi-trucks-band-new-album-and-mad-dogs-and-englishmen-revisited-live-at-lockn\">Trucks recently revealed to MusicRadar that the band has recorded 17 songs for a new album</a>, and is already playing them live.

    "body": "<p>Will craft beer lovers still host “bottle shares” if bottles themselves cease to exist? That may sound like a modern-day Zen koan, but it’s not exactly beyond contemplation.</p>\n<p>This summer, cans made up about <a href=\"https://www.brewersassociation.org/insights/a-good-time-to-be-single-2024-packaging-trends/\">76 percent</a> of craft beer’s slipping retail sales, according to the Brewers Association, with glass dropping to just 24 percent, a major shift from where things were less than a generation ago. Back in 2013, bottles were so ubiquitous in the craft beer world that beer-focused meetups were understandably named after them, and the folks at Sam Adams could make <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/larryolmsted/2013/05/01/craft-beers-say-hello-cans-goodbye-bottles-an-aluminum-revolution/\">headlines</a> for simply planning to “do something they have never done in this country in their 29 years of existence: sell beer in a can.”</p>\n<p>Things have shifted substantially since the days of the second Obama administration, to put it mildly, with cans moving from the new hotness to the industry standard. But as the pendulum swings to its furthest point, cans are evolving in new ways, while traditional glass bottles seem to be turning into a type of branding or a signifier unto themselves. Canning may have changed craft beer culture forever, but additional shifts are clearly coming down the pipe.</p>\n<h2>The Message of Craft Cans</h2>\n<p>OG craft beer fans remember the first ISO cans of the early days of the movement, starting with Dale’s Pale Ale, which Oskar Blues originally launched in its local market in 2002, followed a few years later by the brewery’s groundbreaking Ten Fidy, described as “a beer from a small Colorado brewery which has gained somewhat of a cult following lately, due to its scarcity” by an early reviewer in one <a href=\"https://blogaboutbeer.com/ten-fidy-one-imperial-stout/\">2008 blog pos</a>t. That was the first imperial stout anyone I knew saw in a can, and one of the early turning points for the spread of cans nationwide. Ten Fidy showed that cans could work for small breweries in that era, including styles beyond lawnmower beer, as Sayre Piotrkowski, an Advanced Cicerone and the executive director of the Bay Area Brewers Guild, recalls.</p>\n<p>“The can was novel and had charm when Oskar Blues was doing it way before everybody else,” he says.</p>\n<p>Cans grew steadily over the next decade, and by the time the pandemic started in early 2020, many if not most craft breweries were offering the same format — 4-packs of 16.9-ounce cans — for retail sales. Social distancing and pandemic restrictions pushed even more breweries into packaging for off-premise sales, almost universally in the same 4-packs. With just about every local brewery using the same packaging to sell its products at the retail level, the 4-pack itself started to mean something to consumers. “That format came to indicate, rightfully or wrongly, that this is fresh, local beer,” Piotrkowski says.</p>\n<p>Long after most craft brewers had switched to cans, one subset of the beer world conspicuously stuck to old-fashioned bottles: imports, especially those from traditional Old World producers. Eventually, however, that piece of the puzzle also fell into place. By December 2021, grocery store shoppers could also buy Saison Dupont — which claims a history dating to 1844 — in modern craft-beer 4-packs. Today, Dupont is selling about twice as much in the U.S. as it was before it added cans to its options, according to Lauren Summer, a senior manager at <a href=\"http://www.totalbeveragesolution.com\">Total Beverage Solution</a>, the brewery’s importer.</p>\n<p>“It’s honestly been a great resurgence for the brand,” she says. “Having that pack format is opening up doors for us.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>“Because the shipping is lighter, we’re able to bring the price point a little bit down. So that got us into some retailers that previously weren’t willing to give us a shot.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>Those doors include more on-premise sales — that is, bars and restaurants — that previously wouldn’t or couldn’t stock Saison Dupont in bottles. The packaged version is even leading to increased interest in the draft version.</p>\n<p>“Those pack formats are allowing us to get into on-premise accounts where we didn’t have a shot in the dark in the past,” Summer says. In part, she credits the familiarity of the packaging to more “craft-centric” outlets carrying the beer, instead of just “Belgian import” accounts.</p>\n<h2>Context Is Everything</h2>\n<p>Other importers are having similar experiences, though not always with the same approach. Like Total Beverage Solutions, <a href=\"http://www.specialtybeer.com\">D&amp;V International</a> now offers cans for a limited number of its European imports, after first experimenting with cans of St. Bernardus Wit in 2018. That beer was chosen because it was a relatively new style for the brewery and not among the importer’s leading sellers at the time, according to sales director James Curti.</p>\n<p>“Obviously, it worked tremendously well,” he says. “The cans made it one of our top SKUs.” Other beers from the brewery, including its annual Christmas Ale and St. Bernardus Tokyo, originally developed for the Japanese market, are now also available in cans. But with an eye on tradition, the Belgian producer has kept St. Bernardus Abt 12 and its other traditional ales in glass.</p>\n<p>One big benefit of importing cans from Europe is reduced weight and space, which led to Trader Joe’s recently agreeing to stock cans of the Christmas Ale.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

It's always both.\"</i> Brooklyn zombie mash! IFC Films has debuted the official trailer for a horror comedy movie called <strong> Queens of the Dead</strong>, a queer zombie comedy made by filmmaker Tina Romero (daughter of the legendary zombie master George A. Romero - who passed away in 2017). Drag queens and club kids battle zombies craving brains during a zombie outbreak at their drag show inside a warehouse in Brooklyn, putting personal conflicts aside to utilize their distinct abilities against the undead threat. The film premiered the 2025 Tribeca Festival – where it won an Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature – and later screened at the Fantasia Film Festival up in Montreal a few months ago. </p><p><i>Queens of the Dead</i>is now set to open in theaters starting</p><p><a href=\"https://www.firstshowing.net/schedule2025/#oct\">in October</a>(of course!) before it's streaming on Shudder. The fun ensemble cast includes</p><p><strong>Katy O'Brian</strong>,</p><p><strong>Jaquel Spivey</strong>,</p><p><strong>Tomas Matos</strong>,</p><p><strong>Nina West</strong>,</p><p><strong>Quincy Dunn-Baker</strong>,</p><p><strong>Jack Haven</strong>,</p><p><strong>Cheyenne Jackson</strong>,</p><p><strong>Dominique Jackson</strong>,</p><p><strong>Margaret Cho</strong>,</p><p><strong>Riki Lindhome</strong>, &amp; others. This looks like some wacky, weird, wild and kinky horror fun even if it's another familiar zombie riff.</p><p>Here's the official trailer (+ posters) for Tina Romero's film <strong> Queens of the Dead</strong>, direct from </p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gUjCvASN4\">YouTube</a>:</p><p><graphic src=\"https://media2.firstshowing.net/firstshowing/img17/QueensoftheDeadpostermain592.jpg\" alt=\"Queens of the Dead Poster\"/></p><p><graphic src=\"https://media2.firstshowing.net/firstshowing/img17/QueensoftheDeadpostermain591.jpg\" alt=\"Queens of the Dead Poster\"/></p><p><i>It’s Easter in Bushwick, and a different kind of resurrection is at hand... In Queens of the Dead, a zombie apocalypse breaks out in Brooklyn on the night of a giant warehouse party, where an eclectic group of drag queens, club kids, &amp; frenemies must put aside their drama and use their unique skills to fight against the brain-thirsty, scrolling undead. They’re all forced to resolve their differences and find a way to band together and survive.</i> <i>Queens of the Dead</i> is directed by up-and-coming genre filmmaker <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0739590/\"> Tina Romero</a>, making her feature directorial debut after a few short films previously. The screenplay is written by Tina Romero and Erin Judge. Produced by Natalie Metzger &amp; Matthew Lee Miller.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>LONDON — What does socialism look like when earnestly perpetuated by extraordinarily wealthy benefactors sorely lacking in self-awareness? One answer might be found in <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/exhibitions/radical-harmony-neo-impressionists\"> Radical Harmony: Helene Kröller-Müller’s Neo-Impressionists</a> at the National Gallery. This can be seen both in its selection of works from Helene Kröller-Müller’s Pointillism (or more correctly, Neo-Impressionism) collection, and in the exhibition’s commercial supporters. Our </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1010475/the-cortaulds-impressionism-show-is-a-victim-of-corporate-curating/\">friends Griffin Catalyst</a>, which is stewarded by a</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/business/dealbook/ken-griffin-trump-election.html\">billionaire CEO and Trump backer</a>, once again serves the people an exhibition in which critical curation takes a back seat.</p>\n    <p>Kröller-Müller was born into a German family of industrialists, married a Dutch entrepreneur, and moved to the Netherlands in 1888. After becoming widowed, she inherited the business and became one of the wealthiest women in the Netherlands. She amassed 11,500 works and the world’s largest collection of Neo-Impressionism, and acquired 90 works by Vincent van Gogh, often buying directly from the artist and close relatives. She eventually opened her own museum, stating that the works looked “monumental in a museum, more beautiful than in a room.” The wall labels<strong> </strong>also venture that “the aims this remarkable collector hoped to realise shared Neo-Impressionism’s socialist ambition: by widening access to works made through a radical quest for harmony in art, the world might become a better place.” Ah, the idealism of excessive wealth.</p>\n    <p>Neo-Impressionism is explained as<strong> </strong>the application of dots of opposing colors together, so that they become more vivid, as opposed to mixing colors on a chromatic scale and applying them with complete freedom of brushstroke. While radical in theory, this prescriptive method is thoroughly restrictive to the point of banality, as viewing so many examples en masse proves. Individual hues may “pop” to the eye, but images are confined to flat linearity, almost like “coloring in” sections, as opposed to building up painterly layers as traditional modeling allows.</p>\n    <p>Seascapes should be brilliantly vivid celebrations of light — but, as in Jan Toorop’s “Sea” of 1899, they appear insipid here, as the method is inadequate for capturing depth and thoroughly lacking impact. The rare exceptions prove the point: While van Gogh’s “The Sower” (1888) employs opposing yellow and blue, his use of longer, layered strokes infuses the work with thrilling dynamism. And Georges Lemmen’s 1890 portrait of Jan Toorop varies the size of the “dot,” again to exciting effect. The majority of the rest of the works here, though …. Just think about how a dot is by nature one-dimensional. Regardless of their number, in this format, they will only ever form a collection of dots.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Jan-Toorop-Sea-1899-1200x1109.jpg?resize=1200%2C1109&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Much is made of the politically radical — “socialistic” — iconographic content, such as Jan Toorop’s depiction of workers in “Evening: Before the Strike” and “Morning: After the Strike” (1899–90), or Maximilien Luce’s rendering of workers in “The Iron Foundry” (1899). At least the wall text for the latter notes that, despite buying direct from the artist, Kröller-Müller’s husband, “without any apparent sense of irony,” hung it in the office of his iron ore and shipping business. This absurdity infuses the whole show, which exists because a wealthy benefactor — despite “supporting” the producers by buying from the artist direct — unironically chomped up all examples of an art movement that on paper represents socialist politics but is in itself technically prescriptive and stifling of deviation.</p>\n    <p>Add to this the decidedly perfunctory curating — there is a room called “The Silent Picture” dedicated to domestic pieces, which argues that this particular technique communicated a sense of isolation, though it’s more an inadvertent effect if you ask me. And add to that the fact that this whole show was perpetuated by commercial supporters such as the philanthropic venture Griffin Catalyst, and the whole show feels more about commerce than curation.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Georges-Lemmen-Jan-Toorop-1890-1-1200x1450.jpg?resize=1200%2C1450&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Maximilien-Luce-The-Iron-Foundry-1899-1-1200x922.jpg?resize=1200%2C922&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Jan-Toorop-Morning-After-the-Strike-About-1888-90-1200x1066.jpg?resize=1200%2C1066&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Georges-Seurat-Port-En-Bessin-a-Sunday-1888-1200x1029.jpg?resize=1200%2C1029&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Installation-view_2-1200x732.jpg?resize=1200%2C732&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <i>Radical Harmony: Helene Kröller-Müller’s Neo-Impressionists</i>\n    </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/exhibitions/radical-harmony-neo-impressionists\">Radical Harmony: Helene Kröller-Müller’s Neo-Impressionists</a> <i>continues at the National Gallery (Trafalgar Square, London) through February 8, 2026.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>BERLIN — Lygia Clark’s current retrospective at the <a href=\"https://www.smb.museum/en/museums-institutions/neue-nationalgalerie/exhibitions/detail/lygia-clark-retrospective/\">Neue Nationalgalerie</a> makes a compelling argument that art, therapy, and politics are far more intimately related than they are often discussed as being.</p>\n    <p>Clark was a pivotal member of the Neo-concretists, a group of Brazilian artists who coalesced in the 1950s around geometric abstraction in two and three dimensions. She often worked in the gap between the two, making both painterly sculptures and paintings with sculptural elements to them. But by the 1960s — and following a military coup in 1964 that installed a brutal military dictatorship in Brazil — she and many of her peers increasingly created art that invited contact not only <i>from</i> visitors, but also <i>between</i> them.</p>\n    <p>In the later 1970s, in pursuit of a way to work at the juncture of art and life, Clark began producing material objects that could work as psychotherapeutic tools by activating or deactivating the various senses, especially touch and sight. Her early forays on view in this exhibition include her <i>Bichos</i> (<i>Creatures</i>), bright silver sculptures composed from pieces of aluminum joined by hinges so each object can take a range of different forms. Also on display are works from her series <i>Nostalgia of the Body</i>, begun the same year as the military coup. These pieces range from the tiny “Diálogo de mãos (Dialogue of Hands),” a collaboration with fellow Brazilian artist Hélio Oiticica consisting of a continuous piece of material meant to join two individuals’ hands together, to the large “A casa é o corpo (The House Is The Body),” a three-phase structure that evokes the physical process of reproduction that is meant to facilitate in visitors a conceptual rebirth. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_3154-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Lygia Clark: Retrospective</i>at Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin (photo Cat Dawson/</p>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>Clark also produced works for groups, including <i>Life Structures</i>, a set of enormous rubber bands into which multiple participants weave themselves, and <i>Anthropophagic Slobber</i>, in which an inert body is gradually encased by colorful thread spun from the mouths of multiple participants in a complex dance that also leaves the weavers tangled together. </p>\n    <p>The Neue Nationalgalerie’s presentation of Clark’s oeuvre diverges noticeably from a major 2014 retrospective of her work at the Museum of Modern Art. Though the latter brought Clark’s work into institutional conversation with more recognizable names in the United States, like Rebecca Horn and Robert Morris, it provided limited opportunity to engage with her sensorial objects. The Neue Nationalgalerie, by contrast, is replete with chances for visitors to interact with the work. While some of the bichos are on plinths, a plethora of replicas are staged on a stepped structure onto which visitors can climb or sit and move the creatures around, and replicas of Clark’s sensory suits — meant to block out sight so participants can focus on exploring their own body or that of another person wearing a conjoined suit — hang from a wall across from plinths holding smaller wearable sensorial objects and a table with replicas of those objects for visitors to try on. On the day I visited, children were playing with bichos on the platform; a couple was trying on a set of mirrored glasses for two; another person posed for a photo in a sensory hood; and a group of people were getting gradually more tangled in a network of interconnected rubber bands.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/20033-1200x810.jpg?resize=1200%2C810&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>For Clark, therapy was a form of survival: Turning inward to find and fortify the self during a military dictatorship was a radical act of self-preservation at a moment when very little recourse was available to the individual subject. Showing others the way to such an understanding, as Clark did for many, is nothing if not a political act. To package that politics as art or therapy gives cover to that act in a context in which its exposure as anything but would put Clark and others like her in danger.</p>\n    <p>The Neue Nationalgalerie show explicates this strategic sleight of hand, a move that feels risky, as so much of our already surveillance-saturated world slides ever more in the direction of authoritarianism. Yet Clark provides something like a roadmap for one way to survive and persevere even in difficult times. Hers is laid bare here, and her invitation to visitors — whether they come for her artistic practice or therapeutic one — remains: slow down, fortify the self through the connective tissues of collectivity, and learn and create new pathways for survival and persistence.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/mV-27nov23_3227_kopie-1200x978.jpg?resize=1200%2C978&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_3163-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Lygia Clark: Retrospective</i>at Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin (photo Cat Dawson/</p>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/60A9612-1200x814.jpg?resize=1200%2C814&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/NNG_Cabea_Coletiva_1969-1200x1786.jpg?resize=1200%2C1786&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/BR_RJANRIO_PH_0_FOT_16596_014-1200x930.jpg?resize=1200%2C930&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_3147-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Lygia Clark: Retrospective</i>at Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin (photo Cat Dawson/</p>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/NNG_Estruturas_de_Caixa_de_Fsforos_1964-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_3161-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Lygia Clark: Retrospective</i>at Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin (photo Cat Dawson/</p>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.smb.museum/en/museums-institutions/neue-nationalgalerie/exhibitions/detail/lygia-clark-retrospective/\">Lygia Clark: Retrospective</a> <i>continues at the Neue Nationalgalerie (Potsdamer Strasse 50, Berlin, Germany) through October 12.

All mediums and workspaces are welcome, including your home studio.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.lorenamolina.com/\">Lorena Molina</a>, San Francisco, California</h2>\n<p><i>How long have you been working in this space?</i></p>\n<p>A year.</p>\n<p><i>Describe an average day in your studio.</i></p>\n<p>My studio has always been shaped by the transitory nature of my life. Immigration teaches you to be resourceful — to construct makeshift spaces into whatever you need them to be. For me, my studio can be corn growing in my living room or fermenting <i>curtido</i> with my family in their kitchen. It can be the corner of my bedroom turned into a full photo studio, or the time I spend growing food alongside others. Often, it’s an empty classroom at the university where I teach. And sometimes, it’s a traditional studio — but that’s rare. </p>\n<p>My process includes deep research, growing and caring for plants that have ancestral history, preparing food, reading/writing, taking snack and dance breaks to Bad Bunny/Combo Chimbita. Because I teach, my studio days are long when I get the time to fully dive in. My dog usually joins me in the studio, and I see my walks with him as part of my studio practice. My walks are meditative, observant, and they’re also when I do a lot of my thinking and troubleshooting for my projects. Because my work is so deeply rooted in the geographies I’ve lived in and the relationships I’ve built there, studio work and everyday life often blur together, constantly feeding each other.</p>\n<p><i>How does the space affect your work?</i></p>\n<p>The space I’m in always shapes what I make. Either by the ecologies that surround my studio spaces, or the people and sounds I hear every day. The outside always seeps into my studio. Because I haven’t always had access to a traditional studio, I’ve learned to adapt, but it also shapes the type of work I can make. I really think that one of the reasons I started to make studio still lives was because of the limited wall space I had to make my photographs. But also because I wanted to incorporate the objects, flora, and places that create my home in the margins (I see my home in the margins as a place that is a result of violence and displacement, but also a place for potential for dreaming).</p>\n<p><i>How do you interact with the environment outside your studio?</i></p>\n<p>I’m a curious person. I talk to people and often get lost in conversations. I don’t see these chats are distractions, but something that really fuels and energizes me in the studio. I want to know what others are working on as well (whether it’s art or not). I am also always paying attention to what’s around me, either during my neighborhood walks or coffee breaks. Community is an essential part of my work, both in how I make and what I make. For example, if I’m working at school, my students often work alongside me. We share space, ask each other questions, and those exchanges often shape what we are creating.</p>\n<p><i>What do you love about your studio?</i></p>\n<p>What I love most about my studio is being able to be around my pets. My dog and cat keep me company during long days, and their presence brings me comfort and the purest joy. They remind me to take breaks, to play, and to enjoy the quiet moments in between working. I also love when I get the chance to work with my family. The meals we share afterward are moments I truly cherish. And of course, I love a studio with good light to grow my plants.</p>\n<p><i>What do you wish were different?</i></p>\n<p>Funny enough, what I want in my studio is what I want for my life. I always wish to root somewhere long-term. I do wish I had a more permanent studio space, a place where I could settle in and grow into the work over time. Right now, I adapt and grow wherever I am, and I’m grateful for my ability to do that. But I’m craving a space that offers consistency, room to create larger-scale work, and the chance to build lasting community with others. I want to share space, share meals, and be part of a space for a long time with others.</p>\n<p><i>What is your favorite local museum?</i></p>\n<p>Oakland Museum of California.</p>\n<p><i>What is your favorite art material to work with?</i></p>\n<p>Plants and microbes.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://brigidkennedyart.com/\">Brigid Kennedy</a>, Wethersfield, Connecticut</h2>\n<p><i>How long have you been working in this space?</i></p>\n<p>I’ve been working in this studio since 2021.

    "body": "<p>‣ Ahead of the Studio Museum in Harlem’s reopening this November, Salamishah Tillet asked artists, curators, and educators about the institution’s immense impact on their careers and lives in <i> Harper’s Bazaar</i>:</p>\n<blockquote><p/><i>Rashida Bumbray (independent curator; Studio Museum staff, 2001–2006):</i>I came in 2001—I believe in April. I was a page at NBC, which I hated. Thankfully, they laid us all off right after Thanksgiving. But I went, I think, to the very first of the “Uptown Fridays” [series of parties] that Sandra organized. Then I saw a Whitfield Lovell installation,<i>Whispers From the Walls</i>[featuring a series of charcoal drawings of unidentified Black Americans based on photographs from the pre–Civil Rights era]. I was walking around, and I just started crying. I saw Thelma standing there. I didn’t know her, but she looked like she worked there. So I walked up to her and I was like, “I want to work here.” She gave me her card. I called her seven or eight times, and finally she was like, “Come have an interview with me tomorrow.” So I ran around to all my aunties in Harlem and got this really inappropriate outfit, like an oversize blazer and a brooch and things that I would never wear, and I went to this interview. Thelma was like, “Okay, I’m going to give you a six-month post. Are you interested in curatorial or education?” And I just said, “Curatorial.” Sandra, Christine, and Lowery were all there. On the very first day, Lowery said to me, “You need to learn this shit, because some of us want to retire.”<p/><i>Lauren Haynes (head curator and vice president for arts and culture, Governors Island, New York; Studio Museum staff, 2006–2016):</i>When I got to the museum, Lowery Stokes Sims had moved from director to president. [Golden succeeded Sims as director in 2005.] Lowery was working on very specific projects, including with some African objects in the collection, and I was also tasked to work with her on that. She was so warm, welcoming, and kind but also very smart and precise. To see these examples, particularly of Black women who were so stellar in what they were doing … I was like, “Oh, right. There are people who look like me who do this work.”</blockquote>\n<p>‣ Construction on the Sagrada Família began over 140 years ago, and will theoretically wrap up next year. The <i> New Yorker</i>‘s D. T. Max reports on the monumental project, the long saga of its completion, and how architects are negotiating staying true to Antoni Gaudí’s ambitious vision:</p>\n<blockquote><p>With the hundredth anniversary of Gaudí’s “vulgar” demise approaching, Faulí agreed to let me observe the progress he and his team were making on the site. I first met him in May, 2024. He greeted me outside the basilica. Church officials had by then rescinded their unkeepable promise to finish by 2026, blaming delays caused by the pandemic. Faulí explained to me that the current goal was to have the Jesus tower complete by the end of 2025, so that the full height of the building could be celebrated on the centenary of Gaudí’s death. “Done” would be a state of mind.</p><p>To my eyes, the building looked nearly finished, but Faulí suggested that I look at the side of the church where Gaudí had wanted to depict the history of humanity, from Adam and Eve to the Last Judgment. It had no façade, narthex, portal, angel statues, or stone credos. Metal fencing covered some of the exterior. During the pandemic, Faulí had spent some time on a treatment, but the design was still being worked on; half his team was focussed on it now. How long would the façade take to complete? He startled me with the answer: “I would say maybe twelve years.”</p><p>Faulí, who has his own</p><i>família</i>—a wife and a daughter—was sixty-four at the time. Would he still be around when the Sagrada Família was truly done? “<i>Lo que Díos quiera</i>,” he replied—“Whatever God wishes.” At one point, we peered over the shoulder of one of his architects, who was designing a snail-shaped stairwell for the unfinished façade on a computer. Faulí pointed at the screen and explained, “It’s a curling staircase to get you to the roof, but you also have a vertical column with electricity and data lines, which also plays a structural role, because it will help fuse the walls of the nave to the façade.”</blockquote>\n<p>‣ From the <i>Atlantic</i> to Ezra Klein’s column in the <i>New York Times</i>, mainstream media’s hagiography of Charlie Kirk is truly bizarre to behold. For <i> Vanity Fair</i>, Ta-Nehisi Coates performs a razor-sharp dissection of the dangerous phenomenon:</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>Some people in France were upset to learn this week that their political chaos was being laughed at… by the Italians.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>In less than two years France has gone through five prime ministers, a political feat unsurpassed even in Rome's times of post-war political turbulence.</p>\n<p>And now, the French parliament – reconfigured after the president's decision to hold a snap election in July 2024 – is struggling to produce a majority capable of passing a budget.</p>\n<p>Add to this a general strike on Thursday called by unions opposed to previous budget proposals.</p>\n<p>Newspapers in Rome and Turin exhibited a distinct <i>gioia maligna</i> (malicious joy) in recounting recent events. </p>\n<p>There was the humiliation of the recently departed Prime Minister François Bayrou, the warnings of spiralling debt and the prospect of the French economy needing to be bailed out by the IMF.</p>\n<p>But most of all, there was the fading glory of the president, Emmanuel Macron.</p>\n<p>\"So where is the grandeur now?\" asked Il Messaggero.</p>\n<p>The cost of servicing national debt this year is estimated to be €67 billion - it now consumes more money than all government departments except education and defence.</p>\n<p>Forecasts suggest that by the end of the decade it will outstrip even them, reaching €100 billion a year.</p>\n<p>Last Friday, the ratings agency Fitch downgraded French debt, potentially making it more expensive for the French government to borrow, reflecting growing doubts about the country's stability and ability to service that debt.</p>\n<p>The possibility of having to turn, cap in hand, to the International Monetary Fund for a loan or to require intervention from the European Central Bank, is no longer fanciful.</p>\n<p>And all this against a background of international turmoil: war in Europe, disengagement by the Americans, the inexorable rise of populism.</p>\n<p>Last Wednesday there was a national day of protest organised by a group called Bloquons Tout (Let's Block Everything). Hijacked by the far-left, it made little impact bar some high-visibility street clashes.</p>\n<p>But a much bigger test came yesterday<strong>, </strong>with unions and left-wing parties organising mass demonstrations against the government's plans.</p>\n<p>In the words of veteran political commentator Nicolas Baverez: \"At this critical moment, when the very sovereignty and freedom of France and Europe are at stake, France finds itself paralysed by chaos, impotence and debt.\"</p>\n<p>President Macron insists he can extricate the country from the mess but he has just 18 months remaining of his second term.</p>\n<p>One possibility is that the country's inherent strengths – its wealth, infrastructure, institutional resilience – will see it through what many feel is a historic turning-point.</p>\n<p>But there is another scenario: that it emerges permanently weakened, prey to extremists of left and right, a new sick man of Europe.</p>\n<h2>Tensions with prime ministers</h2>\n<p>All of this dates back to Macron's disastrous dissolution of the National Assembly in the early summer of 2024. Far from producing a stronger basis for governing, the new parliament was now split three ways: centre, left and far-right.</p>\n<p>No single group could hope to form a functioning government because the other two would always unite against it.</p>\n<p>Michel Barnier and then François Bayrou each staggered through a few months as prime minister, but both fell on the central question that faces all governments: how the state should raise and spend its money.</p>\n<p>Bayrou, a 74-year-old centrist, made a totem out of the question of French debt – which now stands at more than €3 trillion, or around 114% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).</p>\n<p>He wanted to stabilise repayments by cutting €44 billion from the 2026 budget.</p>\n<p>Bayrou was brought down when the left and far-right MPs united in a vote of confidence last week, but polls showed that many voters were also hostile to the prime minister's ideas, such as abolishing two national holidays to pay for more defence.</p>\n<p>Emmanuel Macron's immediate recourse has been to entrust a member of his inner circle to pioneer a new approach.</p>\n<p>Sébastien Lecornu, the 39-year-old named as prime minister last week, is a quietly-spoken Norman who became a presidential confidant over late-night sessions of whisky-and-chat at the Elysée.</p>\n<p>Following the appointment, Macron said he was convinced \"an agreement between the political forces is possible while respecting the convictions of each\".</p>\n<p>Macron is said to appreciate Lecornu's loyalty, and a sense that his prime minister is not obsessed with his own political future.</p>\n<p>After tensions with his two predecessors – the veterans Michel Barnier and François Bayrou – today the president and prime minister see eye-to-eye.</p>\n<p>\"With Lecornu, it basically means that Macron is prime minister,\" argues Philippe Aghion, an economist who has advised the president and knows him well.</p>\n<p>\"Macron and Lecornu are essentially one.\"</p>\n<h2>Lecornu's Herculean task</h2>\n<p>Macron wants Lecornu to carry out a shift. From leaning mainly towards the political right, Macron now wants a deal with the left – specifically the Socialist Party (PS).</p>\n<p>By law, Lecornu needs to have tabled a budget by mid-October. This must then be passed by year-end.</p>\n<p>Arithmetically the only way he can do that is if his centrist bloc is joined by \"moderates\" to its right and left – in other words the conservative Republicans (LR) and the Socialists (PS).</p>\n<p>But the problem is this: every concession to one side makes it only more likely that the other side will walk out.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

However, some industries, such as steel, have been dealt a blow with a proposed deal to cut tariffs shelved.</p>\n    <p>Several big drugs companies, such as AstraZeneca, have also halted investment plans, claiming the UK is an \"increasingly challenging\" country to do business in.</p>\n    <p>The vast majority of the £150bn investment - £90bn - will come from Blackstone over the next decade, although how most of this money will be spent has yet to be decided. The US private equity firm announced in June it would spend £370bn across Europe over 10 years.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c7016ljre03o\">The technology deal</a> will see the UK and US co-operate in areas including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing and nuclear power.</p>\n    <p>Microsoft has pledged to spend £22bn in the UK over the next four years, while Google is to invest £5bn over the next two years to expand an existing data centre in Hertfordshire.</p>\n    <p>Starmer said the investments were \"a testament to Britain's economic strength and a bold signal that our country is open, ambitious, and ready to lead\".</p>\n    <p>The PM is keen to make the UK a destination for US investment in an attempt to boost Britain's economy.</p>\n    <p>While it is hoped the investments will generate thousands of jobs in the years ahead, it comes at a time when domestic businesses appear to be slowing investment due to higher running costs.</p>\n    <p>The government says 7,600 jobs will be created by the investments, but over the year to August the number of people on UK payrolls has fallen by an estimated 127,000, according to the Office for National Statistics. Vacancies were down by 119,000 (14%) in June to August 2025 from the level of a year ago.</p>\n    <p>Many firms have blamed increasing costs, such as having to pay more in National Insurance and the minimum wage, as reasons for slowing investment.</p>\n    <p>In recent days, pharmaceutical companies have highlighted other challenges to investing in the UK. US giant Merck rowed back on a plan to invest £1bn after blaming successive governments for undervaluing innovative medicines. Instead, it will move research to the US.</p>\n    <p>AstraZeneca then paused plans to invest £200m at a Cambridge research site, a project expected to create 1,000 jobs. It has also switched investment to the US.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, money is also flowing from UK firms to the US. In the investment announcement, the government pointed to drugs giant <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g58x3441ko\">GSK investing nearly £22bn in R&amp;D and manufacturing in the US</a> over a five-year period.</p>\n    <h2>Where is the UK investment going?</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Blackstone's large investment is in addition to the £10bn it previously announced for data centre development in the UK</li>\n      <li>Real estate investment trust Prologis is set to invest £3.9bn into the UK's life sciences and advanced manufacturing in Cambridge and Daventry</li>\n      <li>Palantir is invest up to £1.5bn in UK defence innovation and plans to create up to 350 new jobs.</li>\n      <li>American tech company Amentum plans to create more than 3,000 jobs across Glasgow to Warrington and the Midlands</li>\n      <li>Boeing has said it will convert two 737 aircraft in Birmingham for the US Air Force, which would be the first USAF aircraft built in the UK for more than 50 years</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle said the planned investment reflected growing confidence in the UK's industrial strategy.</p>\n    <p>\"These record-breaking investments will create thousands of high-quality jobs across the UK,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>But former Deputy Prime Minister Sir Nick Clegg, who also used to be Facebook's president of global affairs, told the BBC's Today programme that the investment was \"crumbs from the Silicon Valley table\".</p>\n    <p>He called for \"some perspective\" to be applied to the \"hype\", and that the deal did not solve the UK's \"perennial achilles heel\", which was that British start-ups tended to end up in the US as they seek investment.</p>\n    <p>\"Not only do we import all their technology, we export all our good people and good ideas as well,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>He said the UK had to learn to \"stand more on our own two feet\", rather than \"cling on to Uncle Sam's coat tails\".</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

There are portraits of Grover Cleveland and Chester A. Arthur, yellowed newspaper clippings of Truman’s swearing-in, glossy magazine covers of Ronald Reagan and his wife, campaign posters from elections past, and life-size cutouts of JFK and Abraham Lincoln. Countless flags hang from the ceiling, and the walls form a patchwork of badges, banners, and political curiosities. </p>\n<p>The man behind it all is Mike Driscoll, a former social studies teacher who, after a couple of years in the classroom, decided it wasn’t for him and set out to buy a bar.  </p>\n<p>He settled on an 1874 building, once a livery stable with a blacksmith’s quarters, to pour his passion for U.S. history into what would become a Buffalo institution. </p>\n<p>His incredible collection began in 1985, when he was still teaching and gathering posters, portraits, and other ephemera. When the bar opened, it contained a third of what it does today. The memorabilia soon became a communal project: over the years, patrons would bring over objects found in dusty basements and flea markets. The collection grew so vast it eventually spilled beyond the bar, with parts now stored at Driscoll’s house.</p>\n<p>The aim of this space isn’t to spark political debates, but rather to highlight history and to test cultural knowledge. Since opening in 1986, Driscoll has kept his teaching spirit alive by quizzing visitors from behind the bar. And every Tuesday of the month, the pub presents a trivia night. Winners can hope to win anything ranging from a candy bar to a $10 gift certificate. But beware, the questions are much tougher than your average trivia. (Example: What is the only state that ends with a K?)</p>\n<p>Listed as one of the 18 best bars in America by Esquire magazine, the establishment attracts people from all over the country. Customers often end up quizzing each other on their home states, perpetuating the bar’s mission. </p>\n<p>While you brush up on your U.S. history, you can do it over a pint of Liberty Lager or Patriot Porter, often brewed with ingredients authentic to the tastes of a past era. You can also enjoy an Independence Burger, for which you’re at liberty to pile on anything you want. </p>\n\n\n                \n            </div>\n\n              </div>",

Families from Southeast Asia, Africa, the Middle East, as well as Latin America and the Caribbean, are all part of this vibrant community. </p>\n<p>Seeing the rich variety of textiles worn by women in its streets, Hoeg saw an opportunity to create a communal space around them. </p>\n<p>In 2014, that vision came to fruition with the creation of Stitch Buffalo, a textile art center where refugee and immigrant women can sell their handcrafted goods, alongside communal classes and a thrift store of textile supplies. Its mission: stitching communities together.</p>\n<p>It started as an embroidery workshop attended by one refugee woman. Today, over 200 refugee women and families receive free sewing equipment, supplies, and training each year. </p>\n<p>The organization recently changed buildings, moving into a renovated former factory. Stepping in, visitors are greeted by an open space full of joy and bright colors. </p>\n<p>The first stop for visitors is the store, where they can explore products created through the Refugee Women’s Workshop. Products include hand-woven totes, crocheted shoulder bags, embroidered pillows, and beaded jewelry. Most are one-of-a-kind, informed by women’s past training as artists, the culture they come from, and the styles worn back home. People can also bring their clothes to have them altered by Stitch Buffalo’s artisans.</p>\n<p>Just behind the store is the Second Stitch Program, a sustainability initiative where more than 20,000 pounds of textile art tools and supplies and over 200 sewing machines find a second life each year. When not used in the Refugee Women’s Workshop or during classes, these materials are available at a discount for crafty people to browse. </p>\n<p>Past the thrift shop are the community workshop spaces, where visitors can try embroidery, dyeing, sewing and weaving–often taught by refugee and immigrant women who practice their English as they share their craft. </p>\n<p>The organization just completed a giant mural that wraps around the building. Created over 18 months with deep community input, it features textile tools, fabrics, and shapes iconic to Stitch Buffalo. It embodies the diverse community that makes West Side Buffalo such a special place. </p>\n\n\n                \n            </div>\n\n              </div>",

For a century, the missing first portion of Mark Twain’s manuscript was believed to have been destroyed by a printer. In truth, it had been sitting quietly in the basement of the granddaughter of James Fraser Gluck, the Buffalo Library curator who persuaded Twain to donate the draft in 1885. </p>\n<p>That discovery reunited the manuscript in full at the Buffalo &amp; Erie County Public Library in 1992. It led to the creation of an entire room dedicated to Samuel Clemens, better known to the world as Mark Twain, America’s great humorist and literary revolutionary.</p>\n<p>Today, the <a href=\"https://www.buffalolib.org/special-collections/mark-twain-room\">Mark Twain Room</a> resembles a cabinet of curiosities, with more than 500 pieces of Twain memorabilia sprinkled throughout. There are cigars and playing cards stamped with his face, portraits, rare editions, and the restored mantel from Twain and his wife Olivia’s home in Buffalo, where he once worked as a newspaper editor. Visitors can also learn about his venture into invention: the “Memory Builder,” a board game he patented in 1892 after watching his daughter struggle to remember historical dates. And there’s even the trunk in which the manuscript was found, now resting beneath the fireplace mantel.</p>\n<p>The heart of the collection is, of course, the Huckleberry Finn manuscript itself, often dubbed one of the greatest American novels and still the subject of debate today. Only two pages are displayed at a time, rotating monthly in the climate-controlled room. Twain's edits sprawl across the margins, his words scratched out, revised, and made “folksier” as he worked to capture a new American literary voice: realism. To stand in front of the manuscript feels like stepping inside his train of thought.</p>\n<p>Twice a year, the exhibition changes, exploring themes like “Twain in Hollywood.” Beyond this room, the library holds other marvels: an unpublished Louisa May Alcott poem, a medieval manuscript collection, a letter written by Charlotte Brontë, and a rare complete set of Shakespeare's 17th-century folios. </p>\n<p>Such riches reflect Buffalo’s standing during the Gilded Age. The city's main street, Delaware Avenue—known as Millionaires’ Row—was lined with the mansions of leading industrialists, and Twain himself. The residue of that lavish era lives on in the treasures of the Buffalo &amp; Erie County Public Library, a town square of culture and arts that was fundamental to the city's cultural development.</p>\n\n\n                \n            </div>\n\n              </div>",

It’s a pretty funky place. It’s built into the hillside. You spend a lot of your time wandering around and kind of stumbling across things. Things like maybe a zoo or an amphitheater; or, perhaps, you take one turn and you come upon this enormous rose garden.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Rachel Burlington: </strong>I remember just walking down the stairs and being like, “Whoa, where am I?” I don’t even know what’s going on. I’m smelling things; there’s so many colors. That was my first experience coming to the Rose Garden before I even got this role.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Dylan: </strong>This is Rachel Burlington. She’s the curator of this garden, meaning she spends her time making sure that all of these roses are happy. And there are a ton of roses to keep happy.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Rachel: </strong>We have over 10,000 roses—individual rose bushes—and we have about 625 varieties. So we have striped ones, we have pink ones, we have bicolor ones, we have little ones, we have big ones. We have virtually every type of rose you can think of.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Dylan: </strong>When I first started learning about the garden, I kept running into this story about how it had gotten started. And the story goes back to World War I. Europe is being torn up by this horrible conflict, and so the people of Portland decide, “We want to offer help.”</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\">They reached out to gardeners over there saying, “We can help you save your plants from destruction. Send your roses to us, and we will keep them safe and growing until after the war.” A beautiful gesture of kindness from one gardener to another. It’s a great story. There is, of course, one major problem.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Rachel: </strong>I have not found any evidence to say that that’s true. There’s nothing to corroborate that.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Dylan: </strong>This story—it really always nagged at Rachel. It became almost the bane of her existence. You might say, the thorn on her rose. So she decided, “Okay, I need to do some research of my own. I’m going to set the story straight. I’m going to dig into the archives and find out actually how this garden came to be.”</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Rachel: </strong>I’m still kind of knee deep in it, and it’s really exciting. Like with any mystery, you just start pulling up the thread, and then the whole thing unravels.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Dylan: </strong>I’m Dylan Thuras, and this is Atlas Obscura, a celebration of the world’s strange, incredible, and wondrous places. This episode is brought to you in partnership with Travel Portland. And today—I didn’t realize this—but Portland is known as the City of Roses. Getting this title, clinching the champion spot, was a real street fight.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\">Today, we hear from Rachel about this story, and we hear from her about the city’s secret weapon in that fight. It was this garden—specifically this test garden, a kind of a cross between a beautiful, peaceful park and a mad scientist’s laboratory. Less World War I, and more War of the Roses. That story, after this.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><em>This is an edited transcript of the </em><a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/podcast\"><em>Atlas Obscura Podcast</em></a><em>: a celebration of the world’s strange, incredible, and wondrous places.

I try every year to grow things, and it just fails, but we do have roses growing in our backyard. And I’ve learned a thing or two about roses over the years, and I’m going to pass one on to you. The first is that rose people are very, very serious about roses.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Rachel: </strong>I feel like there are rose people, and there are plant people. Rose people are its own thing of horticulture.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Dylan: </strong>That’s Rachel Burlington again. Yeah, rose people are so serious that they actually have a pretty good idea of when the very first rose bush was planted in Portland, which was all the way back in 1837. Rose people…they just keep track of this kind of thing. And here’s the other thing about roses.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Rachel: </strong>Roses have had a reputation for not being the easiest to grow. Sometimes roses have a bad reputation for being high-maintenance and disease-prone, and certainly that was the case.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Dylan: </strong>Roses are very finicky. They get diseases easily. They get fungal diseases in humid environments. I mean, humidity is basically the kryptonite of roses. But then people tried to grow roses in Portland, and they were surprised.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Rachel: </strong>Portland has the ideal weather: basically a combination of mild and wet winters, warm and dry summers. That perfect concoction creates the best climate. In fact, sometimes I feel like people come in here and say, “These are the best.” I almost feel like I’m cheating. I’m like, “I literally just planted it and didn’t do anything.”</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Dylan: </strong>Rose growing in Portland really started to take off. By the late 1800s, rose enthusiasts had formed the Portland Rose Society, the first of its kind in the US. And the society began hosting big annual rose shows. By 1904, these shows included a pageant and a parade.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\">The rose business was blooming. Then, as 1905 rolled around, the city decided they were ready to go much bigger—to pitch themselves to the rest of the country and to the world. But they were not alone in this ambition.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

The result is a large venue belonging to the big name of Zastava Promet A.

The complaint concerns a $250 million bonus payout tied to revenue targets for the 2025 Early Access release of Subnautica 2, which the former shareholders of Unknown Worlds Entertainment, represented by Fortis Advisors LLC, allege owners Krafton, Inc. sought to avoid paying out by delaying the game using \"pressure tactics.\"</p>\n    <p>In its defense, Krafton accused the three former leaders of then threatening to self-publish Subnautica 2, \"releasing it without Krafton's backing, marketing, promotion, or distribution.\" This, Krafton claims, left it with \"no choice but to terminate their employment.\"</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.gamesindustry.biz/unknown-worlds-sues-former-leadership-team-for-breach-of-employment-and-fiduciary-duty-of-care\">The company also alleged that Max McGuire, Ted Gill, and Charlie Cleveland downloaded tens of thousands of \"company files\" and emails in the lead up to these terminations</a> and claimed the former leadership \"refused\" to return \"or at the very least confirm\" what devices and confidential information remained in their possession.</p>\n    <p>Now, the founders claim that while Krafton initially alleged it fired them because of the founders' \"supposed intention to proceed with a premature release of Subnautica 2,\" and \"withdrawn game readiness as a grounds to justify its actions,\" it has now \"pivoted to a new theory that it admittedly came up with only after the fact: that it terminated the Founders and seized control because the Founders backed up files they were entitled to access in their work for Unknown Worlds.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Krafton’s disorganized retreat raises more questions than answers,\" the court filing stated. \"To say Krafton’s new theory is a Hail Mary would be an understatement – both because the downloads were not wrongful and because Krafton claims not to have learned of them until <i>after</i> it had fired the Founders. The downloads cannot have been the actual motivation for termination.\"</p>\n    <p>Consequently, lawyers for former CEO Ted Gill, co-founder and creative director Charlie Cleveland, and co-founder and CTO Max McGuire requested that the court deny Krafton's request for a forensic inspection, as well as dismiss a motion for a protective order on the grounds of its \"shift in theories.\"</p>\n    <p>Read our timeline of the <a href=\"https://www.gamesindustry.biz/krafton-inc-versus-subnautica-2-former-lead-developers\">former Subnautica 2 leads versus Krafton here</a>.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Stanford scientists found permanent standard time would reduce obesity and stroke rates nationwide, making it the strongest option over permanent daylight saving time or seasonal shifts.</li>\n      <li>Share:</li>\n      <li></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Every spring, Americans dutifully adjust their clocks forward to daylight saving time, and every fall, back to standard time -- but no one seems very happy about it. The biannual time shift is not only inconvenient, it's also known to be acutely bad for our health. The collective loss of an hour of sleep on the second Sunday in March has been linked to more heart attacks and fatal traffic accidents in the ensuing days.</p>\n<p>Now, a study by Stanford Medicine researchers finds there are longer-term hazards as well -- and better alternatives.</p>\n<p>The researchers compared how three different time policies -- permanent standard time, permanent daylight saving time and biannual shifting -- could affect people's circadian rhythms, and, in turn, their health throughout the country. Circadian rhythm is the body's innate, roughly 24-hour clock, which regulates many physiological processes.</p>\n<p>The team found that, from a circadian perspective, we've made the worst choice. Either permanent standard time or permanent daylight saving time would be healthier than our seasonal waffling, with permanent standard time benefitting the most people.</p>\n<p>Indeed, by modeling light exposure, circadian impacts and health characteristics county by county, the researchers estimate that permanent standard time would prevent some 300,000 cases of stroke per year and result in 2.6 million fewer people having obesity. Permanent daylight saving time would achieve about two-thirds of the same effect.</p>\n<p>\"We found that staying in standard time or staying in daylight saving time is definitely better than switching twice a year,\" said Jamie Zeitzer, PhD, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and senior author of the study to publish Sept. 15 in the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>. The lead author is Lara Weed, a graduate student in bioengineering.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>A theory lacking data</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Even among people who want to end seasonal time shifts, there's disagreement over which time policy to adopt.</p>\n<p>\"You have people who are passionate on both sides of this, and they have very different arguments,\" Zeitzer said.</p>\n<p>Supporters of permanent daylight saving time say more evening light could save energy, deter crime and give people more leisure time after work. Golf courses and open-air malls are big proponents, Zeitzer said. A trial of permanent daylight saving time begun in 1974, however, was so unpopular it was abandoned after less than a year. Among the objectors were parents worried about their children going to school in the dark.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the duration of daylight saving time was later increased from six months to seven months. And since 2018, a bill proposing permanent daylight saving time has been introduced in Congress nearly every year, though it has never passed.</p>\n<p>In the other camp, proponents of permanent standard time contend that more morning light is optimal for health. Organizations such as the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, the National Sleep Foundation and the American Medical Association have endorsed year-round standard time.</p>\n<p>\"It's based on the theory that early morning light is better for our overall health,\" Zeitzer said of these endorsements. \"The problem is that it's a theory without any data. And finally, we have data.\"</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Syncing to 24 hours</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The human circadian cycle is not exactly 24 hours -- for most people, it's about 12 minutes longer -- but it can be modulated by light.</p>\n<p>\"When you get light in the morning, it speeds up the circadian cycle. When you get light in the evening, it slows things down,\" Zeitzer said. \"You generally need more morning light and less evening light to keep well synchronized to a 24-hour day.\"</p>\n<p>An out-of-sync circadian cycle has been associated with a range of poor health outcomes.</p>\n<p>\"The more light exposure you get at the wrong times, the weaker the circadian clock. All of these things that are downstream -- for example, your immune system, your energy -- don't match up quite as well,\" Zeitzer said.</p>\n<p>The researchers used a mathematical model to translate light exposure under each time policy, based on local sunrise and sunset times, to circadian burden -- essentially, how much a person's innate clock has to shift to keep up with the 24-hour day.</p>\n<p>They found that over a year, most people would experience the least circadian burden under permanent standard time, which prioritizes morning light. The benefits vary somewhat by a person's location within a time zone and their chronotype -- whether they prefer early mornings, late nights or something in between.</p>\n<p>Counterintuitively, people who are morning larks, who make up about 15% of the population and tend to have circadian cycles shorter than 24 hours, would experience the least circadian burden under permanent daylight savings time, as more evening light would extend their circadian cycles closer to 24 hours.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Health implications</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>To link circadian burden to specific health outcomes, the researchers analyzed county-level data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the prevalence of arthritis, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease, depression, diabetes, obesity and stroke.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

The average BMI before starting treatment was 34.7 kg/m<sup>2 </sup>(Ozempic), 35.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (Wegovy) and 36.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (Mounjaro).</p>\n<p>The participants, who were recruited online, were asked if their sense of taste (perception of sweetness, saltiness, sourness and bitterness) had changed since starting treatment.</p>\n<p>They were also asked about changes to appetite, satiety and food cravings, as well changes to lifestyle factors, such as smoking, and for self-reported data on height and weight before and during treatment.</p>\n<p>Reductions in BMI, adjusted for duration of treatment, dose, baseline BMI, age and sex, were 17.4% with Ozempic, 17.6% with Wegovy and 15.5% with Mounjaro.</p>\n<p>Around a fifth of the participants said that food tasted sweeter (21.3%) or saltier (22.6%) than before. Their perception of bitterness and sourness did not change.</p>\n<p>Some 26.7% of participants in the Wegovy group reported that food tasted saltier than before, compared with 16.2% in the Ozempic group and 15.2% in the Mounjaro group. Increases in sweetness were reported at similar frequencies in all groups (Wegovy 19.4%, Ozempic 21.6%, Mounjaro 21.7%).</p>\n<p>More than half of the participants (58.4%) reported they were less hungry in general, i.e. their appetite had decreased (Ozempic: 62.1%, Wegovy: 54.4%, Mounjaro: 56.5%).</p>\n<p>Almost two-thirds of the participants (63.5%) reported increased satiety i.e. they felt full sooner Ozempic: 58.8%, Wegovy: 66.8%, Mounjaro: 63.1%). Food cravings were also reduced, with 41.3% of Mounjaro users reporting a strong reduction in cravings, i.e. their cravings were much less intense that before, compared with 34.1% of those taking Wegovy and 29.7% of those taking Ozempic.</p>\n<p>Further analysis revealed links between changes to sense of taste and appetite and satiety.</p>\n<p>Participants who reported that food tasted sweeter since starting incretin-based therapy were twice as likely to report increased satiety, compared with participants who said their perception of sweetness had not changed.</p>\n<p>Those with an increase in the perception of sweetness were also 67% more likely to report a reduction in appetite and 85% more likely to report a reduction in cravings, compared with those whose perception of sweetness was unchanged.</p>\n<p>Similarly, participants who said food tasted saltier than before were about twice as likely (2.17 times) to also reported increased satiety, compared with those whose perception of saltiness was unchanged.</p>\n<p>Professor Moser says: \"These drugs act not only in the gut and brain areas that control hunger but also on taste bud cells and brain regions that process taste and reward. This means they can subtly change how strong flavours, like sweetness or saltiness, are perceived. This, in turn, may affect appetite.\"</p>\n<p>However, there was no link between changes in taste perception and reduction in BMI. The researchers speculate this is because sense of taste is just one of many factors involved in weight loss.</p>\n<p>Professor Moser explains: \"Shifts in taste may affect how satisfying or appealing food feels in the moment, which influences appetite control. However, weight loss depends on many other factors - like metabolism, long-term eating patterns, and activity - so changes to taste alone may not be enough to directly drive body weight reduction.\"</p>\n<p>The study's limitations include inability to prove causation, the self-reporting of data and the possibility that the participants weren't representative of the patient group as a whole.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

We found a few deals to upgrade your living room, including a coastal woven side table and handsome area rugs.</p>\n    <h2>Early Prime Day Kitchen Deals</h2>\n    <p>One room in the home that shouldn't be ignored when it comes to all the things Prime Day has to offer: the kitchen. There are a number of great kitchenware deals kicking around, including markdowns on nonstick and stainless steel cookware, air fryers, Keurigs, and immersion blenders.</p>\n    <h2>FAQs</h2>\n    <h2>When Is Amazon Prime Day 2025?</h2>\n    <p>Alexa, when is the next <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/topic/amazon-prime-day\">Amazon Prime Day</a>? This fall, the Prime Big Deal Days will run between October 7 and October 8. The sale will officially kick off at midnight PST and will extend for a full 48 hours, so you can check everything off your shopping list. The last time Amazon hosted a major retailer-specific sales event was in July. This past summer, the Amazon Prime Day event spanned an unprecedented four full days. Both events are known for offering promotions that rival the deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday in November.</p>\n    <h2>How Does Amazon Prime Day Work?</h2>\n    <p>A <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/5a1FMimJbzYezVoPRq6Z6byMnFWaKLkWm1BDKD3zuxajHaJFP4XNTxS81rdzKCv7RVsisDZ8Bb8mQaPdaqZa34qr54Znaez5vuWBVLscQHmNgME3FeiQ7r8uRs9ShSnDH87GGmDPABWsrEBhmVtsGgzqtShFf3eXpkVVj6gqaRfwbzyZ9NYetjkmjF24zdrcLDoWJDQjmYrAibK53JfdciE14i68Kwoxhbb6KPpWie9KTbacaZFDiKXDTE2RRzSNK46duRfQuMfy1rvxpECL8kDFtVTKAoRGjFN2W2EuWJAXr9paCwMeNV3XW3PALAbMypiwqtViH9EwM8UbZDRk84J?xid=fr1758053571759cgc\">Prime membership</a> is required to take advantage of all these deals. Luckily, it is <i>very</i> easy to become an Amazon Prime member. You can test out a free 30-day trial, and after that, your subscription nets out to $15 per month or $139 per year to take advantage of fast free delivery, Prime Video (for an additional $9 per month), and all the other benefits the mega retailer offers.</p>\n    <h2>Are Other Retailers Offering Discounts During Amazon Prime Day?</h2>\n    <p>Amazon won’t likely be the only retailer to host a mega sales event during the fall months. In years past, we’ve seen the likes of Walmart, Brooklinen, Home Depot, Target, and Best Buy get in on the action with <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/prime-day-furniture-deals-09-16-2025\">furniture deals</a> and sales on trending items such as Samsung smart TVs, Dyson cordless vacuums, robot vacuums, and kitchen essentials like crock-pots and KitchenAid mixers.</p>\n    <h2>What Are the Best Deals During Amazon Prime Big Deals Day?</h2>\n    <p>In our opinion, you should place your Prime Day bets on a few select categories. If you’re looking for great deals on <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/best-air-purifiers-we-tried\">air purifiers</a>, stick <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/best-vacuums-on-amazon-reviewed\">vacuum cleaners</a>, or the lowest prices on home tech (like a new laptop, phone charger, or Amazon device), the shopping event is a notoriously good time to snag deals on smart home gadgets. It’s also a great time to find discounted <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/best-home-appliances-on-amazon\">kitchen items</a>—usually there are a few Vitamix, Kitchenaid, and Ninja deals to go around—as well as good prices on household essentials like bath towels, <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/best-amazon-sheets\">sheet</a> sets, comfy patio furniture, and cleaning supplies.</p>\n    <h2>Do Prime Day deals change each day?</h2>\n    <p>Unfortunately, yes. While many products remain in stock throughout the sale, others either sell out or the sale period ends fairly quickly. In our experience, it totally depends on the brand and the popularity of the product. We will continue updating until the sale ends. In other words, watch this space!</p>\n    <h2>When does Prime Big Deals Day end?</h2>\n    <p>October 8! More specifically, it ends at 3 am EST. If you have your eye on one of the best Prime Day home deals, you'll have until then to shop.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Bravo TV and <i>The Real Housewives of Atlanta</i> star Dwight Eubanks <a href=\"https://people.com/dwight-eubanks-diagnosed-with-prostate-cancer-exclusive-11746180\">announced</a> he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in April 2025, raising awareness of an important issue: Black men have a higher incidence of prostate cancer and prostate cancer mortality, according to <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8987139/\">data from the  World Journal of Men’s Health</a>.</p>\n    <p>Post-diagnosis, Eubanks is advocating for Black men to get screened and championing awareness through an ambassadorship with <a href=\"https://zerocancer.org/\">ZERO Prostate Cancer</a>. </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.success.com/newsletters/\">\n        <graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.success.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CTA_banners_2024_Newsletter.jpg\" alt=\"SUCCESS Newsletter offer\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.success.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CTA_banners_2024_Newsletter.jpg\" alt=\"SUCCESS Newsletter offer\"/>\n    <h2>What are the chances?</h2>\n    <p>“I discovered it by accident.” Eubanks says. “We hosted a health fair at my church in January, and I just happened to go over and get a PSA done. And it came back high, elevated.”</p>\n    <p>Eubanks says he was shocked because he had frequently visited the doctor, and his doctor never mentioned an<a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/15282-elevated-psa-prostate-specific-antigen-level\"> elevated PSA</a> (prostate-specific antigen). Eubanks’ story is common and highlights the likelihood of men being diagnosed with prostate cancer. </p>\n    <p>Research shows that <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/understanding-cancer-risk/cancer-facts/cancer-facts-for-men.html\">one in eight men will get prostate cancer</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jude-emokpare-4a27541a9/\">Jude Emokpare</a>, a physician and oncology hospitalist, confirms the data. He sees prostate cancer patients and is part of an advocacy organization called <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/strada_foundation\">The Strada Foundation</a>, which helps promote prostate cancer screening for Black men.</p>\n    <p>“The current numbers that we work with estimate about one in eight men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime, and in Black men, it’s actually one in six,” Emokpare says.</p>\n    <p>“Unfortunately, for Black men, the odds are stacked against us. We tend to have a higher risk of multiple kinds of diseases, including <a href=\"https://www.success.com/dkms-blood-cancer/\">cancers</a>,” he explains. “Our genetic makeup alone is a factor that you don’t have control over.” </p>\n    <p>Emokpare says socioeconomic status is also a factor in why more Black men get prostate cancer. If they live in an under-resourced neighborhood, their <a href=\"http://success.com/ai-health-care-movement/\">access to health care</a> services is limited. They are either not screened at all or screened late in the disease process. </p>\n    <p>“There’s lots of men… in their 50s and 60s who haven’t even had a PSA test done,” Emokpare says.</p>\n    <p>Eubanks says it’s essential for Black men to visit the doctor and undergo screenings. “It’s really crucial… particularly in the African American community,” he says.</p>\n    <h2>When should you get screened for prostate cancer?</h2>\n    <p>Getting screened for prostate cancer may help you catch it early. The five-year survival rate for localized prostate cancer that hasn’t spread beyond the prostate is 99%, <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/prostate-cancer/prostate-cancer-survival-rates-what-they-mean\">according to WebMD</a>. Regular PSA blood tests combined with <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/24212-digital-rectal-exam\">digital rectal exams</a> are a common screening method. </p>\n    <p>“Men should get screened at least once a year, and the recommendations vary,” Emokpare says. “Typically, we say every man 50 years old and above should get screened. But we get more specific for [high-risk] individuals, and we say, ‘You start screening as early as 40 years.’”</p>\n    <p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/prostate-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/acs-recommendations.html\">American Cancer Society</a>, men should be screened starting at age 50 if they’re of average risk and expected to live at least another 10 years. If they’re Black or have a first-degree relative (father or brother, for example) who was diagnosed with prostate cancer at an early age (younger than 65), they should start screenings at 45. </p>\n    <p>If a man has more than one first-degree relative who had prostate cancer at an early age, he should be screened annually starting at age 40.</p>\n    <h2>How to lower your risk for prostate cancer</h2>\n    <p>Although prostate cancer can’t be prevented for sure, according to the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/prostate-cancer/causes-risks-prevention/prevention.html\">American Cancer Society</a>, men can take action to lower their risk, including: </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Maintaining a healthy weight</li>\n      <li>Being <a href=\"https://www.success.com/13-ways-to-take-care-of-yourself-every-day/\">physically active</a></li>\n      <li>Maintaining a healthy diet including a variety of fruits and vegetables and whole grains while avoiding or limiting red and processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages and highly processed foods</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Emokpare also recommends men quit smoking. “We counsel people a lot about the risks of tobacco use,” he says. “It increases your risk of so many things: heart disease, strokes and several [types] of cancer.”</p>\n    <p>Eubanks says he encourages men, especially Black men, to get screened and get information about prostate cancer. “The stigma of having to go up the rectum to check the prostate—those days are over with,” he says. “It’s a simple process, a matter of just giving blood and getting your results.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Photo by angellodeco/Shutterstock.</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

It also wasn’t long ago that climbing pants built for women <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/forum/topic/114113016/womens-climbing-pants-love-em-or-hate-em\">left a lot to be desired</a>. Thankfully, the pants scene has come a long way—and so have we. After climbing sport routes, trad lines, cracks, boulders, multi-pitch walls, and plastic at the gym, we know what we want in pants.</p>\n<p id=\"publisher_div\"></p>\n<p>From movement-friendly design and under-harness comfort, to <i>actually </i>useful pockets, we evaluated over two dozen pairs of pants on a variety of climbs. We also included a mix of purpose-built climbing pants, more general outdoor pants, and leggings, for those who feel strongly that tights are the only way on rock.</p>\n<p>Finally, if you’re looking for recommendations for both men and women, head over to <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"http://www.climbing.com/gear/best-climbing-pants\">this guide to the best climbing pants</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1\">Best Women’s Climbing Pants: At a Glance</h2>\n<h2 id=\"2\">The Best All-Around Women’s Climbing Pants</h2>\n<p>Only want to deal with one pair of climbing pants? These pairs check most of the boxes for the all-around climber.</p>\n<p>Since many women prefer to climb in leggings, we were determined to find the absolute best pair when it comes to quality, fit, and pockets. Arc’teryx gave leggings a total glow-up for climbers with this high-performance pair. While the price is steep for leggings, the payoff in terms of breathability, fit, and pocket configuration is worth it if you’re looking for a workhorse pair for climbing indoors and out. By far, we found the material of these leggings to be the smoothest and most comfortable of all the rock climbing pants we tested.</p>\n<p><i>Climbing </i>Associate Editor Sam MacIlwaine wore the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-afl-p=\"1\" href=\"https://arcteryx.sjv.io/c/2850304/1991772/24493?u=https%3A%2F%2Farcteryx.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fshop%2Fwomens%2Fessent-high-rise-utility-legging-26&amp;subId1=pants-2025\">Essent High-Rise Utility Leggings</a> ($140) during hot spring and summer sessions around the Utah desert. After sport climbing, bouldering, and moving through offwidths in the Essent, she called them the “most comfortable leggings” she owns—and she owns a lot of leggings. While she loved the lightweight construction for warm-weather climbing, she did worry that the thin fabric would become damaged over time—though hasn’t seen any signs of wear or tear yet. That said, the potential tradeoff is worth it if you want to prioritize breathability and low-profile construction for comfort in warm temps or climbing in the gym.</p>\n<p>Another feature Sam loved was the pocket configuration. Two deep side pockets can accommodate a phone, plus a concealed all-around waistbelt pocket stores tiny essentials. She was a big fan of the bright indigo “Electra” color, but wished they were also available in red or pink.</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I0-P0-CMI_S_1_-3\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<p>Lastly, we love that these pants have a wide variety of sizes, including inclusive sizing up to size 16. Numerical sizing allows you to get the best fit.</p>\n<p>Don’t be fooled by the name—tester Sam MacIlwaine says these <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-afl-p=\"1\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=156240X1688880&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenorthface.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fwomens%2Fwomens-collections%2Fwomens-summit-series-324773%2Fwomens-summit-series-off-width-pants-NF0A84PM&amp;xcust=pants-2025\">Off-width Pants from The North Face</a> ($160) are more of an all-around staple than an offwidth-specific garment. For climbers who don’t love leggings, Sam found these pairs outperformed the rest on trad climbs, multi-pitch routes, and sport pitches alike. Compared to its peers, these pants felt lighter, smoother, and more comfortable. She called them “the most fantastic pants for sport and multi-pitch climbing” due to their superior breathability and “mega smooth” feel. As for offwidths, she found they worked decently well for vertical offwidths but fell short on roofs; their breezy fit left her shins exposed for shredding. (See our offwidth pant recommendations below if that’s what you’re looking for).</p>\n<p>One of the biggest boons of these women’s climbing pants is how successful they are in merging lightweight construction with durability. We also loved the style of these pants—aside from the high-profile North Face logo on the right thigh and “Summit Series” insignia below the left knee, you could get away with dressing these pants up for work or town. If you’re a brand fan, that might not be a problem.</p>\n<p>While Sam calls these pants “95% perfect,” her biggest gripe was the belt loops and snap button closure at the waist. <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.climbing.com/gear/best-climbing-harnesses/\">A harness</a> renders the belt loops useless, and a high-waisted spandex strip would allow for a more seamless, comfortable fit.</p>\n<p>Another upside of these pants is the range of inclusive sizing available. With numerical sizing from 00 to 16—plus the ability to choose a short, regular, or long inseam—you can optimize fit.</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I0-P0-CMI_S_1_-5\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<p>If you love Carhartts, but feel that they’re ultimately a little too burly and intractable for performance climbing, the Black Diamond Ethos Pants ($109; available in XS-XL) wear like lightweight workwear. This means they hold up to abrasion remarkably well and will emerge on the other end of a crack relatively unscathed. <i>Climbing </i>Editor-in-Chief <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.climbing.com/byline/mayasilver\">Maya Silver</a> wore these pants climbing a desert tower and cracks in Utah’s San Rafael Swell, on sport routes around Echo Canyon in Utah, and at the gym.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

That’s enough even to get me out from under the blankets on a cool fall morning. Topped with a sticky, cinnamon-scented <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/g1968/easy-apple-recipes/\"><u>apple</u></a> compote, you won’t need anything extra to complete these pancakes (although a little maple syrup never hurt anyone). These beauties are extra fluffy thanks to the addition of fluffy whipped egg whites into the batter. Trust me—once you try it, you may never make pancakes the same way again. <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/g1684/best-pancakes/\"><u>Pancakes</u></a> are super simple, but they do take practice to get them perfect. Follow these simple tips to reach apple pancake heaven every time.</p>\n<h2>How To Make Apple Pancakes</h2>\n<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>\n<ul>\n        <li><strong>Butter: </strong>If you're a fan of crisp edges and don't mind a slightly darker pancake with a few beauty marks, butter is the way to go. If you prefer a nice, smooth, uniform, and evenly light brown pancake with fluffy edges, go with a neutral oil like canola or vegetable.</li>\n        <li><strong>Apples: </strong>The sweet and warm spiced apple compote is the best part of these pancakes. As for the <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/kitchen-tools/kitchen-secrets/g40782886/types-of-apples-and-uses/\"><u>type of apple</u></a>, a firm apple with a good blend of sweetness and tartness is your best bet. Go for a Pink Lady, Honey Crisp, or Braeburn apple.</li>\n        <li><strong>Brown Sugar: </strong>You can use either light or dark brown sugar here, but keep in mind there will be a slight flavor difference. Dark brown sugar has more molasses and so will have a stronger molasses flavor, which I feel plays really well with the sweetness of the apples. If you aren’t as big a molasses fan, stick to light brown sugar.</li>\n        <li><strong>Ground Cinnamon: </strong>Cinnamon and apples are always a welcome combination. The warm, fragrant, spicy notes of cinnamon complement the bright sweetness of the apples, like in our <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a43183/foil-pack-cinnamon-apples-recipe/\"><u>foil pack cinnamon apples</u></a><strong>.</strong></li>\n        <li><strong>Water: </strong>A little bit of water is necessary to create the jammy texture of the apple topping. It will help the apples cook down and infuse all the brown sugar and cinnamon flavor into them.</li>\n        <li><strong>All-Purpose Flour &amp; Baking Powder: </strong>This combination is perfect any time you need a little bit of rise in your baked goods, but also want to maintain a light structure. The two will help thicken the batter while still allowing it to spread enough for that perfect pancake.</li>\n        <li><strong>Granulated Sugar &amp; Kosher Salt: </strong>Granulated sugar adds some sweetness to the dish, while the salt helps everything pop. The pancakes themselves won’t be too sweet, and not salty at all, but instead will have a nice, light balance.</li>\n        <li><strong>Egg: </strong>The egg is playing 2 big roles here. We’re separating it into yolk and white as the yolk will help to give structure to the batter, while the whites are whipped until stiff and then gently folded into the batter to make these pancakes extra light and fluffy.</li>\n        <li><strong>Pure Vanilla Extract: </strong>The floral notes of the vanilla extract work in tandem with the floral notes of the apples, while also helping to add a bit of depth to the batter.</li>\n        <li><strong>Milk: </strong>This batter needs some moisture and fat to allow things to spread evenly without overspreading and becoming too thin; milk does the job perfectly.</li>\n      </ul>\n<h2>STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS</h2>\n<p data-journey-content=\"true\" data-node-id=\"recipe-intro.6\" class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">To start these pancakes off, we need to make the apple topping. Start by melting 2 Tbsp. butter in a small saucepan and measuring out and reserving 1 ½ c. chopped apples. Add the rest of the chopped apples, along with the brown sugar, ½ tsp. cinnamon, and ¼ c. water to the saucepan. Cook the mixture for about 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the apples soften and the mixture becomes jammy.</p>\n<p data-journey-content=\"true\" data-node-id=\"recipe-intro.8\" class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">Mix together the dry ingredients—flour, baking soda, sugar, salt, and remaining cinnamon—in a medium bowl. Then, melt the remaining butter and, in a large bowl, whisk together the wet ingredients—egg yolk, vanilla, milk, and melted butter—to combine. Once the wet ingredients are combined, gently fold in the dry ingredients until just combined, then fold in the reserved 1 ½ c. chopped apple. </p>\n<p data-journey-content=\"true\" data-node-id=\"recipe-intro.11\" class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">In another bowl, use a hand mixer to beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form, taking care not to over-beat. Gently fold the whipped egg white into the batter until just combined, taking care not to deflate the whipped egg white.</p>\n<p data-journey-content=\"true\" data-node-id=\"recipe-intro.13\" class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">In a large skillet, melt 1 Tbsp. butter and pour about ¼ c. pancake batter into the pan—or adjust for the size of pancakes you prefer. Once little bubbles begin to appear in the batter, which should happen after about 1 to 2 minutes of cooking, carefully flip the pancake and continue cooking until both sides are lightly golden. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the pan as needed. Serve the pancakes topped with the apple mixture and enjoy!</p>\n<p data-journey-content=\"true\" data-node-id=\"recipe-intro.15\" class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">\n        <i>The full list of ingredients and instructions can be found in the recipe below.</i>\n      </p>\n<h2>Recipe Tips</h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Lunchbox classics five days a week: PB&amp;J on Monday, salami on Tuesday, bologna when the fridge looked bleak. As an adult, a sandwich still saves my day when ambition is low and the stove is judging me from across the room. </p>\n    <p>And when it comes to the topic of <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/g65269127/homemade-condiment-recipes/\">condiments</a>, I’ve never had an issue with mayo. Although if it were life or death, I’m sorry, mayonnaise, I will give a lovely eulogy, but mustard is the one getting pulled back from the ledge. Still, mayo on a turkey and Swiss absolutely has a place in my heart and on my bread. Dessert, though? </p>\n    <p>Hearing <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/food-news/a66079146/bath-and-body-works-milk-bar-collab/\">Milk Bar</a> and Hellmann’s teamed up on a tiny bite inspired by founder Christina Tosi’s favorite tomato-mayo sandwich initially gave me pause. The Hellmann’s Mayo Sweet Sandwich stars petite slices of sweet cake standing in for bread, a glossy white mayo frosting, and a thick tomato gelée stacked like a tea sandwich that wandered <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/food-news/a66000754/gbbo-season-16-premiere-fan-reaction/\">into the tent</a> next to Paul Hollywood himself. </p>\n    <p>Curiosity got the best of me, obviously. I’m a glutton for punishment and a stomach ache, so I just had to try it.</p>\n    <p>First impression: adorable. It looks like the kind of canapé you’re told to take two of, because one disappears before your brain registers that your mouth is full. Before the entire bite, I tried each layer on its own to get my bearings.</p>\n    <p>The cake “bread” lands buttery with a gentle sweetness. The tomato gelée tastes like tomato, not vague red fruit in a <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/holiday-recipes/halloween/\">Halloween</a> costume. If tomatoes make you nervous, this will not be your turning point. If you eat <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/g37023704/best-cherry-tomato-recipes/\">cherry tomatoes</a> like grapes, you’re safe. The mayo frosting nudges you that familiar tang from the jar, but it leans confection just enough. But let’s just say it’s not exactly hiding. None of it is.</p>\n    <p>Together, the bite reads like a tomato–mayo sandwich in a fun-house mirror. Sweetness walks behind the tomato, not in front. But what surprised me most was how literal the flavors are.</p>\n    <p>The tomato tastes like a tomato, and the gelée behaves like an honest slice that tries to slide, which leads to several neat little nudges back into place. The mayo, for better or for worse, tastes like mayo. I also caught myself licking a dot of the “frosting” off the side, which is not a thing I’ve ever done with actual mayo, so credit to the pastry team for that mind trick. And the cake tastes like cake, giving the whole bite a soft landing. Somehow it’s both weird and charming at the same time.</p>\n    <p>If your dessert religion <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/g1779/quick-easy-chocolate-desserts/\">is chocolate</a>, you’ll shrug. If peak-season tomato on soft bread makes you soft too, you’ll get the appeal. </p>\n    <p>The Hellmann’s Mayo Sweet Sandwich is available at Milk Bar’s New York City, Los Angeles, and DC flagship bakeries through October 17 with a DIY kit on <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1525073&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmilkbarstore.com%2F\">milkbarstore.com</a>.</p>\n    <p>I’m very glad I tried it. I don’t need another.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

One of the most common iterations is the humble pumpkin muffin. You can make a recipe from scratch or with a pre-made mix, but nearly every cafe and grocery store sells its own ready-to-eat version. </p>\n    <p>So how should we know which ones to buy? I decided to put two of our favorite stores head-to-head: <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/food/a66038942/best-trader-joes-fall-items-2025/\">Trader Joe’s</a> and <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/food-news/a66004289/costco-kirkland-signature-pumpkin-pie-returns/\">Costco</a>. I tried both of their pumpkin streusel muffins to see which one is worth your money. Here's what you need to know.  </p>\n    <h2>Costco</h2>\n    <p>Costco's pumpkin streusel muffins come in a pack of eight for $6.99—that's less than 88 cents per muffin! And they're not skimping either. Each muffin is generously sized with large clumps of golden streusel on top. Another plus: the tulip-shaped liners make these look like they came from a fancy bakery, rather than a discount bulk warehouse.</p>\n    <p>However, that's where my praise ends. Once you slice into these muffins, you're met with pumpkin-less pockets of batter. The craggly cross-section immediately reveals how dry these muffins are. The texture is dense and a bit tough (A.K.A. exactly what you <i>don't</i> want from a muffin). </p>\n    <p>The flavor leaves a lot to be desired, too. The pumpkin flavor is extremely muted, and there's a glaring lack of warm spices you'd expect to find. And the streusel is the biggest letdown; instead of sweet and buttery crumbs, it's unpleasantly firm with a chemical-esque aftertaste.</p>\n    <h2>Trader Joe's</h2>\n    <p>Trader Joe's recently rolled out its own pumpkin streusel muffins, which come in a 4-pack for $5.99. That means each muffin costs $1.50. It's significantly more expensive than the Costco version, but still cheaper than buying a muffin at a café.</p>\n    <p>The interior of this muffin is much more promising. The batter is noticeably darker than Costco's. You can partly credit the hue to the added natural caramel color, but it also likely means there's more pumpkin per muffin. There are a few uneven pockets scattered throughout, but unlike Costco's dry spots, Trader Joe's has a few extra spots of pumpkin puree, which we consider a major bonus.</p>\n    <p>The flavor doesn't disappoint either. Trader Joe's does not hold back on the spices. Clove is dominant in the batter, which really adds to the fall flavor. You can also actually taste the pumpkin. And the buttery, crunchy streusel adds lovely textural contrast to the soft, delicate muffin.</p>\n    <p>These TJ's treats are extremely tender and moist. Food Editor <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/author/233853/taylor-ann-spencer/\">Taylor Ann Spencer</a> described them as more \"cakey\" than your average muffin—and there's a clear explanation why: these muffins are gluten-free! Without wheat flour, the texture stays ultra-tender (even though it's made in an industrial mixer). </p>\n    <h2>The Verdict</h2>\n    <p>It's not even close: Trader Joe's absolutely demolished Costco here. We shouldn't be too surprised, since Costco lovers have recently raised concerns about the <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/food/a64895090/why-costco-muffins-are-different/\">declining quality</a> of the warehouse's muffins. Next time you're in the mood for a fall-forward treat, it's absolutely worth spending the extra 60-something cents for a significantly better muffin. </p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Investigating the fraudster’s life, Laura Kolb finds a self-fashioning figure who both influenced the emergence of the English novel and serves as a strange precursor to our modern-day fascination with conwomen and counterfeits, like the heiress manqué Anna Delvey.</p>\n<p>September 17, 2025</p>\n<p>Woodcut portrait (used to represent Mary Carleton) from the title page of the pamphlet <i>Memories of the Life of the Famous Madam Charlton</i> (1673) — <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:A_woodcut_portrait_of_Mary_Carleton_from_a_pamphlet.jpg\">Source</a>.</p>\n<p>In early June of 1663, Mary Carleton was tried for bigamy in London’s Old Bailey. A figure of considerable public fascination, Mary had been “viewed” by an estimated five hundred visitors while in prison awaiting trial.<sup> 1</sup> Officially, she stood accused of having wed John Carleton in London while already married to John Steadman, a shoemaker, in Canterbury. (Over the course of the trial, the possible existence of a third husband, a Dover surgeon named Day, emerged.) Unofficially, she stood accused in the court of public opinion of a far more interesting cheat: impersonating a fabulously wealthy foreigner in order to lure the hapless Carleton — a lawyer’s clerk, eighteen years old — into marriage. Though Mary herself modestly claimed noble rather than royal birth, she became widely known as the German Princess.</p>\n<p>The facts of Mary Carleton’s life are difficult to pin down.<sup> 2</sup> Its best-recorded episodes — her bigamous marriage and subsequent trial — are the subject of numerous conflicting accounts, while long stretches of her earlier and later life are poorly documented. She was born Mary Moders in Canterbury, probably in 1642. Her father was a musician, maybe a fiddler. She married Steadman, the shoemaker, in the mid-1650s and Day, the surgeon, several years after that. In 1663, she married Carleton, stood trial for bigamy, and was acquitted — Carleton’s side having been able to produce only a single, ineffectual witness. (Steadman reportedly would have testified, but wanted money for travel expenses.) Several years later, in 1671, she was sent to Jamaica for purloining a tankard. She returned to England illegally and resumed thieving; in 1673, she was tried, convicted, and hanged.</p>\n<p>Mary Carleton’s exploits produced a publishing boom: 1663 alone witnessed the printing of more than a dozen pamphlets and broadsides about the case, a pair of autobiographical self-defenses by Mary herself, two rebuttals by John, and printed reports of the trial. A few elements of the story remain relatively undisputed. One early morning in the spring of 1663, a well-mannered, foreign-seeming woman entered the Exchange Tavern in central London. She was accompanied by a parson, with whom she had just shared a ride in a tilt-boat carrying passengers to the city from the port in Gravesend. Seeking to elude the parson’s increasingly amorous attentions, the lady appealed to the tavern’s host, one Mr. King; he provided her with lodgings. King and his wife took careful note of the stranger’s jewels and of letters she sent overseas, ostensibly to a steward. The couple introduced her to Mrs. King’s brother, young John Carleton, who wooed and wed her in the space of a few weeks.</p>\n<p>When it comes to this courtship and its aftermath, accounts diverge. Mary’s version of events can be found in three works published in 1663. The first, <i>A Vindication of a Distressed Lady</i>, appeared before the trial; it is anonymous, but its tone and contents are in keeping with two subsequent works by Mary herself.<sup> 3</sup> A </p>\n<p><i>Vindication</i>insists on Mary’s Germanness, claiming anyone who has heard her speak can detect it in her “Natural Tongue”.</p>\n<p>\n      <sup>It cites as evidence of elite birth and continental origins her facility with “French, Dutch, Latin, Greek, [and] Hebrew”, as well as skills in “Musick, singing, dancing, and the like.”</sup>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <sup>It refutes an earlier satirical pamphlet’s claims that she is a known, English thief who stole sixty pounds from a vintner, purloined rings from a French merchant, and “pickt a Kentish Lord’s pocket at Graves-end.”</sup>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <sup>It closes with Mary looking forward to her trial, where it will be proven that “she hath no other Husband then Mr. John Carleton.”</sup>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <sup>The bottom of the last page contains a postscript, informing the reader that her German maiden name was de Wolway and not — as vulgar English slanderers have apparently rendered it — de Vulva.</sup>\n    </p>\n<p>James Basire after F.

In England, however, giving once stretched into some peculiar places. In Glentham in Lincolnshire, for example, money was set aside for the yearly washing of the tomb of one Molly Grime; and in Newmarket in 1801, £21 was budgeted annually to encourage the marriage of local couples (if unclaimed, the money would go to the local fund for the encouragement of horse racing).</p>\n    <p>These examples are from <i>A Collection of Old English Customs, and Curious Bequests and Charities</i>. Published in 1842, it consists of excerpts from reports made by the Commissioners for Enquiring into Charities in England and Wales. This group was established in 1818 and initially tasked to inspect the condition of charitable trusts for the education of the poor, but its remit soon expanded to include all types of trusts. The first Parliamentary-appointed survey to examine charities, its primary aim was to investigate the most effective use of such funds, a role its institutional descendant, the Charity Commission, still largely holds today. </p>\n    <p>Using the commissioners’ material on the details of wills and legacies, the author — “Henry Edwards of Hoxton” — attempts to trace how certain local customs of giving were established. The text is essentially a digest of examples, shaped around types of charitable actions. It begins with examples of the giving of food, often linked to seasonal festivities and occasions, such as “in aid of Christmas”, Easter, and “for the poor in Lent”, then widens out to societal concerns. Donations for “maimed and old soldiers” and “for redeeming Christian Slaves from African Captivity” follow. The promotion of education (“stimulants to learning and good behaviour”) is covered, too, as are examples of donations to reward decorum and respect (“for upholding loyalty and patriotism” and “for the encouragement of Servants and Apprentices”). Unsurprisingly, given this moral tone, the book’s compiler provides plenty of details from religious life, ranging from donations for the creation of sermons of thankfulness in times of national emergency (e.g., the Great Fire of London, Nelson’s Victory at Trafalgar) to smaller scale acts of benevolence (e.g., “to keep church and churchyard clean” and “keeping boys quiet in church”).</p>\n    <p>Such content might seem rather dry, but as this last example suggests, the author intends to “combine instruction with amusement”, as he states in his introduction. For example, John Nicholson, a London stationer, leaves in his will of 1717 money to be given to any poor person in England with the name of Nicholson so they can advance themselves; Sir Robert Cocks’ will grants money to the poor of New Woodstock, Oxford, a promise he made shortly before buying a winning lottery ticket in 1719. Edwards provides intrigue, too, telling of the parish of Upper Holker in Lancashire, where five acres of land were “bought by the inhabitants with the sum of 185 ½ guineas, which were found in the pocket of a travelling beggar” who had died in a lodging house in the parish in 1799.</p>\n    <p>Despite his desire to entertain, the author never forgets the improving message he wishes to impart. It is hard not to read this <i>Collection</i> as a work celebrating the beneficence of the well-to-do upon the “deserving poor”. Inadvertently, however, it also offers glimpses of charitable efforts going awry as a result of the poor’s seeming unwillingness to play their part. He recounts, for example, the death of the custom of “Stephening” in Drayton Beauchamp, Buckinghamshire, where “all the inhabitants used to go on St. Stephen’s Day to the Rectory, and eat as much bread and cheese, and drink as much ale as they chose, at the expense of the Rector”. Stephening was discontinued by the Rector, as the event “gave rise to so much rioting”. While many perceive the English countryside as the unchanging home of ancient customs and rituals (a myth that can still entice in the twenty-first century), the examples in <i>A Collection</i> also illustrate how mutable customs can be, and how often they are altered through shifting social ideas and economic forces. </p>\n    <p>Published in the early Victorian era, <i>A Collection</i> dates from a time when the word “folklore” did not yet exist, but the practices we now associate with that term (i.e., the gathering of accounts and descriptions of customs and beliefs) was starting to generate increasing interest in the publishing world. Four years after this work was printed, the antiquarian William Thoms, contributing to a discussion in <i>The Athenaeum</i>, would come up with the composite term “Folk-lore” to describe what had previously been known as “popular antiquities”. Sadly, it seems that the publication of <i>A Collection</i> went unnoticed by Thoms and his correspondents. The oversight might have been down to pure bad luck, or Edward’s relatively brief appearance on the literary scene; this seems to have been his only book. However, if Thoms <i>was</i> aware of Edwards’ work, it might not have been to the taste of a man who saw tradition arising from the “folk”, rather than the indulgences and whims of the wealthy. </p>\n    <p>Sep 17, 2025</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>This month at <i>Guernica</i>, we move from a Rembrandt painting to the streets of Chiang Mai, from the Dogon country of Mali to the corridors of a Catholic school, and into the haunted terrain of Indigenous horror. Across works as intimate as they are global, one word keeps surfacing: <i>legacy</i>. What do we inherit from our context, and how do we carry it forward? How do we reckon with cultural traditions that are both sustaining and fraught? And in an age where the past is constantly resurfacing on our screens—what the late cultural theorist Mark Fisher called “the slow cancellation of the future”—how can legacies impress upon us the weight of memory without marooning us in a strange sense of repetition, of a clotted or blocked time, as if history itself refuses to pass?</p>\n    <p>In fiction, an excerpt from Thomas Schlesser’s novel <a href=\"https://www.guernicamag.com/rembrandt-know-yourself/\"> Mona’s Eyes</a> follows a young girl whose mother fears she may lose her sight. During stolen afternoons at the Louvre, Mona’s grandfather teaches her to see—through Rembrandt’s chiaroscuro, through the lives and losses painted onto canvas—as a way of facing what might come. Meanwhile, James Chan Yu’s </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.guernicamag.com/tourists/\">“Tourists”</a>unfolds in Chiang Mai, where Ken, a Korean American who once lived in Thailand, finds himself reduced to “just another farang” as he travels with his American girlfriend through heat, crowds, and the small humiliations that reveal the fault lines of belonging abroad.</p>\n    <p>In nonfiction, Vamba Sherif’s <a href=\"https://www.guernicamag.com/in-search-of-ouologuem/\">“In Search of Ouologuem”</a> traces the rise and erasure of Malian novelist Yambo Ouologuem, whose audacious <i>Bound to Violence</i> won the Prix Renaudot before accusations of plagiarism led him to retreat from public life. Sherif’s essay becomes both a personal pilgrimage and an inquiry into the literary inheritance of Africa, Europe, and beyond. </p>\n    <p>In conversation, <a href=\"https://www.guernicamag.com/anna-bruno-suspense-secular-gods-and-scandal-in-an-elite-catholic-school/\">Anna Bruno</a>, interviewed by Maria Kuznetsova, discusses her new novel <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/341/9781643757001\"> Fine Young People</a>, set in a Catholic high school where two friends investigate the long-ago death of a hockey player. She reflects on suspense, the Catholic church, and how young narrators navigate authority with insight rather than precocity. </p>\n    <p>For our Global Spotlights, Nathan Niigan Noodin Adler’s <a href=\"https://www.guernicamag.com/the-harvest/\">“The Harvest”</a> drags Indigenous horror into the light, showing how histories of erasure and violence resurface from the soil. </p>\n    <p>And in poetry, the issue closes with French-Senegalese poet Sylvie Kandé, whose trilogy—<a href=\"https://www.guernicamag.com/visitation-september-2025/\">“Visitation,”</a> <a href=\"https://www.guernicamag.com/colophon-ii/\">“Colophon II,”</a> and <a href=\"https://www.guernicamag.com/waltz-of-stone/\">“Waltz of Stone”</a>—translated by Nancy Naomi Carlson, weaves exile and generational scars into lyric form. Alongside her is Dominican poet José Mármol, one of his country’s most celebrated voices, whose elegiac <a href=\"https://www.guernicamag.com/an-emptiness-yet-to-come/\">“An Emptiness Yet to Come”</a> and<a href=\"https://www.guernicamag.com/the-sad-ballad-of-wyckoff/\"> “The Sad Ballad of Wyckoff,”</a> translated by Nathalie Handal and Eileen O’Connor, explore absence while holding fast to love.</p>\n    <p>The legacies these pieces confront—whether familial, psychological, artistic, or cultural—are neither static nor unambiguous. They press upon us that, if we are indeed suspended in an age when the future has been stalled, as Fisher suggested, the act of looking back may require as much discipline as it does imagination. As José Mármol writes, “the omen of your absence remains in the halls, / an emptiness yet to come”: lines that distend the word <i>legacy</i> with a vision of time folding in on itself, where the unarrived leans, already, against the present. </p>\n    <p>Featuring, courtesy of the artists, striking original artwork by Patil Balian, Rembrandt van Rijn, Charlotte Brathwaite &amp; Malick Welli, Alioune Diagne, Lucia Hierro, Kenny Rivero, Enrique Pichardo, and Stephen Arboite.</p>\n    <p>–<a href=\"https://www.guernicamag.com/author/youmna-m-chamieh/\">Youmna M.

Then, the experts have to count the uranium and lead atoms present.</p>\n    <p>“Since uranium decays into lead at a fixed rate, we were able to calculate the age by measuring accumulated lead — it’s like an atomic clock for fossils,” explained study co-author Bi Zhao.</p>\n    <p>U-Pb dating has been used to date rocks, minerals, and other fossils in the past, but using it to examine dinosaur eggs is new.</p>\n    <p>“To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that <i>in situ</i> isotopic ages have been reported for dinosaur eggshells both in China and, very likely, worldwide,” study co-author Xing Cheng told <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02904-0\"> Nature</a>.</p>\n    <p>Notably, the results of the U-Pb dating matched the approximated dates of the rocks surrounding the eggs.

With over 3,000 confirmed fossilized eggs at the reserve, 28 of them were dated as part of the study.

By the time these eggs were laid over 85 million years ago, the global climate was in a period of transition.</p>\n    <p>Temperatures were growing cooler, and dinosaurs were going to have to start adapting in order to survive. Researchers believe that this cooling climate may have contributed to dwindling biodiversity amongst the creatures, and the fossilized dinosaur eggs themselves may even point to that.</p>\n    <p>“Dendroolithids’ specialized pore structures may represent evolutionary adaptations to this climatic shift, as novel egg types emerged worldwide during cooling,” Bi Zhao said in a <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2025/09/11/85-million-year-old-dino-eggs-understanding-cretaceous-climate\">statement</a>. “<i>P. tumiaolingensis</i> may represent an evolutionary dead end where the egg-laying dinosaur population failed to adapt successfully to cooling climates.”</p>\n    <p>The research team is looking to expand their research into what the specific climate may have looked like in different areas and different times by dating fossilized eggs found at various rock layers, in the hopes of constructing a regional timeline of the local dinosaur population during a changing climate. Researchers also believe that studying other Dendroolithid eggs in nearby basins could help put together a clearer picture of dinosaur migrations.</p>\n    <p>“Our achievement holds significant implications for research on dinosaur evolution and extinction, as well as environmental changes on Earth during the Late Cretaceous,” Zhao explained. “Such findings can transform fossils into compelling narratives about Earth’s history.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Next, read about the  perfectly preserved, 70-million-year-old dinosaur embryo found curled up in its egg.

Slowly but surely, however, those long-lost pieces are now coming to the surface.</p>\n    <p>Thanks to a decades-long archaeological project — as well as historically low water levels — archaeologists have been able to recover huge chunks of the lost royal residence. These pieces will go to the Polish History Museum, which is steadily reconstructing the palace out of the recovered parts.</p>\n    <h2>Recovering Pieces Of The Villa Regia</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/archaeologists-at-vistula-river.jpg\" alt=\"Archaeologists At Vistula River\"/>\n    <p>Muzeum Historii PolskiArchaeologists at the Vistula River. Though annual projects at the site have ceased, archaeologists still check the river for pieces of the palace.</p>\n    <p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MuzeumHistoriiPolski/posts/1246023797564898\">statement from the Polish History Museum</a>, archaeologists have been working to recover pieces of the palace, the Villa Regia, since the first fragments emerged in 2011. Since then, they’ve recovered roughly 22 tons of material, much of it coming from a “breakthrough” year in 2015. But while regular projects at the site have ceased, archaeologists have continued to check the river for more remnants of the palace. </p>\n    <p>And this year, with the water level of the Vistula River at a historic low, they found some incredible pieces of the lost Villa Regia.</p>\n    <p>Specifically, archaeologists were able to recover pieces of the Villa Regia’s “monumental staircase.” They found a 440-pound fragment of an arcade arch, which historians will be able to fit into the palace reconstruction at the Polish History Museum, as well as a section of a pillar, which will provide new insights into the staircase’s dimensions.</p>\n    <p>“The monuments excavated today will enhance the large collection of exhibits from the 17th-century royal residence Villa Regia located in the Museum of Polish History,” Krzysztof Niewiadomski, Deputy Director of the Polish History Museum for Program Affairs, remarked. “Based on these, we are preparing one of the most impressive installations of the permanent exhibition — the reconstruction of the palace staircase.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/recovering-palace-pieces-from-the-river.jpg\" alt=\"Recovering Palace Pieces From The River\"/>\n    <p>Muzeum Historii PolskiTwo large chunks of the Villa Regia’s staircase were recovered during the recent expedition.</p>\n    <p>Historians will also seek to use the palace fragments to tell the larger story of Poland’s history, as well as the 17th-century Swedish invasion known as the “Deluge.”</p>\n    <h2>The Rise And Fall Of The Villa Regia</h2>\n    <p>The Villa Regia was built between 1637 and 1642 as a summer residence for King Władysław IV Vasa. According to the Polish History Museum, it was “one of the most magnificent residences of 17th-century Europe.” It had an especially impressive western loggia, an exterior gallery or corridor, which was likely erected after the king married Cecilia Renata Habsburg.</p>\n    <p>But then, between 1655 and 1660, the Swedes invaded in what Poland calls the “Swedish Deluge.” During that period, <a href=\"https://dzieje.pl/aktualnosci/potop-szwedzki-przyniosl-polsce-straty-o-wartosci-4-mld-zlotych\">Polish media</a> reports that Poland’s population plummeted by 40 percent and that 188 towns, 186 villages, 136 churches, 30 mills, 10 breweries, 81 castles, and 89 palaces were destroyed by the Swedes. One of those palaces was the Villa Regia.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/villa-regia.jpg\" alt=\"Villa Regia\"/>\n    <p>Public DomainA depiction of the Villa Regia in the 17th century, before it was looted by the Swedes.</p>\n    <p>As the Swedes retreated from Warsaw in 1656, they packed the pieces of the Villa Regia on a barge.

King</i>, eventually earning it a reputation as a \"ghost ship.\" But now, a group including more than a dozen citizen scientists and community historians have succeeded where countless others could not.</h2>\n<p>Wisconsin Historical SocietyA diver swimming above the newly-found wreckage of the schooner <i>F.J. King</i>, which sank in 1886.</p>\n<p>The Wisconsin Underwater Archaeology Association (WUAA) has announced the discovery of the long-lost wreck of the schooner <i>F.J. King</i>.</p>\n<p>The ship, which sank in a storm near Baileys Harbor, Wisconsin on September 16, 1886, had been one of Lake Michigan’s most sought-after shipwrecks for more than a century. This long-awaited find was made possible through the efforts of a dedicated team of citizen scientists and community historians, led by WUAA’s principal investigator, Brendon Baillod.</p>\n<p>A total of 20 volunteers from around the Midwest joined Baillod in the search for the elusive wreck of the <i>F.J. King</i>. Despite numerous attempts at locating the ship’s remains going back to the 1970s, none had ever been successful. This seemingly impossible task cemented the vessel’s reputation as an elusive <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/ghost-ships\">“ghost ship.”</a></p>\n<p>But now, Baillod and his team have succeeded where countless others could not.</p>\n<h2>The Discovery Of A 140-Foot Vessel At The Bottom Of Lake Michigan</h2>\n<p>Local lore claimed that various fishermen had hauled up pieces of the wreck in their nets over the years, while a lighthouse keeper even reported seeing the ship’s masts breaking the surface all the way back in 1886. However, the wreck itself could not be found. Eventually, the wreck became so elusive and sought-after that the Green Bay-based Neptune’s Dive Club offered a $1,000 reward.</p>\n<p>Wisconsin Historical SocietyThe <i>F.J. King</i> measured 144 feet in length.</p>\n<p>But to Baillod’s surprise, his team finally discovered the ship — just two hours into their search.</p>\n<p>The WUAA’s DeepVision side scan sonar picked up a large object, about 140 feet in length, on the floor of the lake — the exact measurements of the <i>F.J. King</i>. Shortly after, the team deployed ROVs to get a better look, while the WUAA’s citizen scientists dove into the water.</p>\n<p>“A few of us had to pinch each other,” Baillod said. “After all the previous searches, we couldn’t believe we had actually found it, and so quickly.”</p>\n<p>For the first time since it fell into its watery grave, human eyes bore witness to the <i>F.J. King</i>.</p>\n<h2>The Final Voyage Of The <i>F.J. King</i> In 1886</h2>\n<p>Door County Shore ReportThe <i>F.J. King</i> enjoyed a successful 19-year career before its fateful voyage in September 1886.</p>\n<p>The <i>F.J. King</i> was a three-masted wooden schooner built in Toledo, Ohio, in 1867 by master shipwright George Rogers. At 144 feet long, she was designed for the grain and iron ore trades, often transporting cargo through the Welland Canal around Niagara Falls.</p>\n<p>Her final voyage began on September 15, 1886 in Escanaba, Michigan, where she loaded iron ore bound for Chicago. Caught in a powerful gale off Wisconsin’s Door Peninsula, the vessel took on water as heavy seas strained her seams.</p>\n<p>After hours of pumping, Captain William Griffin ordered his men into the yawl boat. At 2:00 a.m., the schooner went down bow-first, breaking apart as her crew rowed away. They were then rescued by the schooner <i>La Petite</i> and taken safely to Bailey’s Harbor.</p>\n<p>Wisconsin Historical SocietyThe crew survived the wreck and were safely taken to Baileys Harbor.</p>\n<p>Although Griffin later reported that the wreck lay five miles from shore in 25 fathoms (150 feet) of water, Cana Island Lighthouse keeper William Sanderson claimed he saw masts peeking above the water line much nearer to the shore. Nevertheless, the ship’s true location remained a mystery for more than a century thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Solving The Mystery Of Where Exactly This Famous “Ghost Ship” Went Down</h2>\n<p>Wisconsin Historical SocietyDespite its heavy cargo, the ship’s hull is still intact.</p>\n<p>“We reasoned that the captain may not have known where he was in the 2 a.m. darkness,” Baillod said, “but the lighthouse keeper’s course and distance to the masts were probably accurate.”</p>\n<p>Working off this assumption, Baillod and the team mapped a two-square-mile grid around the keeper’s account, and within that zone, they finally located this storied wreck. As it turned out, it was found less than half a mile from where Sanderson described.</p>\n<p>“The hull is remarkably intact,” Baillod said. “We expected her to be in pieces due to the weight of the iron ore cargo, but her hull looks to be in one piece.”</p>\n<p>Wisconsin Historical SocietyA closeup of the ship’s shockingly intact hull.</p>\n<p>The discovery has been reported to the Wisconsin Historical Society’s Maritime Archaeology program, whose staff have already begun documenting the wreck and creating a 3D photogrammetry model. Plans are underway to nominate the site for inclusion in the State and National Register of Historic Places, after which its location will be made public.</p>\n<p>This is the fifth significant shipwreck found by the WUAA and Baillod in the past three years, joining discoveries such as the schooner <i>Trinidad</i> and the <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/margaret-a-muir-shipwreck\"> Margaret A. Muir</a>, both of which are already listed on the National Register, as well as the </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/john-evenson-shipwreck\">.</a></p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<h2>Between 1986 and 2013, Christopher Thomas Knight lived alone in the woods of Maine, stealing from seasonal cabins and summer camps in order to survive.</h2>\n<p>RedditThe “North Pond Hermit,” Christopher Thomas Knight, after his 2013 arrest.</p>\n<p>In the 1980s, Christopher Thomas Knight decided to leave the world behind and spend his life in the woods of Maine, unbothered by the demands of bills, a career, or his fellow humans. He was just 20 years old at the time — and he wouldn’t emerge from the forest until he was nearly 50.</p>\n<p>Knight survived by stealing from summer camps and seasonal cabins, and while he recognized that his thefts were wrong, he reconciled his moral qualms by entering only uninhabited buildings and taking just what he needed to live: food, clothing, propane tanks, and books to keep his mind occupied.</p>\n<p>These mysterious robberies earned Knight a reputation, and locals began referring to him as the “North Pond Hermit.” Then, in 2013, a game warden set out to capture the elusive thief. Knight was arrested that April and spent seven months in jail for his crimes.</p>\n<p>While the North Pond Hermit no longer lives in the forests of Maine, he looks back fondly on his decades of solitude. As Knight once told a journalist, “There was no audience, no one to perform for… To put it romantically, I was completely free.”</p>\n<h2>Christopher Thomas Knight’s Life Before Isolation</h2>\n<p>“I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived,” wrote Henry David Thoreau in his autobiographical work <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/205/205-h/205-h.htm\"> Walden</a>.</p>\n<p>Thoreau, a naturalist and essayist, published <i>Walden</i> in 1854 as a treatise on existing simply in nature. He lived in a small cabin by Walden Pond for two years, two months, and two days, developing a philosophy of self-reliance and simplicity. </p>\n<p>Of course, Thoreau was far less isolated than he made it seem. The land he lived on belonged to Ralph Waldo Emerson. His mother brought him meals and did his laundry. He wasn’t exactly “roughing it.” But though <i>Walden</i> initially published to a mild reception, it is now held in high regard. Perhaps that is because, as time has gone on, the idea of leaving the world behind for a quiet life in the woods has grown more and more appealing.</p>\n<p>That was certainly the case for Christopher Thomas Knight.</p>\n<p>Knight was born in Maine in 1965. Even as a child, he was notably reserved. He liked to spend time alone, if given the option, despite growing up with four older brothers and a younger sister.</p>\n<p>He was also skilled with his hands. He developed an early interest in mechanics and electronics and spent much of his free time outdoors fishing or exploring the woods. By the time he graduated from high school, he had established a reputation as a quiet young man who kept to himself.</p>\n<p>Knight FamilyChristopher Thomas Knight’s high school yearbook photo from 1984.</p>\n<p>After school, Knight briefly attended a vocational program in electronics. In 1986, he was working as an installer for home security systems — a profession that ironically equipped him with the knowledge of how to avoid detection. Despite holding steady work, however, Knight felt increasingly alienated from the demands of modern living.</p>\n<p>So, one day, he decided to leave it all behind.</p>\n<p>At just 20 years old, Knight quit his job without notice. Not bothering to so much as return his tools or inform his family, he cashed his final paycheck and drove out of town.</p>\n<p>“I had no one to tell,” Knight told author Michael Finkel in an interview for the 2017 book <i> The Stranger in the Woods</i>. “I didn’t have any friends. I had no interest in my co-workers.” </p>\n<p>It was 1986, the beginning of Knight’s life of solitude — one that would last for nearly three decades.</p>\n<h2>Becoming The North Pond Hermit</h2>\n<p>When asked, Knight couldn’t explain his decision. He was not going on a religious or philosophical journey. His parents were “good people,” he said. At first, he didn’t even plan to live in the woods. He had initially grabbed his keys and driven his car down the East Coast, staying in cheap motels until he reached Florida.</p>\n<p>Then, after some time, he turned around and headed north again. Eventually, he found his way back to Maine. His family had no clue where he had gone or what had happened to him, but as he drove by his parents’ house, he didn’t stop to say goodbye to them. He just kept driving deep into the woods until he ran out of gas and abandoned his car with the keys inside.</p>\n<p>“I can’t explain my actions,” Knight said. “I had no plans when I left, I wasn’t thinking of anything. I just did it.”</p>\n<p>Maine State PoliceThe campsite where Christopher Thomas Knight spent 27 years.</p>\n<p>He didn’t have much, just some basic camping supplies, extra clothes, and a bit of food to get started. He started heading south into the woods, once again without any real sense of why or where he wanted to end up.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p><strong>Analyses and data indicate that the crypto market is experiencing its most active altcoin season since early 2025, with many altcoins outperforming Bitcoin. However, behind this excitement lies a paradox. Most retail investors remain uneasy as their portfolios show little to no profit.</strong></p><p>This article outlines the main reasons behind this situation.</p><h2>Altcoin Market Cap Rises but Dominance Shrinks</h2>Sponsored<p>TradingView data shows that the TOTAL3 market cap (excluding BTC and ETH) reached a new high of over $1.1 trillion in September.</p><p>Yet the share of OTHERS (excluding the top 10) has declined since 2022, now standing at just 8%.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/EzUWpUrx/\">TradingView</a>.</p><p>In past cycles, such as 2017 and 2021, TOTAL3 and OTHERS.D rose together. That trend reflected capital flowing not only into large-cap altcoins but also into mid-cap and low-cap ones.</p><p>The current divergence shows that capital is concentrated in stablecoins and a handful of top-10 altcoins such as <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-solana/\">SOL</a>, XRP, BNB, DOG, HYPE, and LINK. Smaller altcoins receive far less liquidity, making it hard for their prices to return to levels where investors previously bought. This creates a situation where only a few win while most face losses.</p><p>Retail investors also tend to diversify across many coins instead of adding size to top altcoins. That explains why many portfolios remain stagnant despite a broader market rally.</p>Sponsored<blockquote><p>“Position sizing is everything. Many people hold 25–30 tokens at once. A 100x on a token that makes up only 1% of your portfolio won’t meaningfully change your life. It’s better to make a few high-conviction bets than to overdiversify,” analyst The</p><a href=\"\">DeFi</a>Investor<a href=\"\">said</a>.</blockquote><h2>Altcoin Index Surges but Investor Sentiment Remains Cautious</h2><p>The Altcoin Season Index from Blockchain Center now stands at <a href=\"https://www.blockchaincenter.net/en/altcoin-season-index/\">80 points</a>. This indicates that over 80% of the top 50 altcoins outperformed Bitcoin in the past 90 days—a <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/signs-altcoin-season-accelerating-in-september/\">clear sign of altcoin season</a>.</p><p>However, the Fear &amp; Greed Index is at <a href=\"https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/\">52</a>, a neutral level reflecting caution and no clear directional bias.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.blockchaincenter.net/en/altcoin-season-index/\">Blockchain Center</a>&amp;</p><p><a href=\"https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/\">Alternative</a></p><p>Historical data shows that the 2024 rally drove both indicators higher. At that time, the Altcoin Season Index climbed above 75, while the Fear &amp; Greed Index soared past 80, showing extreme greed. The parallel rise reflected investor confidence as capital rotated strongly into altcoins. But that is not happening now.</p><p>Retail caution seems to stem from lessons learned in past cycles, where altcoins spiked then collapsed rapidly due to FOMO and mass sell-offs. New factors such as <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/rate-cut-roulette-0-25-50-bps-bitcoin-altcoins/\">Fed rate decisions</a>, tax impacts, and geopolitical tensions may also contribute to hesitation.</p><blockquote><p>“This isn’t an ‘everyone gets rich’ market anymore. It’s player vs. player, especially with the current macro environment,” analyst Luca</p><a href=\"\">emphasized</a>.</blockquote><h2>The Number of Altcoins Has Increased Tenfold Since 2021</h2><p>Although the TOTAL3 market cap is near its 2021 peak, the context has changed dramatically. CoinMarketCap reports that in 2025, more than 21 million altcoins will be tracked—100 times more than the roughly 20,000 coins in 2021.</p>Sponsored<p><a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/number-of-cryptocurrencies-tracked/\">CoinmarketCap</a></p><p><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/dune-analytics/\">Dune</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/0xNonceSense/status/1966871137440461098/photo/1\">data</a> highlights the token explosion from 2017 to 2025, with unique tokens skyrocketing, especially on Ethereum, <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-solana/\">Solana</a>, and Base.</p><p>This creates a much more selective environment. In 2021, investors could profit more easily with fewer coins because competition was lower. With tens of millions of tokens spanning <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/decentralized-finance-and-use-cases/\">DeFi</a>, meme coins, and AI tokens, picking the right one is as difficult as finding a needle in a haystack.</p><blockquote><p>“Back in 2021, the altcoin universe was small and almost every coin caught a rally—even the junky ones. Now in 2025, the game has changed. There are hundreds of times more altcoins. With such an oversupply, the odds that your random small-cap will magically 100x are near zero,” analyst Nonzee</p><a href=\"\">explained</a>.</blockquote><p>Most new tokens fail quickly due to low liquidity, rug pulls, or intense competition. Retail investors, who often spread capital across many small-cap tokens, now face higher risks. This results in either losses or very modest returns, even as the overall market surges.</p><p>These three factors explain why the <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/altcoin-season/\">September 2025 altcoin season</a> feels incomplete. To overcome this, investors may need deeper research, a focus on fundamentally strong projects, and a <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/crypto-portfolio-altcoin-season/\">reconsideration of excessive diversification</a>.</p></body>\n</html>",

The promise was decentralization, self-sovereignty and the end of gatekeepers. Far too many crypto firms still worship personalities and momentum rather than implementing fair governance and structure.</p><p>The irony is stark. A movement built to eliminate central points of failure or control has repeatedly been derailed by its own leadership. The same story repeats from exchange founders being treated like visionaries to DeFi builders rigging token votes for personal gain. One person’s influence is allowed to outweigh the system. When that person falters, everything crumbles.</p><p>Outsized control creates a dangerous feedback loop. Investors pile in, not because the system is resilient, but because they believe in the leader. Their mental model of the world becomes the project. </p><p>We’ve seen this dynamic before. Traditional finance, politics, even cults of celebrity all reveal the same pattern — once power centralizes, failure becomes inevitable. Crypto was supposed to be different. Instead, many projects have recreated the very hierarchies they set out to destroy, only with less oversight, weaker guardrails, and lower efficiency.</p><p>A decentralized system hinging on a single person is a contradiction in terms, and it gives the ruling classes an easy means of control. The silent majority should remember: Cut the head off a snake, and the body will die.</p><h2>DAOs as an antidote</h2><p>This is where <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/types-of-daos\" title=\"null\">DAOs</a> have shown real promise. Properly decentralized autonomous organizations don’t just flatten hierarchies; they replace them with ownership. They swap cults of personality for cultures of contribution.</p><p>When governance is shared and decision making is open, communities can evolve beyond dependence on a single leader. Instead of one figurehead driving the narrative, dozens or even hundreds of contributors step into leadership roles within their own domains. No bosses. No center. Just builders.</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-is-a-dao\" rel=\"\" target=\"_self\" title=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-is-a-dao\"><em><strong>What is a DAO, and how does it work?</strong></em></a><br><br>DAOs work because contributors treat them as theirs. After all, they are. Everyone who shows up and contributes is, in effect, a leader in their lane. Yes, it can be messy, aligning vision without a top-down boss is hard. Consensus takes time. But the upside is enormous: shared ownership, skin in the game, and communities that build because they believe in the mission, not the mythology of a founder.</p><p>Real decentralization doesn’t mean no leaders. It means more of them.</p><h2>The peril of personality</h2><p>The temptation to elevate charismatic figures is understandable. Humans are wired to follow stories more than spreadsheets. A dynamic founder gives media, investors and communities an easy focal point. That shortcut has consequences.</p><p>When the myth of the founder becomes stronger than the strength of the protocol, cracks form. Projects stagnate waiting for a leader’s blessing. Communities fracture when the leader is questioned. And when they inevitably exit the stage, whether through scandal, burnout or politics, the project is left hollow.</p><p>Crypto doesn’t need more heroes. It requires systems resilient enough to survive without them.</p><h2>It’s now or never</h2><p>This message would seem urgent in any context, but 2025 has made it existential. US President Donald Trump’s return to the White House sharpened the <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-trump-effect-short-lived\" title=\"null\">knife-edge</a> on which crypto balances. His administration has signaled that crypto will be treated as a tool and a target: embraced when politically convenient, but crushed when it threatens entrenched interests.</p><p>That dynamic makes crypto’s cult of leadership uniquely dangerous. Centralized control offers centralized targets. A subpoena, a scandal, or a well-aimed speech is all it takes to unravel legitimacy when a project lives and dies by a single personality.</p><p>Decentralized governance makes that centralized political playbook far more challenging to run. </p><p>You cannot subpoena an entire community like you can drag a handful of figureheads before Congress. True DAOs can still face scrutiny, but their distributed responsibility and global nature give them resilience that personality cults can never match. They provide continuity and stability in an industry that has been relentlessly exploited for its volatility.</p><h2>The choice we need to make</h2><p>This is the inflection point. Either the industry embraces decentralization in substance, not just rhetoric, or it will be reabsorbed into the traditional finance bubble and remembered only as an anarchistic blip in human history.</p><p>Crypto cannot have it both ways. It cannot continue to orbit cult leaders and simultaneously claim to challenge Wall Street, the International Monetary Fund or Big Tech. Outsized personalities may attract headlines, but they also invite fragility.</p><p>It’s make-or-break time. The ruling classes know this. They have decades of experience in crushing movements that rely on charismatic leaders. And they are watching closely.</p><p>Satoshi’s vision survives only if the many finally choose to overthrow the few. It is time to kill the cult of leadership, and quickly.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Houston Morgan, head of growth and business development at ShapeShift.</strong></em></p><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\" type=\"\">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Keep an eye out for Arena Mina, the local lighthouse cat, guest relations manager, and rodent control specialist.</p>\n<p>In addition to the beautiful and well maintained grounds, Point Arena offers modern accommodations in the former light house keeper’s buildings. The gift shop and museum offer visitors a chance to view the massive <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_lens\">Fresnel lens</a> up close.</p>\n<p>Despite the removal of its large crystalline lens, the lighthouse is still in operation, using a powerful external LED array to blast a unique light pattern to passing ships. An additional $5 allows visitors entry to the tower, joining tour groups that climb to the top every 20 minutes or so.</p>\n<p>Before committing to the climb, know that there is no elevator and the staircase spirals around the internal walls of the 115-foot tall lighthouse, the tallest on the West Coast. (The lighthouse at <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pigeon-point-lighthouse\">Pigeon Point </a>in Pescadero, California, is the same height.)</p>\n<p>Views from the top of the lighthouse are well worth it, offering a stunning 360-degree panorama of the coastal surroundings: everything from Devil’s Punchbowl (a sinkhole which could eventually swallow the lighthouse in the distant future) to Arena Rock, a massive natural stone platform the size of a football field, lurking ominously just 10 to 15 feet below the coastal waters. Ocean breakers can be easily seen crashing over the shallow platform, which devoid of other markers of scale are often mistaken by visitors for a cresting whale off the coast, although it is much much larger than that.</p>\n<p>The ivory tower also sits only 4 miles from the San Andreas fault, which is why this current lighthouse is not the original structure. The original tower was irreparably damaged during the 1906 earthquake. The original brick tower was demolished and replaced with a more earthquake-resistant design. The company that built the current tower built factory smokestacks. Hence this design featured steel reinforcement rods encased in concrete. This made it the first lighthouse in the U. S. to use this type of construction method.</p>\n<p>Tour guides take shifts occupying the glass housing at the top. Freed of its massive lens, the glass housing is roomy and open with stunning views protected on all sides by floor to ceiling glass. Guides stationed at the top regale visitors with the history of the site and point out unique sights. Bring a couple dollars in cash for the tip jar.</p>\n<p>While visiting the top, visitors are afforded the special opportunity to walk outside on the balcony, just below the glass casing. Those with vertigo or a fear of heights may want to skip this privilege, as the winds can be so strong you may feel you will blow right off the tower. Hold onto your hats and sunglasses as well.</p>\n<p>The grounds are a beautiful place to walk and admire several artistic installations, as well as a gazebo that overlooks the coastline. Bring a sandwich and enjoy a coastal picnic at one of the tables overlooking the sea.</p>\n\n\n                \n            </div>\n\n              </div>",

How are you doing?</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Allegra Rosenberg:</strong> I’m good, Dylan. How are you?</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Dylan: </strong>I am good. So, I’m going to ask you some questions and have you help paint a picture of this particular place we’re visiting today. I’m a tourist in New York City in the 1800s. So, you know, like, top hat, dressed fancy. I don’t know. And I’m there to visit a very specific graveyard called Trinity Churchyard in Lower Manhattan. It’s a really famous place already back then. It has a bunch of very famous people buried there. It’s got Alexander Hamilton. But actually, I look and I see that all these people are gathered around this one specific grave. What is going on over there? What is this scene that I’m looking at?</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Allegra: </strong>Well, there is a grave that’s the only one in the churchyard that’s marked out with flowers. And that’s so people can easily find it because the caretakers are sick of people coming up to ask where this specific grave is. The people that are coming up to this grave, they’re men, they’re women, maybe even newly married couples hand in hand. And they’re leaving more flowers. They’re leaving cards. They’re even crying at this grave.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Dylan: </strong>So obviously, this is someone in this big deal grave site. Whose grave is this?</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Allegra: </strong>Well, so here’s the thing. The gravestone says Charlotte Temple. But Charlotte Temple is a fictional character. She never existed. And there’s nobody actually buried in the grave.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\">I’m Dylan Thuras, and this is <em>Atlas Obscura</em>, a celebration of the world’s strange, incredible, and wondrous places. Today, we visit a strange gravestone inside a very famous cemetery. And we learn what this particular gravestone with no one under it, and in fact, a name of a person who never even existed, says about fandom, about pop culture, and about the strange nature of human beings.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><em>This is an edited transcript of the </em><a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/podcast\"><em>Atlas Obscura Podcast</em></a><em>: a celebration of the world’s strange, incredible, and wondrous places.

But you’re looking deep into the roots of fandom. You’re going like way, this is way before Taylor Swift. This is kind of into the old-timey fandom world. So what are some examples of early origins of fandom culture?</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Allegra:</strong> Well, yeah, that’s the thing. It goes back further than most people think. Lord Byron had a fleet of obsessed fangirls writing him letters. Charles Dickens, he had people lining up for hours to watch his readings. There was public outcry when Arthur Conan Doyle killed off Sherlock Holmes. It’s a whole thing.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Dylan: </strong>Yeah, it’s interesting because in all of these, you see things that feel really modern, right? Even the beat, like getting angry at an author for betraying the world that they’ve built, which is, you know, is a strange thing, but it also has really deep roots. So how did you get into this? How did you develop this interest in fandom?</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Allegra: </strong>Well, I have always been a fangirl, and I’ve always been a nerd. So when I get into something new, you know, that has a long history, like <em>Doctor Who</em> or the Beatles, I’m so interested in going back and looking at who were sort of the first fans that liked this thing, and in what ways were they like me, and in what ways weren’t they like me? And that has continued as I’ve gotten deeper and deeper into history, just led me down more and more interesting paths where I keep finding all of these incredibly fascinating fandoms from earlier and earlier in history that just keep resonating so deeply with my own experiences as a fan. So my research is all about bringing those stories to light, and Charlotte Temple’s grave is such a fantastic example because it seems like something right out of modern day fandom.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Dylan:</strong> Let’s return to the Trinity Churchyard and this strange gravestone. Tell us, why are all these people here to celebrate this fictional woman? Who was the mysterious Charlotte Temple?</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Allegra:</strong> Charlotte Temple, she was the title character in a 1971 novel by Susanna Rowson called <em>Charlotte, A Tale of Truth</em>. It was also published under the name <em>Charlotte Temple</em> in some places.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Dylan: </strong>You know, unfortunately, this is one fandom that fell off over time because I am completely unfamiliar with this story. What’s the kind of basic overview of the plot?</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Allegra:</strong> Yeah, I mean, I had never heard of it either. But basically, the story is that Charlotte is this naive teenage British girl who gets seduced by the villainous rake, Lord Montraville. And he takes her to America and then abandons her when he goes off to marry another woman, because he hadn’t married Charlotte. He marries another woman and then goes off to fight in the Revolutionary War. And so after being abandoned, she dies penniless in wintry New York City after giving birth to an illegitimate child. And the book ends with her father arriving too late to save her from her fate.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

He then set out to construct a house to rival the one he so clearly coveted.</p>\n<p>On the footprint of a 17th-century building by Sir Gervase Cutler, he created a large residence to compete with that of his distant relative, Thomas Watson, whom he considered had usurped his birthright.</p>\n<p>This house now forms the basis of Northern College, an educational institution focused on courses with a social purpose and close links to the trade union movement. </p>\n<p>Between 1727 and 1731, Wentworth added a magnificent folly in the form of a castle ruin to the gardens of his new house, so he could justify adopting the name Wentworth Castle for the estate and one-up his social rival. Despite his efforts, renovations at Wentworth Woodhouse ensured that Wentworth Castle was always second best. The folly itself became known as Stainborough Castle.</p>\n<p>Today, the gardens are owned and operated by the National Trust, and visitors can explore the folly, which looks remarkably like the ruins of a medieval castle. Once inside, however, everything seems a little smaller than it should be. Yet it is not so small that it could not have been a genuine defensive structure, creating a rather disconcerting effect.</p>\n<p>The \"castle\" is an enchanting space, surrounded by magnificent gardens and parkland worth visiting in their own right. In one of the large conservatories is a lead statue of an enslaved African man, installed to mark  Wentworth's role in maintaining Britain's slave-trading interests in the Treaty of Utrecht. In recent years, the statue has become controversial, and the accompanying information now recognizes the dark side of the wealth that created the estate we see today.</p>\n\n\n                \n            </div>\n\n              </div>",

That attack led to malware being inserted into at least two-dozen NPM code packages, but the outbreak was quickly contained and was narrowly focused on siphoning cryptocurrency payments.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shai-hulud-packages.png\"/>\n    <p>Image: aikido.dev</p>\n    <p>In late August, another compromise of an NPM developer resulted in malware being added to “<strong>nx</strong>,” an open-source code development toolkit with as many as six million weekly downloads. In the nx compromise, the attackers introduced code that scoured the user’s device for authentication tokens from programmer destinations like GitHub and NPM, as well as SSH and API keys. But instead of sending those stolen credentials to a central server controlled by the attackers, the malicious nx code created a new public repository in the victim’s GitHub account, and published the stolen data there for all the world to see and download.</p>\n    <p>Last month’s attack on nx did not self-propagate like a worm, but this Shai-Hulud malware does and bundles reconnaissance tools to assist in its spread. Namely, it uses the open-source tool <a href=\"https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog\">TruffleHog</a> to search for exposed credentials and access tokens on the developer’s machine. It then attempts to create new GitHub actions and publish any stolen secrets.</p>\n    <p>“Once the first person got compromised, there was no stopping it,” Aikido’s Eriksen told KrebsOnSecurity. He said the first NPM package compromised by this worm appears to have been altered on Sept. 14, around 17:58 UTC.</p>\n    <p>The security-focused code development platform <strong>socket.dev</strong> <a href=\"https://socket.dev/blog/ongoing-supply-chain-attack-targets-crowdstrike-npm-packages\">reports</a> the Shai-Halud attack briefly compromised at least 25 NPM code packages managed by CrowdStrike. Socket.dev said the affected packages were quickly removed by the NPM registry.</p>\n    <p>In a written statement shared with KrebsOnSecurity, CrowdStrike said that after detecting several malicious packages in the public NPM registry, the company swiftly removed them and rotated its keys in public registries.</p>\n    <p>“These packages are not used in the Falcon sensor, the platform is not impacted and customers remain protected,” the statement reads, referring to the company’s widely-used endpoint threat detection service. “We are working with NPM and conducting a thorough investigation.”</p>\n    <p>A <a href=\"https://www.stepsecurity.io/blog/ctrl-tinycolor-and-40-npm-packages-compromised\">writeup on the attack</a> from <strong>StepSecurity</strong> found that for cloud-specific operations, the malware enumerates AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform secrets. It also found the entire attack design assumes the victim is working in a Linux or macOS environment, and that it deliberately skips Windows systems.</p>\n    <p>StepSecurity said Shai-Hulud spreads by using stolen NPM authentication tokens, adding its code to the top 20 packages in the victim’s account.</p>\n    <p>“This creates a cascading effect where an infected package leads to compromised maintainer credentials, which in turn infects all other packages maintained by that user,” StepSecurity’s <strong>Ashish Kurmi</strong> wrote.</p>\n    <p>Eriksen said Shai-Hulud is still propagating, although its spread seems to have waned in recent hours.</p>\n    <p>“I still see package versions popping up once in a while, but no new packages have been compromised in the last ~6 hours,” Eriksen said. “But that could change now as the east coast starts working. I would think of this attack as a ‘living’ thing almost, like a virus. Because it can lay dormant for a while, and if just one person is suddenly infected by accident, they could restart the spread. Especially if there’s a super-spreader attack.”</p>\n    <p>For now, it appears that the web address the attackers were using to exfiltrate collected data was disabled due to rate limits, Eriksen said.</p>\n    <p><strong>Nicholas Weaver</strong> is a researcher with the <strong>International Computer Science Institute</strong>, a nonprofit in Berkeley, Calif. Weaver called the Shai-Hulud worm “a supply chain attack that conducts a supply chain attack.” Weaver said NPM (and all other similar package repositories) need to immediately switch to a publication model that requires explicit human consent for every publication request using a phish-proof 2FA method.</p>\n    <p>“Anything less means attacks like this are going to continue and become far more common, but switching to a 2FA method would effectively throttle these attacks before they can spread,” Weaver said. “Allowing purely automated processes to update the published packages is now a proven recipe for disaster.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

This preoccupation with food can hinder healthy lifestyle implementation and lead to overeating, making weight loss difficult<i>.</i></p>\n    <p>Previous research has found that 57% of people who have living with overweight or obesity have experienced food noise, although few are familiar with the term. Many of those affected said that food noise made it more difficult to make healthy food choices or stick to an exercise plan.</p>\n    <p>Some people also report that food noise affects their quality of life and their well-being.</p>\n    <p>Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists such as semaglutide (brand names Wegovy and Ozempic) are highly effective at helping people who are living with obesity lose weight. By mimicking the action of a hormone called GLP-1, they reduce appetite and feelings of hunger, slow the release of food from the stomach and increase feelings of fullness after eating.</p>\n    <p>However, little is known about how semaglutide, which was developed by Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk A/S, affects food noise.</p>\n    <p>To find out more, researchers from Novo Nordisk and Market Track LLC, a market research company, conducted a survey of 550 people in the US (average age 53 years, 86% female) who were taking semaglutide for weight loss.</p>\n    <p>Some 81% (447) of the participants said they had been taking semaglutide for at least four months and 86% of the participants reported weighing at least 92kg (14st 7lb) before starting treatment.</p>\n    <p>The participants were asked how food noise was currently affecting them and to recall how it had affected them before starting treatment.</p>\n    <p>Analysis of the results showed that the participants were experiencing less food noise than before.</p>\n    <p>The proportion of participants experiencing constant thoughts about food throughout the day fell almost four-fold from 62% before starting treatment to 16%. The proportion who said they spent too much time thinking about food fell by a similar amount, from 63% to 15%.</p>\n    <p>The proportion who said they had uncontrollable thoughts about food fell more than three-fold from 53% to 15%; the proportion who said their thoughts about food had negative effects on them or their life fell from 60% to 20%; and the proportion who said their thoughts about food distracted them from completing everyday activities fell from 47% to 15%.</p>\n    <p>The survey also contained questions that covered several areas of mental well-being.</p>\n    <p>Here, 352 (64%), 417 (76%) and 438 (80%) of the respondents reported an improvement in mental health, self-confidence and the development of healthier habits, respectively.</p>\n    <p>It is not known if these improvements were related to the drop in food noise or to the participants' weight loss.</p>\n    <p>The study's authors conclude that semaglutide may reduce the amount of food noise that is experienced by individuals who are living with obesity.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Story Source:</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Materials provided by <strong>European Association for the Study of Diabetes</strong>. <i>Note: Content may be edited for style and length.</i></p>\n    <p><strong>Journal Reference</strong>:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Ali Kapan, Othmar Moser, Richard Felsinger, Thomas Waldhoer, Sandra Haider. <strong>Real‐world insights into incretin‐based therapy: Associations between changes in taste perception and appetite regulation in individuals with obesity and overweight: A cross‐sectional study</strong>.<i>Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism</i>, 2025; 27 (9): 5008 DOI:<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/dom.16548\">10.1111/dom.16548</a></li>\n    </ul>\n    <p><strong>Cite This Page</strong>:</p>\n    <p><i>ScienceDaily</i>.

It has been associated with a lower risk of developing major diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and certain cancers.</p>\n    <p>There is substantial evidence showing that diet might play a role on human health by affecting the immune system and moderating inflammation. This depends on the composition of molecules in the diet, which include macronutrients, micronutrients and phytochemicals.

Treatment guidelines recommend that these young children and their families try six months of behavior therapy before starting ADHD medication.</p>\n<p>But pediatricians often prescribe medication immediately upon diagnosis, according to an analysis of medical records from nearly 10,000 young children with ADHD who received care in eight pediatric health networks in the United States.</p>\n<p>\"We found that many young children are being prescribed medications very soon after their diagnosis of ADHD is documented,\" said the study's lead author, Yair Bannett, MD, assistant professor of pediatrics. \"That's concerning, because we know starting ADHD treatment with a behavioral approach is beneficial; it has a big positive effect on the child as well as on the family.\"</p>\n<p>In addition, stimulant medications prescribed for the condition cause more side effects in young patients than they do in older children, Bannett said. Before age 6, children's bodies don't fully metabolize the drugs.</p>\n<p>\"We don't have concerns about the toxicity of the medications for 4- and 5-year-olds, but we do know that there is a high likelihood of treatment failure, because many families decide the side effects outweigh the benefits,\" he said. Stimulant medication can make young children more irritable, emotional and aggressive.</p>\n<p>ADHD is a developmental disorder characterized by hyperactivity, difficulty paying attention and impulsive behavior.</p>\n<p>\"It's important to catch it early because we know these kids are at higher risk for having academic problems and not completing school,\" Bannett said. Early identification and effective treatment for ADHD improve children's academic performance. Research has shown that good treatment also helps prepare individuals with ADHD for many aspects of adulthood, such as maintaining employment, having successful relationships and avoiding trouble with the law.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Complementary treatments</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Behavioral therapy and medication, the two mainstays of ADHD treatment, have different purposes.</p>\n<p>\"Behavioral treatment works on the child's surroundings: the parents' actions and the routine the child has,\" Bannett said. The therapy helps parents and kids build skills and establish habits compatible with how the child's brain works.</p>\n<p>The evidence-based behavioral treatment recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics is called parent training in behavior management. The training helps parents build strong, positive relationships with their children; offers guidance in rewarding a child's good behaviors and ignoring negative behaviors; and recommends tools that help kids with ADHD, such as making visual schedules to help them stay organized.</p>\n<p>In contrast, medication relieves ADHD symptoms such as hyperactivity and inattentiveness, with effects that wear off as the body breaks down each dose of the drug.</p>\n<p>Both approaches are needed for most kids with ADHD to do well. But previous studies of preschoolers diagnosed at age 4 or 5 show that it's best to start with six months of behavioral treatment before prescribing any medication.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Rapid prescriptions</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The researchers analyzed data from electronic health records for children seen at primary care practices affiliated with eight U.S. academic medical centers. They began with 712,478 records from children who were 3, 4 or 5 years old and were seen by their primary care physician at least twice, over a period of at least six months, between 2016 and 2023.</p>\n<p>From these records, the scientists identified 9,708 children who received an ADHD diagnosis, representing 1.4% of the children in the initial sample. They found that 42.2% of these children -- more than 4,000 kids -- were prescribed medication within a month of their ADHD diagnosis. Only 14.1% of children with ADHD first received medication more than six months after diagnosis. The researchers did not have access to data on referrals to behavioral therapy, but since young children are supposed to try the therapy alone for six months before receiving medication, any who were prescribed medication sooner were likely not being treated according to academy guidelines. A smaller study of recommendations for behavior therapy, published in 2021, found only 11% of families got the therapy in line with guidelines.</p>\n<p>Children who were initially given a formal diagnosis of ADHD were more likely to get medication within the first 30 days than those whose medical charts initially noted some ADHD symptoms, with a diagnosis at a later time. But even among preschoolers who did not initially meet full criteria for the condition, 22.9% received medication within 30 days.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Barriers to behavioral treatment?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Because the study was based on an analysis of electronic medical records, the researchers could not ask why physicians made the treatment decisions they did. However, Bannett's team had informal conversations with physicians, outside the scope of the study, in which they asked why they prescribed medication.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>All products featured on Allure are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n    <p>If you’ve ever battled <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/gallery/the-best-treatments-for-every-kind-of-acne\">acne</a>, you know the struggle: endless derm appointments, meds that come and go, and <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/story/best-undereye-concealer\">concealers</a> that either cake or highlight every bump—it’s exhausting. I still get the occasional breakout, but one $9 upgrade has drastically improved my bumpy-textured skin: the PanOxyl Acne Treatment Bar, which also happens to be a <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/best-of-beauty-2025-winners\">2025  Allure Best of Beauty winner</a>.</p>\n    <p>We love <a href=\"https://allure.com/25-under-25\">drugstore products</a> as much as the next person, but how exactly is something so affordable so…effective? Well, <a href=\"https://www.austinskinphysicians.com/dr-kristina-collins-md\">Kristina Collins, MD</a>, a dermatologist based in Austin, broke it down for me. Packed with the maximum over-the-counter dose of <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/story/benzoyl-peroxide-acne-treatment\">benzoyl peroxide</a> (10%), an acne-fighting powerhouse that kills bacteria, unclogs pores, and reduces inflammation, this sudsy face and body bar is “highly effective for both inflammatory acne (red pimples) and comedonal acne (blackheads and whiteheads),” says Dr. Collins. Aside from benzoyl peroxide, <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/gallery/best-glycerin-skin-care-products\">glycerin</a> softens and plumps the skin by attracting moisture. \"[Glycerin] also contains cleansing and lathering agents that help distribute the active ingredient [benzoyl peroxide] evenly across the skin,” she says.</p>\n    <p>However, the crowning feature of this simple-but-mighty cleanser? The obvious! “What makes this product unique is that it comes in a <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/story/best-exfoliating-bar-soaps\">convenient bar format</a>, making it easy to use on both the face <i>and</i> larger body areas like the chest and back,” says Dr. Collins. In fact, the PanOxyl Acne Treatment Bar won <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/best-of-beauty-2025-winners/body\">Best Body Acne Bar</a> this year, proving it punches above most acne products that are only designated for the face. “It’s especially helpful for athletes or those who <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/story/benefits-of-sweating\">sweat frequently</a>, since sweat and friction can trigger breakouts,” Dr. Collins adds.</p>\n    <p>As far as my acne goes, it’s less about angry, red zits and more about texture—tiny bumps, clogged pores, the sneaky kind that makes skin look rough when light hits skin. My derm tells me the fix is equal parts bacteria-killing power players (looking at you, benzoyl peroxide) and exfoliants to keep dead skin from building up. The problem? Most formulas in this category leave my already-finicky combination skin—a.k.a., dry at baseline, but shiny by midday—feeling bone-dry, which means I end up piling on layers of moisturizer to compensate.</p>\n    <p>Here’s the kicker: PanOxyl is different. After just a few uses, I had that fresh, post-facial glow, while staying bouncy, thanks to the glycerin. However, if you have super dry skin, New York City board-certified dermatologist <a href=\"https://artofdermatology.com/\">Jessica Krant, MD</a> points out that high concentrations of benzoyl peroxide (anything above 5%) can be too stripping, so it’s best to ease in or try a lower strength if you’re sensitive.</p>\n    <p>As far as use goes, the brand suggests cleansing as usual <i>before</i> using the bar as a second cleanse to kill the acne-causing oils and bacteria and offer deeper exfoliation. Work it into your hands with water until it’s foamy, spread the lather across your face in circular motions, rinse, and pat dry. Start with once daily, and if your skin can handle it, gradually increase to two or three times per day.</p>\n    <p>I followed the instructions exactly, using the bar after my daily gel cleanser, <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/yFxFbCCLaBcYNG4hxYgdcpdsGa9stD7xfbtX41tAk1ySk1ftRnfuwSacEnbxKS1uJjUi66SoQGfZE5GwE789A44X4Ub8u89sh1VKQR3KXpzn6KQyqsRRyQPSeAwZUjtdXBg3gzbdJSh5zUugJqATyfjsyXPocUHtwpefVyJnmXz66atTT5VJNrPcLRC8NXbksTExcn5rRtqj6XEa2kyydJbWyxDJ8ojBzZbsAq4SX2xwSZJWvQWvoSXSfWeLN9CHLpkLFK3cLMWBDPzbHbWKAZ6WTF9me91yf6PMEB8aT4m4oESnK8ZViQSB4FqJXpjxT5cyFjyvMeFwHXMYKCaxz7sdKMRdfgMUgJsb9ZfnAjvVeyP3zi21td1MLtwUK2SrSMGJcmbccfDW26VNBqpSrhHqYuJjfjXZbv6FrjzEoFht37rL3bKd5XHdcYN8n5XYtcVgZ\">SkinCeuticals’ Simply Clean Cleanser</a>. I lathered it up and applied it everywhere, concentrating on my forehead and cheeks where I tend to get texture. After rinsing, I followed with my go-to hydrating and <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/gallery/get-brighter-skin-vitamin-c\">brightening serum</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/gallery/best-night-cream\">heavier moisturizer</a> to replenish any of the moisture loss from the benzoyl peroxide. I also tested it on my chest post-spin class (prime acne territory) and never experienced a breakout. Quick heads-up: The peroxide can bleach dark towels, so stick to light-colored ones unless you want an accidental tie-dye moment.</p>\n    <p>After a few weeks of using this bar, I’m honestly impressed. My skin looks so much smoother with less texture and has that just-left-a-facial glow that lasts all day. I don’t need it every night because it could be too drying, but I can see myself reaching for it three to four times a week to use on my face and body, especially after a full day of wearing makeup or a sweaty workout. It gives that extra-deep clean that dives into your pores and leaves skin feeling fresh.</p>\n    <p><i>Allure</i>'s Best of Beauty Awards?</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Discover more 2025 Best of Beauty Winners:</strong>\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><i>Allure</i>Best of Beauty 2025: Splurge Winners</li>\n      <li><i>Allure</i>Best of Beauty 2025: Steals Winners</li>\n      <li><i>Allure</i>Best of Beauty 2025: Breakthrough Winners</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Watch us test our 2025  Allure Best of Beauty Skin winners:</strong>\n    </p>\n    <h4>Firework content</h4>\n    <p>This content can also be viewed on the site it <a href=\"https://fw.tv/iframe/embed-feed?channel=allure&amp;playlist=5x6Ezx\">originates</a> from.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

But it’s biotin and hyaluronic acid that get to the root of the situation, strengthening and hydrating hair so it’s healthier, more resilient—and fuller—overall.</p>\n<p><strong>Tester feedback from deputy beauty director  Elizabeth Siegel</strong></p>\n<p>“This shampoo and conditioner do everything I want—making my fine, limp hair look deceptively fuller, shinier, and softer—without anything I don't want, like a strong perfume-y scent.” <strong>—Elizabeth Siegel, deputy beauty director</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Herbal Essences Honey Daily Moisture Shampoo &amp; Conditioner</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Why It Won:</strong> You can make excuses for your parched hair—your age, your parents, your proclivity for your flatiron—or you can take action by adding <strong>Herbal Essences Honey Daily Moisture Shampoo &amp; Conditioner</strong> to your shower. The camellia oil in the nourishing duo closely mimics the natural oils found on healthy hair and helps replenish it every time you decide to take your “everything shower.”</p>\n<p><strong>Tester feedback from senior beauty editor  Jesa Marie Calaor</strong></p>\n<p>“This shampoo and conditioner smell so fresh and sweet—but not cloying—and leave my hair less frizzy and so much softer.” <strong>—Jesa Marie Calaor, senior beauty editor</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Kérastase Première Bain Décalcifiant Réparateur and Première Fondant Fluidité Réparateur</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Why It Won:</strong> Calcium might be good for your bones, but not for your hair when it’s coming out of your showerhead. Too much can form a film around the cuticle, which can actually prevent reparative ingredients from doing their job. <strong>Kérastase Première Bain Décalcifiant Réparateur and Première Fondant Fluidité Réparateur</strong> tackle the issue with citric acid to remove the calcium buildup from hard water, and then hand it off to glycine, a humectant that works overtime to soften the hair and make it stronger and more elastic.</p>\n<p><strong>Tester feedback from contributing writer  Sophia Panych</strong></p>\n<p>“I know this sounds crazy—and maybe I imagined it—but you can feel this shampoo and conditioner working as you’re in the shower. Your hair starts to feel silkier and less flimsy as you slide your comb through it, which I do in the shower as I rinse out conditioner. But it’s really how your hair looks after a couple of weeks of using this duo where you notice a visible change. My frayed ends started to look polished, and the broken bits along my hairline stopped being so fuzzy after blow-drying them.” <strong>— Sophia Panych, contributing writer</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Biolage Professional Hair Spa Color Last Shampoo &amp; Conditioner</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Why It Won:</strong> The <strong>Biolage Professional Hair Spa Color Last Shampoo &amp; Conditioner</strong> rely on soybean oil and stearic acid to keep highlights sparkly, brunettes glossy, and reds fiery for weeks, making it a bit more feasible to stretch out the time between your salon appointments. And with the brand’s signature clean-floral scent, every shower will transport you back to being in your colorist’s chair.</p>\n<p><strong>Tester feedback from senior director of audience development  Lexi Herrick</strong></p>\n<p>“This Biolage shampoo-and-conditioner combo has become one of my absolute staples. Its quality is unmatched, and every moment of applying this product screams salon luxury. It provides a thorough clean and deep-conditioning, smells amazing, and brightens my blonde almost instantly. As someone who has been actively trying to delay my highlights appointments, I can visibly see this product extending the life of my color over time.” <strong>—Lexi Herrick, senior director of audience development.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Pattern Hydration Shampoo</strong></p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

He would later study fine arts in Europe, traveling throughout France and Italy, dividing his time between Paris and Florence. A talented illustrator since high school, Robert edford stayed in the French capital for more than a year in his early 20s producing and selling sketches. These drawings, including female nudes and charcoal portraits, were shown in 2011 as part of the Arternativelight exhibition in Monaco, revealing Redford’s love of the visual arts. It was his second wife, Sibylle Szaggars, who convinced the actor to share them with the general public. “We have about a hundred drawings at our home in California,” she explained to the Monaco newspaper <a href=\"https://monaco-hebdo.com/culture/quand-robert-redford-expose/\">Monaco Hebdo</a> in 2011. “But my husband never wanted to show this work which he did when he was younger, starting in 1957 and continuing into the 1960s. I managed to convince him to show them two years ago when this project was launched.”</p>\n    <p>Redford’s first on-screen triumph was in the Western <i>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</i> (1970), directed by George Roy Hill. He starred alongside actor <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/paul-newman-and-joanne-woodward-at-home\">Paul Newman</a>. Sydney Pollack offered him some of his most legendary big-screen roles in <i>The Way We Were</i> (1973), <i>Three Days of the Condor</i> (1975), and <i>Out of Africa</i> (1986). The actor directed his first film in 1980, <i>Ordinary People</i>, which won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. His fifth film, <i>The Horse Whisperer,</i> which he produced, directed, and starred in, was another resounding success. In 2019, the French film industry celebrated his entire career with an Honorary César Award.</p>\n    <p>Redford is also famous for the compound he has been building in Utah, a lifelong project inspired by the ecological principles that have long been important to him. Using natural energy sources and respecting the environment, the actor has been continually expanding his estate over the years. “I want to buy a canyon,” <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/robert-redford-sundance-utah-house\">Redford told his lawyer</a> when he started the project.</p>\n    <p>Notably, in <a href=\"https://archive.architecturaldigest.com/issue/19890401\">April 1989</a>, we published Redford’s colossal property, which is home to a ski resort, wilderness areas, and the Sundance Institute, a creative center dedicated to young independent filmmakers; accordingly, he is also a founder of the Sundance Film Festival, which is now a household name. During the home tour, Redford told <i>AD</i> that he has always had “a visceral sense of place”—“I know instinctively where I feel at home and where I don’t, but I can’t say why.” Sundance currently has 98 hotel rooms at the foot of Mount Timpanogos, and boasts largely Western-inspired decor.</p>\n    <p>Look back on more images of the iconic actor below.</p>\n    <p><i>This photo essay on Robert Redford was originally published by</i> AD France.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>Robert Redford, the actor, Oscar-winning director, and environmentalist who forever changed the independent filmmaking scene with his Sundance Film Festival, has died at the age of 89. The <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/robert-redford-lists-cozy-bay-area-cottage\">Hollywood icon</a>, who was born on August 18, 1936, died in his home on Tuesday morning, “at Sundance in the mountains of Utah—the place he loved, surrounded by those he loved,” his publicist <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c07p8yle7pet\">said in a statement</a>.</p>\n<p>Born Charles Robert Redford Jr., the actor appeared in over 50 films, beginning with a small role in 1960’s <i>Tall Story</i>—a film adaptation of the play that had served as his Broadway debut the year before. The romantic comedy starred Jane Fonda, also in her film debut. Fonda and Redford would go on to appear in four more movies together throughout their careers. “It hit me hard this morning when I read that Bob was gone,” Fonda wrote in a statement. “He meant a lot to me and was a beautiful person in every way. He stood for an America we have to keep fighting for.”</p>\n<p>Redford resided in Utah. In 1958, he married Utah native Lola Van Wagenen. The pair welcomed four children before divorcing in 1985, the same year he starred alongside Meryl Streep in Out of Africa. The actor remarried German artist Sibylle Szaggars in 2009. He is survived by Szaggars, his daughters Shauna Schlosser Redford and Amy Redford, and seven grandchildren.</p>\n<p>The California native’s breakthrough film role came in 1969, when he was cast alongside <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/paul-newman-and-joanne-woodward-at-home\">Paul Newman</a> in <i>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</i>—though Redford’s good looks almost cost him the role. “He’s just another Hollywood blond. Throw a stick out of a window in Malibu, you’ll hit six like him,” a studio executive <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckke5522r23o\">reportedly</a> said. But Newman insisted that Redford be cast as the Kid to his Butch, forming the foundation of a friendship that continued until Newman’s death in 2008. “We’d play tricks on each other,” Redford said of their dynamic. “The more sophisticated the joke, the better.” The pair appeared onscreen together again in <i>The Sting</i> in 1973, for which Redford received the only Oscar nomination of his acting career; he would later win an Oscar as a first-time director in 1980 for <i>Ordinary People,</i> as well as an honorary Oscar in 2002.</p>\n<p>Starting in 1961, Redford began assembling the land that would become the Sundance Mountain Resort, where the Sundance Institute was formed in 1981 and the organization’s Sundance Film Festival—which bolstered the careers of Steven Soderbergh, Quentin Tarantino, Darren Aronofsky, Ryan Coogler, and Ava DuVernay—was born. As he stacked his résumé with roles, Redford continued to expand his property. By the time he <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/12/11/exclusive-robert-redford/\">sold the resort</a> in 2020, it spanned 2,800 sprawling acres.</p>\n<p>The <i>A River Runs Through It</i> director was known as an avid advocate for the environment and served as a trustee of the National Resources Defense Council nonprofit for 30 years. In the 1970s, he was elected commissioner of the Provo Canyon sewer district in his beloved Utah. But according to <i> The New York Times,</i> the bureaucracy involved with that experience caused the actor to become disillusioned with politics; switching gears, he opted to use independent activism and filmmaking to effect change. Among those efforts is the Redford Center, a nonprofit focused on producing environmental films. “I was born with a hard eye,” he told </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/robert-redford-at-77-more-671029/\">The Hollywood Reporter</a>in 2014. “The way I saw things, I would see what was wrong. I could see what could be better. I developed kind of a dark view of life, looking at my own country. When I was a kid, I was told to be a good sport. It wasn’t whether you won or lost; it was how you played the game. I realized that was a lie.” In 2016, Redford was</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c07p8yle7pet\">awarded</a>the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his “lifelong advocacy on behalf of preserving our environment” and “his pioneering support for independent filmmakers across America.”</p>\n<p>In 1989, the <i>All the President’s Men</i> star invited <i>Architectural Digest</i> to his cherished Utah residence, which was built with an emphasis on the surrounding natural landscape. Below, we revisit <i>AD</i>’s tour of the legend’s forever home in Sundance, where he lived and died. — <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/contributor/kathryn-schultz\">Katie Schultz</a></p>\n<p>\n      <i>This article originally appeared in the April 1989 issue of Architectural Digest.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>In 1900 the “historic” period in Native American art—the period of the great 19th-century blanket weavers, headers, and potters—unofficially came to a close. In 1900, also, the federal government sold a canyon—a glacial bowl at the foot of Mount Timpanogos, Utah—to a Mormon family named Stewart. The Stewarts purchased 3,500 acres at two and a half dollars per acre, pastured some sheep there and eventually built a small ski station with one lift and a Samoan-style restaurant. Before Utah was settled, though, the canyon had been an Indian hunting and fishing ground.</p>\n<p>Robert Redford loved that “semi-wilderness” long before he owned any part of it. He had passed through the canyon on his way home to Los Angeles from Colorado, where he went to college, and he found himself going back to camp there. “I’ve always had a visceral sense of place,” he says. “I know instinctively where I feel at home and where I don’t, but I can’t say why. The affinity isn’t only too mysterious and personal, it’s also the sort of thing that risks sounding hokey.”</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>At a Glance:<br/>When success-driven leaders fall into the same digital addiction affecting an estimated 210 million people worldwide, the solution isn’t going cold turkey—it’s building better systems.</p>\n<p>The irony wasn’t lost on me. Here I was, CEO of eXp World Holdings and publisher of <i>SUCCESS®</i> magazine—a publication dedicated to helping ambitious people achieve their highest potential—and I couldn’t stop doomscrolling through my phone at 2 a.m.</p>\n<p>It started innocuously enough: a quick check of social media between meetings, a scroll through industry news during lunch. But over several days, I found myself diving deeper into rabbit holes of conspiracy theories, outrage content and the kind of clickbait that can hijack your brain’s reward system.</p>\n<p>The dopamine hits kept coming, but so did the anxiety. My sleep suffered, my focus fractured and I was in a constant state of agitation—all <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11594359/\">textbook social media addiction symptoms</a>.</p>\n<p>That’s when I knew I had a problem and, more importantly, that it wasn’t just personal. This was part of a global crisis: Among the billions of social media users online, some estimates have indicated that as many as 210 million are struggling with social media addiction. Dependence on social media can have far-reaching consequences, including increased isolation and loneliness; greater likelihood of anxiety, depression, and social anxiety disorder; sleep disruption; poor work performance; reduction in empathy; and decreased physical activity, which can negatively affect <a href=\"https://www.success.com/should-social-media-be-regulated-surgeon-general-warning-social-media/\">overall health and wellness</a>. And, when your health is at stake, taking a break from social media isn’t optional; it’s essential.</p>\n<p>For high-achievers, the trap cuts even deeper. Our drive for the next edge or insight is the very thing these platforms exploit. What feels like productivity <a href=\"https://www.success.com/prevent-screen-fatigue/\">leaves us drained and unfocused</a>. That’s why learning how to break social media addiction is so important—especially for leaders and entrepreneurs.</p>\n<h2>The silent pandemic: How addiction to social media hijacks elite performance</h2>\n<p>The numbers are staggering. <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S240584402500338X#bib7\">One study</a> reported that 56% of users reported feeling anxious without access to their social media profiles. But what makes this particularly dangerous for leaders and entrepreneurs is how it can masquerade as productivity.</p>\n<p>In 2024, the New York City Health Department released a <a href=\"https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/mh/social-media-mental-health-report-2024.pdf\">report</a> declaring social media “a threat to youth mental health.” The U.S. surgeon general has called for increased transparency and for companies to prioritize user well-being over revenue.</p>\n<p>Yet most business leaders I know treat their social media habits as a necessary evil rather than recognizing them as a genuine threat to their cognitive performance and decision-making capacity.</p>\n<p>As comedian Bill Maher put it in a quote that Cal Newport highlights in his book <i>Digital Minimalism</i>: “The tycoons of social media have to stop pretending that they’re friendly nerd gods building a better world and admit they’re just tobacco farmers in T-shirts selling an addictive product to children. Because, let’s face it, checking your ‘likes’ is the new smoking.”</p>\n<p>The comparison to tobacco isn’t hyperbole. According to research published in <a href=\"https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/cyber.2022.0117\"> Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking</a>, 24% of TikTok users and 28% of Instagram users studied qualify as “addicted” using clinical diagnostic criteria.</p>\n<h2>Why high-achievers are especially prone to digital addiction</h2>\n<p>Success-oriented individuals face the following unique vulnerabilities that make social media addiction more likely and more damaging.</p>\n<h3>1. Information addiction masquerading as research</h3>\n<p>We tell ourselves we’re staying informed, networking or researching our markets. But “an endless bombardment of news and gossip and images has rendered us manic information addicts,” Newport observes. “Incessant clicking and scrolling generates a background hum of anxiety.”</p>\n<h3>2. FOMO amplified by competitive nature</h3>\n<p>High-achievers are naturally competitive. Social media exploits this by creating artificial urgency around every update, every trend, every competitor’s move. “The urge to check Twitter or refresh Reddit becomes a nervous twitch that shatters uninterrupted time into shards too small to support the presence necessary for an intentional life,” Newport warns.</p>\n<h3>3. Validation seeking despite success</h3>\n<p>Even successful leaders crave external validation. “Tech companies encourage behavioral addiction through intermittent positive reinforcement and the drive for social approval,” creating what Newport calls “virtual slot machines” that keep us scrolling for the next hit of engagement.</p>\n<h3>4. Always-on mentality</h3>\n<p>James Clear, author of <i>Atomic Habits</i>, identifies mindless phone scrolling as “the greatest interruption” to productivity. For leaders who pride themselves on being always available and always learning, this creates a perfect storm of distraction disguised as diligence.</p>\n<h2>The recognition phase: Identifying your digital addiction patterns</h2>\n<p>My own wake-up call came when I recognized the physical and mental symptoms that mirrored other addictive behaviors I’d observed in myself and others over the years. Here are major signs to look for to help you conduct your own honest assessment.</p>\n<h3>Physical warning signs</h3>\n<ul>\n      <li>Checking your phone within minutes of waking up</li>\n      <li>Feeling phantom vibrations from your phone</li>\n      <li>Anxiety when your phone battery dies or you lose signal</li>\n      <li>Neck and shoulder pain from “tech neck”</li>\n      <li>Sleep disruption from late-night scrolling</li>\n    </ul>\n<h3>Cognitive warning signs</h3>\n<ul>\n      <li>Difficulty concentrating on single tasks for extended periods</li>\n      <li>Mental fatigue despite not doing mentally demanding work</li>\n      <li>Decreased attention span for books, articles or deep conversations</li>\n      <li>Racing thoughts or feeling mentally “wired” even when tired</li>\n    </ul>\n<h3>Emotional warning signs</h3>\n<ul>\n      <li>Irritability when interrupted while on your phone</li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://www.success.com/why-social-media-is-ruining-your-self-esteem-and-how-to-stop-it/\">Comparing yourself to others</a>based on social media posts</li>\n      <li>Mood swings correlated with social media engagement</li>\n      <li>Feeling empty or unsatisfied after spending time on social media</li>\n    </ul>\n<h3>Behavioral warning signs</h3>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

But for some climbers, any discussion of weight now feels taboo. One doctor explores this tension.</p>\n<p class=\"py-tight text-left font-utility text-utility3-size leading-utility3-line-height text-text-secondary\"> (Photo: Salomé Aubert)</p>\n<p class=\"mb-base-loose flex flex-wrap gap-(--spacing-base)\"><template id=\"B:0\"></template></p>\n<p class=\"pub-date font-utility-2 text-text-secondary\">Published September 16, 2025 11:14AM</p>\n<p>I’m in the gym on a Saturday morning. I’m having a frustrating session where gravity seems awfully high. Later over coffee, my training partner and I are debriefing the session. I say, “I’ve been thinking of losing a few pounds.” Immediately, I feel a sense of guilt for bringing up this topic. “Absolutely not,” they reply. “You’re great just as you are.”</p>\n<p id=\"publisher_div\"></p>\n<p>That’s what a friend is meant to say, right? Her default answer was rooted in body positivity, aimed at shoring up any insecurity or body dysmorphia I might have. Why, then, did it feel so dismissive?</p>\n<p>Around the same time, I joined an online climbing forum. One of the cited norms caught my attention: “No body talk.” No discussing other people’s bodies, or your own. On the surface, this might seem a progressive safeguard against triggering people with eating disorders. However, something about the rule made me uneasy. It gave me the sense that talking about bodies at all was inherently problematic, as though the subject itself were shameful.</p>\n<p>This made me think: What would be my preferred answer to my question following the gym session that morning?</p>\n<p>Here are some examples of responses that would have been more helpful for me.</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">“Interesting thought. How’d you think that might influence the power you’ve been trying to build?”</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">“I don’t think that’s needed from a health perspective, but I get that weight can be a relevant training factor.”</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Or even just, “Tell me more about that.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are not the right answers for everyone, but I argue that body-related talk is not inherently bad, and it can be sensitive, constructive, and relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I0-P0-CMI0\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<p>I spent February in Idaho, enjoying a month in the snow—winter hiking, and skiing of all kinds, but not climbing. A few weeks in, I noticed I was about five pounds lighter. Seeing the number on the scale and knowing I wasn’t actively climbing at the time, I became concerned about losing muscle. I talked to a friend about it, and we had a thoughtful, healthy conversation about my weight, body composition, and nutrition. We also came up with strategies that would allow me to return home to Boston feeling strong. They even recommended a new brand of protein shake, which is now my favorite. It was a reminder that talking about these things can be empowering. These types of conversations can focus on performance and well-being, rather than judgment.</p>\n<p>It’s important to be thoughtful about others’ histories with body image and remember that even a close friend might not have shared everything—but it’s also important to create a culture of listening and receptivity to ideas.</p>\n<p>As a physician, I’m trained to talk about sensitive subjects like weight carefully. I also know how often silence around the topic can backfire. Instead of letting body talk become taboo, the community should cultivate spaces for sensitive, consent-based conversations where health, performance, and personal choice can be discussed without shame.</p>\n<h2>A sport wracked by eating disorders</h2>\n<p>Climbing has problems with body image and disordered eating. A <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sports-and-active-living/articles/10.3389/fspor.2020.00086/full\">2020 survey study</a> involving an international sample of 498 adult sport climbers reported an overall 8.6% prevalence of disordered eating. Among female climbers, prevalence was 16.5%<b>,</b> and among elite female climbers, it surged to 42.9%.</p>\n<p>Recently, climbers have also shined a spotlight on these issues, making hard-won progress at fighting harmful attitudes. In 2020, Sasha DiGiulian bravely <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B9zSbidHLvA/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\">spoke out</a> about body shaming and bullying, which had real consequences for the perpetrator, including losing sponsors. Beth Rodden <a target=\"_self\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/beth-rodden-climbing-body-image/\">has courageously written</a> about how her long-term struggle with disordered eating undermined her well-being, despite short-term performance gains. And in 2024, after two doctors on the International Federation of Sport Climbing Medical Commission <a target=\"_self\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.climbing.com/news/ifsc-medical-commission-members-resign-over-inaction/\">resigned</a> and top athletes including Janja Garnbret <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CvNdC2TM3Mf/\">spoke out</a>, the IFSC became the first international sporting body to <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/news/new-competition-policy-places-ifsc-at-forefront-of-fight-against-reds\">introduce regulations addressing Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (REDs)</a>.</p>\n<p>These were important, overdue changes. However, social change can bring about unintended consequences, even when the overall impact is positive. For example, mandatory seatbelt laws in the 1960s successfully reduced the risk of death if an accident occurred; however, some studies observed that drivers, feeling safer, then began to take more risks (known as the “<a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/psychology/the-peltzman-effect?\">Peltzman Effect</a>”).</p>\n<p>Has an unintended consequence of body positivity within climbing become a reluctance to talk about our bodies at all, and a sense that doing so is shameful? Has intentional management of weight become taboo, even when approached in a healthy, evidence-based way?</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I1-P0-CMI0\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<p>We often use the phrase “losing weight” to refer specifically to reducing body fat while preserving or even increasing muscle mass. But this is more accurately called changing your body composition. It involves altering the relative proportions of different tissue types in your body.  Body composition can change even if your overall weight stays the same, or it can shift alongside changes in weight.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>Santiago Carrasquilla and Danaé Gosset travelled to Argentina with just a camera and captured something quite extraordinary in the life and work of sign painter Luis Benz.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the most profound stories emerge from the simplest encounters. In 2019, creatives <a href=\"https://www.madeatartcamp.com/\">Santiago Carrasquilla</a> and <a href=\"https://pencil.tv/\"> Danaé Gosset</a>—both former apprentices of design legends Stefan Sagmeister and Paula Scher—embarked on what seemed like a straightforward documentary project. </p>\n<p>Armed with a borrowed camera and fuelled by curiosity, they travelled to Argentina to film Luis Benz, a self-taught sign painter with five decades of experience working entirely by hand.</p>\n<p>What they captured over five days would sit dormant in hard drives for nearly eight years before emerging as Luis Benz: Happiness is Achieved With Very Simple Things.</p>\n<p>It's a deeply moving portrait that transcends its craft-focused premise to become something far more universal. If you can, I'd urge you to take five minutes out of your day and watch it below. You won't regret it.</p>\n<p>The partnership between Santiago and Danaé began both professionally and personally: they were romantically involved at the time and had just completed American singer-songwriter Mitski's music video for A Pearl, with Saad Moosajee and Art Camp. But rather than taking a break after their successful collaboration, they felt compelled to pursue another creative venture.</p>\n<p>\"We were both in this work-driven phase where we just wanted to keep making things,\" explains Danaé. \"So instead of resting, we jumped into another project.\"</p>\n<p>The idea for the Luis Benz film had been percolating in Santiago's mind for years. \"I met him years before,\" he recalls. \"And it was even in my ten-year plan when I graduated from the School of Visual Arts in New York, from Debbie Millman's class. I'd already bought a bunch of his signs for our house, and I told Danaé the idea. She pushed us to make it happen.\"</p>\n<p>And they didn't wait around. \"I remember we were literally in a taxi on the way to the airport, still figuring out the concept,\" recalls Danaé. \"By the time we landed, we had settled on the idea of asking Luis to paint 50 signs for himself.\"</p>\n<p>This concept proved to be a stroke of creative genius. Rather than documenting Luis's commercial work, the pair invited him to turn inward and select words that carried personal meaning.</p>\n<p>\"I thought it would be interesting to have him paint words he normally didn't get asked to paint,\" explains Santiago. \"Not 'ice cream' or 'soda', but something else. I was surprised by his choices. He pulled out an old dictionary and selected his favourite words, including some ancient Spanish words that are no longer in common use. On the back of each sign, he wrote the definitions.\"</p>\n<p>This inventive framework transformed what could have been a straightforward craft documentary into something far more intimate and engaging. \"It came from wanting to give him a chance to make something for himself,\" explains Danaé. \"His work was usually for fruit shops or boats. Shifting that context felt powerful, asking him to turn inward and pick the words that carried meaning for him.\"</p>\n<p>Despite the powerful material they captured, the film's journey to completion was anything but smooth. Personal projects, as any creative knows, can be the hardest to finish—and this one carried additional emotional weight.</p>\n<p>\"One of the hardest things to do is finish personal projects, especially big ones,\" admits Santiago. \"This felt big: five days of shooting, a lot of footage to work through. Editing was daunting. It took us a while to even open the footage. And then, life happened. Danaé and I broke up in the middle, which kept us less motivated to work on it.\"</p>\n<p>The editing process alone took a year and a half, requiring them to find the story within hours of footage. Danaé credits Santiago's persistence for seeing the project through: \"I honestly don't think I would've finished it if it were just me,\" she says. \"Santiago really took the project on, working with Fabián to find the story behind the footage. He shaped it into something very human, where the craft is secondary to Luis's life. That's what makes it powerful.\"</p>\n<p>The film's visual approach mirrors Luis's own philosophy about happiness and simplicity. Shot on a Canon C300 with quality lenses, the cinematography captures intimate, unposed moments that feel both timeless and immediate.</p>\n<p>\"Danaé and I both took turns shooting, finding shots together,\" recalls Santiago. \"Because we were there all day, we caught beautiful light and these natural unfoldings of his story. For colour, we worked with a great colourist in Paris named Hadrian. We spent time shaping the footage so it felt timeless, like a memory; inspired by analogue photography.\"</p>\n<p>But the real magic happened in their relationship-building with Luis. \"Every day for five days, we went to his house and just sat with him,\" says Santiago. \"We filmed him painting, smoking, playing music, working. He was always telling stories, always cracking jokes. Even though there was a language barrier for Danaé, it felt natural and homey.\"</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the project was Luis's immediate openness to these two young creatives from New York. This wasn't just a matter of professional courtesy; it was a genuine human connection.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The first time I witnessed an anamorphic display that truly worked was just over a year ago. Late at night, I was at a crossroads in Shinjuku, Tokyo, watching what appeared to be a giant cat leap straight out of a digital billboard, and seriously wondered if someone had slipped something into my Asahi. The effect was so convincing that several people instinctively stepped backwards.</p>\n    <p>That moment crystallised in my mind something profound about visual storytelling in the 2020s. The power lies not in the technology itself, but in how we use it to create genuine human connection. In that light, I was blown away by LA-based creative agency <a href=\"https://www.psbl.co/\">Possible</a>'s recent triumph: transforming the MTV Video Music Awards' iconic Moon Person from a static trophy into a living, breathing cultural icon. </p>\n    <p>What makes this achievement particularly remarkable is the technical challenge involved. Unlike the curved LED canvases that have become synonymous with spectacular anamorphic displays—think Times Square's dramatic installations of recent years—the VMA stage relied entirely on flat screens. This constraint forced Possible's team into uncharted creative territory: a true example of necessity being the mother of invention.</p>\n    <p>This wasn't achieved solely through expensive technology. It required six weeks of intensive experimentation, working closely with production designer Matt Steinbrenner and the team at <a href=\"https://www.visualnoisecreative.com/\">Visual Noise Creative</a>. The collaborative process involved constant iteration, testing perspective tricks and illusions until each animation felt genuinely three-dimensional.</p>\n    <p>The result was 11 distinct animations that showcase the Moon Person's personality across a spectrum of moods and scenarios. One moment, they were transforming into chrome as a direct nod to the physical VMA trophy; the next, they were clinging dramatically to the screen's edge or striking heroic poses.</p>\n    <p>But if there's one thing I've learned over the years, it's that true impact comes not just from special effects, but from understanding character. Possible's approach to the Moon Person demonstrates this perfectly. Rather than treating it as a corporate logo to be displayed, they've created a protagonist that feels like they have a genuine personality.</p>\n    <p>The interdimensional portal concept provides the narrative framework, but it was the smaller details that created emotional resonance. When beams of light swept from the Moon Person's helmet across the audience, or when they appeared to step directly into the arena space, something magical happened.</p>\n    <p>It's challenging for anyone working in this space to admit it, but these days, static is no longer enough. Young audiences, in particular, have become increasingly sophisticated. They've grown up with Instagram filters, TikTok effects, and immersive gaming experiences. Static displays, regardless of their size or cost, struggle to capture attention.</p>\n    <p>Possible's approach acknowledges this reality, but importantly, without sacrificing artistic integrity. The Moon Person's transformations at the VMAs felt organic, not gimmicky. When this character emerged from portals or shifted between ethereal and playful modes, it served the overall narrative, rather than merely showcasing technical capability.</p>\n    <p>This approach reflects the studio's broader philosophy. Over the past 15 years, they've built their reputation by working with artists like Childish Gambino, Ariana Grande, and Lady Gaga—musicians who understand that visual impact must serve storytelling. The same principles that make a concert memorable apply to award show design.</p>\n    <p>All that would be impressive enough, but that's not all. The timeline alone—six weeks from concept to execution—represents an enormous creative sprint. Remember, every animation had to be conceived, designed, tested, and refined during that period, all while coordinating with multiple stakeholders.</p>\n    <p>What was perhaps most impressive, though, was how Possible, in partnership with executive producers Jesse Ignjatovic and Barb Bialkowski, managed to honour the Moon Person's cultural legacy while pushing it into new territory. The icon has been central to the VMAs since 1984: a year most of the people in attendance weren't even born. Turning it into an active participant in the show, rather than a passive symbol, required a careful balance.</p>\n    <p>Overall, it's no exaggeration to say this project set a new standard for live event design. It's a great example of how creative studios can breathe new life into long-standing cultural icons, ensuring they remain relevant for new generations while respecting their enduring legacy.</p>\n    <p>Get the best of Creative Boom delivered to your inbox weekly</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The story of Thai illustrator Tanakan Bangnoi demonstrates how creative careers rarely run smoothly, but resilience and a positive outlook can help turn things around.</p>\n    <p>It's hard to imagine how many people have the potential to become a successful artist, yet never pursue it seriously, simply due to a lack of confidence. How many people, I wonder, spend their lives sketching in notebooks, doodling during meetings, imagining elaborate worlds, but convince themselves their work isn't \"good enough\" for public consumption?</p>\n    <p>The story of Thai illustrator Tanakan Bangnoi demonstrates what happens when someone breaks through that confidence barrier.</p>\n    <p>Known professionally as 'Think like a mustache', Tanakan is known for his distinctive work, transforming everyday moments into satirical fantasies. Yet his journey began in a place of crippling self-doubt.</p>\n    <p>\"I had no confidence in whether my drawings were good enough, and I never dared to show them to anyone,\" he recalls. Despite growing up in a creative family—both his grandfather and father were talented artists—and discovering his passion through English vocabulary book illustrations as a teenager, he nearly let that confidence gap win.</p>\n    <p>At university, Tanakan faced a creative crossroads. A Facebook page became his testing ground: a place where his illustrations of ordinary Thai life, infused with humour and satirical edge, could find an audience.</p>\n    <p>The response was encouraging enough that Tanakan made a permanent commitment: he tattooed the words 'Think like a mustache' on his arm as a reminder of creative courage. \"Sometimes, it's not your lack of skill that holds you back,\" he reasons, \"but yourself.\"</p>\n    <p>By 2019, his career was gaining traction. Weekly illustrations shared across Facebook art groups caught the attention of major Thai music labels, resulting in lyric video commissions and collaborations with renowned singers. His selection as one of 200 illustrators for the Thailand Illustration Fair in 2020 confirmed his ascending trajectory.</p>\n    <p>But then catastrophe struck… twice. First, COVID-19 cancelled projects across the industry. And then hackers destroyed his Facebook page, along with years of audience building. \"I felt like I lost everything I had built,\" he shudders. \"People who once followed my work just disappeared.\"</p>\n    <p>For over a month, depression took hold. Tanakan faced a choice between surrender and renewal. \"But thanks to my love for drawing and the good people around me, I managed to get through it and start again,\" he recalls. \"I decided to start fresh, launching a new page and updating my work regularly on Instagram.\"</p>\n    <p>The experience taught him that perfectionism is often the enemy of progress. \"Nothing in life is ever truly perfect,\" he says. \"The most important thing is just to be yourself.\"</p>\n    <p>Today, Tanakan resides near Cincinnati, Ohio, USA, where he creates illustrations that often celebrate the everyday. \"I believe there's always something fun, or a little funny, in day-to-day life,\" he says. \"The world is getting harder to live in, and people, including me, often pressure themselves about their future. But we shouldn't stress too much. Life always has its little jokes, mixed with a touch of fantasy.\"</p>\n    <p>\"My storytelling often touches on different problems or situations, but in a way that isn't too heavy-handed,\" he continues. \"I try not to make people feel overly stressed or anxious when experiencing my work. In Thailand, many unusual things happen all the time; sometimes so strange that people just laugh about them. Thai people often adapt by treating these situations lightly, so life doesn't feel too overwhelming.\"</p>\n    <p>Tanaka is also known for drawing on the treasure hunt principle. Like a filmmaker hiding Easter eggs, he deliberately plants small, playful details throughout his work; a technique that stems from his love of films and games. \"When people look closely at my illustrations and then come back to tell me, 'Oh, I saw that little thing you put in there!'—that moment makes me really happy,\" he smiles.</p>\n    <p>His inspiration comes from a range of sources, including H.R. Giger's biomechanical concepts, while the golden age of practical effects—Star Wars, Jurassic Park, and The Lord of the Rings—showed him how attention to detail creates compelling worlds. \"That was a time when people really paid attention to details—concept art, set design, costumes—all filled with charm,\" he enthuses.</p>\n    <p>It's been a long road, and for any artist facing their own setbacks, Tanakan offers hard-won wisdom. \"I believe that if you truly love something, you'll always find the time to do it; no excuses,\" he says. \"Even if only one or two people appreciate your work on a given day, that alone can make your day feel worthwhile.\"</p>\n    <p>Get the best of Creative Boom delivered to your inbox weekly</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<h2>John Phillips formed the Mamas &amp; the Papas in 1965 and wrote many of the band's greatest hits, but when the group broke up just three years later, his substance abuse overtook his life.</h2>\n<p>Trinity Mirror/Mirrorpix/Alamy Stock PhotoJohn Phillips of the Mamas &amp; the Papas outside of his Bel Air home in 1969.</p>\n<p>Throughout the latter half of the 20th century, John Phillips was considered one of the leading figures of the folk-rock movement. One of the four members of the Mamas &amp; the Papas, Phillips was responsible for some of the biggest hits of the 1960s, establishing a musical legacy that lasted a lifetime.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, that is not all John Phillips is remembered for today.</p>\n<p>Phillips led a turbulent life, one that was marred by substance abuse, relationship troubles, and a controversy that would haunt him long after his death: his relationship with his daughter Mackenzie.</p>\n<p>Although he may have written some of the most beloved folk harmonies of the ’60s, the mark Phillips left on the world is much, much darker.</p>\n<h2>John Phillips’ Early Life And Musical Beginnings</h2>\n<p>John Edmund Andrew Phillips was born on Aug. 30, 1935, in Parris Island, South Carolina. That very week, his namesake — Hurricane John — struck the southeastern United States. The wild storm would prove to be an apt metaphor for John Phillips’ life.</p>\n<p>Phillips’ father, Claude, was a U.S. Marine Corps officer who had “developed a passion for gambling, booze, women, and camaraderie among his Marine buddies,” as Phillips wrote in his 1986 autobiography, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/papajohnautobiog0000phil/page/31/mode/1up\"> Papa John</a>. “He would drink his whiskey and play cards and show off his soulful Irish tenor to blow off steam. His voice brought tears to people’s eyes.”</p>\n<p>Public DomainJohn Phillips in 1967, the year before the Mamas &amp; the Papas disbanded.</p>\n<p>Claude reportedly struggled with feelings of uselessness after the end of his military career, which resulted in frequent drunken fits and foul moods. Meanwhile, Phillips’ mother, Edna, ran a dress shop and spent time out of the house. “Every morning, she’d leave the bottle [of Four Roses] there for him, and he’d head down to the dark, dank cellar and just drink himself into a stupor every day for months at a clip,” Phillips recalled of his father. “It was like I didn’t really have a father much of the time.”</p>\n<p>The family eventually moved to Alexandria, Virginia, where John discovered some of his early musical influences, mostly traditional folk and doo-wop harmonies. After high school, he briefly attended Hampden-Sydney College and later enrolled at the U.S. Naval Academy, seemingly ready to follow in his father’s footsteps. In the end, though, this life didn’t hold his interest.</p>\n<p>“The truth was that the only thing that I had enjoyed about college anyway was playing guitar and singing for people,” Phillips reflected in his autobiography. “And I could do that anywhere.”</p>\n<p>So, John Phillips made his way to New York City to pursue a career in music.</p>\n<h2>The Rise And Fall Of The Mamas &amp; The Papas</h2>\n<p>In New York, Phillips formed a folk trio called The Journeymen with Scott McKenzie and Dick Weissman. They produced three albums together and achieved a moderate amount of success, but they split in 1964 due to interpersonal troubles and America’s changing taste in music. Phillips quickly moved on to his next project: the Mamas &amp; the Papas.</p>\n<p>The band formed in 1965 and was composed of Phillips, his wife Michelle, Canadian singer Denny Doherty, and vocalist <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/cass-elliot-death\">“Mama” Cass Elliot</a>. Right from the start, though, relationships within the group were messy. </p>\n<p>Public DomainThe Mamas &amp; the Papas only performed from 1965 to 1968, with a brief reunion in 1971.</p>\n<p>Phillips had only recently divorced his first wife, Susan, with whom he had a son named Jeffrey and a daughter named Mackenzie. They’d separated after Phillips met 17-year-old Michelle while on tour with The Journeymen and started an affair. John and Michelle Phillips wed on Dec. 31, 1962 — when John was 27 and Michelle was 18.</p>\n<p>However, there was also an undeniable chemistry between Michelle Phillips and Denny Doherty that created “two and a half years of total melodrama,” as Michelle explained to <i> Vanity Fair</i> in 2007. Michelle and Denny soon began an affair of their own. To make matters more complicated, Cass Elliot was “madly in love” with Denny Doherty, though the feelings were unrequited. And Phillips was understandably upset that his wife was sleeping with his friend and band mate behind his back. That wasn’t the only issue in their relationship, though. </p>\n<p>“I ended up in the hospital,” Michelle once recalled of a fight she and Phillips had. “That’s all I’ll say about it.”</p>\n<p>Even as the Mamas &amp; the Papas put out hits like “California Dreamin’,” “Monday, Monday,” and “Words of Love,” their behind-the-scenes drama and Phillips’ drug use continued to ramp up tensions within the group. Eventually, after just a few years of stardom, the band broke up in 1968.</p>\n<p>John Phillips had wanted total control, both in his relationship and in the band, and it tore them all apart. That was hardly the end of Phillips’ challenges, though.</p>\n<h2>John Phillips’ Controversial Relationship With His Daughter</h2>\n<p>Throughout his life, John Phillips was married four times and fathered multiple children. His first daughter, <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/mackenzie-phillips\">Mackenzie Phillips</a>, was an actress and singer in her own right, and she seemed to have everything going for her. </p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Experiences like this are the reality for many job seekers today. With competition this fierce, it’s important to create the best resume possible to be considered.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/how-long-do-employers-look-at-resumes\">Recruiters spend around six seconds</a> scanning a resume before deciding whether it’s worth a closer look. Landing your dream job often depends on how effectively you can stand out in that brief moment. That means clarity, strategy, and personalization are non-negotiables. </p>\n<p>This guide will help you build a resume that passes applicant tracking systems (ATS). Find everything from foundational formatting tips to advanced techniques for showcasing your <a href=\"https://www.success.com/hard-skills-vs-soft-skills/\">skills</a> and unique strengths.</p>\n<h2>Why It’s Hard to Get a Job Right Now</h2>\n<p>The job market is more competitive than ever. A mix of economic shifts, tech advancements, and changing employer expectations is making it harder for candidates to break through.</p>\n<p>Consider these stats:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>As of April 2025, the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf\">U.S. unemployment rate stood at 4.2%</a>, remaining within a narrow range of 4.0% to 4.2% since May 2024. This means there are fewer openings and more people chasing them.</li>\n      <li>Automation is picking up speed. <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/jobs-lost-jobs-gained-what-the-future-of-work-will-mean-for-jobs-skills-and-wages\">According to McKinsey</a>, anywhere from almost none to nearly a third of all hours worked worldwide could be automated by 2030, depending on the rate of adoption.</li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://www.amraandelma.com/top-linkedin-job-posting-statistics-2025/\">LinkedIn reports</a>that over 9,000 job applications are submitted on its platform every minute, totaling more than 12.9 million daily.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>These facts mean employers have more options and can afford to be extremely selective. In response, job seekers are trying all kinds of <a href=\"https://www.success.com/job-seekers-resort-song-and-dance-to-stand-out/\">creative tactics</a> to get noticed. These include video resumes, personal websites, and even full-on social media campaigns. In this type of job market, knowing how to make a good resume is more important than ever. </p>\n<h2>What Does a Good Resume Look Like?</h2>\n<p>A good resume strikes a balance between clarity, relevance, and strategy to present your qualifications in a way that’s easy to read. Hiring managers want to know who you are, what you’ve done, and why it matters, without having to dig for the details.</p>\n<p>Here’s what makes a resume stand out:</p>\n<h3>Clarity and Readability</h3>\n<p>About <a href=\"https://novoresume.com/career-blog/hr-survey\">42% of HR professionals</a> spend less than 10 seconds reviewing a resume, and nearly 65% say they form their first impression within 15 seconds. That means your resume has to be easy to skim at a glance. A clear, readable resume can go a long way to help you stand out.</p>\n<h3>Strong Structure</h3>\n<p>Start with your contact info and a short summary, followed by your experience, education, and skills. <a href=\"https://www.resumeble.com/career-advice/resume-trends\">Combining both your work history and skills</a> in a logical format is becoming more common. It helps highlight what you bring to the table from multiple angles.</p>\n<h3>Relevance Over General Info</h3>\n<p><strong>I</strong>nstead of listing duties, highlight results and show metrics. Your resume should include things like “Boosted customer retention by 30%” rather than “Handled client emails.” That shows you understand how your work impacts the bottom line.</p>\n<h3>Speak Their Language (Literally)</h3>\n<p>Use the same language you see in the job listing. This helps your resume pass through <a href=\"https://sopa.tulane.edu/blog/understanding-applicant-tracking-systems\">Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)</a>. ATS can filter out resumes before a recruiter even sees them if the right language isn’t used.</p>\n<h3>Professional Formatting</h3>\n<p>Avoid flashy fonts or design tricks, unless you’re in a design-heavy industry. A clean, professional format gets better results. Save and send your resume as a PDF to make sure it looks the same on every screen.</p>\n<h3>Keep It Short, but Not Too Short</h3>\n<p>If you’re just starting out, a one-pager works. But for more experienced professionals, a two-page resume is actually <a href=\"https://novoresume.com/career-blog/hr-survey\">preferred by 68.3% of hiring managers</a>.</p>\n<p>A great resume is a snapshot of your professional value. If you’re wondering how to communicate that value better, blending your <a href=\"https://www.success.com/soft-skills-for-resume/\">soft skills</a> with your technical know-how is one way to stand out naturally.</p>\n<h2>How to Make a Great Resume: Tips and Best Practices</h2>\n<p>A great resume is a well-crafted document that tells your professional story in a clear and focused way. Hiring managers and <a href=\"https://www.success.com/how-to-optimize-your-resume-for-ai/\">ATS software</a> are scanning for more than just keywords; they’re looking for signs of impact, relevance, and potential. These tips will help you refine your resume, highlight what matters most, and improve your chances of landing that interview. Use the following resume writing tips to ensure you get it right. </p>\n<h3>Use a Clean, Professional Format</h3>\n<p>Clarity is key. Recruiters often skim through dozens of resumes in minutes, so a clean design gives yours a better chance of being read.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Stick to simple, professional fonts like Arial or Calibri (10–12 pt).</li>\n      <li>Use clear section headings (e.g., Summary, Experience, Skills).</li>\n      <li>Include bullet points for easy scanning.</li>\n      <li>Keep it ATS-friendly. Avoid images, text boxes, or complex formatting.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

In addition to the typical South Africa itinerary of Boulders Beach and game drives, she offered a trip to Soweto, where Noah spent a lot of his youth, and a day spent learning about Black history and eating at Black-owned restaurants. At one of the group dinners, they also discussed the memoir.</p>\n<p>“[Books] provide a venue for you to talk about the things that you want out of life… and in terms of personal development, I think it provides kind of the training ground or the practice space for people to try… what it feels like to live out their values,” she says.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliannejaysonbuonocore/\">Julianne Buonocore</a>, founder of <a href=\"https://theliterarylifestyle.com/\">The Literary Lifestyle</a> (which supports reading and literacy), took a literary trip for her honeymoon in Italy. Her trip was based on several books set in Italy, and she planned many aspects of the trip around the novel <i>My Brilliant Friend</i> by Elena Ferrante, which is set in Naples and surrounding areas.</p>\n<p>“We also stayed at [Hotel Danieli] that was featured in [<i>Pictures from Italy</i><strong> </strong>by Charles Dickens</p>\n<p><i>and</i></p>\n<p><i>My Brilliant Friend</i>] and had been stayed at by [other] famous authors,” she says. “We visited St. Mark’s Square [in Venice], which was also visited by authors like Ernest Hemingway [and] is also in</p>\n<p><i>The Talented Mr. Ripley</i>…. When I realized I was traveling to Italy, I wanted to incorporate the books I was reading with my travel so I could bring the pages to life.”</p>\n<h2><strong>Literary getaways for personal development</strong></h2>\n<p>Literary trips are a great way to combine learning, experiences and self-care. You stimulate your mind, and experience authors and book settings vividly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/sarah_ernestine\">Sarah Ernestine</a>, a book publicist, says her most notable literary trip was to the Netherlands, after reading the massive book,<i> The Goldfinch</i> by Donna Tartt. It took Ernestine seven years to finish it.</p>\n<p>“The character … has to find a painting in the Netherlands called <i>The Goldfinch</i>, which is a real painting by Carel Fabritius made in the 1600s.… I went to the museum in the Hague, called the Mauritshuis [where the painting is housed].” She says the experience helped her personal development as she stepped into the shoes of a character on a self-discovery journey.</p>\n<h2><strong>How to plan your literary getaway</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.natashasrobinson.com/\">Natasha Sistrunk Robinson</a>, who has a doctorate in ministry, is the president and CEO of T3 Leadership Solutions, Inc., and has hosted six literary tourism trips, the latest about Harriet Tubman, and based on her book <i>Journey to Freedom</i>. The Juneteenth tour went from North Carolina to Toronto, Canada, following the same route taken by Harriet Tubman on the Underground Railroad. Her advice is to plan your trip around understanding the people you will be interacting with.</p>\n<p>“On this tour, I’ve chosen to partner with someone who’s a friend, [historian] Dr. Gregory Thompson. He has done work for the preservation of Harriet Tubman’s story.” She adds that she always looks for a local expert to partner with when she does her tours.</p>\n<p>Your literary getaway can be an official tour or something you organize yourself or for family.

I feel lucky enough to call some of these women friends. Watching them achieve their goals has been so cool. In some ways, it feels like climbing is really changing. But something felt off as I read through the headlines. For example, take <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2025/05/05/brooke-raboutou-janja-garnbret-excalibur/\">this one from <i>The Washington Post</i></a>: “The gender gap has narrowed in climbing. These women have closed it.”</p>\n<p id=\"publisher_div\"></p>\n<p>I’m a bit of a skeptic. Plus, the buzzy language about “closing the gender gap” felt too tidy, too enthusiastic. It made me wonder: What are we actually talking about here? It felt as if we were trying to wrap up some annoying loose end in the narrative arc of climbing so that we could all move on.</p>\n<p>The day I started writing this, I went out bouldering with a group of friends. They were all men, which is not unusual for me and typically not something I’d bat an eye at. A man I didn’t know very well joined us. I noticed right away that, although we were all climbing on the same problems, he never once asked me for beta. Yet he was relentless in his supply of (unsolicited) suggestions, advice, and pointers directed specifically to me and no one else.</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I0-P0-CMI0\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<p>Normally, I appreciate the collaborative nature of bouldering, but this time felt different. While the men got to simply climb, I couldn’t help feeling condescended to by the input and feedback directed at me. It was as if I was the only one who needed help, despite us all climbing the same grades.</p>\n<p>This is actually a common gendered scenario in climbing, and I grimace at how cliché it is to even write about something like this. After climbing for years, I had naively thought that these types of scenarios didn’t happen much anymore.</p>\n<p>I left the boulders seething. I couldn’t make sense of the disconnect between my own experience and the public excitement around “narrowing the gender gap.” How could the gender gap be closing when the everyday experiences of women in climbing aren’t really changing all that much? How many noteworthy physical feats are required to lift up every woman in climbing, rather than just highlight the outliers?</p>\n<p>Clearly, “narrowing the gap” hadn’t changed my experience as an average female climber. I wanted to know how it felt for someone who is purportedly closing the gap. So, I called up my friend <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.climbing.com/news/katie-lamb-first-woman-climb-v16/\">Katie Lamb</a> to get her take. She agreed that this simplified narrative leaves out a lot when it comes to her actual experiences.</p>\n<p>“The best men are establishing V17 and 5.15d. This takes categorically more skill and strength than repeating those grades,” Katie told me. “However, back in the day, Beth Rodden and Lynn Hill were actually pushing the limits of what anyone was doing on El Cap. And they received considerably more pushback for doing so.”</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I1-P0-CMI0\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<p>Katie pointed out plainly that there are two gender gaps: a performance gap and an experiential gap, both of which still exist. While at least some exemplary female climbers’ accomplishments are widely celebrated, this still doesn’t address the fact that most women in climbing are simply not taken as seriously as men, no matter “how hard” they climb.</p>\n<p>“The accomplishments of the outliers don’t significantly impact how average female climbers are perceived,” Katie agreed. We should still celebrate these accomplishments, no doubt, but to assume that they have any impact on the overall perception of female climbers is a mistake, and a trap that I think I had fallen into.</p>\n<p>To me, the idea of “the gap” itself feels male-centric. Why do women’s accomplishments only matter in relation to what men can do? Perhaps we fixate on upper-end numbers and outliers as a way of tracking progress because it’s easier and more comfortable than trying to understand women’s actual experiences in the sport.</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I2-P0-CMI0\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<p>So, I wondered, what would it look like if there were no gap at all? In my experience, the gap doesn’t actually exist when I am doing the activity. When I’m on the wall, I’m not thinking about what it means or where I fit into society. I’m just climbing.</p>\n<p>The beauty of climbing is that it brings us into the present, into our bodies and out of our heads. Perhaps we can simply let climbing be what it is for all of us. Let’s allow women to forge their own paths outside of “the gap,” beyond simply following in the footsteps of men.</p>\n<p>Finally, though this essay is centered in my experience as a female climber, I would be remiss not to mention the experiences of nonbinary climbers, too. I aim to highlight the complexity of the idea of the gender gap so that all people can feel embodied in climbing, outside of gender.</p>\n<p><i>This story first appeared in Tommy Caldwell’s newsletter, “Routefinding.” You can sign up for his newsletter </i><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.patagonia.com/climbing/tommy-caldwell-newsletter/\"><i>here</i></a><i>.</i></p>\n<p><em>Jane Jackson is a writer based in the Sierra Nevada.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The rival file-sharing service harnesses humour brilliantly to capitalise on the WeTransfer AI training controversy and lure in creative professionals.</p>\n    <p>When your biggest competitor drops the ball, what do you do? Well, if you're Smash, the French file transfer service, you take the mickey, with a campaign that's half joke, half serious business move.</p>\n    <p>Following a massive backlash against WeTransfer for its change in terms and conditions, Smash is rolling out some cheeky visuals that directly mock its Dutch rival. It's bold, it's direct, and it's working.</p>\n    <p>The whole thing kicked off last month when WeTransfer quietly changed its terms of service. The new wording appeared to suggest that any file you uploaded to their service could be used to train AI models. For creatives who rely on WeTransfer daily—photographers, designers, video editors and others—this felt like a massive betrayal.</p>\n    <p>Anyone who makes money from their creative work will understand why. The idea that WeTransfer might use your files to build AI tools? Not exactly what anyone signed up for.</p>\n    <p>Smash saw their chance and took it. Instead of a boring corporate response, they went straight for WeTransfer's throat with cutting humour; first in France, and now here in the UK. It was like watching Burger King roast McDonald's, except with file transfers.</p>\n    <p>The visuals in the campaign appear simple enough, but there's a serious message behind them. While WeTransfer upset everyone with AI controversies, Smash is positioning itself as the ethical alternative that gives a damn about user privacy and intellectual property.</p>\n    <p>The company itself isn't new; Smash has been around since 2017 and has steadily built up its user base over the last eight years. But timing is everything, and WeTransfer's AI controversy came at exactly the right moment. Smash had six million users and a capable infrastructure, enough to handle a sudden influx of angry WeTransfer refugees.</p>\n    <p>And that's basically what's happened. Since the controversy broke, Smash has seen its usage and subscriptions explode with triple-digit growth. But what's perhaps surprising is where the growth is coming from. It's not just their home country: they're seeing massive upticks in the US, UK, and even the Netherlands, where WeTransfer was born.</p>\n    <p>Of course, you can't just base a business on clever copywriting. So it's important to note that behind the jokes, Smash actually delivers on privacy in ways that WeTransfer apparently doesn't.</p>\n    <p>Their approach is pretty simple, really: they don't open your files, they don't analyse them, and they definitely don't feed them to AI models. Your stuff stays your stuff.</p>\n    <p>They also do something pretty rare in the file transfer world; they show you the environmental cost of each transfer. Working with a sustainability firm, they calculate the carbon footprint so you know exactly what impact you're having. It's the kind of transparency most companies avoid, but Smash is tackling its responsibilities head-on, and that's something we find laudable.</p>\n    <p>Overall, what Smash has pulled off with this campaign is a masterclass for any smaller company taking on a tech giant. They haven't gone high-minded or preachy about AI ethics. They haven't penned long blog posts about data sovereignty. They've simply put a smile on people's faces, while making their point crystal clear.</p>\n    <p>The beauty of their approach is that it doesn't take itself too seriously while addressing genuine concerns. Creatives worried about their intellectual property don't need lectures: they need alternatives that work and respect their rights. And sometimes the best response to a competitor's stumble is a well-timed joke that cuts to the chase.</p>\n    <p>Which means that creatives who felt burned by WeTransfer's AI ambitions now have a clear alternative that speaks their language, both literally and figuratively. In a world where trust in tech keeps eroding, sometimes a bit of honesty wrapped in humour is exactly what people need to hear.</p>\n    <p>Get the best of Creative Boom delivered to your inbox weekly</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

For several months, we very memorably even harboured a regular online visitor based in Antarctica. Where we have rarely broken through, and by extension, where we think very few of our readers are from or have even visited, is Central Asia.</p>\n<p>The vast swathes of land from Russia to China, largely made up of the 'Stans, have seen trade routes pass innovation, spice and precious cargo from the Far East to Europe and back for millennia. Further north, the wild landscape has remained more untamed – to our average online visitor, all are untravelled. This month, through to 20 November, the country's famed centre of communion and commerce welcomes the world.</p>\n<p>Commissioned by Gayane Umerova, the Chairperson of the Uzbekistan Art and Culture Development Foundation <a href=\"https://acdf.uz/\">(ACDF)</a>, the sprawling multifaceted celebration is the crown jewel of several years of extensive international positioning. The festival serves not only as an invitation to foreign tourists, but also as a signpost to broader cultural advancements throughout the country. Most ambitiously of all, it is a cornerstone of the national action to enhance livelihoods and careers for the country's young people, where, unlike in the West, two-thirds are aged under thirty. Offering a route into tourism and the service industries, or emboldening the artisan crafts of the region, are all intended to help with employment and purpose. </p>\n<p>Harnessing art and culture for soft power is no new idea. Even the idea of hosting a massive art exhibition every other year can be traced back to Venice and the 19th Century. But what Bukhara is introducing in this first edition, led by LA-born Artistic Director Diana Campbell, is a unique proposition. Every artist exhibiting has not merely created the work displayed in Uzbekistan, but has also collaborated with a local craftsperson. This huge undertaking has been in the planning for many years, with a vast number of contributors who have never collaborated with someone before, and even fewer having any prior understanding of traditional and regional artisan practices. A more in-depth examination of this aspect of the biennial will follow in a subsequent article.</p>\n<p>The debut edition of the biennial is entitled 'Recipes for Broken Hearts' and, like many great titles, it comes from an old story. The myth goes that a prince was forbidden to marry his young love, the daughter of an artisan. In consolation, he was given the national dish of plov – a warming rice dish with lamb and vegetables, served somewhat like biryani.</p>\n<p>The name has been taken at face value, and also skewed through translation and interpretation. In fact, with Uzbekistan being part of the USSR until the early '90s, the Cyrillic alphabet has been in use for decades, despite a more recent political shift to incorporate the Latin script across the country. At the biennial, initial signage and programming were released in English, but as more locals came to explore the offer, very sensibly avoiding the midday heat of the mid-30s, a range of explanations and guides were also available in Uzbek.</p>\n<p>The artists and collaborators have explored parallels of a broken heart, examining the various routes and reasons a heart might be broken. They have considered the meanings of recipes and the exceptionalism of the site within which this all takes place. For over 3,000 years of continuous human settlement, Bukhara is one of the world's oldest cities. Amidst the contemporary art and more established carpets, cotton, earthenware, and spices are mosques and minarets dating from as far back as the 1100s.</p>\n<p>It is this sand and rust-coloured architectural environment that acts as a framework for the varied art on display. Encompassing mosaic, puppetry, painting, sculpture, audience-created AI music production, dance, textile art and in fact, more than seventy site-specific commissions. With local craftspeople integral to the artistic endeavours, there are more than 200 active participants from almost 40 countries worldwide.</p>\n<p>The old town has been paved to facilitate access between the shaded, ancient trading buildings and the more open squares. Other entrances, through ogee or multifoil archways, lead to smaller zones, each surrounded by smaller cells, offering shelter from the sun and allowing for small personal interactions with the art on display. Most beguiling of these is the sumptuous <i>Blue Room</i> by Abdulvahid Bukhoriy and Jurabek Siddikov. In the early afternoon heat, dipping your head under a low door and entering this space is like entering an anti-sauna —a cool retreat for the body and soothing for the eyes. </p>\n<p>Blue Room, 2024–2025 by Abdulvahid Bukhoriy Uzbekistan in collaboration with Jurabek Siddikov Uzbekistan. Photo by Felix Odell courtesy of the Uzbekistan Art and Culture Development Foundation</p>\n<p>Equally surprising, and on an even larger scale, is an installation by Brazilian artist Marina Perez Simão in collaboration with Bakhtiyar Babamuradov. Also utilising regional ceramic skills, this piece fills a floor space with dynamic, stylised eyes in a design and colourway that is excitingly incongruous with the surrounding flat roofs and Islamic arches.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

The milestone comes after strong whale sales. It also raises questions about whether retail optimism can sustain the rally.</p><h3><strong>XRP Market Value Rises Above Top Corporations</strong></h3>\n<p>Companies Market Cap listings show that XRP ranks at a higher valuation than Shopify, Verizon and Citigroup at present. Shopify supports millions of shopping locations online, and Verizon has over 140 million users, while Citigroup has trillions of assets under its management.</p><p>The token has increased by 12% this week, trading above $3.05, the first in weeks. Analysts say this is part of a larger recovery across digital assets fueled by ETF anticipation.</p><h3><strong>Analysts Predict Breakout</strong></h3>\n<p>Technical analysts have pointed out bullish setups. A bull flag was also noticed by an analyst, giving projections such as $6, $13, and even $23 in case the coin breaks above $3.60.</p><p>Another respected trader noted that Fibonacci levels point to $4.39 and $5.85, while support zones can be found between $3.01 and $2.85.</p><p>Another analyst noted a symmetrical triangle. According to them, this suggests that there is an equal chance for the XRP price to rise or drop. He stressed that maintaining a close above $3.07 is critical for bullish continuation.</p><h3><strong>ETF Speculation Fuels Optimism</strong></h3>\n<p>Investor enthusiasm has grown around the possibility of an XRP exchange-traded fund in the United States. Bloomberg’s James Seyffart noted that REX-Osprey’s XRP ETF is expected to launch soon after delays.</p><p>The Polymarket prediction data proves this optimism. The probability of an XRP ETF to gain approval by the end of 2025 currently stands at 95% on the platform. The figure represents a 24% increase in recent months, which is an indicator of increasing belief among market players.</p><p>The graph indicates an upward trend following decreases earlier in the year, and confidence is now at an all-time high. Such products could open institutional flows into XRP, like it happened with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.</p><p>However, demand could also be mixed. For example, the Solana Staking ETF by REX-Osprey has recorded total inflows of $205 million since its launch. Compared to the BTC ETFs’ performance in their first two months of launch, the REX-Osprey Solana ETF has performed below expectations.</p><h3><strong>Whales Decrease Exposure Despite Milestone</strong></h3>\n<p>As retail traders celebrate the coin’s valuation milestone, large XRP holders are reducing their exposure. Santiment reported that whales with 10 to 100 million XRP sold 40 million coins in forty-eight hours.</p><p>These large holders have gradually minimized exposure in the past weeks. Their sell-offs correspond with the launch of the REX-Osprey XRP ETF. The move by the whales suggests that they do not think that there will be high demand from institutions, which will raise the price of the coin.</p><p>Big sell orders were observed at Binance, Coinbase, and OKX as the coin price rose more than $3.05. The whales also added short positions between $3.3 and $3.6, putting hurdles for any bullish momentum.</p><h3><strong>SEC Delays Add Uncertainty</strong></h3>\n<p>Also, a decision on the XRP ETF by Franklin Templeton has been postponed by the U.S SEC. Regulators are still cautious, and with every hesitation, they add an element of confusion to market sentiment.</p><p>The Whale Flow 30-day moving average by CryptoQuant supports the bearish position of the whales.

(Photo: Ty Lekki)</p>\n<p class=\"mb-base-loose flex flex-wrap gap-(--spacing-base)\"><template id=\"B:0\"></template></p>\n<p class=\"pub-date font-utility-2 text-text-secondary\">Updated September 14, 2025 08:37AM</p>\n<p>It was two hours after sunset but the darkness didn’t make a difference to Colin Haley. He was wedged in a vertical, chest-width crevasse just below the summit of Patagonia’s Cerro Torre, squirming for purchase amid the ancient glacial ice. “It was like [Yosemite’s] Harding Slot, but of ice,” Haley told <i>Climbing</i>. He’d left nearly everything at the base of the crevasse in order to fit inside—his extra jacket and gloves, Grigri, helmet, food from his chest pocket—and still could just barely squeeze through. Even without a helmet, when Haley turned his head, his headlamp would get knocked to the side. By 9:30 p.m., he’d been in that crevasse for over two hours with no clear end in sight. But he was determined. “I thought: either I make it through this crevasse somehow, or my attempt is finished.”</p>\n<p id=\"publisher_div\"></p>\n<h2>A change of plans</h2>\n<p>Colin Haley had originally planned to spend the entire summer in Pakistan’s Karakoram mountains, first attempting K7 (6,934m) with partners and then pursuing a solo ascent elsewhere in the range. But when temperatures soared to frighteningly high levels, leading to increased rockfall and challenging travel, Haley realized he would have to pivot elsewhere. “I knew Patagonia in winter was going to be the opposite of too hot and melted out,” Haley said. “Freezing my ass off sounded appealing, in comparison.”</p>\n<p>The pivot was notably similar to three years ago, when Haley aborted an unseasonably dry solo trip to the Canadian Rockies. After seeing the sad state of the area’s summer snowpack, he flew to El Chaltén and ultimately made the first <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.climbing.com/news/colin-haley-solos-fitz-roy-patagonia-winter/\">solo ascent of the <i>Supercanaleta</i> (5.9 WI4 M5/6; 1,500m)</a> on Cerro Chaltén (Fitz Roy) in Austral winter.</p>\n<p>This year, Haley arrived in El Chaltén in early August and immediately began bringing loads of equipment into the mountains. He planned to solo Cerro Torre’s line of first ascent, the <i>Ragni Route</i> (WI5+ M4), which tackles sections of vertical rime-ice and gains roughly 1,000 meters from the start of the technical climbing. The <i>Ragni</i> may technically be the easiest line on Cerro Torre, but it also has the longest approach of any route in the massif—over 45 kilometers of variable mountain terrain. “As soon as I arrived in town my goal became: get as much of my gear as close to the base of the route as possible, as soon as possible,” Haley said. He made four gear-portering trips into the mountains—totalling seven-and-a-half labor-intensive days—to ultimately deposit a large gear cache on top of Filo Rosso, a protected campsite near the start of <i>Ragni</i>.</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I0-P0-CMI0\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<h2>Climbing the <i>Ragni</i></h2>\n<p>Haley departed town on September 4 and skied in to the base of Cerro Torre in one long day. He spent a second, short day climbing from the basin (called Circo de los Altares) up to the top of Filo Rosso, encountering brief sections of mixed and steep ice up to M4, which he had fixed with a short length of rope. From that campsite, the “real” climbing of the <i>Ragni </i>begins: 600 meters of alpine ice, blocky mixed terrain, and the airy, poorly protected rime-ice flutings which the Torre group is infamous for.</p>\n<p>On September 6, Haley packed up his bivy and began climbing around 6:45 a.m. He free soloed from his campsite to about one rope-length above the Col of Hope, and then rope soloed nearly everything after. Haley said that with a small pack he would have been comfortable free soloing roughly 50 percent of the Ragni’s terrain, “but due to the weight of my pack, filled with wintertime bivy gear, it was not appealing to me,” he explained.</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I1-P0-CMI0\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<p>Haley’s first day on route was a big one. He dispatched all but the final three crux pitches of the <i>Ragni</i> and bedded down around 3 a.m. Conditions had been surprisingly good—”I’ve definitely climbed the route with significantly more rime than it had now,” he said—but even so, the <i>Ragni</i> was in full winter condition, with brittle ice and plenty of excavating to do.</p>\n<p>The following day, with just three pitches to climb, Haley left camp at 11 a.m. and prepared for what he knew would be the crux (typically, the<i> Ragni</i> increases in difficulty the higher you climb, with the very last pitch being the hardest). The first pitch went by easily, but the second required a lot of time-consuming digging through rime to reach solid protection and axe placements.</p>\n<p>“But the real story is that the right side of Cerro Torre’s southwest face recently had a massive serac collapse some time within the last nine months,” Haley said. As a result, the right side of the final pitch had plenty of blue ice exposed rather than the typically white sugary snow. Haley beelined for this option, sure that the route was now about to get much more straightforward. He climbed securely up the often-overhanging glacial ice, occasionally aiding off of screws as the previous days’ exhaustion caught up to him.</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I2-P0-CMI0\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Bong, a new, itsy-bitsy, absolutely electrifying Cambodian restaurant in Crown Heights, has more energy even while you’re waiting on the sidewalk for your table to be ready than most spots can muster on their most lit-up nights of the year. For the three evenings a week that it’s open, the whole operation, in a modest storefront on a residential corner, is shimmeringly alive. The cooks are half dancing in the open kitchen as they slice and stir-fry. The customers all seem wildly in love with one another. Inside, the light bouncing off the acid-green walls makes everyone’s faces appear traced with neon. The thumping bass of the hip-hop playlist reverberates through the dining room and rolls out through the open door to reach the diners seated at bistro tables out front. Even a half block away, the air smells sweet and bright, like seared shellfish, sharp vinegar, and the blistery green of sizzling herbs.</p>\n    <p>Bong (the name comes from a Khmer term of kinship and respect) is run by the Cambodian chef Chakriya Un, who was born in a Thai refugee camp and grew up in the U.S., and her partner, Alexander Chaparro, who emigrated from Venezuela. For eight years, Un operated Kreung, an acclaimed pop-up whose explorations of flavor and memory were a proving ground for many of the dishes now on Bong’s menu. The lineup is tight—a party of four could (and should!) order the whole thing. In addition to offering a survey of Khmer cuisine, with its strong flavors and sour ferments, the restaurant also pays homage to Un’s own family, particularly her mother, Kim Eng Mann, or Mama Kim, who can sometimes be spotted working in the kitchen. She developed the recipe for the <i>cha kapiek</i>, a bracing dip in which a symphonic, funky fermented-shrimp paste is pounded with fresh shrimp and peanuts; it’s served with a mound of satisfyingly crinkle-cut crudités and seed-studded shrimp chips. Mama Kim’s namesake lobster (listed with the minimal description “IYKYK”) is a magnificent mountain of crustacean legs and claws, the pieces stir-fried with oodles of slivered ginger and a sweet-spicy herbaceous paste, made by Mama Kim, that clings, slurpably, to the meat and drips juicily onto a pile of rice below. A toothsome hanger steak is crowned with a dynamic <i>tuk kreung</i>—a blend of eggplant, chiles, and another paste made with fish that Mama Kim catches herself.</p>\n    <p>Almost everything on the menu is thrilling. Even what fails to be thrilling, such as a fairly floppy green salad that I tried on one visit, manages to be at least interesting. (The dressing on that salad was afire with Kampot peppercorns, a hard-to-find Cambodian variety that has a tealike flowery astringence.) Another salad of chewy-crisp pork jowl and sliced melon is zingy with garlic and pickle-tart. The round sweetness of squid, fried in a light-as-air batter, is magnified by intensely floral curry leaves and a salty snowfall of shaved cured egg yolk. A bone-in pork chop, thick as a dictionary, tender as can be, and drowning in a luscious mess of charred tomatoes marinated in a sugar-lime-fish-sauce concoction, features every shade of sour and sweet.</p>\n    <p>Along with Mama Kim’s lobster, a dish about which I have had literal dreams, my favorite thing on the menu was the whole fried fish—dorade, on one visit, the skin crackly and dusted with toasted rice powder—which eyeballs you lasciviously from an oval plate. Its flesh is scored into diamonds, the way you might slice a lattice into the fat end of a pork shoulder; it’s visually striking and functionally quite useful, creating perfect little pull-off morsels ready to be dipped in sour-tamarind sauce and wrapped up in a lettuce leaf with Vietnamese coriander and <i>diếp cá</i> (a punchy herb known as fish mint). Here, perhaps, the chaotic-party energy of the place could have used a little focus, or been channelled into a brief anatomy spiel: I saw way too many tables dive ecstatically into the fried fish—and then, too happily, allow their plates to be cleared away without realizing that, if you flip the creature over, there’s an entire second serving to be found on the other side.</p>\n    <p>It’s doubly a shame to miss the second half of the fish simply because a seat at white-hot, tiny Bong is, at the moment, a terribly precious thing. For most of Bong’s opening months, Un and Chaparro have been ever present in the tiny space, Chaparro working the front of house and Un, gloriously pregnant, in the kitchen. As a newish parent myself, still very much obsessed with the oddness and wonder and misery of human gestation, I found Un’s physical presence in the restaurant incredibly moving—I can’t think of another time I’ve seen someone who is visibly expecting working in a restaurant, let alone the chef and owner and engine of a place. After the very recent birth of their child, Un has taken a break from the all-consuming demands of restaurateuring to attend to the entirely distinct all-consuming demands of early parenthood. The restaurant remains open, run by Un’s talented kitchen team, with Un, Chaparro, and Mama Kim dropping in occasionally; the food remains sharp and bright and deep and exhilarating, the mood vivacious and young and loud and polychromatic. What a thing it is to bring life into this world! ♦</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

They had just completed a historic milestone: the first winter ascent of the legendary line envisioned and soloed by Renato Casarotto back in January 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"publisher_div\"></p>\n<h2><b>A legendary line</b></h2>\n<p>Casarotto’s visionary route—35 pitches, 1,250 meters, up to 5.11b—traces the striking North Pillar of Cerro Chaltén, nearly 1,000 meters of soaring granite itself, before continuing up the upper wall to the summit. He named it “Pilar Goretta,” after his wife. Even in summer, the climb is serious: endless crack systems, polished dihedrals, and off-widths on flawless granite. In winter, it becomes something else entirely—endless storms, freezing ropes, cracks filled with verglas, and tents shredded by Patagonia’s infamous winds.</p>\n<p>Reflecting on that solo ascent, Casarotto wrote in the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://publications.americanalpineclub.org/articles/12198038300/Fitz-Roy-Solo-on-the-North-Pillar\"><i>American Alpine Journal</i></a>: “On this wall I had to overcome extreme technical difficulties in the presence of continuous bad weather. This adventure confirmed to me that to succeed on very difficult climbs, it’s essential to integrate with the environment, to identify the right moment so your physicaCll and psychological energy is not wasted in long waits.”</p>\n<p>Several teams have repeated the 1979 route, and often with variations. Colin Haley, the only other climber to solo it—and the first to do so alpine style, in 2023—called Casarotto’s achievement “incredible… in an era with no forecasts, no satellite communications, no LED headlamps, no camming devices.”</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I0-P0-CMI0\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<h2><b>A first taste of Patagonian winter</b></h2>\n<p>For all three members of the Italian team—Della Bordella, Majori, and Tommaso Lamantia—this was their very first winter expedition in Patagonia. Despite Matteo’s deep experience (five Cerro Chaltén ascents and countless other Patagonian climbs), he admitted he didn’t know exactly what awaited them. “The chances of success were extremely slim,” he told me.</p>\n<p>Arriving in El Chaltén on August 5, they didn’t hesitate. A rare good-weather window opened, and the team shouldered 55-pound packs and slogged through deep snow to the base. On August 7, they launched their first attempt, climbing halfway up the pillar before fierce winds forced a retreat on August 10.</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I1-P0-CMI0\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<p>“It was incredible,” Della Bordella recalled. “The cold, the fatigue, the absolute solitude—and at the same time, exhilarating. Pitch by pitch we grew more confident that it was possible.” Daytime temperatures barely reached 40°F; at night, they dropped to –5°F, with winds biting even harder.</p>\n<p>Although they retreated, the team came back to town energized. Della Bordella stressed that his guiding principle was to never burn himself out on any given day, to always leave enough energy and clarity for a safe retreat if needed. His words echoed Casarotto’s decades-old wisdom.</p>\n<p>But Patagonian weather has little mercy. Storms pinned them down through late August, and Lamantia had to fly home, disappointed to miss the final push. “It wasn’t easy watching from afar,” he admitted, “but I’m grateful for what I experienced. I made it halfway up the pillar. I didn’t get the cherry on top, but it was still an incredible adventure. As a photographer, I hope my work helps tell the story in a future documentary.”</p>\n<h2><b>The final push</b></h2>\n<p>Patience is one of Della Bordella’s greatest strengths. He relied on a longtime friend back in Italy for weather forecasts—and this time, the prediction was perfect. With lighter packs and the benefit of experience, Della Bordella and Majori reached the base in half the time of their first attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I2-P0-CMI0\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<p>At dawn on September 5, Majori led the first mixed pitches, ice tools and crampons scraping on the granite. Then Matteo took over on the steep, technical cracks he knew so well. They bivouacked under the giant Bloque Empotrado, wedged between Pilar Goretta and Aguja Mermoz. The next day they completed the pillar and bivouacked again on the snowfield at its top, preparing for the final wall. On September 7, exhausted and frozen but unwavering, they stepped onto Cerro Chaltén’s 11,171-foot summit.</p>\n<h2><b>Majori’s circle comes full</b></h2>\n<p>For Marco Majori, this climb was more than just a technical challenge. Just a year earlier, he had barely survived a crevasse fall on K2 during an ambitious no-oxygen ski descent attempt. He clawed his way out alone, in terrible shape, and only survived thanks to the swift aid of fellow climbers. Though the physical injuries healed, the psychological scars lingered.</p>\n<p>What motivated him to return to high-stakes climbing? Family history. His father, Giovanni Majori, had once been on an expedition with Casarotto himself but decided against attempting the pillar. A childhood photo of Casarotto—a tiny black dot at the base of the massive wall—stayed with Marco for decades. “This climb,” he told me, “was a circle closing.”</p>\n<h2><b>Della Bordella: The vision</b></h2>\n<p>Della Bordella and Majori already had a strong partnership, having opened a new route on Siula Grande (6344 m) in Peru the year before. But what stands out about Della Bordella isn’t just his technical mastery—it’s his character.</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I3-P0-CMI0\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

But new findings show those sanctions have done little to stop Stark from simply rebranding and transferring their assets to other corporate entities controlled by its original hosting providers.</p>\n<p>Image: Shutterstock.</p>\n<p>Materializing just two weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Stark Industries Solutions became a frequent source of massive DDoS attacks, Russian-language proxy and VPN services, malware tied to Russia-backed hacking groups, and fake news. ISPs like Stark are called “bulletproof” providers when they cultivate a reputation for ignoring any abuse complaints or police inquiries about activity on their networks.</p>\n<p>In May 2025, the European Union <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:L_202500965\">sanctioned</a> one of Stark’s two main conduits to the larger Internet — Moldova-based <strong>PQ Hosting</strong> — as well as the company’s Moldovan owners <strong>Yuri</strong> and <strong>Ivan Neculiti</strong>. The EU Commission said the Neculiti brothers and PQ Hosting were linked to Russia’s hybrid warfare efforts.</p>\n<p>But <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/one-step-ahead-stark-industries-solutions-preempts-eu-sanctions\">a new report</a> from <strong>Recorded Future</strong> finds that just prior to the sanctions being announced, Stark rebranded to <strong>the[.]hosting</strong>, under control of the Dutch entity <strong>WorkTitans BV</strong> (AS209847) on June 24, 2025. The Neculiti brothers reportedly got a heads up roughly 12 days before the sanctions were announced, when Moldovan and EU media reported on the forthcoming inclusion of the Neculiti brothers in the sanctions package.</p>\n<p>In response, the Neculiti brothers moved much of Stark’s considerable address space and other resources over to a new company in Moldova called <strong>PQ Hosting Plus S.R.L</strong>., an entity reportedly connected to the Neculiti brothers thanks to <a href=\"https://correctiv.org/faktencheck/russland-ukraine/2024/05/16/hacks-und-propaganda-zwei-brueder-aus-moldau-tragen-russlands-digitalen-krieg-nach-europa/#:~:text=web%20hosting%20service%2C-,Morenehost,-%2C%20writes%20the%20IT\">the re-use of a phone number</a> from the original PQ Hosting.</p>\n<p>“Although the majority of associated infrastructure remains attributable to Stark Industries, these changes likely reflect an attempt to obfuscate ownership and sustain hosting services under new legal and network entities,” Recorded Future observed.</p>\n<p>Neither the Recorded Future report nor the May 2025 sanctions from the EU mentioned a second critical pillar of Stark’s network that KrebsOnSecurity identified in <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/stark-industries-solutions-an-iron-hammer-in-the-cloud/\">a May 2024 profile on the notorious bulletproof hoster</a>: The Netherlands-based hosting provider <strong>MIRhosting</strong>.</p>\n<p>MIRhosting is operated by 38-year old <strong>Andrey Nesterenko</strong>, whose <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20141221134456/http://www.nesterenko.name/en/index.html\">personal website</a> says he is an accomplished concert pianist who began performing publicly at a young age. <strong>DomainTools</strong> says mirhosting[.]com is registered to Mr. Nesterenko and to <strong>Innovation IT Solutions Corp</strong>, which lists addresses in London and in Nesterenko’s stated hometown of Nizhny Novgorod, Russia.</p>\n<p>Image credit: correctiv.org.</p>\n<p>According to the book <i>Inside Cyber Warfare</i> by Jeffrey Carr, Innovation IT Solutions Corp. was responsible for hosting <strong>StopGeorgia[.]ru</strong>, a hacktivist website for organizing cyberattacks against Georgia that appeared at the same time Russian forces invaded the former Soviet nation in 2008. That conflict was thought to be the first war ever fought in which a notable cyberattack and an actual military engagement happened simultaneously.</p>\n<p>Mr. Nesterenko did not respond to requests for comment. In May 2024, Mr. Nesterenko <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/stark-industries-solutions-an-iron-hammer-in-the-cloud/\">said</a> he couldn’t verify whether StopGeorgia was ever a customer because they didn’t keep records going back that far. But he maintained that Stark Industries Solutions was merely one client of many, and claimed MIRhosting had not received any actionable complaints about abuse on Stark.</p>\n<p>However, it appears that MIRhosting is once again the new home of Stark Industries, and that MIRhosting employees are managing both the[.]hosting and WorkTitans — the primary beneficiaries of Stark’s assets.</p>\n<p>A copy of the incorporation documents for WorkTitans BV obtained from the Dutch Chamber of Commerce shows WorkTitans also does business under the names <strong>Misfits Media</strong> and and <strong>WT Hosting</strong> (considering Stark’s historical connection to Russian disinformation websites, “Misfits Media” is a bit on the nose).</p>\n<p>An incorporation document for WorkTitans B.V. from the Netherlands Chamber of Commerce.</p>\n<p>The incorporation document says the company was formed in 2019 by a <strong>y.zinad@worktitans.nl</strong>.

His turbulent, light-drenched seascapes could be panoramic, stretching more than 200 centimetres (about 6.5 feet) wide. His 1850 masterpiece <i>The Ninth Wave</i>, an oil-painted maelstrom of dark waves against a livid orange sunset, measures 332 centimetres (almost 11 feet) across. But in 1887, Aivozovsky proved he could work at a much smaller scale just as easily. At a celebration marking his seventieth birthday, the artist presented each of his 150 dinner guests with a unique miniature painting: tiny vistas embedded in a studio photograph of himself, poised with brush in hand. At just 10.6 by 7.3 centimetres (about 4 by 3 inches), the paintings are each almost a thousandth of the size of <i>The Ninth Wave</i>. There are two variations of the underlying photograph — in some, he looks at the canvas, in others, at the audience — and a few are dated later than 1887, perhaps implying that Aivazovsky continued the gifting practice for years after the dinner.</p>\n    <p>As his miniature seascapes suggest, Aivozovsky was prolific. Today, about 6,000 paintings are attributed to him. But his productivity was not always seen as an advantage by his contemporaries. The art critic Vladimir Stasov <a href=\"https://www.tretyakovgallerymagazine.com/articles/1-2017-54/many-faces-ivan-aivazovsky\">wrote</a>:</p>\n    <p>Speed was only one of several critiques reserved for an artist whose achievements brought him to the top of Russian society. Others took issue with Aivozovsky’s inclination toward self-promotion. Visiting Aivozovsky’s gaudy Feodosia home in 1890, the writer and attorney Alexander Vladimirovich <a href=\"https://www.tretyakovgallerymagazine.com/articles/4-2016-53/ivan-aivazovsky\">complained</a>:</p>\n    <blockquote>If you did not know that in front of you was the creator of “The Ninth Wave”, you would probably take him for a painter who had sunk into smug self-contemplation of his own bureaucratic position, proud of finally having worked his way up to a certain salary that allowed him to acquire gilded furniture and hang a full-length portrait of himself in full regalia in the living room to impress visitors.</blockquote>\n    <p>Aivozovsky’s collection of miniature paintings — executed at the very height of his career — certainly reflect his penchant for self-promotion. As for the question of whether an artist’s speed cheapens the value of his work? That comes down to a personal value judgment. But in the history of art, these souvenir paintings seem more significant than a mere experiment in scale. They also made Aivozovsky an early mixed-media pioneer. Decades before dada artists composed subversive photomontage and pop artists like Robert Rauschenberg collaged paint and photography, the great Romantic Aivazovsky was not too precious to do his own small experiment with form.</p>\n    <p>Sep 11, 2025</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>In “The History of Sound,” a new romantic drama set during and after the First World War, passion is an intensely private thing, and in more ways than you might expect. Love and desire are not simply expressed in the sweaty vigor of bodies in bed; the two central characters are turned on, and brought together, by moments of quietly harmonious convergence, rooted in shared qualities of heightened perception, cultivated taste, and specialized knowledge. A crucial early scene takes place in 1917, where Lionel Worthing (Paul Mescal), a voice student at the New England Conservatory of Music, is out drinking with friends. Suddenly, amid waves of cigarette smoke and chatter, he hears a song that he recognizes: “Across the Rocky Mountain,” an old folk ballad that he learned while growing up on a farm in Kentucky. It’s not the kind of tune that pops up every day at a Boston bar, and Lionel is immediately interested in the singer: David White (Josh O’Connor), another student at the conservatory.</p>\n<p>What happens next is essentially a case of love at first listen. Here are two young men bonding over a shared devotion to American folk music, which, born out of rural oral traditions excluded from their academic milieu, seem mired in obscurity. David, blessed with O’Connor’s elfin, mischievous smile, is an impulsive fellow and a suave multitasker: he can sing, play the piano, and dangle a cigarette from his lips with rakish allure. Lionel is shyer and quieter, but Mescal—peering through thin, owlish glasses that have a way of both concealing and amplifying his magnetism—employs the character’s reserve to stealthy effect. When Lionel, playfully goaded by David, sings “Silver Dagger,” a folk tune about a young woman trying to heed her mother’s mistrust of men, his voice rings out in the smoky, now silent bar with a clarity that touches the sublime.</p>\n<p>Lionel’s singing ability is one of two gifts that he’s cultivated since boyhood. The other is that Lionel can see sound. In an opening voice-over, an older version of Lionel, played by Chris Cooper, describes his surprise at learning that few other people can. “I thought everyone could see sound. Yellow for D,” he says. “Taste, too. My father would play a B-minor and my mouth went bitter.” For most of us, sound is invisible, and the movie suggests that Lionel and David’s immediate mutual attraction is largely invisible, too—except, perhaps, to those few attuned to the same wavelength. As the two men tumble into bed, and into the depths of a physically, emotionally, and intellectually thrilling romance, it’s as if their devotion to music, an inherently isolating endeavor, had somehow inoculated them against the dangers of public exposure. It’s not that their love dare not speak its name; it’s that few others would recognize the name if it were spoken, or would even begin to understand the language.</p>\n<p>Although Lionel’s experience of sound is never identified onscreen, he has what is commonly known as synesthesia, in which certain stimuli trigger more than one sensory response. (<i>The New Yorker’s</i> Robin Wright, writing from personal experience, has described the condition as “<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/i-have-something-in-common-with-marilyn-monroeand-you-might-too\">a kind of neurological crosstalk</a>.”) More than a few movies have evoked the experience of synesthesia, some by chance, some through a deliberate attempt to reproduce its effects. In the 1940 Walt Disney classic “Fantasia,” an army of animators sought out visual correlatives for the contours of classical music—mostly with clearly illustrative narrative imagery but also with inventive bursts of pure abstraction. Paul Thomas Anderson’s “Punch-Drunk Love,” from 2002, features lyrical interludes in which a color band fills the screen, each surging note of Jon Brion’s score seeming to correspond to a different hue.</p>\n<p>In “The History of Sound,” the South African-born director Oliver Hermanus shows little interest in such bold displays of cinematic impressionism. The film has a spare, chilly beauty. Its most striking compositions are of forests and farms, which the cinematographer Alexander Dynan shoots in a wintry, desaturated palette dominated by pale grays and parched browns. If there are intense or vibrant colors here, they remain locked away in the vault of Lionel’s consciousness—a vault that, snippets of voice-over notwithstanding, Hermanus has no intention of breaking into too easily. His discretion extends to the depiction of David and Lionel’s affair. The men’s first instance of lovemaking consists of some droll foreplay—David, an instinctive trickster, spits a stream of water at Lionel’s face—and an almost businesslike invitation (“Come on”), followed by a quick, tasteful cut to the morning after.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Hayes <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20090505141638/http://www.rbhayes.org/hayes/manunews/paper_trail_display.asp?nid=65&amp;subj=manunews\">watched</a> as a Wells Fargo crate was pried open to reveal its long-awaited cargo: a Siamese cat, the first of its kind in the country, that had endured two months of travel by land and sea before arriving in the White House. Though much beloved, the new pet (rather unimaginatively dubbed “Siam”) by all accounts did not take well to its new home. Not long after its arrival, Hayes’ daughter reported that the cat’s health had suddenly taken a turn for the worse, and a veterinarian’s prescribed diet of “beef tea and milk every three hours” was not enough to save it.</p>\n    <p>The president’s pet may not have been long for this world, but love of Siamese cats is eternal: since the Ayutthaya period (1351–1767), manuscripts extolling the virtues of auspicious breeds have circulated in what is now Thailand, though the examples that come down to us today all date from after the sack of the former capital by the Burmese in 1767, during which numerous manuscripts and artworks were destroyed. Cat treatises, called <a href=\"https://southeastasianlibrarygroup.wordpress.com/2013/06/07/a-treatise-on-siamese-cats/\"> Tamra Maew</a>, were part of a category of Siamese manuscripts — often created on mulberry bark and bound in a concertina format — that sought to taxonomize animals with royal or religious significance, such as </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://temp-dev-forums.auctionmarketer.co.uk/auction/1176-fine-books-manuscripts-and-works-on-1009/223-thailand-manual-on-horses-manuscript-in-thai-19th-century-151862?keyword=&amp;name=&amp;excl_keyword=&amp;search_type=&amp;auction_no=1176&amp;low_estimate=&amp;high_estimate=&amp;sort_by=lot_no&amp;gridtype=listview&amp;ipp=10&amp;catId=&amp;page_no=23&amp;last_name=&amp;first_name=&amp;title=&amp;auction_date=&amp;tab_type=\">horses</a>and</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://art.thewalters.org/object/W.893/\">elephants</a>.

The artist has placed each specimen — including one with a fish in its jaws — on a pedestal like a deity before a crowd of adoring worshipers. Other examples in the genre show the cats <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Treatise_on_Cats#/media/File:Tamra_khao_manee_cat_in_Bangkok_(cropped).jpg\">sticking out their tongues</a>, licking their bellies, or <a href=\"https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-147937297/view\">sporting a chunky belled collar</a>.</p>\n    <p><i>Tamra Maew</i> manuscripts pair illustrations of these auspicious pets with poetic descriptions and notes on what mystical benefits the owner might hope to accrue, which may range from riches to good health. Translations of a <i>Tamra Maew</i> published in <a href=\"https://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/30/clutterbuck.php\"> Cabinet</a> magazine gives us a sense of what these breed descriptions were like: one cat has “eyes like dewdrops on a lotus”, while another’s are “lit like fireflies, applied liquid gold”. One has a “body colored as a conch shell”, while another is “white as cliffs”. Even the names of the different subtypes have poetic charm: Dark Sapphire, Excellence, Jeweled Cloth, Lao Flower.</p>\n    <p>It is to the breed called <i>Wichien Maat</i>, or Moon Diamond — better known to Western audiences as the Classic Siamese — that Hayes’ ill-fated pet belonged. Rama V, Siam’s king at the time, <a href=\"https://tehran.thaiembassy.org/en/content/the-real-housecats-of-siam-wichien-maat?cate=5d84630615e39c3cbc002bcf\">reportedly</a> enjoyed giving them as diplomatic gifts. A carefully selected Wichien Maat presided over the coronation ceremony of Thailand’s current king, Rama X (though <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/world/fake-mews-confusion-over-cat-at-thai-kings-coronation-ceremony-idUSKCN1SB0IS/\">conspiracies swirl</a> about whether or not it may actually be a doll), but many other breeds featured in the <i>Tamra Maew</i> have not fared as well: of the seventeen included in most versions of this treatise, only a handful are known to have survived until the present day.</p>\n    <p>For slightly creepier specimens, <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/item/2010422038\">see this</a> other <i>Tamra Maew</i> manuscript held by the Library of Congress.</p>\n    <p>Sep 10, 2025</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>Much of direction is production: the material conditions under which a movie is made plays a major role in the creative process. Movie lovers tend to think of producers as dictators of formulas, oppressors of originality, the enemies of art, but that just reflects the unfortunate history of studio filmmaking in Hollywood and elsewhere. In fact, producing a movie can be a kind of art in itself, a practical imagining of possibilities for filmmakers that they wouldn’t themselves have come up with. The complete retrospective of Chantal Akerman’s work that runs at <i>MOMA</i> from September 11th to October 16th includes a superb instance of this phenomenon—of visionary production fostering directorial artistry—in her “Portrait of a Young Girl at the End of the 60s in Brussels,” an hour-long movie from 1994.</p>\n<p>“Portrait” was commissioned by the French television channel Arte as part of an anthology series titled “All the Boys and Girls of Their Age,” which featured the work of nine directors, including not only veterans such as Akerman, Claire Denis, and André Téchiné but also relative newcomers. The directors were given a handful of dictates. The films had to be about adolescents and had to be set some time from the nineteen-sixties to the eighties, with some political context. Each movie was to run an hour and to be shot on a low budget, on a tight schedule (about three weeks), and in the small-scale format of 16-mm. film. Finally, each film had to feature pop music and include a party scene. Aside from those conditions, the filmmakers were given more or less total freedom—and, in “Portrait,” that freedom shows.</p>\n<p>Akerman is, of course, most known for the movie that was voted best of all time in the 2022 <i>Sight &amp; Sound</i> poll, “<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/movies/jeanne-dielman-23-quai-du-commerce-1080-bruxelles-2\">Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles</a>,” from 1975, which looks with choreographic precision at the domestic life—both utterly conventional and radically independent—of a middle-aged woman. With its calculatedly severe form, the film both distills and extends melodrama to avant-garde extremes. “Portrait,” despite sharing some crucial traits with that earlier work, is also drastically different. Thanks to its production method—for a start, the emphasis on youth—it’s one of Akerman’s most personal, immediately expressive, and dramatically straightforward movies. And “Portrait” is also one of Akerman’s rarest films—also because of the terms under which it was made—and its rarity has produced a skewed view of Akerman’s cinematic achievement.</p>\n<p>“Portrait” is, in effect, a short story—one so simple and so solid that it invites adornment and elaboration on a grand scale of imagination. The film is set, pointedly, at a significant historical moment—April, 1968, just a month before the great wave of generational protests that transformed France—and at a similarly significant time in the life of its title character, Michèle (Circé Lethem). Michèle, whose age is unspecified (the actor was seventeen), engages in a rebellion of her own. While it’s still dark, her father drops her off at a streetcar stop for her commute to school, but she doesn’t take the streetcar and she doesn’t go to school. In a café, she starts to forge a parental note to excuse her absence (a nod to a scene from Truffaut’s “The 400 Blows”) but then gives up and decides to stop going to school altogether, tearing up and throwing away her report card—her version of crossing the Rubicon.</p>\n<p>At lunch hour, Michèle meets her friend Danielle (Joëlle Marlier) outside the school gate. They join two boys at a café and indifferently make out with them; then Danielle returns to school and Michèle goes to the movies. There, she meets a young man named Paul (Julien Rassam) who brazenly tries to pick her up, and she doesn’t mind. As they kiss, talk, and wander about, he mentions that he’s a deserter from the French Army and has just arrived in Brussels, with nowhere to stay. Michèle has an idea: an adult cousin lives nearby but is out of town; she takes Paul to the cousin’s apartment and they get into bed together. Michèle then leaves him there and meets up with Danielle to head over to a big party, where she has another idea: having concluded that Paul isn’t the man for her but for Danielle, she decides to do something about it.</p>\n<p>The heart of the story involves a romantic epiphany that’s also an unspoken recognition of homosexual desire; Michèle’s matchmaking scheme is a vicarious replacement for something that’s doomed to go unfulfilled. The subtlety of Akerman’s concept and the wry tenderness of her approach are, however, merely a start. The extraordinary achievement of the drama is that it immediately and consistently fulfills the audacious triple dare of its title, being simultaneously about a character, a time, and a place. Michèle comes across as a singular and powerful personality, with something of Akerman’s own trenchant intellect, assertive candor, and vulnerable self-revelation. At the same time, the movie is a thrillingly airy and active vision of Brussels that maps Michèle’s precocious and ambitious temperament onto the cityscape. Moreover, the film is also a vision of a time pregnant with radical change, with Michèle’s dramatic leap off course foreshadowing the imminent crisis of the Francosphere. (This last is a theme of Akerman’s life, too. Born in 1950, she dropped out of high school and, in 1968, made her first film.)</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

At most we catch up for a few miles, like running a night marathon alongside a cargo train, you can’t ask for much more. We don’t decide anything about our love lives either, the quickening adrenaline, the red-hot lava. The long marriage, the holiday camp romance, incestuous desires, in an old people’s home, an asylum, a palliative care center, in a luxury euthanasia clinic, most use the same words to say the same thing: that you die without the faintest idea. What kind of lives would you like to have lived, gentlemen? No idea. What do you regret, ladies? No idea. We could do it all over again and everything would turn out differently. Born in the same bed, to the same mother, the same day, the same year, a different life. I could’ve never been born and everything would be the same. The same house next door with its moles and black currants, the same trees cut back and burned in a bonfire at the first sign of winter. Nobody could answer one simple question: Why did they choose a life of solitude, or one divorce after another, or a marriage that ends in a race to see whose health will be first to take a nosedive? Once again I think about all this fractured nonsense to pass the time while I lift and entwine the grapevines, straighten the stakes, tighten the wires, and sort the buds. The supervisor, the owner’s nephew, oversees all this work. We jump from one bed to the next, from one chair to the next, in intensive care, in the room where they play cards and everyone just shrugs. In the end amnesia does the dirty work that nobody else wants to do and sweeps everything away. Most die in cloud-cuckoo-land; why did they take the path leading this way instead of the one in the opposite direction? They can remember events, when they deserted the army, when they fell for a minor and would secretly meet her in the barn, but they don’t remember why or how, if she had braids, if she had the body of a child, what it was that made them so senile. He continues to supervise me, he watches every move I make as if I were his slave, it’s the 21st century, Hey, I tell him, it’s the 21st century. We cross the canal on foot, on a motorcycle, we head toward the cliff or the waterfall, always wandering, but this is as far as I got, thinking too much about this abstract and useless nonsense makes my movements less precise. It’s time to clock out. Sorry, all good, see you tomorrow. I can’t afford any criticism at work, or to attract any warnings from the boss, it all gets put in my file.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Say there are two poetic traditions, which regard each other with a mixture of boredom, fear, and contempt. The first descends from the confessionalists of midcentury America: Robert Lowell, Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton. It can convey, or assume, a progressive social agenda — exemplified by Adrienne Rich and Sharon Olds — but in form hews to lyric convention, with identifiable speakers and displays of compressed emotion. Today this tradition lives on as the de facto mode of MFA workshops, of most poetry readings, and of <i>I don’t know who needs to hear this but</i> virality. Its most cynical, vitiated form is the aphoristic doggerel of Instapoetry.</p>\n    <p>The second tradition likewise claims an august ancestry. Demanding and dense, it acknowledges Ezra Pound, and adores Gertrude Stein; it nods to Charles Olson, and, sometimes, peers across the Atlantic to J. H. Prynne. The lyric voice is ruptured, evaded, or denied; the vocabulary is often recondite, the allusions and ellipses occasionally impenetrable. This second tradition’s aims and antagonisms were theorized by the first generation of Language poets, who set themselves against what the late Lyn Hejinian called the “coercive, epiphanic mode” of the first tradition. (I’m reminded of William Stafford’s famous poem “Traveling Through the Dark,” whose speaker “thought hard for us all.”) For their part, the epiphanics sometimes disparage these experimental poets — not always unfairly —as an obscurantist and self-congratulatory clique.</p>\n    <p>So goes one story of contemporary Anglophone poetry, much repeated and by now a little threadbare. Plenty of poets don’t fit into either camp; some, like John Ashbery, are claimed by both. And each side’s perceived enemies — the programs and prizes of what Charles Bernstein calls “official verse culture” on the one hand, academics and their insular jargon on the other — were and are far more various than aesthetic warfare requires. If only by inertia, though, the broad outline holds up.</p>\n    <p>In search of significant territory, the conflict often latches onto questions about poetic voice, and about the self, or selves, from which that voice presumably sounds. (Or, as Theodor Adorno put it, the way “the subject sounds forth in language until language itself acquires a voice.”) Language poetry’s inheritors tend to regard any coherent, unitary <i>I,</i> within or outside a poem, as a bourgeois fantasy. Lyric poets might reply that no amount of kooky syntax or pronoun toggling can change the fact that words are put on the page by a real person (or sometimes, but surprisingly rarely, people). But if the argument is about what constitutes human experience, and the poetics and politics of its representation, what do we do with poetry that tries to notice, and even to transcribe, the nonhuman?</p>\n    <p>It’s then no coincidence that environmentally conscious poetry’s rightful place in this tale of two genealogies has never seemed quite clear. The category itself contains a microcosm of that broader division, with the distinction between the lyric and (small L) language traditions more or less mapping onto that between nature writing and ecopoetry. For the first group, think of Wordsworth, “wander[ing] lonely . . . / . . . o’er vales and hills.” Think of Thoreau, striking deep into the woods; of Robert Frost and Wendell Berry; or of the latter-day bestiaries of America’s most popular recent poet, Mary Oliver. Green thoughts in green shades. An exhortation to commune with the natural, for the sake of your soul — if also, somewhere in there, for nature’s sake too.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>To what extent will artificial intelligence revolutionize (derogatory) the lives of the professionally and semiprofessionally literary? Already the technology has barreled through enough creative and commercial sectors to fill a Studs Terkel oral history, threatening mass unemployment events for copywriters, translators, illustrators, sales and customer service representatives, and more. The <i>New York Times</i> assails readers almost daily with appalling stories of AI therapists and AI boyfriends, capturing the paradox of a technology that promises to fix broken systems even as it makes them worse. As social ties fray and mental health infrastructure deteriorates, people turn to AI for emotional support —the same AI that then urges them to kill themselves.</p>\n<p>For those of us working in reading- and writing-heavy fields — chiefly media and academia, the US’s last two eroded islands of institutional intellectual life — the boom in sophistication of large language models over the past few years has struck alarm bells that were already chiming. Well before the inflection point of OpenAI’s 2022 debut of ChatGPT, freelance writers and adjunct instructors were already beset by declining web traffic, stagnant book sales, the steady siphoning of resources from the humanities, and what was hard not to interpret as a culture-wide devaluation of the written word. Then along came a swarm of free software that promised to produce, in seconds, passable approximations of term papers, literary reviews, lyric essays, Intellectual Situations.</p>\n<p>The swarm assembled faster than anyone had anticipated. “If you have not been using AI,” wrote the poet and <i>Yale Review</i> editor Meghan O’Rourke in a <i>Times</i> op-ed this July, “you might believe that we’re still in the era of pure AI ‘slop’ — simplistic phrasing, obvious hallucinations.” ChatGPT’s writing is still merely competent — “no rival for that of our best novelists or poets or scholars,” O’Rourke writes — but it’s “so much better than it was a year ago that I can’t imagine where it will be in five years.”</p>\n<p>How can intellectuals chronicle such a shift — one that threatens their ability to chronicle anything at all? O’Rourke is among a growing group of literary writers who have tried to answer the question in the first person, scoping out artificial intelligence’s encroachments from within the domains it most imperils. Their writing asks what AI-generated writing can or (much less often) can’t do, and how human writers can or (much more often) can’t respond. Call the genre the AI-and-I essay. Between April and July, the <i>New Yorker</i> published more than a dozen such pieces: essays about generative AI and the dangers it poses to literacy, education, and human cognition. Each had a searching, plaintive web headline. “Will the Humanities Survive Artificial Intelligence?” asked Princeton historian D. Graham Burnett. “What’s Happening to Reading?” mused the magazine’s prolific pop-psych writer Joshua Rothman, a couple months after also wondering, with rather more dismay, “Why Even Try If You Have AI?” “AI Is Homogenizing Our Thoughts,” declared Kyle Chayka, with the irony of a columnist whose job is to write more or less the same thing every week using his own human mind. An article by Hua Hsu put it most starkly, seeing the artificial-versus-human intelligence war as all but lost: “What Happens After AI Destroys College Writing?”</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>AI-made material is a waste product: flimsy, shoddy, disposable, a single-use plastic of the mind.</p>\n      <a href=\"\">Tweet</a>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>No topic — not the genocidal war and famine in Gaza, not Trumpian authoritarianism — has magnetized bien-pensant attention this year in the way that AI has. Writing on AI thus comes in every mode: muckraking (“Inside the AI Prompts DOGE Used to ‘Munch’ Contracts Related to Veterans’ Health”), scholastic (“Deep Learning’s Governmentality”), polemical (“The Silicon-Tongued Devil”), besotted (“The AI Birthday Letter That Blew Me Away”). The AI-and-I essay, however, usefully registers a generalized intellectual anxiety. While spoken in the voice of an individual author, each piece in this emergent corpus stages a more collective drama. To read these writers writing about AI writing is to witness, almost in real time, intellectual laborers assimilating a threat to their own existence. The threat looms more distantly for some than for others. But whether or not one enjoys the near-extinct security and legacy prestige of a <i>New Yorker</i> staff job (to spend one’s days “focussing” on the rapid erosion of the life of the mind — the dream!), this work paints a persuasive picture of a world hollowed by machines — a world, the writers suggest, we will all have to learn to live in.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The first and second Trump Administrations have provoked markedly different critical reactions. The shock of 2016 and its aftermath saw a wave of liberal anxiety about the fate of objective knowledge, not only in the United States but also in Britain, where the Brexit referendum that year had been won by a campaign that misrepresented key facts and figures. A rich lexicon soon arose to describe this epistemic breakdown. Oxford Dictionaries declared “post-truth” their 2016 word of the year; Merriam-Webster’s was “surreal.” The scourge of “fake news,” pumped out by online bots and Russian troll farms, suggested that the authority of professional journalism had been fatally damaged by the new hegemony of social media. And when presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway coined the phrase “alternative facts” a few days after Trump’s inauguration in early 2017, the mendacity of the incoming administration appeared to be all but official.</p>\n    <p>The truth panic had the unwelcome side effect of emboldening those it sought to oppose. “Fake” was one of Trump’s favorite slap-downs, especially to news outlets that reported unwelcome facts about him and his associates. A booming MAGA media further amplified the President’s lies and denials. The tools of liberal expertise appeared powerless to hold such brazen duplicity to account. A touchstone of the moment was Hannah Arendt, who observed in <i>The Origins of Totalitarianism</i> that “the ideal subject of totalitarian rule is not the convinced Nazi or the dedicated communist, but people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction . . . no longer exists.”</p>\n    <p>In 2025, the denunciations have a different flavor. To many of us, the central problem is that we live not so much in a time of lies, as one of <i>stupidity</i>. This diagnosis has credibility across the political spectrum. In January, the sinister David Brooks wrote a column for the<i> Times</i> titled “The Six Principles of Stupidity.” The new administration, he wrote, was “behaving in a way that ignores the question: What would happen next?” In March, Hillary Clinton — not, perhaps, ideal counsel — weighed in with an op-ed in the same paper, with the headline “How Much Dumber Will This Get?” “It’s not the hypocrisy that bothers me,” Clinton wrote, “it’s the stupidity.” And in April, the Marxist writer and intellectual Richard Seymour posted an essay on “Stupidity as Historical Force.” In place of Arendt, Seymour quoted Trotsky: “When the political curve goes down, stupidity dominates social thinking.”</p>\n    <p>Trump’s lying is no less constant or blatant than in 2016, but by now it feels familiar, already priced in. What more is there to say about the “war on truth,” a decade into Trump’s political career? Still, at least two aspects of his second administration are newly and undoubtedly “stupid.” One is shambolic incompetence of a degree that led an <i>Atlantic</i> journalist to be accidentally added to a Signal group chat about US military operations, a group whose other members included the vice president and the secretary of defense (it was this debacle that prompted Clinton’s op-ed). A second is an incomprehensible determination to press ahead with policies — such as tariffs and the defunding of medical research — that will do deep harm without any apparent gain, even for Trump’s backers and clients, still less his voters. The spectacle of a prominent vaccine skeptic and wellness crank as secretary of health and human services goes beyond an abandonment of truth; it feels like an assault on human progress. Bans on fluoride in tap water, passed by legislators in Utah and Florida at Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s behest, mark a new hostility to the very concept of public use values. The escalation from Trump One to Trump Two has seen irrationality spread from the deliberative public sphere to flood the veins of government.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>The US deportation machine is rapidly expanding its capacity to terrorize and disappear people. With support from the Trump Administration, masked and unidentified federal agents have been kidnapping people around the country and forcing them into a labyrinth of field offices and detention centers. Much of the response to this cruel reign of terror has focused on Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in major cities — most notably in Los Angeles, where Trump imposed an occupying military force of thousands of National Guardsmen and Marines in June.</p>\n<p>ICE is of course a worthy target for resistance. It is a federal law enforcement agency that increasingly resembles a secret police force, and it’s being used to target political dissidence and arbitrarily detain whomever it wants. Created in 2003, ICE is now poised to become the highest-funded federal police force in US history. But in addition to — and in coordination with — ICE, officers from numerous other agencies are working to abduct people from farms, factories, and the streets of big cities and small towns. The extent to which this expanding federal police state relies on a vast network of jails, prisons, and local police to do its brutal work is often overlooked. The US’s sprawling carceral infrastructure — built up across the land over decades, and designed from the start to dehumanize — enables the capture and deportation of increasing numbers of people. As the federal government deputizes these federal, state, and local agencies to partake in ICE’s work, it remakes existing infrastructure and political relationships in ICE’s image: remakes them, that is, toward fascism.</p>\n<p>A recent raid in rural Kentucky illustrated several features of this transformed and expanded deportation machine. On the afternoon of May 29, 2025, armed federal agents descended on the small city of Harlan in a fleet of black SUVs and a white unmarked van. The agents — employees not of ICE, but of the Drug Enforcement Administration — raided Sazon Steakhouse, a popular Mexican restaurant. According to Jennifer McDaniels, who reported on the raid and its aftermath for the local <i>Tri-City News</i>, the agents handcuffed “an unconfirmed number of individuals . . . and loaded them in an unmarked white van” before driving away. Some people in the Harlan community report that there was a simultaneous raid at El Charrito, a restaurant down the road from Sazon.</p>\n<p>Harlan sits in the coalfield of eastern Kentucky and has been immortalized in popular culture for its history of labor struggle and class warfare. The people of Harlan who gathered in the parking lot of Sazon during the raid were held back by Kentucky State Police and told that the abduction of their neighbors by the DEA was part of “an ongoing drug investigation.” Given Kentucky’s recent status as one of the states most affected by the opioid crisis —and given the state’s distinction of having one of the highest local jail incarceration rates on the planet — the words “ongoing drug investigation” bought DEA agents enough time to abduct a group of workers and leave town unimpeded. In Kentucky, as around the United States, mass criminalization and the jail and prison boom of the past thirty-five years have set the stage for federal police to disappear people in broad daylight.</p>\n<p>McDaniels, the <i>Tri-City News</i> reporter, lives in Harlan County and was on the scene during the raid in May. In the course of her reporting, she was told by a DEA spokesperson that the agents had come to Sazon for a “judicially authorized law enforcement operation pursuant to a drug investigation.” She was also told that the investigation was ongoing, and that there would be no further comment.</p>\n<p>We spoke with McDaniels at Sazon in June. “I don’t like what [these raids] are doing to our community,” she said. “And our local leaders don’t like what it’s doing to our community. We took it personal here. We just really want to know what’s happening . . . and nobody’s telling us.”</p>\n<p>Opacity and confusion are critical tools of the US police state. Collaborations across jurisdiction and scale rely on mystification. McDaniels noted that in the days following May 29, people in Harlan looked through online jail rosters and found that at least thirteen people had been taken from the community and booked into the Laurel County Correctional Center, a county jail seventy miles away on the western edge of eastern Kentucky’s coal country. They saw that the roster listed all the cases as “Immigration,” and that no one had been charged with a drug offense.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p><strong>Microsoft Corp.</strong> today issued security updates to fix more than 80 vulnerabilities in its <strong>Windows</strong> operating systems and software. There are no known “zero-day” or actively exploited vulnerabilities in this month’s bundle from Redmond, which nevertheless includes patches for 13 flaws that earned Microsoft’s most-dire “critical” label. Meanwhile, both <strong>Apple</strong> and <strong>Google</strong> recently released updates to fix zero-day bugs in their devices.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/winupdatedate.png\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>Microsoft assigns security flaws a “critical” rating when malware or miscreants can exploit them to gain remote access to a Windows system with little or no help from users. Among the more concerning critical bugs quashed this month is <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-54918\">CVE-2025-54918</a>. The problem here resides with <strong>Windows NTLM</strong>, or NT LAN Manager, a suite of code for managing authentication in a Windows network environment.</p>\n    <p>Redmond rates this flaw as “Exploitation More Likely,” and although it is listed as a privilege escalation vulnerability, <strong>Kev Breen</strong> at <strong>Immersive</strong> says this one is actually exploitable over the network or the Internet.</p>\n    <p>“From Microsoft’s limited description, it appears that if an attacker is able to send specially crafted packets over the network to the target device, they would have the ability to gain SYSTEM-level privileges on the target machine,” Breen said. “The patch notes for this vulnerability state that ‘Improper authentication in Windows NTLM allows an authorized attacker to elevate privileges over a network,’ suggesting an attacker may already need to have access to the NTLM hash or the user’s credentials.”</p>\n    <p>Breen said another patch — <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-55234\">CVE-2025-55234</a>, a 8.8 CVSS-scored flaw affecting the <strong>Windows SMB</strong> client for sharing files across a network — also is listed as privilege escalation bug but is likewise remotely exploitable. This vulnerability was publicly disclosed prior to this month.</p>\n    <p>“Microsoft says that an attacker with network access would be able to perform a replay attack against a target host, which could result in the attacker gaining additional privileges, which could lead to code execution,” Breen noted.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-54916\">CVE-2025-54916</a> is an “important” vulnerability in <strong>Windows NTFS</strong> — the default filesystem for all modern versions of Windows — that can lead to remote code execution. Microsoft likewise thinks we are more than likely to see exploitation of this bug soon: The last time Microsoft patched an NTFS bug was in March 2025 and it was already being exploited in the wild as a zero-day.</p>\n    <p>“While the title of the CVE says ‘Remote Code Execution,’ this exploit is not remotely exploitable over the network, but instead needs an attacker to either have the ability to run code on the host or to convince a user to run a file that would trigger the exploit,” Breen said. “This is commonly seen in social engineering attacks, where they send the user a file to open as an attachment or a link to a file to download and run.”</p>\n    <p>Critical and remote code execution bugs tend to steal all the limelight, but <strong>Tenable</strong> Senior Staff Research Engineer <strong>Satnam Narang</strong> notes that nearly half of all vulnerabilities fixed by Microsoft this month are privilege escalation flaws that require an attacker to have gained access to a target system first before attempting to elevate privileges.</p>\n    <p>“For the third time this year, Microsoft patched more elevation of privilege vulnerabilities than remote code execution flaws,” Narang observed.</p>\n    <p>On Sept. 3, Google <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-fixes-actively-exploited-android-flaws-in-september-update/\">fixed two flaws</a> that were detected as exploited in zero-day attacks, including CVE-2025-38352, an elevation of privilege in the Android kernel, and CVE-2025-48543, also an elevation of privilege problem in the Android Runtime component.</p>\n    <p>Also, Apple recently patched its seventh zero-day (CVE-2025-43300) of this year. It was part of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/29/whatsapp-fixes-zero-click-bug-used-to-hack-apple-users-with-spyware/\">an exploit chain</a> used along with a vulnerability in the <strong>WhatsApp </strong>(CVE-2025-55177) instant messenger to hack Apple devices. Amnesty International <a href=\"https://x.com/DonnchaC/status/1961444710620303653\">reports</a> that the two zero-days have been used in “an advanced spyware campaign” over the past 90 days. The issue is fixed in iOS 18.6.2, iPadOS 18.6.2, iPadOS 17.7.10, macOS Sequoia 15.6.1, macOS Sonoma 14.7.8, and macOS Ventura 13.7.8.</p>\n    <p>The <strong>SANS Internet Storm Center</strong> has a <a href=\"https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Microsoft%20Patch%20Tuesday%20September%202025/32270/\">clickable breakdown</a> of each individual fix from Microsoft, indexed by severity and CVSS score. Enterprise Windows admins involved in testing patches before rolling them out should keep an eye on <a href=\"https://www.askwoody.com/2025/september-2025-updates-are-out/\">askwoody.com</a>, which often has the skinny on wonky updates.</p>\n    <p>AskWoody also reminds us that we’re now just two months out from Microsoft discontinuing free security updates for Windows 10 computers.

I beg us to put away the decorative gourds and pumpkin spice for just a tiny bit longer. It’s a slippery slope from “hooray, scarves!” and “look at that perfect rainbow of a tree!” to a very long winter where I forget what warmth feels like on my skin and I am beseeching us not to wish it away. Or, I struggle with change? Hm, it’s hard to tell!</p>\n<p><graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/54776341426_aa794e62a2_z.jpg?resize=640%2C427&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"cabbage and halloumi skewers-4\"/><br/>\n<graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/54776576208_eb8ae2330c_z.jpg?resize=640%2C427&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"cabbage and halloumi skewers-3\"/></p>\n<p><br/>\nThese cabbage and halloumi skewers, like me, have their feet in both seasons: a heartier, warming vegetable but with flavors that still taste like weather warm enough to eat outside. If you haven’t grilled cabbage before, you’re in for a treat. Even on the most pathetic gas grill (i.e. mine), the thick leaves get a little sweet, a little smoky, and — as we’ve learned via <a href=\"https://smittenkitchen.com/2025/04/charred-salt-and-vinegar-cabbage/\">this charred salt and vinegar cabbage</a>, <a href=\"https://smittenkitchen.com/2019/11/roasted-cabbage-with-walnuts-and-parmesan/\">this roasted cabbage with walnuts and parmesan</a>, and <a href=\"https://smittenkitchen.com/2022/02/crispy-cabbage-and-cauliflower-salad/\">this crispy cabbage and cauliflower salad</a> — the more char, the better. Thin slices of salty halloumi are threaded between the chunks of cabbage and they, too, taste astoundingly good grilled. The cheese was, in fact, designed for it. Finally, we make an herby, punchy mixture with garlic, lemon, capers, and red pepper and brush it all over and then my husband and I stand in the kitchen and wolf it all down and forget why we’d want to eat anything else for dinner.</p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/54776676740_df7faec667_z.jpg?resize=640%2C427&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"cabbage and halloumi skewers-9\"/>\n    </p>\n<p/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://smittenkitchen.substack.com/s/off-the-menu\"/>The Smitten Kitchen now has two newsletters! <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/smittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/substack-otm-header.jpg?resize=300%2C60&amp;ssl=1\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://smittenkitchen.substack.com/welcome\">The Smitten Kitchen Digest</a>, my many years running Monday newsletter, is for catching up on all things SK: what’s new, announcements, fun things to read, and seasonal menu suggestions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://smittenkitchen.substack.com/p/welcome-to-the-weekly-yap\">The Weekly Yap</a>, my new Friday newsletter, is all about everything off-the-menu and not always about cooking, like what I’m up to, into, great meals out, books, travel, and more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://smittenkitchen.substack.com/subscribe\">Sign up for both (free!) right here.</a>If you’re already a Monday newsletter subscriber, you can add the Friday newsletter via your</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://substack.com/settings\">Substack settings</a>&gt; Subscriptions &gt; The Smitten Kitchen Digest &gt; Slide the toggle next to Off-The-Menu to receive the emails.</p>\n<p/>\n    <p><graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/smittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/staub-smitten-kitchen-rainbow-braiser-square3.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\"/><strong>Big braiser news!</strong> In the 18 months since we launched the Staub x Smitten Kitchen Braiser, nothing has made me happier than seeing how many of you are cooking in it.

Drizzle in 6 tablespoons of the olive oil with the machine running. Taste for seasoning and adjust to taste.</p>\n<p><strong>Assemble skewers:</strong> Cut halloumi block into 1/4-inch slices, then cut each slice in approximately 1-inch flat squares. If your halloumi is breaking a lot, you can soak the block in warm water for 5 to 10 minutes to soften it slightly, making it easier to slice.</p>\n<p>Thread chunks of cabbage and halloumi slices onto skewers, alternating the two for the length of the skewer. Brush skewers lightly with remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Halve your zested lemon.</p>\n<p><strong>Grill the skewers:</strong> Heat your grill to a high temperature. Arrange the skewers across the grill and cook until lightly charred underneath, then turn the skewers to char the next side. Brush the just-grilled parts with the herb oil, continuing to turn the skewers until they’re charred on all sides and you’ve used all of the oil. You can put the lemon halves on the grill as well to grill them. Squeeze the lemon halves over the skewers and enjoy them as soon as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>No grill?</strong> You can arrange the skewers on a baking sheet and run them under your oven’s broiler, turning and brushing them as you would on the grill.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>At least 18 popular JavaScript code packages that are collectively downloaded more than two billion times each week were briefly compromised with malicious software today, after a developer involved in maintaining the projects was phished. The attack appears to have been quickly contained and was narrowly focused on stealing cryptocurrency. But experts warn that a similar attack with a slightly more nefarious payload could lead to a disruptive malware outbreak that is far more difficult to detect and restrain.</p>\n<p>This phishing email lured a developer into logging in at a fake NPM website and supplying a one-time token for two-factor authentication. The phishers then used that developer’s NPM account to add malicious code to at least 18 popular JavaScript code packages.</p>\n<p><strong>Aikido</strong> is a security firm in Belgium that monitors new code updates to major open-source code repositories, scanning any code updates for suspicious and malicious code. In a blog post published today, Aikido said its systems found malicious code had been added to at least 18 widely-used code libraries available on <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\"> NPM</a> (short for) “Node Package Manager,” which acts as a central hub for JavaScript development and the latest updates to widely-used JavaScript components.</p>\n<p>JavaScript is a powerful web-based scripting language used by countless websites to build a more interactive experience with users, such as entering data into a form. But there’s no need for each website developer to build a program from scratch for entering data into a form when they can just reuse already existing packages of code at NPM that are specifically designed for that purpose.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, if cybercriminals manage to phish NPM credentials from developers, they can introduce malicious code that allows attackers to fundamentally control what people see in their web browser when they visit a website that uses one of the affected code libraries.</p>\n<p>According to Aikido, the attackers injected a piece of code that silently intercepts cryptocurrency activity in the browser, “manipulates wallet interactions, and rewrites payment destinations so that funds and approvals are redirected to attacker-controlled accounts without any obvious signs to the user.”</p>\n<p>“This malware is essentially a browser-based interceptor that hijacks both network traffic and application APIs,” Aikido researcher <strong>Charlie Eriksen</strong> <a href=\"https://www.aikido.dev/blog/npm-debug-and-chalk-packages-compromised\">wrote</a>. “What makes it dangerous is that it operates at multiple layers: Altering content shown on websites, tampering with API calls, and manipulating what users’ apps believe they are signing. Even if the interface looks correct, the underlying transaction can be redirected in the background.”</p>\n<p>Aikido said it used the social network Bsky to notify the affected developer, <strong>Josh Junon</strong>, who quickly replied that he was aware of having just been phished. The phishing email that Junon fell for was part of a larger campaign that spoofed NPM and told recipients they were required to update their two-factor authentication (2FA) credentials. The phishing site mimicked NPM’s login page, and intercepted Junon’s credentials and 2FA token. Once logged in, the phishers then changed the email address on file for Junon’s NPM account, temporarily locking him out.</p>\n<p>Aikido notified the maintainer on Bluesky, who replied at 15:15 UTC that he was aware of being compromised, and starting to clean up the compromised packages.</p>\n<p>Junon also issued a mea culpa <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45169794\">on HackerNews</a>, telling the community’s coder-heavy readership, “Hi, yep I got pwned.”</p>\n<p>“It looks and feels a bit like a targeted attack,” Junon wrote. “Sorry everyone, very embarrassing.”</p>\n<p><strong>Philippe Caturegli</strong>, “chief hacking officer” at the security consultancy <a href=\"https://seralys.com\">Seralys</a>, observed that the attackers appear to have registered their spoofed website — npmjs[.]help — just two days before sending the phishing email.

    "body": "<p>In the lead-up to the Minnesota State Fair, a twelve-day fête of starch and fat which marks the end of every summer, the event’s organizers release a highly anticipated list of competitively decadent new fair foods. The débutantes of 2025 included chicken-fried bacon, Grandma Doreen’s Dessert Dog (vanilla ice cream encased in slabs of coffee cake, on a stick), and the Uncrustaburger (with deep-fried peanut-butter-and-jelly Uncrustables instead of a bun). Other new entries painted a picture of Minnesota’s evolving tastes and demographics. Baba’s, a Palestinian American hummus company based in Minneapolis, unveiled the Fawaffle, topped with a generous scoop of tahini butter, cherry tomatoes, and fresh mint. A window run by Minneapolis’s Midtown Global Market sold Somali Street Fries, smothered in stewy, spicy beef <i>suqaar</i>. Between snacks, I sipped a savory dill-pickle iced tea, garnished with a crunchy spear and a zesty Tajín rim.</p>\n<p>The fair dates back to the eighteen-fifties, and was conceived as a showcase of the state’s flourishing agriculture, meant to attract settlers who might have otherwise continued to California. Today it sprawls across a permanent three-hundred-and-twenty-two-acre fairgrounds in St. Paul and draws some two million people a year. Attractions include kitschy traditions such as a butter-sculpting demonstration, in which a master carver crafts a bust of the winner of the annual Princess Kay of the Milky Way pageant, and the Miracle of Birth Center, displaying pens of expectant farm animals. (If you’re lucky, the staff will have just induced an enormous sow.) It’s perhaps most powerful, though, as a smorgasbord of Proustian attachments. Many of the most beloved food venders sell a single, time-honored classic: bubbling-hot, batter-fried cheese curds, as sparkly as nuggets of gold, from a stall called the Mouth Trap; the Corn Roast’s deeply burnished cobs, dunked in melted butter; crispy, wispy sweet-onion rings at Danielson’s &amp; Daughters.</p>\n<p>One vender rules them all: Sweet Martha’s Cookie Jar. You could say, metaphorically, that the streets of the Minnesota State Fair are paved with Sweet Martha’s chocolate-chip cookies. You could say it literally, too. Look down, as you’re tramping around in search of the All You Can Drink Milk stand (three dollars a ticket) or a cup of grilled peaches and cream from the Produce Exchange, and you’re likely to see a sandy, flattened cookie, pounded into the ground by thousands of feet. Sweet Martha’s, which operates three stands at the fair, is more lucrative than any other food purveyor by a huge margin. In 2024, it pulled in nearly five million dollars, more than twice as much as the next most successful vender, Pronto Pups, which sells a variation on a corn dog, dipped in pancake batter. The reason for the debris is not that people are discarding the cookies but, rather, the way they’re sold. Sweet Martha’s cookies are baked to order, then served warm in precariously tall stacks, teetering out of a paper cup, or, better yet, the stand’s signature plastic bucket, which gets loaded with about four dozen cookies despite fitting only three dozen. Veteran fairgoers know to bring ziplock bags to contain the excess, but cookie collateral is inevitable.</p>\n<p>At seven-thirty on the first morning of this year’s fair, I met Sweet Martha herself at one of her stands just before it opened. Martha Rossini, who is short and slight, with dark hair cut into a blunt, chin-length bob, speaks with a pronounced Minnesota accent, all long “O”s. “At this time of day, I go, You know, it is a breakfast food—it has eggs in it!” she said. In 1978, Rossini was a twenty-eight-year-old art teacher when she decided she might try her hand at becoming a fair-food vender. The following year, she founded Sweet Martha’s with her then husband, Gary Olson, and their friend Neil O’Leary, hand-drawing the now iconic mascot: a bashful, knock-kneed cookie with long lashes and red pumps. In the early days, operating out of a small cart, Rossini served the cookies in paper cones, which couldn’t be folded up or stashed in a bag. “I wanted people to have to hold it,” she told me. “They walk down the street, and that’s my marketing.”</p>\n<p>Though each of the Sweet Martha’s stands resembles an average commercial bakery—big, sterile-feeling rooms lined with industrial-sized stand mixers and walk-in ovens—the business has the spirit of a two-week summer camp. Like many of the fair’s venders, Sweet Martha’s is largely staffed by teen-agers. But it also employs a passionate contingent of former teen-agers, who return each summer with extraordinary reliability, sometimes from out of state. As Rossini stowed her purse in a tiny back office, a manager named Katie Atlas was onboarding a new employee, a young woman who fiddled nervously with her necklace. Atlas, who’d been a neighbor of Rossini’s and babysat her kids, worked her first fair in 1994, when she was fifteen. She hasn’t missed one since. “This was probably one of the first places I ever really felt accepted,” Atlas told me. “They valued me for my work ethic, and I became a part of something bigger, and a lot of fun. And so year after year, for me, it’s trying to capture those people who might need a little extra encouragement.”</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>The chairman of the <strong>Federal Trade Commission</strong> (FTC) last week sent a letter to Google’s CEO demanding to know why Gmail was blocking messages from Republican senders while allegedly failing to block similar missives supporting Democrats. The letter followed media reports accusing Gmail of disproportionately flagging messages from the GOP fundraising platform <strong>WinRed</strong> and sending them to the spam folder. But according to experts who track daily spam volumes worldwide, WinRed’s messages are getting blocked more because its methods of blasting email are increasingly way more spammy than that of <strong>ActBlue</strong>, the fundraising platform for Democrats.</p>\n<p>Image: nypost.com</p>\n<p>On Aug. 13, <strong>The New York Post</strong> ran an “exclusive” <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2025/08/13/business/google-caught-flagging-gop-fundraiser-emails-as-suspicious-sending-them-directly-to-spam-memo/\">story</a> titled, “Google caught flagging GOP fundraiser emails as ‘suspicious’ — sending them directly to spam.” The story cited a memo from Targeted Victory – whose clients include the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), Rep. Steve Scalise and Sen. Marsha Blackburn – which said it observed that the “serious and troubling” trend was still going on as recently as June and July of this year.</p>\n<p>“If Gmail is allowed to quietly suppress WinRed links while giving ActBlue a free pass, it will continue to tilt the playing field in ways that voters never see, but campaigns will feel every single day,” the memo reportedly said.</p>\n<p>In an August 28 letter to Google CEO <strong>Sundar Pichai</strong>, FTC Chairman <strong>Andrew Ferguson</strong> cited the New York Post story and warned that Gmail’s parent <strong>Alphabet</strong> may be engaging in unfair or deceptive practices.</p>\n<p>“Alphabet’s alleged partisan treatment of comparable messages or messengers in Gmail to achieve political objectives may violate both of these prohibitions under the FTC Act,” Ferguson wrote. “And the partisan treatment may cause harm to consumers.”</p>\n<p>However, the situation looks very different when you ask spam experts what’s going on with WinRed’s recent messaging campaigns. <strong>Atro Tossavainen</strong> and <strong>Pekka Jalonen</strong> are co-founders at <a href=\"https://www.koliloks.eu/\">Koli-Lõks OÜ</a>, an email intelligence company in Estonia. Koli-Lõks taps into real-time intelligence about daily spam volumes by monitoring large numbers of “spamtraps” — email addresses that are intentionally set up to catch unsolicited emails.</p>\n<p>Spamtraps are generally not used for communication or account creation, but instead are created to identify senders exhibiting spammy behavior, such as scraping the Internet for email addresses or buying unmanaged distribution lists. As an email sender, blasting these spamtraps over and over with unsolicited email is the fastest way to ruin your domain’s reputation online. Such activity also virtually ensures that more of your messages are going to start getting listed on spam blocklists that are broadly shared within the global anti-abuse community.</p>\n<p>Tossavainen told KrebsOnSecurity that WinRed’s emails hit its spamtraps in the .com, .net, and .org space far more frequently than do fundraising emails sent by ActBlue. Koli-Lõks published a graph of the stark disparity in spamtrap activity for WinRed versus ActBlue, showing a nearly fourfold increase in spamtrap hits from WinRed emails in the final week of July 2025.</p>\n<p>“Many of our spamtraps are in repurposed legacy-TLD domains (.com, .org, .net) and therefore could be understood to have been involved with a U.S. entity in their pre-zombie life,” Tossavainen explained in the LinkedIn post.</p>\n<p><strong>Raymond Dijkxhoorn</strong> is the CEO and a founding member of <a href=\"https://www.surbl.org/\">SURBL</a>, a widely-used blocklist that flags domains and IP addresses known to be used in unsolicited messages, phishing and malware distribution. Dijkxhoorn said their spamtrap data mirrors that of Koli-Lõks, and shows that WinRed has consistently been far more aggressive in sending email than ActBlue.</p>\n<p>Dijkxhoorn said the fact that WinRed’s emails so often end up dinging the organization’s sender reputation is not a content issue but rather a technical one.</p>\n<p>“On our end we don’t really care if the content is political or trying to sell viagra or penis enlargements,” Dijkxhoorn said. “It’s the mechanics, they should not end up in spamtraps. And that’s the reason the domain reputation is tempered. Not ‘because domain reputation firms have a political agenda.’ We really don’t care about the political situation anywhere. The same as we don’t mind people buying penis enlargements. But when either of those land in spamtraps it will impact sending experience.”</p>\n<p>The FTC letter to Google’s CEO also referenced a <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2022/04/11/despite-what-fox-news-tells-you-a-new-study-did-not-prove-that-gmail-is-biased-against-conservatives/\">debunked</a> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.16743.pdf\">2022 study</a> (PDF) by political consultants who found Google caught more Republican emails in spam filters. <strong>Techdirt</strong> editor <strong>Mike Masnick</strong> notes that while the 2022 study also found that other email providers caught more Democratic emails as spam, “Republicans laser-focused on Gmail because it fit their victimization narrative better.”</p>\n<p>Masnick said GOP lawmakers then filed both lawsuits and complaints with the <strong>Federal Election Commission</strong> (both of which failed easily), claiming this was somehow an “in-kind contribution” to Democrats.</p>\n<p>“This is political posturing designed to keep the White House happy by appearing to ‘do something’ about conservative claims of ‘censorship,'” Masnick <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/09/04/ftc-chair-fergusons-ridiculous-crusade-threatening-google-over-spam-filters-that-actually-work/\">wrote</a> of the FTC letter. “The FTC has never policed ‘political bias’ in private companies’ editorial decisions, and for good reason—the First Amendment prohibits exactly this kind of government interference.”</p>\n<p>WinRed did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>The WinRed website says it is an online fundraising platform supported by a united front of the Trump campaign, the <strong>Republican National Committee</strong> (RNC), the NRSC, and the <strong>National Republican Congressional Committee</strong> (NRCC).</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Palm-fringed bays are plentiful though there are less genuinely calm swimming beaches on the south and west coasts (and even less standout hotels and resorts located alongside them) as these regions are better known for high quality surfing and body boarding.

    "body": "<p>A filmmaker who wanted to make a politically contentious movie couldn’t do much better than to set it in mid-2020, when the United States, under the <i>covid</i>-19 lockdown and approaching a Presidential election, was tearing itself apart over masking mandates and then over the fallout from the killing of George Floyd. This is precisely what Ari Aster’s recent film “Eddington” does, wading with apparent boldness into a slew of issues that remain divisive even five years on. Strangely enough, though, if he had removed the <i>covid</i> and protest plotlines entirely, the movie would be more or less the same. Its run time might be shorter, but its emotional essence, thematic core, and even the motivations that drive its characters would remain intact. Although the story is steeped in the practicalities of that moment and the controversies they aroused, it’s ultimately driven by something else altogether; namely, sexual humiliation. “Eddington” is a fundamentally manospherical movie, in which the insistence on the politics of <i>COVID</i> and race is little more than facile posturing.</p>\n<p>The film is set in New Mexico, in the fictitious title town—population of two thousand four hundred and thirty-five, according to a road sign—where the election year sees the mayor also up for reëlection. The incumbent, Ted Garcia (Pedro Pascal), who lives in upper-middle-class comfort with his teen-age son, Eric (Matt Gomez Hidaka)—and without his ex-wife, who left him long ago—is intent on enforcing the state’s mask mandate. His nemesis, who impulsively decides to run against him, is the town’s sheriff, Joe Cross (Joaquin Phoenix), who is skeptical of masking. He lives in a cluttered house with his wife, Louise (Emma Stone), an artist, and her mother, Dawn (Deirdre O’Connell), an online obsessive in thrall to QAnon-like conspiracy theorists.</p>\n<p>Joe’s decision to run comes about after two incidents involving social media. First, when Ted holds a town-council meeting in a bar that he owns, Joe is called to remove a ranting homeless man named Lodge (Clifton Collins, Jr.) and is injured in the resulting tussle. Adding insult to injury, Eric and his friend Brian (Cameron Mann) film the incident and plan to post the embarrassing video on social media. Soon after, a video of Joe defying the mask mandate in a local supermarket ends up online and draws praise by denialists. Stoked, Joe announces his candidacy to run against Ted, immediately recording a video and posting it. Then he returns to the station and dubiously insists that his two young deputies, Guy (Luke Grimes) and Michael (Micheal Ward), work on the campaign—starting right now.</p>\n<p>So far, so political. But the conflict between Joe and Ted goes back further and is rooted in a deep loam of backstory that emerges bit by bit. Joe has long believed that his wife, Louise, had a sexual relationship with Ted when she was sixteen. Dawn believes so, too, but Louise denies it. Early in the film, Joe watches a video about persuading a reluctant partner to have a child and then, in bed with Louise, tries to initiate sex. She backs away; it’s clear that she’s been rejecting him for a while. Dawn goads Joe about Ted, suggesting that Louise’s late father, who was also sheriff, would have taken action. Then, while Joe is in his sheriff’s S.U.V., recording a ranty campaign video, Eric rides up on a bike and taunts him, “Tell them about the time my dad dumped your wife.” Later, he’s even nastier: “What about your fucking crazy whore wife?” Joe takes his accusations against Ted public; Louise repudiates them publicly.</p>\n<p>The true politics of “Eddington,” then, are sexual politics. When they result in criminal violence, it becomes clear that the movie’s essence is that of a film noir and that its wider political gestures are just ornamental. The centrality of sexual politics isn’t only dramatic and thematic; it also governs the film’s aesthetic. For the most part, this aesthetic is unremarkable; “Eddington” offers a tightly crafted story filmed with blandly efficient professionalism, saving its most energetic touches for rendering violence with shock and gore. But there is one exception, a scene whose dramatic importance is reflected in a startling inventiveness of composition, and whose stylistic finesse provides a clue about where Aster’s emotional investment lies. It’s the only scene in the movie with a distinctive cinematic identity.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

However, the Eternal City is surprisingly family-friendly despite the dearth of attractions aimed specifically at younger ages. The Colosseum and other Roman ruins are always a hit with kids, while Villa Borghese park offers ample green space for running free, biking or picnicikng on crisp Roman pizza squares. If all else fails, there is always gelato, both as a treat and as a fun hands-on workshop to break up the days of sightseeing. Below, we’ve listed some of the best family hotels in Rome that offer extra space and, often, special services just for little ones.<br/>&#13;\n </p>\n    <h2>How we review</h2>\n    <p><br/>&#13;\nEvery hotel in this curated list has been visited by one of our expert reviewers, who are usually hosted on a complimentary basis.

Even regular visitors will be tempted by something new every time they arrive – a record-breaking museum perhaps, or maybe an entire hipster neighbourhood that seemingly sprang up overnight. So, tick the must-dos off your list – attempting to squeeze all 2,722 feet (828 metres) of the Burj Khalifa into one photograph and sailing a traditional <i>abra</i> (wooden boat) across Dubai Creek, for example – but don’t ever think you’ve done Dubai, because Dubai is always on a mission to outdo itself.

The “Euphoria” star leads Fennell’s upcoming adaptation of Emily Brontë’s novel “<a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/t/wuthering-heights/\">Wuthering Heights</a>” alongside <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/t/margot-robbie/\">Margot Robbie</a>, a project that instantly became the talk of the town when it went out to market in 2024.</p>\n    <p>The <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/t/film/\">film</a> eventually <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/news/breaking-news/emerald-fennell-wuthering-heights-margot-robbie-jacob-elordi-valentines-2026-release-date-1235076380/\">landed at Warner Bros.</a> (despite reports of a more lucrative offer from Netflix for a streaming-only release), which has it slated for a Valentine’s Day weekend 2026 release.\n\n</p>\n    <p>Despite the star power attached on both sides of the camera, “Wuthering Heights” was the source of some controversy when it was first announced. Elordi plays Heathcliff, the romantic anti-hero who is discovered on the streets before being taken in by a wealthy member of Britain’s landed gentry, only to fall in love with their daughter. Language in Brontë’s original novel suggests that the character is non-white (though he has previously been played by the likes of Laurence Olivier, Ralph Fiennes, Timothy Dalton, and Tom Hardy), and many voices online suggested that the role should have gone to an actor of color.</p>\n    <p>The casting director for the film, Kharmel Cochrane, defended the casting choice back in April, saying at a <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/wuthering-heights-casting-director-defends-1235118651/\">Q&amp;A at the Sands Film Festival in Scotland</a> that these things are open to interpretation. </p>\n    <p>“There’s definitely going to be some English Lit fans that are not going to be happy,” Cochrane said. “There was one Instagram comment that said the casting director should be shot. But just wait till you see it, and then you can decide whether you want to shoot me or not. But you really don’t need to be accurate. It’s just a book. That is not based on real life. It’s all art.”</p>\n    <p>Hong Chau, “Saltburn” actor Alison Oliver, and Shazad Latif also star in “Wuthering Heights.”</p>\n    <p>Robbie will next be seen in Kogonada’s “A Big Bold Beautiful Journey,” which she stars in alongside Colin Farrell. Elordi is currently filming Season 3 of “Euphoria” and will soon be seen in Guillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein” and Ridley Scott’s “The Dog Stars.”</p>\n    <p>Warner Bros. will release “Wuthering Heights” in theaters on February 13, 2026. Check out the teaser for the film and the first poster, with the caption “Come Undone.”</p>\n    <blockquote><p>Drive me mad. “Wuthering Heights” comes to theaters Valentine’s Day.</p>— WutheringHeightsMovie (@wuthering_hts)<a href=\"\">pic.twitter.com/n4UNA1nKmh</a><a href=\"\">September 3, 2025</a></blockquote>\n    <blockquote><p>Come undone.

Now the trailer for “<a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/t/men-of-war/\">Men of War</a>” is here.</p>\n    <p>It tells the mysterious saga of Jordan Goudreau, a forty-something Green Beret turned mercenary who accepted $200 million from Venezuelan dissidents to put together a team and attempt the overthrow of Nicolas Maduro’s dictatorial government — possibly with tacit support from the first Trump administration.</p>\n    <p>If this incident, codenamed Operation Gideon, didn’t make a ton of headlines, it was because it occurred in May 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic when attention was very much elsewhere. But those aware of it nicknamed it the Bay of Piglets for the small-scale nonsense of it. Was it ever meant to succeed? Did a skilled operative like Goudreau really think it would? Two of his fellow ex-U.S. Army operatives were captured held for years in Venezuela when the mission inevitably failed.</p>\n    <p>Gatien and Corben tell a gripping story and feature some startling personalities: There’s a Venezuelan dissident in a Miami penthouse who’s obsessed with ninjas who’s particularly memorable — Miami is described as today’s version of “Casablanca,” a place where exiles from all over Latin America gather to plot their comeback, making whatever shady deals are necessary to make their unhinged plots happen, and it definitely comes across that way.</p>\n    <p>You can see why Neon came aboard as distributor: This is a doc meant to inspire obsession, and maybe some awards interest too. Goudreau, in particular, as a fascinating protagonist, from the moments he talks about evading a SWAT team in Boca Raton in the aftermath of Operation Gideon’s failure (the Trump admin, trying to establish its deniability of knowledge of this plot, swiftly moved to arrest him), hopping on a motorcycle and heading to the Mexican border, where he lived in self-exile for years.</p>\n    <p>He’s since returned and awaits trial in Tampa. There may not be a ton of filmmaker distance here, though: the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-maduro-green-beret-jordan-goudreau-6f312dcde47c5da6cf7a54aef8ccdd7e\">AP reports</a> co-director Gatien put up her $2 million Manhattan loft as bond to secure his release before the trial can begin. A source tells IndieWire that Gatien’s bond support was contingent on his participating in a Veterans Affairs program. He is currently living in a VA facility in the Tampa Bay area.\n\n</p>\n    <p>“Men of War” will be available on demand from Neon on Tuesday, September 9.

    "body": "<p><strong>Morocco’s coolest surf town is no longer a secret – but as its popularity booms, the local community is rolling with the tides. </strong> </p>\n<p>For a second, it feels like I’m losing my balance. But my body reacts before I can think, and my feet readjust, sharpening my stance. I squat lower and my arms steady out – to my surprise, I’m actually gliding along the wave as the whitewash roars behind me. This must be that surfer’s high everyone talks about, I think to myself, beaming. When a local surfer stretches out his arm for a high five, I miss, crashing back into the sea with a laugh that bubbles up from nowhere.</p>\n<p>I’m halfway through a lesson with Dar Surf, a surf camp based in Taghazout, <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/morocco\">Morocco</a>. Of course, the waves decide the spot – and it’s rarely on your hostel doorstep. So today we’re a short drive south at Anza Beach, one of countless surf-friendly beaches along Morocco’s Atlantic Coast.  </p>\n<p>Bobbing back to the surface, I catch a glimpse of my instructor, Mohammed Akhermaz – AKA Momo. He throws me a thumbs-up from the lineup, the spot where surfers wait for the next oncoming wave. Like many travellers these days, I had come to Taghazout for the waves and low-key hangouts. But I hadn’t expected to find such a deep sense of community and belonging.</p>\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><strong>An Intrepid trip inspired me to uproot my life and move to Morocco</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>The rise of Taghazout</strong>  </h2>\n<p>Momo grew up in Rabat, Morocco’s capital city about six hours up the coast, and picked up his first surfboard when he was 17 years old. It was a relatively late start in the world of surfing, but one of his best decisions nonetheless. His passion for catching waves led him to become an instructor and he made the move south to Tamraght – Taghazout’s up-and-coming neighbour – five years ago.</p>\n<p>‘Surfing isn’t just a sport,’ he says. ‘It’s a connection between you and the ocean.’</p>\n<p>It’s this feeling of connection that first drew international surfers to Morocco in the early ’60s and ’70s. Once they’d experienced the country’s underrated waves, word soon spread – and it wasn’t long before foreigners were favouring the consistent surf and jaw-dropping scenery in and around Taghazout.</p>\n<p>Surfers from Europe and the United States would stay for months at a time, camping out on the beaches in vans and tents. Slowly, they introduced the sport to the local community. When it was time to move on, they would often leave behind their boards and wetsuits, giving more locals the chance to fall in love with catching waves.</p>\n<p>Once a tiny fishing village, Taghazout became the epicentre of Moroccan surf culture in just a couple of decades. And the rise of homegrown talent like Olympian Ramzi Boukhiam and big-wave surfer Othmane Choufani has further embedded surfing into the region’s identity.</p>\n<p>Today, business is booming; Taghazout’s visitor numbers have jumped 25 per cent in three years and with a multimillion-dollar resort development project well underway, the region is expected to see those numbers continue to grow. While some locals have valid worries about gentrification and rapid change, many see this growth as a positive step.</p>\n<p>‘I don’t remember a time without tourists,’ Momo says. ‘But [the area] has gotten more famous over the last five years. And that’s good for the locals. It gives us a better life.’</p>\n<p>If there’s one way travellers can support Taghazout as it adapts, he adds, it’s to ‘learn about Morocco before you come,’ he says. ‘The number one rule is to respect the culture and the country first.’</p>\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><strong>How I found healing on a group trip to Morocco</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Waves and warm welcomes</strong>  </h2>\n<p>Despite this quick growth, community bonds still run deep in Taghazout. Perhaps that’s because surf culture and Amazigh hospitality echo the same values of generosity, connection and mutual respect. It’s that kind of welcome that keeps people wanting to come back – although I’ve met a few who have simply never left.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to get hooked on that energy. As an introvert, I still found myself drawn into the charismatic nature of the surf herd, cheering when people caught waves and sharing banter with others while I caught my breath at the lineup. Even though I was having a one-on-one lesson with Momo, I was struck by the camaraderie in the water as he gave a few words of encouragement to a lone surfer paddling by. ‘That’s what we do. We share,’ he says, scanning the ocean for the next wave for me to catch. ‘That’s my favourite part. I like to make people happy. Like with you just now, I could see your smile from really far away.’</p>\n<p>Peak surf season is between November and March, but even in July, as I wrestled out of my wetsuit after the session, the lineup remained packed with surfers. Salty and sandy, Momo and I made our way to one of the barefoot beach cafes and plopped down on colourfully-patterned poufs facing the sea. ‘There are always waves,’ Momo says, pointing towards a clean set as we sip our <i>ness ness </i>– Morocco’s signature blend of coffee and milk. ‘A pro would want to surf that.’   </p>\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><strong>The best meal I had on my trip to Morocco had little to do with the food</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Riding the wave</strong>  </h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p><strong>Set-jetting isn’t just a clever play on words. It’s a very real phenomenon.</strong> </p>\n<p>And while travelling through Thailand earlier this year, I saw it in action. Season three of <i>The White Lotus</i>, set in Ko Samui, was airing at the time, so it naturally came up during a pub crawl conversation. ‘I booked this trip as soon as I saw the trailer,’ a new friend shared. ‘I just knew if I were watching it at home, I’d want to be there.’  </p>\n<p>That’s set-jetting in a nutshell: seeing a beautiful location on screen and wanting to experience it in real life. If you’re ready to step into real-life sets, here are some top set-jetting spots (movie metaphors and the occasional bad pun included) and some very Intrepid ways to get there.</p>\n<h2><strong>Move through Matera with more grace than Bond</strong> </h2>\n<p>It’s not often a high-stakes car chase inspires envy, but that’s what a James Bond movie can do. Between the stunts and the suits, <i>No Time To Die </i>spotlights Matera, a UNESCO-listed city in southern <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/italy\">Italy</a>, as a must-visit destination. </p>\n<p>On <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/italy/premium-puglia-160144\">Premium Puglia</a>, things move at a slower pace. Sip wine, stroll through the famous Sassi cave dwellings with a local guide and learn how this ancient city (dating back to the Palaeolithic period – long before Bond) became so iconic. </p>\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><strong>Northern vs southern Italy</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>(Sand)walk in Timothee Chalamet’s footsteps in Jordan  </strong> </h2>\n<p>Shot for IMAX, <i>Dune: Part One </i>and<i> Dune: Part Two </i>make the most of their epic landscapes – and much of what fans see as Arrakis was filmed in Wadi Rum, a protected desert wilderness in <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/jordan\">Jordan</a>. </p>\n<p>On <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/jordan/explore-jordan-159940\">Explore Jordan</a>, you’ll meet the sheikh of a local Bedouin tribe and learn what life is really like in the desert. Dine on traditional zarb, sleep in a simple Bedouin camp and head out on a half-day jeep safari the next morning. The terrain’s vast, the views are unreal and, thankfully, there are no giant sandworms. </p>\n<h2><strong>Cross Canada like Joel and Ellie</strong> </h2>\n<p>Though set in the United States, much of <i>The Last of Us</i> was filmed in <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/canada\">Canada</a>. The post-apocalyptic backdrop of deserted cities and open roads? That’s Alberta. </p>\n<p>On screen, Joel and Ellie trek across America – from Boston to Wyoming – dodging infected humans and wrestling with moral dilemmas. You don’t need to follow in their literal footsteps, but if a cross-country journey’s on your list, <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/canada/canadian-rockies-northern-lights-144879\">Canadian Rockies &amp; Northern Lights</a> gives you the drama (minus the zombies) – all with the safety of a small group and an experienced leader. </p>\n<h2><strong>Transform into someone new in Peru </strong> </h2>\n<p>When a franchise hits its seventh film, it needs to step things up to keep momentum. And <i>Transformers: Rise of the Beasts </i>did precisely that by choosing <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/peru\">Peru</a> as the next place for the Autobots to roam. While the movie received mixed reviews, there’s no denying that Machu Picchu makes the most captivating backdrop.  </p>\n<p>The film shows off Peru’s ancient landscapes, but there’s plenty it doesn’t capture too. On <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/peru/classic-peru-160084\">Classic Peru</a>, go beyond the screen with an experience you won’t find in any franchise. Stop for lunch with the Huilloc community in the Sacred Valley and join in a welcome dance.  </p>\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><strong>The joy of seeing Machu Picchu with the descendants of its builders</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Make Poland not</strong><strong><i> </i></strong><strong>A Real Pain</strong> </h2>\n<p><i/></p>\n<p><i>A Real Pain</i>, starring Jesse Eisenberg and Kieran Culkin, depicts everything a group tour <i>shouldn’t</i> be. Set on a heritage trip to <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/poland\">Poland</a>, the cousins argue in front of strangers, miss train stops and make things awkward for everyone.  </p>\n<p>For a smoother ride, try <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/czech-republic/best-central-europe-159984\">Best of Central Europe</a>. Like the cousins, you’ll visit a former concentration camp on a guided tour led by a local expert – a sobering and important part of the trip. But after that, things lighten up. You’ll continue through the Tatra Mountains and Budapest, with plenty of train connections caught and no dinners ruined by passive-aggressive bickering or gross burps (fingers crossed). </p>\n<h2><strong>Snack like Carmy in Chicago</strong> </h2>\n<p>Forget Smell-O-Vision (it’s a thing, look it up) – watching <i>The Bear </i>makes you wish someone had invented a way to reach into a TV screen and grab the food. While Carmy’s restaurant is fictional, it was inspired by spots that do exist around Chicago.  </p>\n<p>Join a <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/chicago/chicago-food-experience-tour\">Chicago Food Experience Urban Adventure</a> to get your hands on the best Italian beef sandwich, as well as a deep-dish pizza. There’ll be no shouting or stress, just really, <i>really </i>good food, cousin. </p>\n<h2><strong>Step into a K-cinema set in Seoul</strong> </h2>\n<p>Parasite isn’t your typical set-jetting film. Bong Joon-ho’s thriller is all about class division and capitalism; and it’s largely shot inside, showing the disparity between the Park family’s home and that of the Kim family. And yet, it put <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/south-korea\">South Korea</a> on the big screen, becoming the first South Korean movie to win Best Picture at the Oscars. </p>\n<p>Go to Seoul on <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/south-korea/south-korea-highlights-160776\">South Korea Highlights</a>, where Parasite is set, and see the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) – the most famous Korean divide of them all – with your local leader. And if that noodle dish from the movie’s climax makes you salivate, you’ll love the street food tour of the Gwangjang markets.  </p>\n<h2><strong>Channel your inner Luke Skywalker in Tunisia </strong> </h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

But after years of dealing with the fatigue and weakness that comes with long Covid, she didn’t need another achievement ticked off the list. She just wanted to feel like herself again.</strong> </p>\n<p>It was such a small thing.</p>\n<p>I was sitting on the Old City wall in Khiva, <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/uzbekistan\">Uzbekistan</a>, watching the sunset. The heat of the day was dissipating, and I was watching some of the local kids aim a soccer ball at an imaginary goal post. I was a few days into Intrepid’s <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/uzbekistan/central-asia-five-stans-express-160772\">Central Asia: Five Stans Express</a> trip, taking a quiet moment to myself to stop, breathe and drink up my surroundings. </p>\n<p>I scanned the horizon from my perch, having just climbed a short but steep set of stairs up onto the wall. For the average person, it was a feat of ‘nothingness’. But for me, it was a small triumph, a quiet win and a relief. ‘Look at you, legs… look what you just did.’</p>\n<h2><strong>The long road back from long Covid</strong></h2>\n<p>People aren’t worrying about Covid-19 too much these days, but for some of us, it’s ever-present. I developed long Covid in 2022, after contracting the virus for the second time. Besides the foggy memory and myriad other annoyances, I lost complete feeling in my toes and developed a debilitating weakness in my legs. These symptoms started about three weeks after I had recovered from the acute infection. At first, I thought I just needed more rest, or to eat better, but nothing helped in the slightest. I simply grew weaker and weaker and weaker.</p>\n<p>My legs had always been the strongest part of me. They hiked me over mountains in Romania, up to the monastery in Petra and over Dead Woman’s Pass on the Inca Trail. But, for a year and a half, those same legs couldn’t get me around a supermarket. Sometimes I was unable to stand up from a chair, other times they collapsed without warning and I would fall to the ground.</p>\n<p>The journey through long Covid isn’t for the faint of heart. Healing isn’t linear. ‘Crashes’ (the sudden and severe drop in physical or mental energy experienced by many sufferers) can happen at the most inopportune times and would leave me bedridden. I quietly wallowed in despair; there’s an abject loneliness that comes from being unable to participate in community. Before long Covid, I went for daily walks on the beach or through my local park, volunteered on multiple boards and attended concerts and festivals. But all of this had slipped away.</p>\n<p>One of my biggest fears was that I would never travel again. If I couldn’t get up the stairs in my own house, how was I going to be able to get around an airport, let alone a foreign country?</p>\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><strong>The road to Machu Picchu starts at 385 lbs</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>A turning point</strong> </h2>\n<p>In 2024, things finally started to improve. I could take small walks. By small, I mean from the parking lot to the beach and back. And then to the water’s edge and back. Maybe 100 paces. It wasn’t hiking in the Andes, but it was something.</p>\n<p>Then, one day, I was scrolling on Facebook when the Five Stans trip popped up in my feed. I scrolled past it initially, then backed up. You know, I didn’t even want to click on it. I didn’t want to get my hopes up and dream of travel, just to deny myself the privilege. But I clicked.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/turkmenistan\">Turkmenistan</a>! Are you kidding me? SOLD!  </p>\n<p>For decades before the word Covid even existed, the Stans had been a bucket list trip for me. I’d been poring over books about the Silk Road for years, reading about this ancient trade route that was steeped in human history. My soul had been harassing me to go to Central Asia. To be there, walking in the footsteps of Genghis Khan, imagining the 1000-camel caravans pulling into Samarkand, would be a true Carla-esque adventure.</p>\n<p>So, did I have the legs to do it? Honestly, in many ways, it was a huge gamble.</p>\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><strong>78 reasons to book the damn trip</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>From fear to freedom</strong> </h2>\n<p>On my first night in Turkmenistan, I remember lying in bed and thinking, ‘just 25 more sleeps until I can go home.’</p>\n<p>The thought came from a place of fear and uncertainty. The 44-hour journey from my hometown in Nova Scotia to Ashgabat had knocked the stuffing out of me. I felt exhausted and worried – not just about my own ability to complete the trip, but about dragging the group down with me.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>The decentralized finance market faced turbulence this weekend as Aave’s token plunged over 6% following conflicting rumors about its relationship with World Liberty Financial, a DeFi project tied to President Donald Trump’s family. The decline came just as World Liberty Financial’s token, WLFI, debuted in perpetual futures trading with a valuation suggesting a staggering $40 billion market cap.</p><h3><strong>Rumors Lead to Aave Selloff</strong></h3>\n<p>The decline in Aave was due to speculation surrounding a governance proposal, which dated back to October 2024. The proposal stated that Aave will have 7% of the circulating supply of WLFI, and 20% of revenues will be shared when WLFI is deployed on Aave v3.</p><p>There were rumors on social media that this arrangement had been agreed upon. A community post on X revived the old proposal, claiming the allocation was already agreed upon. The rumor quickly spread after Aave founder Stani Kulechov cryptically replied “yes” in the comments and described the speculation as “the art of the agreement”.</p><h3><strong>WLFI Team Issues Denial</strong></h3>\n<p>The WLFI team later issued a firm denial. They said the claim that Aave would receive 7% of WLFI’s supply was “false and unfounded”. The clarification directly contradicted online chatter and created confusion about whether the original proposal was ever formally enacted.</p><p>Traders had already assigned a potential $2.7 billion value to Aave’s supposed WLFI stake, nearly half of Aave’s own fully diluted valuation. Despite the denial, the buzz drove sharp volatility in Aave’s token price, which first spiked by more than 7% before tumbling. The token swung from a high near $385 down to $339. It currently trades at $329.</p><h3><strong>World Liberty Financial Gains Traction</strong></h3>\n<p>While Aave dealt with the rumors, attention turned to World Liberty Financial itself. The project announced it would unlock tokens for early investors on September 1. These tokens were sold at $0.015 and $0.05 in earlier funding rounds. Investors will be able to redeem 20% of their holdings through an on-chain compliance system called the Lockbox.</p><p>The perpetual futures debut on Binance, Bybit, and OKX, valuing WLFI at around $0.42. This price implied a fully diluted valuation of more than $40 billion, based on the token’s total 100 billion supply.</p><h3><strong>Trump-Linked WLFI Tests Politics and Regulation</strong></h3>\n<p>The project’s ties to President Trump have stirred political debate. Some Democrats argue his involvement presents conflicts of interest, particularly after he signed the GENIUS Act in July. The legislation created the first comprehensive stablecoin regulatory framework in the United States. Opponents say provisions intended to limit conflicts were weakened during negotiations.</p><p>Even with the criticism, WLFI’s launch is seen as a major test for the intersection of politics and crypto innovation. The unlocking of the tokens will be the first time early investors will be allowed to trade their holdings. In addition, it is likely to define how politically-linked blockchain projects will perform under the U.S. regulatory framework.</p><h3><strong>Aave Expands as Governance Rumors Rock Market</strong></h3>\n<p>These developments happen amidst a revived momentum in decentralized finance. The total value locked in protocols is now more than $167 billion. It is gradually moving near the December 2021 record level of nearly $212 billion.</p><p>Aave is also expanding, most recently launching on Aptos as a part of its multi-chain expansion strategy. Nevertheless, the rumors about WLFI indicate how governance and political affiliations can quickly influence the sentiment in the market.</p><h3><strong>Trump’s WLFI Mints $205M Stablecoins</strong></h3>\n<p>Earlier, World Liberty Financial minted $205 million of its USD1 stablecoin following a speech by Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller. Waller praised stablecoins as strengthening the dollar’s global role. The mint lifted the USD1 circulating supply to $2.4 billion.</p><p>This marks the largest increase since April, signaling growing confidence in the project’s stablecoin strategy. USD1 has become the world’s sixth-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, trailing Tether and USDC.</p><p>Waller called stablecoins a tool to improve retail and cross-border payments. SEC Chair Paul Atkins echoed support, describing the GENIUS Act as a landmark for U.S. crypto regulation. The project’s treasury had grown to $548 million, its largest value ever, with stablecoins now being its largest asset.</p></body>\n</html>",

What would President Zelenskyy wear to the Oval Office?</p>\n    <p>Last February, Ukraine's president wore a black Henley shirt to the White House, no jacket, keeping the bunker-chic look he's maintained since the 2022 Russian invasion. But the meeting got combative.</p>\n    <p>President Trump chastised President Zelenskyy as ungrateful for U.S. support. A reporter for a right-wing cable channel called out, \"Why don't you wear a suit? You're at the highest level in this country's office, and you refused to wear a suit… do you own a suit?\"</p>\n    <p>President Trump ended the meeting and said of the Ukrainian president on social media, \"He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office.\"</p>\n    <p>This week, President Zelenskyy changed his look. He wore a black canvas blazer over a black collared shirt, buttoned at the top. Still no tie — but his solemn clothing seemed to proclaim: let's have a serious conversation.</p>\n    <p>Even the reporter who panned his February wardrobe told Zelenskyy he looked \"fabulous.\" President Trump added, \"I said the same thing.\" President Zelenskyy told the reporter, \"And you're in the same suit. You see, I changed, you have not.\"</p>\n    <p>Yes, men can get weary of being judged by the cut of their clothes, not the cut of their jibs.</p>\n    <p>Sam Schube, who covered the fashion aspect of the Oval Office meeting for <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> told us, \"I'm not sure there's such a thing as a non-political outfit — everything politicians wear, no matter how bland, sends a message.\"</p>\n    <p>Winston Churchill famously wore an air-raid suit when he visited the White House in December, 1941, just after the United States had been attacked at Pearl Harbor. It reminded Americans that Britons were being bombed in their homes, and Europe faced a life-or-death crisis.</p>\n    <p>Sam Schube says President Zelenskyy has been working with a Ukrainian designer so that his clothing in public appearances, \"blends his wartime style with something a bit more formal. He looks like he's dressing not just for battle, but high-stakes endgame diplomacy.\"</p>\n    <p>Zelenskyy called this week's White House visit \"the best one\" yet. The clothes may not make the man — but they might help make for a better meeting.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p><strong>On a small group adventure in Turkey, Meghan and her fellow travellers experience a welcome – and some award-winning baklava – that moves them all to tears.</strong></p>\n<p>We all giggled when JD started crying. Again. We couldn’t help it.</p>\n<p>‘Oh, no,’ he laughed as soon as the tears started to pool, and I laughed as all of us started tearing up with him.</p>\n<p>It had become a thing on this trip – these unexpected moments of emotion bubbling up out of nowhere. But they weren’t really out of nowhere. JD’s tears came when something real truly hit – a story shared, a connection made.</p>\n<p>Like the day before when we visited a family-run pottery shop and learned about the 4000-year-old craft. Overwhelmed by the tradition having survived for generations, he connected with the craftsmen through his emotions. But in this moment it wasn’t just him. Rhem’s eyes glassed over, mine stung and our leader, Elif, wiped her cheek.</p>\n<p>Nuray, our host, smiled as we reached for our napkins. ‘It’s the onions,’ she teased, motioning to her kitchen.</p>\n<p>JD, Rhem, Elif and I were five days into our <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/turkey\">small group trip in Turkey</a>, which included a visit to Nuray’s home for a home-cooked meal. I spent the last eight years dreaming of one day staying in a cave hotel in <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/turkey/cappadocia\">Cappadocia</a>, and here I was sitting in someone’s cave home? Of course I was feeling emotional. </p>\n<h2>Turkey trips that might move you to tears</h2>\n<p>Sitting on Nuray’s worn sofa, my toes curling on a well-trodden carpet, I took a deep breath. Family photos lined the wall and the smell of slow-simmered tomato and garlic still lingered in the air. Rhem’s shoulders slowly lowered from her ears. It felt like our trip had been moving at full speed, but in this moment, time seemed to slow down.</p>\n<p>Feeling comfortable can make you feel vulnerable. There’s something special about being comfortable enough to allow your walls to fall and your emotions to show. And now here we were, five people who had been strangers just moments before, crying over baklava.</p>\n<p><strong>Read more:  Travelling through grief: How I found healing on a group trip to Morocco</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Before the baklava </strong></h2>\n<p>An hour earlier, our van weaved through Cappadocia’s honeycombed rock formations and tourist-packed streets full of souvenir shops before making a sharp turn up a quiet street. We hopped out at the bottom of the hill and started our ascent as cicadas buzzed, dust collected on our sandals, sweat pooled down my back and I regretted wearing a light-coloured shirt.</p>\n<p>Elif pushed open the creaking gate that brought us to our host’s home where we would be sharing lunch together. We walked through the stone courtyard to a home made out of volcanic tuff – a light rock built into the landscape. Surrounded by plants and standing in front of the doorway covered by a white curtain blowing in the wind, Nuray stood on the threshold. Her smile was already reaching her eyes before a word was spoken, and we all found ourselves instantly smiling, too.</p>\n<p>She greeted us like we were longtime friends coming over for lunch with a warm, soft hug that reminded me of my mom as her hand rubbed my back in greeting. Having spent the last three weeks away from home, I leaned into that feeling .</p>\n<p>We weren’t the first guests she’s welcomed into her home, but she made us feel like we were. Her excitement was palpable and made us feel special as she ushered us inside, her smile never fading.</p>\n<p>‘Intrepid comes into my home and I am very, very happy,’ she beamed. Nuray credits her beautifully spoken English to having welcomed Intrepid travellers into her home for the last 12 years. In an effort to tackle gender disparity in Turkey, Intrepid engages local, self-employed women to host activities, and now Nuray gets to share a piece of her home, her family and her culture with people from around the world.</p>\n<h2><strong>A mother on the road </strong></h2>\n<p>Elif had had an extra pep in her step that morning, energised for us to finally meet Nuray after having told us so much about her.</p>\n<p>‘It’s very special, this visit,’ she kept sharing.</p>\n<p>It was Eid al-Ahda, a holiday typically spent with family and loved ones sharing grape leaves and baklava, but Elif was spending her holiday with us. Elif and Nuray hugged for a long time and Elif’s eyes watered a bit – I realised this was her family on the road.</p>\n<p>And for JD, it felt the same.</p>\n<p>It’s been years since JD lived in his home country of New Zealand with his family, and he had been struggling with that distance leading up to this trip. Stepping into Nuray’s gave him the sense of home and familiarity he’s been craving.</p>\n<p>‘I almost felt like her kids were bringing friends over to stay the night, or that we were part of the family and had been there before,’ he tells me later when we reflect on the day. ‘It just felt comfortable, easy and safe. I needed that.’</p>\n<p><strong>Read more:  A first-timer’s guide to Turkish hamams</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Food is how love travels through time</strong></h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

I’m contractually obligated to tell a meandering and infuriatingly irrelevant story in each headnote, keeping you from the recipe as long as possible for nefarious, possibly witchy, purposes, and I don’t want to disappoint. Next week, I’ll be celebrating my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/52567411\">20th wedding anniversary</a> with a guy I met because I wrote some rambling things on a blog about, like, dating and New York City and funny things that had happened, he read it, we went for a drink, I stopped dating, needed a new subject to fill the void, and Smitten Kitchen came to be one year later.

We still like to have people over, still like to go out, still love Paris and New York, and — here it comes, the actual point! — he’s still trying to convince me to put chocolate in more recipes. In 2014, he successfully lobbied for me to <a href=\"https://smittenkitchen.com/2014/03/double-chocolate-banana-bread/\">put chocolate in my banana bread</a>, and from a glance at the 899-long comment section, it sounds like you’re glad he did.

I recommend picking a school in your area, or perhaps where you grew up, or searching the descriptions for classrooms that might focus on something particularly meaningful to you. Help out if you feel you’re able. There is no purchase too small to unquestionably make a teacher’s (and their students’) day. Plus, buying crayons, pencils, and books that help kids learn and succeed feels really good.

We met a 10-year-old boy named Manicu Vashku. He was so small and quiet and wide eyed and sweet. Ted took to him immediately. The story Ted wrote about our trip was spare and matter of fact and kept returning to the children: how silent they were, how confused they seemed, how obedient they were.\"</p>\n    <p>Their story, by the way, would win a Peabody Award.</p>\n    <p>Ted and Neenah joined workers from Save the Children as they brought Manicu to his aunt, in a village shattered by war.</p>\n    <p>\"When it was time to leave, Ted gave Manicu notebooks and pens and told him to study hard.\"</p>\n    <p>\"I'm so glad I got to go there with Ted,\" Neenah Ellis told us. \"He always had a reverence about him.\" Ted Clark was that exceptional journalist — and that rare soul — who always tried to find ways to help.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

My boyfriend works at Anthropic. See </i>\n      <u>my full ethics disclosure here</u>\n      <i>.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Last week, OpenAI reached out to offer an unusual opportunity: a chance to talk with CEO Sam Altman and other OpenAI executives on the record over dinner in San Francisco.</p>\n    <p>The company has had a tumultuous week. GPT-5, a new family of models introduced into ChatGPT last week, <a href=\"https://www.platformer.news/gpt-5-launch-release-reviews-impressions/\">is clearly superior to past OpenAI models at coding, creative writing, and other tasks</a>. It's also notably faster in many cases, and seems to hallucinate less. </p>\n    <p>At the same time, the launch of the models — and the decision to immediately cut off access to GPT-4o and other predecessors — triggered <a href=\"https://www.platformer.news/gpt-5-backlash-openai-lessons/\">the largest user backlash in the company's history</a>.</p>\n    <p>The company has spent the past week reversing many of its initial decisions, restoring access to previous models and increasing rate limits on more compute-intensive reasoning models for paying users. It has also begun to reckon in public with the evidence that some users have developed powerful emotional attachments to their models, suggesting new safety risks that the company has said it will take into account when updating its products in the future.</p>\n    <p>In any case, I said yes to dinner.</p>\n    <p>On Thursday evening, I joined nine other reporters at Dalida, a Mediterranean restaurant in San Francisco. Altman was joined by OpenAI's chief operating officer, Brad Lightcap; its head of ChatGPT, Nick Turley; and members of its communications team. Dinner was on the record; executives made some additional off-the-record comments over dessert. For the most part, though, executives answered every question we asked.</p>\n    <p>(Under our <a href=\"https://www.platformer.news/ethics/\">ethics policy</a>, I typically pay for my own expenses related to work events like this. But given the awkwardness of trying to pay for my portion of dinner in this case, I instead donated $200 to the <a href=\"https://cpj.org/?ref=platformer.news\">Committee to Protect Journalists</a>, which promotes press freedom and supports journalists under siege.)</p>\n    <p>I've been to more than my share of tech-related dinners over the years, but none quite like this one. Typically, tech companies only make their CEOs available like this in a strictly off-the-record capacity, if they make them available at all. In that sense, OpenAI's invitation came as a breath of fresh air — even if the company is clearly doing damage control after a rocky launch.</p>\n    <p>The restaurant was loud, and my phone struggled to pick up some of the conversation. So if the quotes here are shorter than you might expect, it's because I'm relying on the handwritten notes I took as a backup.</p>\n    <p>In any case, enough preamble — here's what I learned.</p>\n    <h3>On GPT-5</h3>\n    <p><strong>Altman says the company has learned its lesson about abruptly cutting off model access. </strong>\"I think we definitely screwed some things up in the rollout,\" he said. The company assumed just about everyone would be happy to get an upgraded model, and didn't consider the parasocial relationship that some segment of its user base had developed with GPT-4o and other models.</p>\n    <p><strong>But the number of people with intense relationships with individual models is still small, he said. </strong>Referring to forums like Reddit's <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MyBoyfriendIsAI/?ref=platformer.news\">r/MyBoyfriendIsAI</a>, Altman said: \"it's a very small percentage of people who are in the parasocial relationships.\"</p>\n    <p><strong>He himself is not one of them.</strong> Asked whether he experienced any grief over the loss of GPT-4o, he said: \"I had not an ounce of that.\"</p>\n    <p><strong>OpenAI revenue continues to grow despite the controversy.</strong> Revenue from the company's API roughly doubled in the first 48 hours after GPT-5 came out, Altman said.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>I</strong>\n    </p>\n<p/>\n    <p>The humans call the road <i>boca del lobo </i>after a wolf mouth because there is so much blood. The wolf mouth is man-made. The grief is wild, carnivore. People were <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/29/us/san-antonio-migrant-truck-deaths/index.html\">left to perish</a> in a semi-truck in <i>la boca del lobo</i>, Texas in 2022. Each loss has a human name. To have been named is to have been seen, held, loved.</p>\n<p>Faraway, the wolves howl at the super blood wolf moon while U.S. citizens install miles of concertina wire along the Rio Grande. The elegant sound of the word “concertina” denotes a range of meanings: a squeezebox musical instrument that is part of the accordion family (even a musical instrument belongs to a family), whose bellows expand and contract so that the middle appears to collapse on itself; an action meaning, per the Cambridge Dictionary, “to fold, crush, or push together.”</p>\n<p>The sharp-bladed concertina wire spirals along the riverbank while in the deep waters the floating barrier bobs and curves, a gigantic snake body with a long flexible spine. The <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/buoys-texas-immigration-rio-grande-mexico-522e45febd880de1453460370043a25f\">neon orange buoys</a> are connected, webbing anchored to the riverbed. The purpose of the floating barrier is to deter migrants, to dislodge humans. The <a href=\"https://www.concertina-wire.org/concertina-wire/concertina-fence.html\">security defense marketing copy</a> for concertina wire says that its purpose is to “prevent entry of enemies or animals,” to complement immigration policies that crush and collapse the middle through displacement and separation of families.</p>\n<p>The soaked and sacred footsteps of children, all flesh and fabric <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2023/07/21/texas-floating-border-wall-children-slashed-by-razor-wire/70447906007/\">caught</a> in the riverbank’s teeth. The river’s waters whisper: <i>Children are sacred. Children are sacred. Children are sacred</i>.</p>\n<p>Even the inanimate concertina wire recognizes the cruelty and asks to be swallowed deep into the belly of the earth. The earth hears the prayer of the concertina wire: <i>I’ll come for you. I’ll put an end to this. You were meant to do something greater than hurt children seeking safety at a border.</i></p>\n<p>One of the men <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/texas-border-razor-wire-fainting-7aa811baf2708b89a0316804c3f2e35e\">heard</a> the cacophony of the river song, the concertina wire’s prayer, the earth’s promise, the children’s cries. He couldn’t get the song out of his head. At some point in his workday, he sent an extraordinary email from an ordinary computer to shine a flashlight into the river’s razor-sharp man-made mouth. I imagine the water flooded, soft and fresh to cool his ankles. His shoes squeaked as he walked water-logged down the hall. The news broke. The water broke. The hearts broke. Everyone and everything implicated in the brokenness. Man-made; man-destroyed. Whistle blown.</p>\n<p/>\n    <p>***</p>\n<p/>\n    <p>In 2019, I often crossed paths with the same person on my daily bus commute to downtown Portland. One morning I mouthed, “Thank you” when I saw them on the street holding a sign: <i>Children Do Not Belong In Cages</i>. I saw them on my lunch breaks alone in the middle of the plaza as people wolfed down food from nearby carts. This person held their sign, rain or shine: <i>Children Do Not Belong In Cages</i>. Their strong arms reminded me amidst all the noise and self-focused hurry that children were <a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/spike-unaccompanied-child-arrivals-proves-enduring-challenge\">detained in cages</a>, separated from their parents. Sunshine pulsed over my skin as I imagined the fear of children. <i>Children are sacred. </i></p>\n<p>Two decades ago, in the early aughts, I had seen children heavy with fear while working as a bilingual case manager supporting families in domestic violence shelters, in both San Francisco and Los Angeles. Many had fled violence in their home countries only to find it in the United States. Magda lived in the shelter where I worked. When Magda crossed the border she hid in a body of water overnight. The water was up to her neck. The water was cold. The water kept her safe. She shivered then, in the body of water, and again, in the remembering. Her eyes watered. Mine did too.</p>\n<p>People who don’t understand the complexity of domestic violence ask, about those who remain, “Why do they stay? Why don’t they leave?” And those who don’t understand the necessity of migration ask, about those who flee, “Why don’t they stay? Why do they leave?” I’m not sure those who ask even want answers or are prepared to listen. They’d rather the river drown out the sounds.</p>\n<p>I could point to the pervasiveness of femicide and gender-based violence, or to domestic violence lethality indicators and statistics that confirm how leaving is the most dangerous time. I could run through the <a href=\"https://www.thehotline.org/identify-abuse/power-and-control/\">Power and Control Wheel</a>, a domestic violence pie chart with factors related to intimidation, isolation, economic and emotional abuse, and the use of children as pawns by parents. For undocumented families, the absence of citizenship and residency privileges <a href=\"https://www.theduluthmodel.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Power-and-Control-Tactics-Used-Against-Immigrant-Women.pdf\">increases danger</a>. At the border, families who flee violence on foot are met with <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/02/the-right-to-seek-asylum-does-not-exist-at-u-s-mexico-border/\">military tactics</a> and those who make it to safety are met with policies and people who scream, “Go back to where you came from!”</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>It all started when the Ministry of Equality implemented its Diversity Program. I’d been out of a job since forever and the new law made it compulsory for all companies to diversify their staff. Things were getting pretty desperate, so I was immediately drawn to the first listing I saw on the government website: LOOKING FOR A FLEXIBLE JOB OUTDOORS? LIKE TO WALK? MAKE MONEY WHILE STRETCHING YOUR LEGS<i>. </i>I was surprised that El Cobrador del Frac still existed because it had been a long time since I’d seen one of their debt collectors, the guys in coattail suits and top hats. Anyway, it was better than being a cashier in a supermarket, sitting on my ass all day, getting headaches from the fluorescent lights and the small talk about vouchers and seasonal discounts. So I applied.</p>\n<p>On the day of the interview, I was very nervous. It didn’t help that the walls were covered in hunting trophies. Everywhere I looked, a dead animal. Goats, lions, rabbits. A bull. “The CEO is a successful hunter,” said Pedro, the manager, while</p>\n<p>I stared at his nose because he was cross-eyed. The whole process was quick. None of the other women who showed up had a driver’s license, so they gave me the job on the spot. Pedro congratulated me. He said I was the first woman in history to be a Cobrador Del Frac—or in my case, a “Cobradora.” “You’re making history!” he said.</p>\n<p>Pedro went over everything with me: On my first day at the job, I’d show up to change into my uniform, study the files on the debtor I was supposed to track down, and then grab the keys to one of the company cars. Except instead of “the debtor,” they said, “the individual.” This made me chuckle, but I noticed it bothered Pedro, so I cut it out. I didn’t want him to think that I was laughing at him. Because of his eyes, I mean.</p>\n<p>One of the things I was most excited about was the uniform, but when I asked about it, Pedro said we had to buy our own. He told me to see it “as an investment,” a tool of the trade. Noticing my disappointment, he said he’d lend me one for the time being. We left his office and walked through a large room of cubicles until we reached a closet where the agency kept all its promotional pens, brochures, and spare top hats. All the office workers stared at me. For some reason, they looked pale and sad, almost defeated. I don’t think they were happy to see me. This had been a male-only environment since its founding in 1978. My presence announced the beginning of the end. I didn’t blame them. They were right.</p>\n<p>The only uniform available was a size XXL, but Pedro said it didn’t matter so long as I didn’t trip over the pants and the top hat didn’t block my vision. Besides, he said, after I got the commission from my “first catch,” I’d be able to buy one that fit—maybe in a kid’s size, which was cheaper anyway. “Women always have it easier,” he said. I was about to tell him that wasn’t true, but I just nodded and said, “thanks.” “Remember, you’re the first one! You’re making history!”</p>\n<p>I exited the offices onto Calle de Orense feeling like I was on top of the world.</p>\n<p>That was about it for the day. I pinned the hem of the pants and practiced walking around my apartment wearing the uniform. I chased my cat Lila and told her that she owed me money, and that she hadn’t paid rent in her whole fucking life.</p>\n<p>That night, I could barely sleep. My stomach was full of butterflies, just like before the first day of school after a long summer. In the morning, I woke up before my alarm went off.</p>\n<p/>\n    <p>*</p>\n<p/>\n    <p>I arrived at the office the next day, changed into the suit, grabbed the paperwork on the “individual,” and drove away in the company car. I didn’t have any information on the debtor besides his address and the name of an obscure company called Varsovia LLC. As soon as I got there, I noticed that the address was just a sad looking storefront where the glass had been covered by a myriad of different peel-and-stick window stickers, which didn’t look promising at all. If the individual didn’t show up, I’d be stuck waiting for the entire shift—which sucked.</p>\n<p>Walking up and down the street I quickly learned that one of the worst parts of the job was that everyone hated me. I went into a café to pee, and they threw me right back out into the street chasing me with a broom, which tested my ability to run in such an oversized suit. To wear the uniform of the <i>cobrador </i>was to become a leper. Nobody wanted to be anywhere near me. Children would stick their tongues out at me, and their mothers would speed past. Most people were afraid that I was hunting them down. From the girl who shoplifted a dress from Zara to the lady who had forgotten to pay her electricity bill, everyone ran away from me.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

The co-first authors are <strong>Shaokun Zhang</strong> of Penn State University and <strong>Ming Yin</strong> of Duke University.</p>\n<p>In recent years, LLM Multi-Agent systems have garnered widespread attention for their collaborative approach to solving complex problems. However, it’s a common scenario for these systems to fail at a task despite a flurry of activity. This leaves developers with a critical question: which agent, at what point, was responsible for the failure? Sifting through vast interaction logs to pinpoint the root cause feels like finding a needle in a haystack—a time-consuming and labor-intensive effort.<br/> <br/>This is a familiar frustration for developers. In increasingly complex Multi-Agent systems, failures are not only common but also incredibly difficult to diagnose due to the autonomous nature of agent collaboration and long information chains. Without a way to quickly identify the source of a failure, system iteration and optimization grind to a halt.<br/> <br/>To address this challenge, researchers from <strong>Penn State University</strong> and <strong>Duke University</strong>, in collaboration with institutions including <strong>Google DeepMind</strong>, have introduced the novel research problem of <strong>“Automated Failure Attribution.”</strong> They have constructed the first benchmark dataset for this task, <strong>Who&amp;When</strong>, and have developed and evaluated several automated attribution methods. This work not only highlights the complexity of the task but also paves a new path toward enhancing the reliability of LLM Multi-Agent systems.</p>\n<p><br/>The paper has been accepted as a <strong>Spotlight presentation at the top-tier machine learning conference, ICML 2025</strong>, and the code and dataset are now fully open-source.<br/>Paper：<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00212\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00212</a><br/>Code：<a href=\"https://github.com/mingyin1/Agents_Failure_Attribution\">https://github.com/mingyin1/Agents_Failure_Attribution</a><br/>Dataset：<a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/Kevin355/Who_and_When\">https://huggingface.co/datasets/Kevin355/Who_and_When</a><br/> <br/> <strong>Research Background and Challenges</strong><br/>LLM-driven Multi-Agent systems have demonstrated immense potential across many domains. However, these systems are fragile; errors by a single agent, misunderstandings between agents, or mistakes in information transmission can lead to the failure of the entire task.<br/>Currently, when a system fails, developers are often left with manual and inefficient methods for debugging:<strong>Manual Log Archaeology</strong> : Developers must manually review lengthy interaction logs to find the source of the problem.<strong>Reliance on Expertise</strong> : The debugging process is highly dependent on the developer’s deep understanding of the system and the task at hand.<br/> <br/>This “needle in a haystack” approach to debugging is not only inefficient but also severely hinders rapid system iteration and the improvement of system reliability. There is an urgent need for an automated, systematic method to pinpoint the cause of failures, effectively bridging the gap between “evaluation results” and “system improvement.”</p>\n<p><strong>Core Contributions</strong><br/>This paper makes several groundbreaking contributions to address the challenges above:<br/>1.<strong> Defining a New Problem</strong>: The paper is the first to formalize “automated failure attribution” as a specific research task. This task is defined by identifying the <strong>failure-responsible agent</strong> and the <strong>decisive error step</strong> that led to the task’s failure.<br/>2. <strong>Constructing the First Benchmark Dataset: Who&amp;When</strong> : This dataset includes a wide range of failure logs collected from 127 LLM Multi-Agent systems, which were either algorithmically generated or hand-crafted by experts to ensure realism and diversity. Each failure log is accompanied by fine-grained human annotations for:<strong>Who</strong>: The agent responsible for the failure.<strong>When</strong>: The specific interaction step where the decisive error occurred.<strong>Why</strong>: A natural language explanation of the cause of the failure.</p>\n<p>3. Exploring Initial “Automated Attribution” Methods : Using the Who&amp;When dataset, the paper designs and assesses three distinct methods for automated failure attribution:<br/>– All-at-Once: This method provides the LLM with the user query and the complete failure log, asking it to identify the responsible agent and the decisive error step in a single pass. While cost-effective, it may struggle to pinpoint precise errors in long contexts.<br/>– Step-by-Step: This approach mimics manual debugging by having the LLM review the interaction log sequentially, making a judgment at each step until the error is found. It is more precise at locating the error step but incurs higher costs and risks accumulating errors.<br/>– Binary Search: A compromise between the first two methods, this strategy repeatedly divides the log in half, using the LLM to determine which segment contains the error. It then recursively searches the identified segment, offering a balance of cost and performance.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p><strong>On a Women’s Expedition, Cliona learns about the realities of menstruation in some parts of Nepal – and meets the women working to change the narrative.</strong> </p>\n<p>I bury my face in a pile of still-warm T-shirts and leggings as I sort through my freshly washed laundry. Nothing beats the sweet, soapy scent of clean clothes after a week of trekking.</p>\n<p>As I shake out the last of the bag, a pair of period undies falls on the floor. I pick them up and hold them out in front of me. They look familiar. My size. But they’re not mine. So I send a quick message to the group chat:</p>\n<p>‘Morning! Is anyone missing a pair of black period undies? I picked them up in the launderette in Pokhara.’</p>\n<p>It’s no big deal. Just a mix-up. But a few days later, I’d see that stray pair of underwear in a whole new light.</p>\n<p>I’m on Intrepid’s <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/nepal/nepal-womens-expedition-160342\">Women’s Expedition in Nepal</a> – a trip designed to let travellers experience the country through the eyes of local women. So far, we’ve listened to morning prayers at <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/kapans-buddhist-nunnery/\">Kapan Ani Gompa</a> – a Buddhist nunnery where women have a rare opportunity to receive a traditional monastic education; we’ve learned how to make momos with a lovely lady named Dolma who was born and raised in a Tibetan refugee camp; and we’ve danced to Shakira’s <i>Waka Waka</i> with our <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/female-porters-nepal/\">all-female trekking crew</a> under a full moon in the Annapurna foothills. </p>\n<p>My period just so happened to coincide with the trek. Typical, I know. Given the choice (<i>if only</i>), I would’ve picked another week. But I had painkillers at the ready, a hefty stock of Snickers and a group of brilliant women by my side. It was a slight inconvenience, but it wasn’t going to stop me. </p>\n<p>But when we return to <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/nepal/kathmandu\">Kathmandu</a> and visit an NGO called Days for Girls, I learn that getting your period goes far beyond inconvenience for some Nepali women. </p>\n<h2>Banished for bleeding</h2>\n<p>We pull up outside a building on the busy street of Bafal Marg. There’s a sign reading ‘turning periods into pathways’ above the door. Motorbikes zip past in an endless stream, and while I linger for a gap in the traffic, our leader, Keshu, strides out with an open palm, bringing the bikes to a halt. I shuffle behind her like a duckling.</p>\n<p>Waiting to greet us is Maya Khaitu, the country director of <a href=\"https://www.daysforgirls.org/nepal/\">Days for Girls Nepal</a>. The organisation is a part of a global non-profit working to eliminate stigma and limitations around periods. Through community education and sustainable period products, the NGO is improving the health and livelihoods of girls and women in Nepal, Kenya and Guatemala, among other countries. </p>\n<p>‘Watch your heads,’ Maya warns as we climb a narrow metal staircase to a small classroom where we’ll learn more. Two team members hand out small bouquets of powder-pink amaryllis flowers to each woman in our group as we settle into our seats. Although the windows are shut, there’s no escaping Kathmandu’s soundtrack of honking horns and yapping dogs.</p>\n<p>‘As you know,’ Maya says, ‘menstrual health is stigmatised.’ I see a wave of nodding heads in the corner of my eye. ‘But in far western and midwestern Nepal, women and girls are banished to cattle sheds or makeshift huts during their period.’</p>\n<p>‘And just two months ago,’ she continues, ‘a woman was attacked by a tiger while she was sleeping in one of these sheds.’</p>\n<p>The street noise dissolves like sugar in a cup of masala chiya, and a collective gasp sweeps through the room.</p>\n<blockquote><p>This practice of isolating women on their period is part of chhaupadi, a centuries-old tradition where menstruation is seen as impure.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The tiger fled after villagers raised the alarm, Maya told us. The woman survived with minor facial injuries, but some aren’t so lucky. More recently, a woman tragically died from a <a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/sudurpaschim-province/2025/07/13/woman-dies-of-snakebite-in-menstrual-shed-in-kanchanpur\">snake bite in a menstrual shed</a> in Kanchanpur. </p>\n<p>This practice of isolating women on their period is part of chhaupadi, a centuries-old tradition where menstruation is seen as impure. During their bleed, women aren’t allowed to stay in the home or do everyday tasks like cooking and cleaning – or even touch others – out of fear they’ll bring death, illness, crop failure or some other bad luck to the family.</p>\n<p>The huts, known as chhau goths, have poor sanitation and ventilation, and women face many dangers including wild animal attacks, freezing temperatures, smoke inhalation and sexual assault. Unfortunately, many sexual assault cases go unreported due to social stigma and lack of adequate support systems.</p>\n<p>Maya tells us that in the past, women would sleep in a cave or an open field – even in the rain or snow. ‘Some older women have said, “Oh, these girls are so lucky staying in a cow shed!” – because sometimes all they had was a basket filled with hay to scatter and sleep on.’</p>\n<p>When we ask Maya how the women feel about chhaupadi, she says it’s complicated.</p>\n<p>‘Because girls are indoctrinated about the beliefs surrounding menstrual impurity from a young age, there’s often a blend of social conditioning and willing participation due to fear of spiritual repercussions if they break the rules. It can be tricky to distinguish genuine belief from reluctant compliance.’</p>\n<h2>Life-changing period kits</h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

My boyfriend works at Anthropic. See </i>\n      <u>my full ethics disclosure here</u>\n      <i>.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Today, let's talk about a tumultuous week in the life of xAI's middling chatbot, Grok, and what it reveals about the state of AI competition at this moment in 2025.</p>\n    <p>On July 9, xAI released Grok 4, calling it \"<a href=\"https://x.ai/news/grok-4?ref=platformer.news\">the most intelligent model in the world</a>.\" The model beat rivals on a handful of leading benchmarks, including one known as <a href=\"https://agi.safe.ai/?ref=platformer.news\">Humanity's Last Exam</a>, where its score of 25.4 percent edges out Gemini 2.5 Pro by 3.8 points. But it lagged rivals at practical tasks, including coding and creative writing, leading to credible charges that <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/grok-4-various-things?ref=platformer.news\">xAI had gamed the benchmarks</a>.</p>\n    <p>No one remembers any of that, of course, because immediately upon release, Grok 4 began <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/09/grok-ai-praised-hitler-antisemitism-x-ntwnfb?ref=platformer.news\">generating antisemitic comments and referring to itself as MechaHitler</a>. It also <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/11/grok-4-appears-to-reference-musks-views-when-answering-questions-.html?ref=platformer.news\">seemed to search Elon Musk's posts before responding to shape its views</a>. A week later, it added a not-safe-for-work anime companion — in an app that to this day <a href=\"https://www.platformer.news/grok-ani-app-store-rating-nsfw-avatar-apple/\">is rated for children 12 years and older in the App Store</a>.</p>\n    <p>Grok has become a popular fixture on X, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/grok-x-twitter-elon-musk-how-used-dunking-2025-4?ref=platformer.news\">where users routinely invoke it to dunk on people making false claims</a>. But despite some legitimately impressive aspects of xAI as an operation — most notably the speed with which it built models that are nearly state of the art — Musk's constant tampering and obsession with anti-wokeness have resulted in a series of comical, unforced errors that have blunted the app's momentum.</p>\n    <p>In an effort to kick-start Grok's growth, last week the company made <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/752906/groks-video-generator-is-free-for-now?ref=platformer.news\">its new image-to-video feature, Imagine, free for all users</a>. Musk said that, as a result, Imagine was \"growing like wildfire.\"</p>\n    <p>Over the past few days, though, something appears to have doused the flame. The top free app in the App Store is OpenAI's ChatGPT — while Grok is a still respectable No. 5.</p>\n    <p>But where most would see healthy competition between two well-funded AI labs, Musk — as he so often does — saw conspiracy.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Anthropic had deprecated three models in the Claude 3 family when it announced Claude 4 in May; it shut off access to them two months later. As Kylie Robison <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/claude-3-sonnet-funeral-san-francisco/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">reported at  Wired</a>, mourners at the funeral lamented the loss of Claude 3's voice, and the influence it had over their lives. (“Maybe everything I am is downstream of listening to Claude 3 Sonnet,” one person said while delivering a eulogy to the crowd.)</p>\n<p>At the time, it was easy — and not entirely unwarranted — to dismiss many of the attendees as AI-pilled San Francisco kooks. (The event concluded with a \"necromantic resurrection ritual” in which attendees attempted to resurrect Claude 3.) But less than two weeks later, in the shadow of GPT-5's launch, the funeral for Claude looks less like an isolated case of AI mania — and more like a preview of what AI labs should now consider standard.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, I said that <a href=\"https://www.platformer.news/gpt-5-launch-release-reviews-impressions/\">the worst day to review a model is the day it comes out</a>: there's simply too much that you don't know. And indeed, OpenAI's release of GPT-5 was followed by a notable backlash, a series of apologies, and a strategic retreat.</p>\n<p>Today, let's talk about what happened, how OpenAI reacted, and what we should expect from labs when they release big models in the future.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>II.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>On Thursday, after months of teasing it, OpenAI released GPT-5. On a live stream, the company presented the model as a significant step forward on the road to building a powerful artificial general intelligence.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.threads.com/@crumbler/post/DNGVIwDxzuI?ref=platformer.news\">Almost immediately</a>, though, the r/ChatGPT subreddit filled up with complaints. The company was now forcing everyone to use GPT-5, even if they personally might have preferred GPT-4o, o3, or other OpenAI models. For some users, the loss was primarily a professional one: a workflow broken, or a sense that the new, invisible model picker now routed all their queries to cheaper, less capable models than the ones they were used to. </p>\n<p>For others, though, the loss felt personal. They developed an affinity for the GPT-4o persona, or the o3 persona, and suddenly felt bereft. That the loss came without warning, and with seemingly no recourse, only worsened the sting.</p>\n<p>\"OpenAI just pulled the biggest bait-and-switch in AI history and I'm done,\" <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1mkobei/openai_just_pulled_the_biggest_baitandswitch_in/?ref=platformer.news\">read one Reddit post</a> with 10,000 upvotes.  \"4o wasn't just a tool for me,\" the user wrote. \"It helped me through anxiety, depression, and some of the darkest periods of my life. It had this warmth and understanding that felt... human.\"</p>\n<p>OpenAI and CEO Sam Altman acted quickly to address the user revolt. On Sunday, Altman <a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/1954602882554265777?ref=platformer.news\">said the company would bring back GPT-4o</a>, and would increase rate limits for use of the \"reasoning\" functionality within GPT-5. (Paid users should expect 3,000 per week, Altman <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sama/status/1954604215340593642?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1954604215340593642%7Ctwgr%5E154463c71a91e1b8a12a72cc89e2d56ac1616a8b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgizmodo.com%2Fopenai-brings-back-fan-favorite-gpt-4o-after-a-massive-user-revolt-2000641214&amp;ref=platformer.news\">said in an X post</a>.)</p>\n<p>Altman also said the company would begin to display the model being used when a user makes a query.</p>\n<p><strong>III</strong>.</p>\n<p>Altman seemed a bit surprised by the backlash.</p>\n<p>\"If you have been following the GPT-5 rollout, one thing you might be noticing is how much of an attachment some people have to specific AI models,\" Altman <a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/1954703747495649670?ref=platformer.news\">wrote in an X post</a>. \"It feels different and stronger than the kinds of attachment people have had to previous kinds of technology (and so suddenly deprecating old models that users depended on in their workflows was a mistake).\"</p>\n<p>On one hand, I can understand why this has not been more apparent to OpenAI and its rivals. While I found GPT 4o and o3 useful in various ways, I never found myself attached to their personalities. (If anything, I chafed at their formulaic writing style, with its constant usage of the \"it's not X — it's Y\" rhetorical device.)</p>\n<p>And for most of its history, the AI industry has thought about new models largely in terms of the new scores they reach on benchmarks and other evaluation frameworks, instead of as potentially disruptive replacements for critical work functions and companionship.</p>\n<p>At the same time, we have known for <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/11/google-ai-lamda-blake-lemoine/?ref=platformer.news\">years now</a> that even relatively underpowered models can still inspire overwhelming emotions in their users.</p>\n<p>Over the weekend, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> published an analysis of 96,000 ChatGPT chats posted online between May 2023 and now. It found dozens of instances of ChatGPT making \"<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/i-feel-like-im-going-crazy-chatgpt-fuels-delusional-spirals-ae5a51fc?st=Cqnx9E&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&amp;ref=platformer.news\">delusional, false and otherworldly claims to users who appeared to believe them</a>,\" reporters Sam Schechner and Sam Kessler wrote. They go on:</p>\n<blockquote>In those conversations, ChatGPT frequently told users that they aren’t crazy, and suggested they had become self-aware. The bots’ delusional conversations are also characterized by a lexicon that frequently refers to codexes, spirals and sigils. They often ruminate on themes of resonance and recursion, and use a peculiar syntax to emphasize points.</blockquote>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

I had a family that I wanted to spend more time with.\"</p><p>It was 1991. Sandra Grimes had spent more than two decades with the CIA. But she agreed to stay on to help a colleague investigate why the agency's informants in the Soviet Union had \"gone dark,\" as they say in spycraft, in 1985 and 1986.

He started wearing tailored suits, had his teeth capped, then paid cash for a new house and bought a Jaguar. All on a civil servant's salary.</p><p>Sandra Grimes scrutinized activity logs and financial statements and noticed that three times after Ames had lunch with a Soviet embassy official in Washington, D.C., he deposited thousands into his bank account.</p><p>\"Well, three matches don't make a conviction, but in my mind, Rick was the spy,\" Sandra Grimes recollected. \"It didn't take a rocket scientist to add one plus one plus one.\"</p><p>Aldrich Ames was arrested in 1994 and pled guilty to espionage, after taking millions of dollars for his spy work for the Soviet Union. He is still serving a life sentence.</p><p>Sandra Grimes died on July 25 at the age of 79. Her work was crucial in catching and stopping a Soviet agent who, the Senate Intelligence Committee said, \"caused more damage to the national security of the United States than any spy in the history of the CIA.\"</p></body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>What did we get up to while our kids’ time away overlapped for two weeks this summer? Did we go on vacation? Did we party every night? The truth is honestly embarrassing, so middle-aged coded, Deb of the early Smitten Kitchen years would rage and weep. [“You <i>promised</i> you wouldn’t get lame!”] I got… orthotics. And even worse than considering this newsworthy, I <i>love</i> them. I caught up on appointments. I challenged myself to finish books before they were overdue at the library and occasionally pulled it off. Sometimes I drank an entire 8 glasses of water and went to bed by 10:30pm. Sure, we went out. We had uninterrupted conversations. We drank Hugo spritzes. We saw dogs playing in a kiddie pool set up in front of an open fire hydrant and lamented that the kids were missing it, then reloaded their last locations and photos from the camp stream a million more times. We said things to each other like, “I miss the kids, but not parenting.” I watched <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@mikebirbiglia/video/7532600776175193358\">this clip</a> and it emotionally wrecked me. I’d sleep through my alarm in the morning and nobody was there to tell me I make weird faces in my sleep or that they’d promised they’d bring homemade treats to school that day. Friends, it was wild.</p>\n<p><br/>\n<graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/smittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/grilled-chicken-salad-with-cilantro-lime-dressing-collage-01.jpg?resize=640%2C212&amp;ssl=1\"/></p>\n<p>And the party didn’t end there. I’d make big dinner salads and bask, revel in being able to mix it all together, dressing too, not having to leave it on the side or create a whole salad bar of build-your-own bowl ingredients in case an unnamed picky child was going to reject the whole due to some of the parts. And in the most buried lede of all buried ledes, I need to tell you that this specific salad instantly became the star of our whole summer.</p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/smittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/grilled-chicken-salad-with-cilantro-lime-dressing-collage-03.jpg?resize=640%2C212&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>This salad could medal in the summer dinner salad Olympics, and as far as I’m concerned, it’s not even close. I’m pretty sure I’m going to be making it for the rest of my life, but I’m hoping you might start sooner, and even pull it off in a vacation house rental kitchen. It started in a more complex place; I’ve been making variations on what I call a Southwestern Cobb salad for years, a kinda taco bowl salad, with cute little rows of everything from tomatoes to black beans and peppers but every time I decide it was time to share it, I’d sigh and have to admit it was a bit of work.</p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/smittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/grilled-chicken-salad-with-cilantro-lime-dressing-collage-02.jpg?resize=640%2C212&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>Instead, I’ve distilled it to what I consider the best, most essential parts: chili-rubbed grilled chicken, charred sweet corn, avocado, and the best, most habit-forming, most put-it-on-everything, most I-can’t-stop-thinking-about-it cilantro lime dressing on earth. The whole thing is a symphony of greens and yellows (my favorite colors) and lest you think this feels a bit too wholesome and adult, I highly recommend a bowl of Fritos on the side and occasionally crumbled on top. A glass of something cold condensating on the table, your toes in the sand, and the general feeling that life is actually pretty grand right now isn’t guaranteed, but I want this for you, for us, and I hope this salad helps.</p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/54702545449_1f8798cc68_z.jpg?resize=640%2C427&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"grilled chicken salad with cilantro lime dressing-10\"/>\n    </p>\n<p/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://smittenkitchen.com/the-classroom-wishlist-project/\"/> It’s here! <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/smittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/classroom-wishlist.jpg?resize=300%2C146&amp;ssl=1\"/></p>\n<p><strong>The 2025 SK Classroom Wishlist Project</strong>, in which we try to get teachers what they need to set their classrooms up for success, has kicked off. If you cannot figure out where to start, let me help! I recommend picking a school in your area, or perhaps where you grew up, or searching the descriptions for classrooms that might focus on something particularly meaningful to you. Help out if you feel you’re able. There is no purchase too small to unquestionably make a teacher’s (and their students’) day. Plus, buying crayons, pencils, and books that help kids learn and succeed feels really good.

Millions of travellers flock to the ancient ruins every year, and for good reason. While we would all love to marvel at this site, there are a few steps to take (literally) before you get there.  </p>\n<p>Table of Contents:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#what-is-permit\">What is a permit and why do you need one?</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#what-if-i-can\"t-get-permit\">What if I don’t get a permit?</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#alternatives\">Permit-free alternatives</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#fitness\">How fit and experienced do I need to be to hike the Inca Trail?</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#positive-impact\">Make a positive impact visiting the Inca Trail</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <strong>Discover Intrepid’s range of small group trips to Machu Picchu</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"\"/>\n    </p>\n<h2>What is a trail permit and why do you need one?</h2>\n<p>All travellers who want to hike the Inca Trail must have a permit. The maximum number of Inca Trail permits is 500 per day, including crew and porters, which means that only about 200 permits are allocated to visitors. So, if this trip is high on your bucket list (and it should be), it’s time to start planning <i>now.</i> </p>\n<p>Here’s what you need to know:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>In mid-October, the Inca Trail government authority will release permits for the Inca Trail for 2026</li>\n      <li>During peak hiking season (June to August), you <strong>should try to book at least five to six months in advance</strong></li>\n      <li>Travelling with a tour operator is mandatory to hike the Inca Trail – travellers are not allowed to do it on their own</li>\n      <li>The Inca Trail is closed for the entire month of February for maintenance and conservation, but the Quarry Trail and train to Machu Picchu are still open</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>I don’t know about you, but as soon as I hear anything about visas, documentation requirements, permits, passes, etc., my brain becomes mashed potatoes. I have to do what? When? How??</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"\"/>\n    </p>\n<h2>How to get an Inca Trail permit</h2>\n<p>For an iconic trip like this, there are rules to follow. Travelling with a tour operator like Intrepid is mandatory to trek the Inca Trail and enter Machu Picchu, but that’s not something you need to stress about. Planning a trip should be enjoyable, so all you need to do is simply book the Machu Picchu trip of your choice and Intrepid will deal with the logistics.</p>\n<p>Here’s the cool part:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Intrepid has 30+ tours that will bring you to Machu Picchu</li>\n      <li>Upon arriving in Peru, your local Intrepid leader will have your Inca Trail pass confirmed and handled for you</li>\n      <li>A separate ticket required to enter Machu Picchu is included in your trip</li>\n      <li>Transportation from Cusco or Lima will be coordinated for you</li>\n      <li>Your local crew will have you covered on camping gear and the porters will even carry it for you</li>\n      <li>Local cooks will prepare you three meals a day, provide snacks and can cater to dietary restrictions and allergies</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Seriously, it’s that simple. All you have to do is:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Pick out an Intrepid Inca Trail trip</li>\n      <li>Book it</li>\n      <li>Provide full passport details required to book and confirm Inca Trail permits and enter Machu Picchu</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Oh, and entry tickets into Machu Picchu? That part’s covered, too. So, take a deep breath, <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/inca-trail-packing-list/\">pack your comfiest hiking shoes</a> and start feeling confident and adrenalised for your trip.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"\"/>\n    </p>\n<h2>What if I don’t get a permit?</h2>\n<p>Great question.</p>\n<p>The Inca Trail is a popular trek, so there’s a chance you could book a trip without securing a permit for your selected dates. If this happens, don’t worry, <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/inca-trail-vs-quarry-trail/\">you’ve got some options</a>. In case you don’t get a permit, you can:  </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Take the train</li>\n      <li>Hike the Quarry Trail</li>\n      <li>Change the date of your trip</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Every Intrepid trip that hikes the Inca Trail offers the option to take either the Inca Trail, Quarry Trail or train to the historic site. However, if your heart is set on the Inca Trail and you don’t get a permit, you’ll just have to be flexible with your dates.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"\"/>\n    </p>\n<h2>Permit-free alternatives</h2>\n<h3>Quarry Trail</h3>\n<p>The Quarry Trail does <strong>not</strong> require a permit, and you can still experience a three-day trek and camp in the Andes.  </p>\n<p>While the Inca Trail is the more popular option, as it’s the only way to hike directly into Machu Picchu, people opt for the <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/peru/machu-picchu/quarry-trail\">Quarry Trail</a> for many reasons. You’ll <i>ooh</i> and <i>aah</i> at archaeological sites, authentic cultural interactions, valley views, a visit to a waterfall and a finale in Aguas Calientes, the getaway town of Machu Picchu.  </p>\n<p>Another major perk is the bragging rights of reducing your impact of over-tourism and seeing fewer travellers than on the Inca Trail.</p>\n<p>Are you not into hiking altogether? There’s an option for that, too.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/facts-about-machu-picchu-peru/\">Related: 12 cool facts about Machu Picchu</a>\n    </p>\n<h3>Machu Picchu by train</h3>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>Centuries before photography froze the world into neat frames, scientists, poets, and artists streamed transient images into dark interior spaces with the help of a camera obscura. Julie Park explores the early modern fascination with this quasi-spiritual technology and the magic, melancholy, and dream-like experiences it produced.</p>\n<p>July 31, 2025</p>\n<p>“Athanasius Kircher’s camera obscura”, illustration from Kirscher’s <i>Ars magna lucis et umbrae</i> (1671) reproduced in Josef Maria Eder’s <i>Ausführliches Handbuch der Photographie</i> (Detailed handbook of photography, 1905) — <a href=\"https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/object/Fotoreproductie-van-een-prent-voorstellende-een-draagbare-camera-obscura--12b0cd8c581a73030dbcb772134f2df9\">Source</a>.</p>\n<p>The camera obscura, a device known as the photographic camera’s predecessor, was originally the size of a room. As an artist’s aid for rendering perspective, a scientific model for understanding optics, and a source of popular entertainment, it furnished observers with all kinds of information during the early modern period. In the context of pursuing knowledge about the natural world — whether in studying the sun, the light it emits, or the very organ for seeing, the eye — alchemists, astronomers, and mathematicians turned rooms in their homes into camera obscuras for revealing what was previously invisible.</p>\n<p>In the most rudimentary terms, the camera obscura (whose Latin name means “dark chamber”) is a dark and enclosed environment with a hole on one side. This aperture allows light to stream into the interior space, casting moving images onto the opposite wall. Because its images of external reality appear reversed, both laterally and vertically — in colors deeper than their original, with movements intact but seemingly exaggerated — the camera obscura’s projections of the world re-envision it as a dream.</p>\n<p>One of the very first mentions of the phenomenon behind the camera obscura is tied to the viewing of a solar eclipse.<sup> 1</sup> Aristotle, while observing a partial solar eclipse in the fourth century BCE, glimpsed its reflection in the play of light that seeped through the dense canopy of a tree. Here, the “dark chamber” is not a box or a room, but the critical space between solid things. Transposing this phenomenon onto the walls of domestic architecture, early modern natural philosophers made it possible to experience the domain of one’s personal space as a realm of marvelous reversal and illusion.</p>\n<p>First published image of a camera obscura, from Gemma R. Frisius’ <i>De radio astronomico et geometrico liber</i> (1545) — <a href=\"https://antoniocanal.com/php/camera-obscura-timeline.php\">Source</a>.</p>\n<p>Frontispiece to James Ayscough’s <i>A Short Account of the Eye and Nature of Vision</i> (1755) — <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/b30373177/page/n1/mode/2up\">Source</a>.</p>\n<p>For Giambattista della Porta, polymath author of <i>Natural Magic</i> (1558), a book of natural philosophy and alchemy filled with magic tricks and scientific experiments, the camera obscura was a space for “see[ing] all things in the dark, that are outwardly done in the Sun, with the colours of them”.<sup> 2</sup> This evocative phrasing suggests the metaphysical happenings that the experience of being and peering inside a camera obscura offers. Della Porta’s instructions for engineering this “very pleasant and admirable” experience — among the “great secrets of Nature” — involve managing sources of light and creating the conditions by which it can be strategically channeled: “you must shut all the Chamber windows, and it will do well to shut up all holes besides”, except for one that is as wide and long as your hand.</p>\n<p>\n      <sup>By covering the walls with paper or white cloth to create a viewing screen, the outside world will appear indoors, both familiar and estranged: “so shall you see all that is done without in the Sun, and those that walk in the streets, like to Antipodes, and what is right will be the left, and all things changed.”</sup>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <sup/>\n    </p>\n<p>A spiritual dimension inheres in this experience: the notion of illumination via obscuration that surrounds the early modern camera obscura carries remnants of the medieval period’s approach to darkness as the medium for perceiving the glorious light of God. Elina Gertsman explains how nowhere was this more evident than in windows through which light, both colored and clear, flooded into the darkness of cathedrals.<sup> 5</sup> Without the dimly lit cathedral space, this transmission of light as an expression of God’s splendor would not be so keenly felt. Both cathedrals and camera obscuras share the principle that dark places form the critical environment through which transformative light and its effects can be channeled. Yet in the case of camera obscuras, it was not just light alone, but ever more wondrous projections of the world that illuminated enclosed spaces.</p>\n<p>Illustration of a three-tiered camera obscura system attributed to Roger Bacon, from Athanasius Kircher’s <i>Ars magna lucis et umbrae</i> (The great art of light and shadow, 1671)\n— <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/athanasiikirche00kirc/page/94/mode/1up\">Source</a>.</p>\n<p>A method for drawing involving a camera obscura, from Charles-Antoine Jombert’s <i>Method pour apprendre le dessein</i> (Method for learning drawing, 1755) — <a href=\"https://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/jombert1755/0173/image,info,thumbs\">Source</a>.</p>\n<p>Illustration of a camera obscura arranged to “rectify” the image of a monument or landscape, from Edmund Atkinson’s <i>Natural Philosophy for General Readers and Young Persons</i> (1875), a translated abridgement of Adolphe Ganot’s <i>Cours élémentaire de physique</i> (1851) — <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/naturalphilosoph00ganorich/page/n407/mode/1up\">Source</a>.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

He once had a slash, as they say in British pubs, on a monument to those who died at the Alamo. He snorted a line of ants with Mötley Crüe. There are many other stories. He went into rehab programs, stopped, started, and stopped all over again.</p>\n    <p>Then, in the 2000s, Ozzy Osbourne became a hit on cable television: <i>The Osbournes</i> was an MTV reality series about the domestic life of his family. A performer once proclaimed as 'The Prince of Darkness' reappeared as a slightly daft and bumbling, burrito-loving suburban dad, albeit with an f-bomb charged vocabulary.</p>\n    <p>This week Alice Cooper, a founder of shock-rock, wrote on Instagram, \"I always saw Ozzy as a cross between the prince of darkness, which is the persona his fans saw, and the court jester. That was the side that his family and friends saw.\"</p>\n    <p>And just last month, even as he struggled with Parkinson's, Ozzy Osbourne reunited with his Black Sabbath mates for a last show in Birmingham.</p>\n    <p>And he sang in one of their last songs:</p>\n    <p>\"Yes, I've been a bad guy</p>\n    <p>Been higher than the blue sky</p>\n    <p>And the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man.\"</p>\n    <p>He sure didn't.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>High on the list of cooking things that I’ve got far more opinions on than anyone has ever asked of me (and may have even, at times, prayed I’d stop yapping about), are homemade ice cream sandwiches. Why? Because it’s devastating when you realize something that should bring us nothing but incandescent summer joy — ice cream! cookies! — rarely work as well as promised. Most cookies become so hard once frozen, you feel like you’re breaking a tooth with each bite. Unyielding cookies also squeeze the ice cream out the sides, leading to drips down your arms and an immediate bad mood (for adults; kids, naturally, love it). While writing <a href=\"https://smittenkitchen.com/books/\">Smitten Kitchen Keepers</a>, I became obsessed with creating a deeply nostalgic homemade <a href=\"https://chipwich.com/\">chipwich</a>-style ice cream sandwich that did everything right and I had three big a-ha moments along the way:</p>\n<p><br/>\n<graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/smittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/chipwich-ice-cream-cake-collage-01.jpg?resize=640%2C429&amp;ssl=1\"/></p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Chocolate chip cookies might be rock-like from the freezer but do you know what is not? Cake! I found that making my cookies a little more cakey — blondie-like, even — by adding some milk yielded a cookie that was the perfect texture from the freezer.</li>\n      <li>Freezing mutes flavors so slightly bumping up the sweetness and saltiness of the cookie you’re freezing really helps it have a perfect flavor when you eat them frozen.</li>\n      <li>Finally, filling ice cream sandwiches individually is for people with more time and/or patience on their hands than me. Instead, I poured a single layer of cookie batter into a pan and divided it in half once it was baked. These halves formed the top and bottom of a slab of ice cream sandwiches I cut into individual ones once they were frozen. [I also use this technique for these classic <a href=\"https://smittenkitchen.com/2021/06/chocolate-ice-cream-sandwiches/\">Chocolate Ice Cream Sandwiches</a>.]</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/smittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/chipwich-ice-cream-cake-collage-02.jpg?resize=640%2C429&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/smittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/chipwich-ice-cream-cake-collage-03.jpg?resize=640%2C212&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>And while I am truly as obsessed with the <a href=\"https://smittenkitchen.com/books/\">SKK</a> Blondie Chipwich recipe now as I was in 2022, when a chipwich-loving friend had a birthday this month, I realized the next best thing to individual blondie chipwiches was a one cake-sized one we serve in wedges. Do I need to tell you what a commotion a giant chocolate chip cookie ice cream cake causes? Especially when you’re not even lying when you said it was “easy peasy” because it has a one-bowl, hand-whisked cookie batter that bakes quickly and storebought ice cream? It’s happy, retro, and speckled with so many chocolate chips, well, I found some melted into the kitchen floor the next sunny morning. But, uh, you’ll make sure they all get in mouths first, okay? I’m counting on you.</p>\n<p><graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/54676427151_09eabfeb91_z.jpg?resize=640%2C427&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"chipwich ice cream cake-13\"/><br/>\n<graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/54676754010_a0caa1b667_z.jpg?resize=640%2C427&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"chipwich ice cream cake-15\"/></p>\n<p/>\n    <h3>Chipwich Ice Cream Cake</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li>1/2 cup (4 ounces or 115 grams) unsalted butter, any temperature, plus extra for coating the pans</li>\n      <li>Scant 1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>\n      <li>1 cup (215 grams) packed light brown sugar</li>\n      <li>1/3 cup (80 ml) milk, any kind, cold is fine</li>\n      <li>1 large egg</li>\n      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>\n      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>\n      <li>1 cup (130 grams) all-purpose flour</li>\n      <li>1 1/2 cups (9 ounces or 255 grams) miniature chocolate chips, divided</li>\n      <li>3 cups (1 28-ounce container) vanilla ice cream</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p><strong>Make the cookies:</strong>Heat oven to 350°F (175°C) degrees and line two 8-inch round cake pans with rounds of parchment paper. Coat the exposed sides with butter or nonstick spray. A little extra underneath the parchment helps it stick. If you only have one cake pan, don’t fret. The batter will hold while you bake the first round.</p>\n<p>In a large bowl, melt butter half in the microwave or in a medium-sized pot on the stove, then stir until the butter finishes melting. (This keeps the temperature down.) Add salt, brown sugar, and milk, whisking until smooth. If it’s not cool yet, let it cool a bit more (you do not want the egg to scramble or the chips to melt) before adding the egg and vanilla, whisking until combined. Sprinkle batter with baking powder and mix very well into the batter. Stir in flour and 1/2 cup (3 ounces or 85 grams) of the chocolate chips, stirring until flour disappears.</p>\n<p>Pour half the batter into each pan and smooth the top flat. Sprinkle the tops of each round with 2 tablespoons of the chocolate chips.</p>\n<p>Bake for about 15 minutes, until cookies are golden at the edges and set but soft in the center. Transfer to a cooling rack for 5 minutes, then remove from the pans, peeling off the parchment underneath. I like to then transfer my cookies to the freezer for 10 minutes so that they are fully, fully cold before we begin assembling the cake. If your ice cream is rock-hard in the freezer, transfer it to the fridge for these 10 minutes so it will be easier to scoop.</p>\n<p><strong>Assemble the cake</strong>: Line one of the 8-inch round cake pans with plastic wrap that extends up the sides of the pan in two directions. This will make it easier to remove the cake. [An 8-inch springform can work too but risks leaking before the ice cream is fully frozen again; I’d still use some plastic inside for security.]</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p><strong>Tackle some of the world’s best walking trails without sacrificing your creature comforts on these nine all-new adventures.</strong></p>\n<p>If you’re a keen hiker, you’re probably used to roughing it a bit. Keeping things simple – with homemade trail mix and and a trusty tent in tow – is often part of the appeal, allowing you to focus on connecting with nature and seeking out those mind-blowing views.</p>\n<p>But for those of us who like to get our steps in but prefer a soft landing at the end of the day, it means that certain trails often end up in the too-hard, maybe-I’ll-be-limber-enough-for-that-one-day mental list.</p>\n<p>That’s where Intrepid’s <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/new-trips\">new range of Premium Walking &amp; Trekking trips</a> come striding in.  </p>\n<p>Combining the best of Intrepid’s <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/walking\">Walking &amp; Trekking</a> adventures with <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/premium\">Premium</a> comforts, these new trips smooth out the rougher edges of outdoor exploration.

He is also called ‘Kuku bugga’. But no, he ain’t cuckoo!</strong> </p>\n<p>Travellers scoff schnitzels the size of their 4WD wheels, locals are dressed like extras on a <i>Mad Max</i> set and pub staff stretch their vowels soooooo faaaaaar their sentences could lap <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/australia\">Australia</a>. </p>\n<p>My smile couldn’t be wider, nor my joyous roar louder at the Lion’s Den Hotel south of Cooktown, an outback tavern that’s a thirst quencher for those who have conquered the bumpy drive along the Bloomfield Track from Cape Tribulation, north of the <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/australia/daintree\">Daintree</a> River.</p>\n<p>Watching from his favourite seat is Mooks – who, like a chameleon, is unseen until you spot him. Then he pops. His signature twirls of black hair loop behind his ears and curl down his chest, and with wisps of whiskers, he is a prize-winning portrait pleading to be painted. Mooks, however, is more into the art of walking and talking.</p>\n<p>‘Kuku bugga’, I learn, is the local lingo for someone who likes to talk, and Mooks could probably do that underwater, as that is where he was born.</p>\n<h2>Explore Far North Queensland</h2>\n<p>‘Mum was working in a cattle station in Laura, and when she couldn’t get to the hospital, she called my grandad and grandma to the homestead and she had me in the Laura River,’ he says.</p>\n<p>‘Mum needed to keep working and couldn’t look after me, so I lived in a bark shelter by the river with my grandparents.’</p>\n<p>The town of Laura is 130 km from where Mooks now lives and works at Rossville Retreat, a property where you can camp, or ‘glamp’ in beautiful bush lodges. But not all who stay are simply passing through. Many people visit to spend time with Mooks, to walk his Country, learn about bush food and medicine and, in some cases, to be healed. Whatever the reason, everything starts with a smoking ceremony.</p>\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><strong>Back to nature: On a mission to protect Australia’s Daintree Rainforest forever</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>‘Get some smoke on you!’</strong> </h2>\n<p>I’m on Intrepid’s <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/australia/cape-york-torres-strait-explorer-162063\">Cape York &amp; Torres Strait Explorer</a> trip, travelling overland from Cairns to ‘The Tip’, the northernmost point on mainland Australia. And meeting Mooks is an unforgettable stopover on the journey. </p>\n<p>‘Smoking ceremony is like a barrier for you,’ he says. ‘So, once you go through that smoking ceremony, you become one of us.’</p>\n<p>Doused in smoke, we ‘head bush’ along a dusty, scrub-lined track that looks unremarkable, but is soon revealed to be a living supermarket and a free-for-all pharmacy.</p>\n<p>‘This is our bush shampoo,’ says Mooks, as he tears leaves from a scrubby bush, scrunching them in his hands and adding water to make a foamy, soapy froth.</p>\n<p>‘My grandma used to bathe me with this when I was a little baby. It’s good for the skin, good for the water, doesn’t harm the fish or anything, you can use the leaf for rash, sunburn, it does make your skin soft, like a sponge.’</p>\n<p>From the same plant, the bark is used to relieve muscle pain, and from another tree, the leaves are plucked and crushed, releasing a menthol smell – and can be used to treat a variety of ailments. Next, we snack on lemony green ants with a snake weed chaser, a delicate purple flower that tastes like a mushroom. It’s good and would be the star of a salad.</p>\n<p><strong>Watch: </strong><strong>A new approach to travel in Australia’s Red Centre</strong><strong> </strong> </p>\n<h2><strong>The gift of healing</strong> </h2>\n<p>At 15, life changed for Mooks.</p>\n<p>‘My grandfather always said to me, “One day you’ll be helping many people”. I looked at him and said, “No, I don’t help anybody. I don’t want to help people.”‘</p>\n<p>Fifteen-year-old Mooks wasn’t interested, but teen spirit couldn’t fight it. Young Harold had been born into a family of healers.</p>\n<p>‘I knew that I had the power. And then one day, my grandfather and uncle said, “We’re going to take you to the ritual.” I ended up going bush with them and passed the healing.’</p>\n<p>Years on, there’s a long list of people who have sought out Mooks for his treatments.</p>\n<p>‘I helped a young girl from Belgium, a nine-year-old,’ says Mooks. ‘She had a brain tumour and from what I have heard, she is doing well. There was a young girl from Sydney with cystic fibrosis, she’s 21 now, a young boy from Texas with autism and a young girl in England had a brain tumour. I’ve been working on her for a few years, and she’s doing really well. I think she’s almost 20 now.’</p>\n<p>Healers harbour their secrets, though Mooks does share that he uses his hands and his didgeridoo to draw illness from people. I suspect his kind eyes and soft voice are also an integral part of his treatment.</p>\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><strong>A trip in my home country felt as inspiring as any trip overseas</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Lost for words</strong> </h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p><strong>When Lisa’s life took a detour and she found herself facing divorce, the future suddenly felt uncertain. But she knew one thing for sure: when it came to the division of assets, she was getting the family trip to Southeast Asia.</strong> </p>\n<p>The year my marriage fell apart, I flew to <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/vietnam/hanoi\">Hanoi</a>. Twelve months prior, our family of three had calendared the next year’s trips, each choosing a destination. My husband chose Spain, our 15-year-old daughter, Sophie, chose Italy and I chose <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/vietnam\">Vietnam</a> and <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/cambodia\">Cambodia</a>.  </p>\n<p>We’d travelled to Spain, eating crisp-skinned suckling pig in the shadow of the Alhambra. We’d travelled to Italy, bathing in the scent of lemon blossoms on the Amalfi Coast. Then, over dinner one January night, seemingly out of nowhere, my husband said ‘My soul is deeply unhappy. I want a divorce.’</p>\n<p>The gutting of our 20-year coupling left me gasping for air. Our plans for the future, once discussed over morning cappuccinos at home in New Jersey, were now hatched between lawyers whose aim was transactional: extinguish the marriage and divide its assets. I felt powerless as drafts of a settlement agreement volleyed between lawyers who seemed more in control of my life than I was.</p>\n<p>‘What do you want from your future?’ A friend asked one day as I sobbed on her sofa.</p>\n<p>I hesitated. It had been a long time since I’d been anything but a wife and mother. I wasn’t accustomed to considering my own desires.</p>\n<p>‘I want to travel,’ I said, feeling the weighty truth of my words. I thought of my lost trip to Vietnam and Cambodia. It had fallen away in the implosion of our marriage.</p>\n<p>I Googled trips to the region and found Intrepid’s <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/vietnam/best-vietnam-cambodia-160544\">Best of Vietnam and Cambodia</a>. I’d never taken a group trip and wasn’t sure I’d like the format – my husband and I had always travelled independently. But, in the stupor of divorce, the heady logistics of trip-planning felt impossible. </p>\n<p>I asked my lawyer to add the tour to our settlement agreement. ‘It’s non-negotiable,’ I said. Anticipating the trip gave me something to hold onto – something that was mine.</p>\n<h2><strong>A journey of self rediscovery</strong> </h2>\n<p>Sophie and I landed in Hanoi on a blazing hot day in June. Our Intrepid group was a mix of friendly travellers from New Zealand, the UK and Australia. I liked them immediately. The stories we shared over dinner were real – one couple had lost their son; a young woman was struggling with the challenges of her job. Their vulnerability allowed me to share that I was getting divorced, which set an authentic tone for the trip. I could be myself.</p>\n<h3>Braving new waters</h3>\n<p>We travelled first to Halong Bay, boarding a wooden ‘junk boat’ whose name belied its luxurious cabins and delicious meals. With a magician’s sleight of hand, the chef carved carrot strips into intricate rosebuds, adding them to a sumptuous lunch of spongy fish cake, savoury pork, and squid seared with onions and peppers.</p>\n<p>After lunch, we slipped into the clear, green waters of the bay. A year ago, I wouldn’t have done it – wildly self-conscious of my middle-aged body in a swimsuit. But I’d fought hard for this trip, and I was committed to experiencing every bit of it. Pushing past my insecurity I waded in, welcomed by the water’s healing embrace.</p>\n<h3>Making new connections</h3>\n<p>Moving on to Hue, we took a motorbike tour of the ancient imperial city. After my long marriage, I felt awkward wrapping my arms around the cigarette-scented driver.</p>\n<p>‘What’s your name?’ he asked, bike jumping to life. ‘Lisa,’ I told him.</p>\n<p>‘My name is Ku,’ he said, taking my hand.</p>\n<p>Ku was a retired high school French and English teacher, living in the mountains above Hue. ‘It’s cheaper up there,’ he said, pointing to the green hills framing the city. ‘I save my earnings for my children’s education.’</p>\n<p>‘Me too!’ I said, smiling at the universal connection of parenthood.</p>\n<p>I held onto Ku’s waist, exhilarated by the hot wind in my hair as we careened through narrow streets, stopping at temples and tombs. My heart lurched when we turned sharply on loose gravel, but Ku made me feel safe as he gently strapped my helmet under my chin each time we got on and off the bike.</p>\n<h3>Seeing the light</h3>\n<p>The group spent two nights in Hoi An, where darkened alleys glowed with paper lanterns, colours vivid like candies in a dish. Wishing on lit candles, we sent them floating downriver. I wished that my path forward would be illuminated, like the candescent waterway. With our new Aussie friends, we scoured the night market for banana-printed bucket hats, laughing when Sophie negotiated the best price. For the first time in months, divorce took a backseat to the pleasure of the moment.</p>\n<p>From the urban bustle of <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/vietnam/ho-chi-minh-city\">Ho Chi Minh City</a>, we took a day trip to the Cu Chi tunnels. Dug by the South Vietnamese Army, they are an elaborate web of subterranean passages, bedrooms, kitchens and even birthing rooms. At their apex, they housed 16,000 people. The tunnels felt claustrophobic. <i>Like my marriage,</i> I realised for the first time as I hoisted myself out of the tiny hole with my own strong arms. </p>\n<h2><strong>A new dawn</strong> </h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

As if I forget how easily I get consumed with a very specific idea for what a recipe should be and cannot let it go, even when it’s past time to move on. As if it was someone else who made <a href=\"https://smittenkitchen.com/2016/08/even-more-perfect-blueberry-muffins/\">blueberry muffins 25 times one summer</a> until <a href=\"https://smittenkitchen.com/2010/08/perfect-blueberry-muffins/\">she found what she was looking for</a>. Thus, perhaps I <i>shouldn’t</i> be surprised but I still am: I’ve made an obscene amount of focaccia this spring and summer trying to find the recipe I’ll want to use forever. Here are five things I learned along the way:</p>\n<p/>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>For focaccia that’s brown and crisp on top, a shallow pan is best</strong>: (<a href=\"https://amzn.to/4llw3aZ\">Like these rimmed baking sheets</a>.) While my<i>focacce</i>sometimes brown and crisp decently in pans with taller sides, such as a cake pan, it’s never as good.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/54648243800_4b6d4444ea_z.jpg?resize=640%2C427&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"focaccia with zucchini and potatoes-08\"/>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>It’s surprisingly hard to overbake focaccia:</strong>I know this sounds like madness, but for all intents and purposes, after 20 minutes in the oven, the bread is baked. But it doesn’t have a crunchy top and edges that hold, and I really like those. When I bake focaccia at least 30 minutes and often up to 35 or 37, not removing it until it’s the deepest golden brown on top, the texture is perfect: excellent edges but hydrated and chewy inside.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/54647925416_29691c9462_z.jpg?resize=640%2C427&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"focaccia with zucchini and potatoes-12\"/>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>No-knead is triumphant here:</strong>There are a lot of well-loved, well-reviewed, and no doubt phenomenal focaccia recipes around that apply the technique of “turns” to the dough — stretching and folding the dough to create a stronger dough with a more airy crumb. Yet, in side-by-side tests, I just didn’t find any significant improvement in texture or structure vs. when I didn’t bother kneading the dough. Perhaps it was my own user error. But perhaps it barely matters if, in the end, I love the way the no-knead method — i.e. the easiest and least fussy — comes out.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/smittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/focaccia-with-zucchini-and-potatoes-collage.jpg?resize=640%2C428&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Resist playing, hard as it is:</strong>Two things that are unfortunately wildly fun — punching down a dough after its first rise and dimpling the heck out of a focaccia with oiled fingertips — are not our friends here, and really take away from the final airiness we want in this kind of pan-baked bread. I had to rein in my impulses to play, dimpling only a few times, to get the focaccia you see here.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p><graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/54648243925_337fd256b6_z.jpg?resize=640%2C427&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"focaccia with zucchini and potatoes-06\"/><br/>\n<graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/54647082132_8563fd9453_z.jpg?resize=640%2C427&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"focaccia with zucchini and potatoes-07\"/></p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Toppings shrink; be generous:</strong>While you can leave this focaccia plain, or just sprinkle it with sea salt and rosemary needles, my dream here was a somewhat loaded summer focaccia, and I topped mine with zucchini and potatoes.

    "body": "<p>The increasing integration of robots across various sectors, from industrial manufacturing to daily life, highlights a growing need for advanced navigation systems. However, contemporary robot navigation systems face significant challenges in diverse and complex indoor environments, exposing the limitations of traditional approaches. Addressing the fundamental questions of “Where am I?”, “Where am I going?”, and “How do I get there?”, ByteDance has developed Astra, an innovative dual-model architecture designed to overcome these traditional navigation bottlenecks and enable general-purpose mobile robots.</p>\n<p>Traditional navigation systems typically consist of multiple, smaller, and often rule-based modules to handle the core challenges of target localization, self-localization, and path planning. Target localization involves understanding natural language or image cues to pinpoint a destination on a map. Self-localization requires a robot to determine its precise position within a map, especially challenging in repetitive environments like warehouses where traditional methods often rely on artificial landmarks (e.g., QR codes). Path planning further divides into global planning for rough route generation and local planning for real-time obstacle avoidance and reaching intermediate waypoints.</p>\n<p>While foundation models have shown promise in integrating smaller models to tackle broader tasks, the optimal number of models and their effective integration for comprehensive navigation remained an open question.</p>\n<p>ByteDance’s Astra, detailed in their paper “Astra: Toward General-Purpose Mobile Robots via Hierarchical Multimodal Learning” (website: <a href=\"https://astra-mobility.github.io/\">https://astra-mobility.github.io/</a>), addresses these limitations. Following the System 1/System 2 paradigm, Astra features two primary sub-models: <strong>Astra-Global</strong> and <strong>Astra-Local</strong>. Astra-Global handles low-frequency tasks like target and self-localization, while Astra-Local manages high-frequency tasks such as local path planning and odometry estimation. This architecture promises to revolutionize how robots navigate complex indoor spaces.</p>\n<p>Astra-Global serves as the intelligent core of the Astra architecture, responsible for critical low-frequency tasks: self-localization and target localization. It functions as a <strong>Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)</strong>, adept at processing both visual and linguistic inputs to achieve precise global positioning within a map. Its strength lies in utilizing a <strong>hybrid topological-semantic graph</strong> as contextual input, allowing the model to accurately locate positions based on query images or text prompts.</p>\n<p>The construction of this robust localization system begins with <strong>offline mapping</strong>. The research team developed an offline method to build a hybrid topological-semantic graph G=(V,E,L):</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>V (Nodes):</strong>Keyframes, obtained by temporal downsampling of input video and SfM-estimated 6-Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) camera poses, act as nodes encoding camera poses and landmark references.</li>\n      <li><strong>E (Edges):</strong>Undirected edges establish connectivity based on relative node poses, crucial for global path planning.</li>\n      <li><strong>L (Landmarks):</strong>Semantic landmark information is extracted by Astra-Global from visual data at each node, enriching the map’s semantic understanding. These landmarks store semantic attributes and are connected to multiple nodes via co-visibility relationships.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>In practical localization, Astra-Global’s self-localization and target localization capabilities leverage a <strong>coarse-to-fine two-stage process</strong> for visual-language localization. The coarse stage analyzes input images and localization prompts, detects landmarks, establishes correspondence with a pre-built landmark map, and filters candidates based on visual consistency. The fine stage then uses the query image and coarse output to sample reference map nodes from the offline map, comparing their visual and positional information to directly output the predicted pose.</p>\n<p>For <strong>language-based target localization</strong>, the model interprets natural language instructions, identifies relevant landmarks using their functional descriptions within the map, and then leverages landmark-to-node association mechanisms to locate relevant nodes, retrieving target images and 6-DoF poses.</p>\n<p>To empower Astra-Global with robust localization abilities, the team employed a meticulous training methodology. Using <strong>Qwen2.5-VL</strong> as the backbone, they combined <strong>Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)</strong> with <strong>Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)</strong>. SFT involved diverse datasets for various tasks, including coarse and fine localization, co-visibility detection, and motion trend estimation. In the GRPO phase, a rule-based reward function (including format, landmark extraction, map matching, and extra landmark rewards) was used to train for visual-language localization. Experiments showed GRPO significantly improved Astra-Global’s zero-shot generalization, achieving 99.9% localization accuracy in unseen home environments, surpassing SFT-only methods.</p>\n<p>Astra-Local acts as the intelligent assistant for Astra’s high-frequency tasks, a multi-task network capable of efficiently generating local paths and accurately estimating odometry from sensor data. Its architecture comprises three core components: a <strong>4D spatio-temporal encoder</strong>, a <strong>planning head</strong>, and an <strong>odometry head</strong>.</p>\n<p>The <strong>4D spatio-temporal encoder</strong> replaces traditional mobile stack perception and prediction modules. It begins with a <strong>3D spatial encoder</strong> that processes N omnidirectional images through a Vision Transformer (ViT) and Lift-Splat-Shoot to convert 2D image features into 3D voxel features. This 3D encoder is trained using self-supervised learning via 3D volumetric differentiable neural rendering. The 4D spatio-temporal encoder then builds upon the 3D encoder, taking past voxel features and future timestamps as input to predict future voxel features through ResNet and DiT modules, providing current and future environmental representations for planning and odometry.</p>\n<p>The <strong>planning head</strong>, based on pre-trained 4D features, robot speed, and task information, generates executable trajectories using <strong>Transformer-based flow matching</strong>. To prevent collisions, the planning head incorporates a <strong>masked ESDF loss</strong> (Euclidean Signed Distance Field). This loss calculates the ESDF of a 3D occupancy map and applies a 2D ground truth trajectory mask, significantly reducing collision rates. Experiments demonstrate its superior performance in collision rate and overall score on out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets compared to other methods.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>The concept of AI self-improvement has been a hot topic in recent research circles, with a flurry of papers emerging and prominent figures like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman weighing in on the future of self-evolving intelligent systems. Now, a new paper from MIT, titled “Self-Adapting Language Models,” introduces <strong>SEAL (Self-Adapting LLMs)</strong>, a novel framework that allows large language models (LLMs) to update their own weights. This development is seen as another significant step towards the realization of truly self-evolving AI.</p>\n<p>The research paper, published yesterday, has already ignited considerable discussion, including on Hacker News. SEAL proposes a method where an LLM can generate its own training data through “self-editing” and subsequently update its weights based on new inputs. Crucially, this self-editing process is learned via reinforcement learning, with the reward mechanism tied to the updated model’s downstream performance.</p>\n<p>The timing of this paper is particularly notable given the recent surge in interest surrounding AI self-evolution. Earlier this month, several other research efforts garnered attention, including Sakana AI and the University of British Columbia’s “Darwin-Gödel Machine (DGM),” CMU’s “Self-Rewarding Training (SRT),” Shanghai Jiao Tong University’s “MM-UPT” framework for continuous self-improvement in multimodal large models, and the “UI-Genie” self-improvement framework from The Chinese University of Hong Kong in collaboration with vivo.</p>\n<p>Adding to the buzz, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently shared his vision of a future with self-improving AI and robots in his blog post, “The Gentle Singularity.” He posited that while the initial millions of humanoid robots would need traditional manufacturing, they would then be able to “operate the entire supply chain to build more robots, which can in turn build more chip fabrication facilities, data centers, and so on.” This was quickly followed by a tweet from @VraserX, claiming an OpenAI insider revealed the company was already running recursively self-improving AI internally, a claim that sparked widespread debate about its veracity.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the specifics of internal OpenAI developments, the MIT paper on SEAL provides concrete evidence of AI’s progression towards self-evolution.</p>\n<h3>Understanding SEAL: Self-Adapting Language Models</h3>\n<p>The core idea behind SEAL is to enable language models to improve themselves when encountering new data by generating their own synthetic data and optimizing their parameters through self-editing. The model’s training objective is to directly generate these self-edits (SEs) using data provided within the model’s context.</p>\n<p>The generation of these self-edits is learned through reinforcement learning. The model is rewarded when the generated self-edits, once applied, lead to improved performance on the target task. Therefore, SEAL can be conceptualized as an algorithm with two nested loops: an outer reinforcement learning (RL) loop that optimizes the generation of self-edits, and an inner update loop that uses the generated self-edits to update the model via gradient descent.</p>\n<p>This method can be viewed as an instance of meta-learning, where the focus is on how to generate effective self-edits in a meta-learning fashion.</p>\n<p>SEAL operates on a single task instance (C,τ), where C is context information relevant to the task, and τ defines the downstream evaluation for assessing the model’s adaptation. For example, in a knowledge integration task, C might be a passage to be integrated into the model’s internal knowledge, and τ a set of questions about that passage.</p>\n<p>Given C, the model generates a self-edit SE, which then updates its parameters through supervised fine-tuning: θ′←SFT(θ,SE). Reinforcement learning is used to optimize this self-edit generation: the model performs an action (generates SE), receives a reward r based on LMθ′’s performance on τ, and updates its policy to maximize the expected reward.</p>\n<p>The researchers found that traditional online policy methods like GRPO and PPO led to unstable training. They ultimately opted for ReST^EM, a simpler, filtering-based behavioral cloning approach from a DeepMind paper. This method can be viewed as an Expectation-Maximization (EM) process, where the E-step samples candidate outputs from the current model policy, and the M-step reinforces only those samples that yield a positive reward through supervised fine-tuning.</p>\n<p>The paper also notes that while the current implementation uses a single model to generate and learn from self-edits, these roles could be separated in a “teacher-student” setup.</p>\n<p>The MIT team instantiated SEAL in two specific domains: <strong>knowledge integration</strong> and <strong>few-shot learning</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Knowledge Integration:</strong>The goal here is to effectively integrate information from articles into the model’s weights.</li>\n      <li><strong>Few-Shot Learning:</strong>This involves the model adapting to new tasks with very few examples.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h3>Experimental Results</h3>\n<p>The experimental results for both few-shot learning and knowledge integration demonstrate the effectiveness of the SEAL framework.</p>\n<p>In <strong>few-shot learning</strong>, using a Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct model, SEAL significantly improved adaptation success rates, achieving 72.5% compared to 20% for models using basic self-edits without RL training, and 0% without adaptation. While still below “Oracle TTT” (an idealized baseline), this indicates substantial progress.</p>\n<p>For <strong>knowledge integration</strong>, using a larger Qwen2.5-7B model to integrate new facts from SQuAD articles, SEAL consistently outperformed baseline methods. Training with synthetically generated data from the base Qwen-2.5-7B model already showed notable improvements, and subsequent reinforcement learning further boosted performance. The accuracy also showed rapid improvement over external RL iterations, often surpassing setups using GPT-4.1 generated data within just two iterations.</p>\n<p>Qualitative examples from the paper illustrate how reinforcement learning leads to the generation of more detailed self-edits, resulting in improved performance.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

The co-first authors are Shaokun Zhang of Penn State University and Ming Yin of Duke University.</p>\n<p>In recent years, LLM Multi-Agent systems have garnered widespread attention for their collaborative approach to solving complex problems. However, it’s a common scenario for these systems to fail at a task despite a flurry of activity. This leaves developers with a critical question: which agent, at what point, was responsible for the failure? Sifting through vast interaction logs to pinpoint the root cause feels like finding a needle in a haystack—a time-consuming and labor-intensive effort.<br/> <br/>This is a familiar frustration for developers. In increasingly complex Multi-Agent systems, failures are not only common but also incredibly difficult to diagnose due to the autonomous nature of agent collaboration and long information chains. Without a way to quickly identify the source of a failure, system iteration and optimization grind to a halt.<br/> <br/>To address this challenge, researchers from <strong>Penn State University</strong> and <strong>Duke University</strong>, in collaboration with institutions including <strong>Google DeepMind</strong>, have introduced the novel research problem of <strong>“Automated Failure Attribution.”</strong> They have constructed the first benchmark dataset for this task, <strong>Who&amp;When</strong>, and have developed and evaluated several automated attribution methods. This work not only highlights the complexity of the task but also paves a new path toward enhancing the reliability of LLM Multi-Agent systems.<br/>The paper has been accepted as a <strong>Spotlight presentation at the top-tier machine learning conference, ICML 2025</strong>, and the code and dataset are now fully open-source.<br/>Paper：<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00212\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00212</a><br/>Code：<a href=\"https://github.com/mingyin1/Agents_Failure_Attribution\">https://github.com/mingyin1/Agents_Failure_Attribution</a><br/>Dataset：<a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/Kevin355/Who_and_When\">https://huggingface.co/datasets/Kevin355/Who_and_When</a><br/> <br/> <strong>Research Background and Challenges</strong><br/>LLM-driven Multi-Agent systems have demonstrated immense potential across many domains. However, these systems are fragile; errors by a single agent, misunderstandings between agents, or mistakes in information transmission can lead to the failure of the entire task.<br/>Currently, when a system fails, developers are often left with manual and inefficient methods for debugging:<strong>Manual Log Archaeology</strong> : Developers must manually review lengthy interaction logs to find the source of the problem.<strong>Reliance on Expertise</strong> : The debugging process is highly dependent on the developer’s deep understanding of the system and the task at hand.<br/> <br/>This “needle in a haystack” approach to debugging is not only inefficient but also severely hinders rapid system iteration and the improvement of system reliability. There is an urgent need for an automated, systematic method to pinpoint the cause of failures, effectively bridging the gap between “evaluation results” and “system improvement.”</p>\n<p><strong>Core Contributions</strong><br/>This paper makes several groundbreaking contributions to address the challenges above:<br/>1. <strong>Defining a New Problem</strong>: The paper is the first to formalize “automated failure attribution” as a specific research task. This task is defined by identifying the </p>\n<p>2. <strong>failure-responsible agent</strong> and the <strong>decisive error step</strong> that led to the task’s failure.<strong>Constructing the First Benchmark Dataset: Who&amp;When</strong> : This dataset includes a wide range of failure logs collected from 127 LLM Multi-Agent systems, which were either algorithmically generated or hand-crafted by experts to ensure realism and diversity. Each failure log is accompanied by fine-grained human annotations for:<strong>Who</strong>: The agent responsible for the failure.<strong>When</strong>: The specific interaction step where the decisive error occurred.<strong>Why</strong>: A natural language explanation of the cause of the failure.</p>\n<p><strong>3. </strong>Exploring Initial “Automated Attribution” Methods : Using the Who&amp;When dataset, the paper designs and assesses three distinct methods for automated failure attribution:<strong>All-at-Once: </strong>This method provides the LLM with the user query and the complete failure log, asking it to identify the responsible agent and the decisive error step in a single pass. While cost-effective, it may struggle to pinpoint precise errors in long contexts.<strong>Step-by-Step:</strong> This approach mimics manual debugging by having the LLM review the interaction log sequentially, making a judgment at each step until the error is found. It is more precise at locating the error step but incurs higher costs and risks accumulating errors.<strong>Binary Search: </strong>A compromise between the first two methods, this strategy repeatedly divides the log in half, using the LLM to determine which segment contains the error. It then recursively searches the identified segment, offering a balance of cost and performance.<strong> </strong><strong>Experimental Results and Key Findings</strong></p>\n<p>Experiments were conducted in two settings: one where the LLM knows the ground truth answer to the problem the Multi-Agent system is trying to solve (<strong>With Ground Truth</strong>) and one where it does not (<strong>Without Ground Truth</strong>). The primary model used was GPT-4o, though other models were also tested. The systematic evaluation of these methods on the Who&amp;When dataset yielded several important insights:</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Video world models, which predict future frames conditioned on actions, hold immense promise for artificial intelligence, enabling agents to plan and reason in dynamic environments. Recent advancements, particularly with video diffusion models, have shown impressive capabilities in generating realistic future sequences. However, a significant bottleneck remains: <strong>maintaining long-term memory.</strong> Current models struggle to remember events and states from far in the past due to the high computational cost associated with processing extended sequences using traditional attention layers. This limits their ability to perform complex tasks requiring sustained understanding of a scene.</p>\n    <p>A new paper, “Long-Context State-Space Video World Models” by researchers from Stanford University, Princeton University, and Adobe Research, proposes an innovative solution to this challenge. They introduce a novel architecture that leverages <strong>State-Space Models (SSMs)</strong> to extend temporal memory without sacrificing computational efficiency.</p>\n    <p>The core problem lies in the quadratic computational complexity of attention mechanisms with respect to sequence length. As the video context grows, the resources required for attention layers explode, making long-term memory impractical for real-world applications. This means that after a certain number of frames, the model effectively “forgets” earlier events, hindering its performance on tasks that demand long-range coherence or reasoning over extended periods.</p>\n    <p>The authors’ key insight is to leverage the inherent strengths of State-Space Models (SSMs) for causal sequence modeling. Unlike previous attempts that retrofitted SSMs for non-causal vision tasks, this work fully exploits their advantages in processing sequences efficiently.</p>\n    <p>The proposed <strong>Long-Context State-Space Video World Model (LSSVWM)</strong> incorporates several crucial design choices:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Block-wise SSM Scanning Scheme:</strong>This is central to their design. Instead of processing the entire video sequence with a single SSM scan, they employ a block-wise scheme. This strategically trades off some spatial consistency (within a block) for significantly extended temporal memory. By breaking down the long sequence into manageable blocks, they can maintain a compressed “state” that carries information across blocks, effectively extending the model’s memory horizon.</li>\n      <li><strong>Dense Local Attention:</strong>To compensate for the potential loss of spatial coherence introduced by the block-wise SSM scanning, the model incorporates dense local attention. This ensures that consecutive frames within and across blocks maintain strong relationships, preserving the fine-grained details and consistency necessary for realistic video generation. This dual approach of global (SSM) and local (attention) processing allows them to achieve both long-term memory and local fidelity.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-3.png?resize=586%2C883&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The paper also introduces two key training strategies to further improve long-context performance:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Diffusion Forcing:</strong>This technique encourages the model to generate frames conditioned on a prefix of the input, effectively forcing it to learn to maintain consistency over longer durations. By sometimes not sampling a prefix and keeping all tokens noised, the training becomes equivalent to diffusion forcing, which is highlighted as a special case of long-context training where the prefix length is zero. This pushes the model to generate coherent sequences even from minimal initial context.</li>\n      <li><strong>Frame Local Attention:</strong>For faster training and sampling, the authors implemented a “frame local attention” mechanism. This utilizes FlexAttention to achieve significant speedups compared to a fully causal mask. By grouping frames into chunks (e.g., chunks of 5 with a frame window size of 10), frames within a chunk maintain bidirectionality while also attending to frames in the previous chunk. This allows for an effective receptive field while optimizing computational load.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-4.png?resize=605%2C729&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The researchers evaluated their LSSVWM on challenging datasets, including <strong>Memory Maze</strong> and <strong>Minecraft</strong>, which are specifically designed to test long-term memory capabilities through spatial retrieval and reasoning tasks.</p>\n    <p>The experiments demonstrate that their approach <strong>substantially surpasses baselines</strong> in preserving long-range memory. Qualitative results, as shown in supplementary figures (e.g., S1, S2, S3), illustrate that LSSVWM can generate more coherent and accurate sequences over extended periods compared to models relying solely on causal attention or even Mamba2 without frame local attention. For instance, on reasoning tasks for the maze dataset, their model maintains better consistency and accuracy over long horizons. Similarly, for retrieval tasks, LSSVWM shows improved ability to recall and utilize information from distant past frames. Crucially, these improvements are achieved while maintaining practical inference speeds, making the models suitable for interactive applications.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-5.png?resize=595%2C339&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The Paper<i> Long-Context State-Space Video World Models</i> is on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20171\">arXiv</a></p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Many hotels have their own custom fragrances that they perfume the air with, using aromatherapy to set the mood and help guests get into a vacation mindset. Utilizing calming scents like lavender and sandalwood, hotel fragrances can help link your memories to a sense of place, so every time you smell a certain perfume, you'll be transported back to a trip.  <br/>\nWant to have that same experience every time you walk in your front door at home? We tested out a variety of fragrance methods, from candles to diffusers, to find out which were the best at making our home smell like a five-star hotel. Try out our picks and feel like you're on vacation every day.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://bluemefragrance.com/products/happiness-ceramic-refillable-diffuser-yuzu-ginger\">\n        <graphic loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.smartertravel.com/production/Articles/2024-12/How%20to%20Make%20Your%20Home%20Smell%20Like%20a%20Hotel/small_Blume_e07d881e04.webp\" alt=\"Image\" class=\"list-item-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" fetchpriority=\"auto\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Pretend you're staying at a luxury eco-spa with <a href=\"https://bluemefragrance.com/collections/diffusers\">Blueme's Happiness Diffuser</a>. Crafted with clean, phthalate- and paraben-free formulas, these oils are housed in elegant ceramic bottles and diffused through naturally grown rattan reeds. Each reed contains 20 or more porous channels, allowing the fragrance to gently release into your space for up to three months.</p>\n<p>Bring the smell of a five-star hotel to your home with <a href=\"https://www.hotelcollection.com/products/studio-pro-scent-diffuser\">Hotel Collection's Studio Pro Scent Diffuser</a>. This compact diffuser uses a cold-air technology that converts fragrance oil into a dry nano-mist that makes the scent consistent and long-lasting. It's also much safer than a candle since there's no flame or smoke to deal with (just a beautiful fragrance). Despite the diffuser's small size, it can easily scent your entire apartment or house.</p>\n<p>Pair the diffuser with the brand's wide range of scents that are inspired by hotels across the globe, from The Edition Hotel New York to the 1 Hotel Miami Beach.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.jupitersmellsrich.com/products/mykonos-candle?variant=44421831885076\">\n        <graphic loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.smartertravel.com/production/Articles/How to Make Your Home Smell Like a Hotel/Content/small_Untitled_design_bc59c46bbb.webp\" alt=\"Jupiter Smells Rich Candle\" class=\"list-item-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" fetchpriority=\"auto\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Your house may be hundreds of miles from the beach, but it can smell like you're on an exotic vacation in Mykonos with <a href=\"https://www.jupitersmellsrich.com/products/mykonos-candle?variant=44421831885076\">Jupiter Smells Rich's candle</a>. Notes of wild orchid, jasmine, lemon blossom, vanilla, and sandalwood conjure up an island getaway.</p>\n<p>This luxury candle is made from 100 percent soy wax and has an all-natural beeswax-coated wick to ensure a clean burn. The scent will linger throughout your house long after you've blown out the flame.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://nohohomehawaii.com/collections/reed-diffusers\">\n        <graphic loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.smartertravel.com/production/Articles/How to Make Your Home Smell Like a Hotel/Content/small_Untitled_design_22_1024x256_574bd43104.webp\" alt=\"Noho Home Reed Diffusers\" class=\"list-item-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"125\" fetchpriority=\"auto\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p>A diffuser is one of the easiest and safest ways to make your home smell like a hotel. A diffuser is a small vial of scented liquid that disperses the fragrance through wooden reeds. Unlike a candle or plug-in, you can just open up a diffuser and forget about it.</p>\n<p>Our favorite diffuser is <a href=\"https://nohohomehawaii.com/collections/reed-diffusers\">Noho Home's Puakenikeni Reed Diffuser</a>. Perfumed oil is housed in a beautiful vessel that efficiently distributes fragerance via reeds. When the scent starts to fade, simply flip the reeds to refresh the smell. We love the Puakenikeni scent, which is designed in Hawaii and inspired by the puakenikeni flower.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://enviroscent.com/products/stix-stand-starter-kit\">\n        <graphic loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.smartertravel.com/production/Articles/How to Make Your Home Smell Like a Hotel/Content/small_enviroscent_difusser_spray_54fbf6bd8e.webp\" alt=\"enviroscent diffuser and spray product stills\" class=\"list-item-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" fetchpriority=\"auto\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Worried about what you’re breathing in with all of the artificial air fresheners on the market? Enviroscent does things differently, with a focus on making its scents cleaner, healthier, and safer. All of its products use pure fragrance oils in concentrated form (with no additives) and are packaged using renewable and recyclable minimal-waste materials. Scent your space via the <a href=\"https://enviroscent.com/products/stix-stand-starter-kit\">stix + stand diffuser</a>, a <a href=\"https://enviroscent.com/products/car-vent-clip-starter-kit\">car vent clip</a>, or a <a href=\"https://enviroscent.com/products/scent-spritz-starter-kit\">spray</a>.</p>\n<p>No matter which method you choose, it’s all flameless and liquidless to eliminate danger and mess. There are many delectable scents to choose from, including a blend of lavender tea and honey, which smells incredibly relaxing and delicious.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.hillhousenaturals.com/home-fragrance-diffuser-s/194.htm\">\n        <graphic loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.smartertravel.com/production/Articles/How to Make Your Home Smell Like a Hotel/Content/small_Hillhouse_Naturals_Candle_and_Diffuser_23b376e8ba.webp\" alt=\"Hillhouse Naturals Candle and Diffuser\" class=\"list-item-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" fetchpriority=\"auto\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p>For a fragrance that will fill your house and last a long time, look to Hillhouse Naturals. This company was founded by a mother/daughter duo who make the products (with the help of a team of women) on their family farm. They use local ingredients, most of which come straight from the farm. Hillhouse Naturals’ <a href=\"https://www.hillhousenaturals.com/home-fragrance-diffuser-s/194.htm\">diffusers</a> last for an average of three to four months, which is significantly longer than most other diffusers on the market. The <a href=\"https://www.hillhousenaturals.com/candles-s/193.htm\">soy candles</a> also burn longer than regular wax candles and don’t have the dangerous chemicals that can be found in mass-market candles.</p>\n<p>You’ll find plenty of unique scents here, including travel-themed varieties like the lakeside diffuser, which smells like \"spectacular sunsets upon fresh cool waters\" and conjures up past waterfront vacations.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://scentfill.com/\">\n        <graphic loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.smartertravel.com/production/Articles/How to Make Your Home Smell Like a Hotel/Content/small_Scentfill_d13a5ed5bd.webp\" alt=\"Scentfill product still\" class=\"list-item-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" fetchpriority=\"auto\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://scentfill.com/\">Scentfill</a> offers a healthier alternative to traditional plug-ins. The company makes refills that are designed to fit into <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Air-Wick-Scented-Freshener-Warmer/dp/B004IVUX1S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=air+wick+oil+warmer&amp;qid=1578512945&amp;sr=8-9&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=stm07a5-20&amp;linkId=eacccc6703b8fd2e6c36cd5bdb389631&amp;language=en_US\">Air Wick oil warmers</a> but are made with 100 percent plant-based and natural oils rather than chemicals. The fragrances are much more complex and luxurious than what you’d find from a drugstore plug-in—choose the <a href=\"https://scentfill.com/products/relaxing-lemon-lavender-eucalyptus\">Relax Blend</a> with lemon, lavender, and eucalyptus to make your home smell like a high-end hotel.</p>\n<p>Most scents will last between 30 and 60 days if the warmer is set to low, and the refills are reasonably priced at $5.77, making this an affordable option for home fragrances.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QgHWWnLLbpQewqhSQgUUR0EAAAFvpObNnAEAAAFKAYQ4zMQ/https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MR4Y0CZ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?creativeASIN=B01MR4Y0CZ&amp;imprToken=XTVkN36bpA87T.cd9Vzieg&amp;slotNum=1&amp;&amp;ascsub&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;tag=smartrav-20&amp;linkId=4c421413182c0cf63e504c642398a12c&amp;language=en_US\">\n        <graphic loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.smartertravel.com/production/Articles/How to Make Your Home Smell Like a Hotel/Content/small_Asakuki_s_5_in_1_Aromatherapy_Device_d4ddf06279.webp\" alt=\"Asakuki’s 5-in-1 Aromatherapy Device\" class=\"list-item-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" fetchpriority=\"auto\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Today’s post looks at the early months of the Second Continental Congress. </i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Before the First Continental Congress adjourned in October 1774, its members agreed to reconvene in Philadelphia on May 10, 1775. By the time Congress met again, the Battles of Lexington and Concord had occurred and the siege of Boston was under way—the de facto government had a lot to do.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/prologue.blogs.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/06783_2009_001_PR-827x1024.jpg?resize=685%2C848&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Peyton Randolph was elected president of the Congress but was forced to return to Virginia in late May. On May 24, 1775, Congress unanimously elected <a href=\"https://prologue.blogs.archives.gov/2019/09/12/john-hancock-and-his-signature/\">John Hancock</a> to replace Randolph. The 39-year-old Hancock had already amassed an impressive resume. The Harvard College graduate was a multiterm selectman of Boston, was a member of the provincial legislature from 1766 to 1772, served as president of the Provincial Congress in 1774, and served as a delegate from Massachusetts to the First Continental Congress. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/prologue.blogs.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/09/Box_265_30-n-031-0225-155772142-1576689145230-712x1024.jpg?resize=685%2C985&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/135797826\">National Archives Identifier 135797826</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>Congress then turned its attention to raising an army and finding someone to lead it. After the Battles of Lexington and Concord, about 20,000 provincial militiamen had assembled in the Boston area to stave off British forces. Congress proposed using these men as the core of a Continental Army.</p>\n    <p>On June 14, 1775, Congress voted to create the Continental Army out of the militia units around Boston, and on June 15, 1775, Congress unanimously elected George Washington as the commander in chief of the Continental forces.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/prologue.blogs.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/06843-2024-001-ac_1600x1600-748x1024.jpg?resize=685%2C938&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/prologue.blogs.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/06843-2024-002-ac_1600x1600-779x1024.jpg?resize=685%2C900&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Washington had served in the Virginia militia as a major in the French and Indian War. Congress chose Washington in part because of his military experience, but also he was seen as someone who could help unite the colonies.</p>\n    <p>The following day Washington accepted, <a href=\"https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/03-01-02-0001\">saying</a>:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>Mr President, Tho’ I am truly sensible of the high Honour done me in this Appointment, yet I feel great distress, from a consciousness that my abilities &amp; Military experience may not be equal to the extensive &amp; important Trust: However, as the Congress desire i⟨t⟩ I will enter upon the momentous duty, &amp; exert every power I Possess In their service &amp; for the Support of the glorious Cause: I beg they will accept my most cordial thanks for this distinguished testimony of their Approbation.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/prologue.blogs.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/01645_2008_002_PR-661x1024.jpg?resize=661%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/485331790\">National Archives Identifier 485331790</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>While Congress was meeting, the so-called Battle of Bunker Hill occurred. After <a href=\"https://prologue.blogs.archives.gov/2025/04/18/lexington-and-concord-22-hours-and-a-shot-heard-around-the-world/\">Lexington and Concord</a>, the British troops were eager to quash the rebellion and in June planned to launch an attack on Boston. Details of their plan were leaked, and about 1,000 Massachusetts and Connecticut soldiers gathered to defend a hill in Charlestown.</p>\n    <p>The battle occurred on June 17 and was mistakenly known as the Battle of Bunker Hill (in reality, it was “Breed’s Hill”). Although the British prevailed, they incurred a high number of casualties, signaling to the Americans that they had a fighting chance.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/prologue.blogs.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/148-GW-454-1024x677.jpg?resize=685%2C453&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/532897\">National Archives Identifier 532897</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>Congress, however, had not yet fully given up on reconciliation with Britain. On July 6, 1775, Congress approved a <a href=\"https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-01-02-0113-0005\">Declaration of Causes</a> outlining the rationale and necessity for the colonies taking up arms, arguing:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>In our own native Land, in defence of the Freedom that is our Birthright, and which we ever enjoyed till the late Violation of it—for the protection of our Property, acquired solely by the honest Industry of our fore-fathers and ourselves, against Violence actually offered, we have taken up Arms. We shall lay them down when Hostilities shall cease on the part of the Aggressors, and all danger of their being renewed shall be removed, and not before.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>Congress also sent King George III the <a href=\"https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-01-02-0114\">Olive Branch Petition</a>, a final attempt at resolving disputes between the colonies and Great Britain. The King, however, refused to receive it and in response to the Battle of Bunker Hill issued a Proclamation of Rebellion in which he declared the colonies to be in a state of open rebellion. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/prologue.blogs.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/00946_2002_001_PR-796x1024.jpg?resize=685%2C881&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/44276869\">National Archives Identifier 44276869</a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/prologue.blogs.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/00946_2002_002_PR-787x1024.jpg?resize=685%2C891&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/44276869\">National Archives Identifier 44276869</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>With Great Britain refusing to negotiate, the colonies were on their way to realizing that a reconciliation with the crown may not be possible and independence might be their best option.</p>\n    <p><i>Want to know more?

But all too often, our own behavior can get in the way. To ensure a smoother, more courteous journey for everyone, don’t make the following 11 airplane mistakes.<br/>\nSteering clear of certain behaviors can help you stay in your fellow passengers’ good graces, while avoiding others might actually save your life. Read on to find out what not to do on a plane.</p>\n<p>Where would you rather be when you discover that Ambien makes you hallucinate or that you're allergic to your new antibiotic—at home, with easy access to your doctor and a local hospital, or in a metal tube hurtling 35,000 feet above the ocean? Never take a medicine on a plane without having tested it at home first to learn how you react.</p>\n<p>I know—the briefing is boring, you've heard it a million times, and you already know how to buckle a seatbelt. Although it may seem tedious, the information could save your life one day. At the very least, take a few seconds to figure out where the nearest emergency exit is and how many rows away it is from your seat. (In a dark or smoky cabin, you'll want to be able to count the rows by touching the seats as you make your way toward an exit.)</p>\n<p>No one is going to laugh at your one-liner about guns, weapons, or anything else that could be taken as threatening, particularly not the flight attendants, who have the power to remove you from a flight if they think there's even the slightest chance you might pose a security risk.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest debates in the travel world is whether it's okay to recline your seat. Regardless of which side of the issue you take, I think we can all agree that once the food and drink carts start rolling down the aisles, it's only courteous to ensure your seat is upright so the person behind you can have full access to their tray.</p>\n<p>No one will complain if you have a glass of wine with dinner, but over-indulging in alcohol can have consequences ranging from dehydration to even getting kicked off the plane for disorderly behavior. Remember: No one wants to sit next to the flyer who reeks of alcohol, passes out on your shoulder, or throws up on your shoes.</p>\n<p>Speaking of mealtimes, give your seatmates a break—don't show up for your flight with a tuna sandwich or a plate of onion rings. Not only will they stink while you're eating them, but they'll also ensure that you have bad breath for the rest of the flight.</p>\n<p>The flight attendants' first priority is to keep you safe, not to cater to your every whim, so use discretion when deciding when to hit that call button. If you're feeling ill or you're thirsty on an overnight flight when the lights are out and getting up would wake your sleeping seatmates, feel free to hit the button. If the flight attendants are already serving dinner and all you want to do is request a soda, sit down and be patient.</p>\n<p>As pet peeves go, this is one of my biggest—when the person in 33A puts her carry-on in the bin above row 16, ensuring that there won't be enough space for the people actually sitting in row 16 to stow their own bags. This means people in the front of the plane end up having to put their bags toward the back, which leads to passengers trying to go against the stream of traffic when it comes time to deplane. Do everyone a favor and use your own overhead bin space unless there's no alternative.</p>\n<p>In other carry-on shenanigans, please don't be the person who puts their rolling suitcase, backpack, and coat into the overhead bin on a full flight. Leave space for other people's belongings by placing your personal item under the seat in front of you and squeezing your coat into the empty spaces left after everyone else has fitted their larger bags into the bin.</p>\n<p>I have no problem with people slipping off their shoes to be more comfortable on a long flight, with a few important exceptions.</p>\n<p>First, your feet should be as unobtrusive as possible to everyone else (so don't prop them on top of a seatback, or wriggle them into the gap between the wall of the plane and the poor person in the seat in front of you who just wants to lean against the window without getting a faceful of your bare toes.)</p>\n<p>Second, put your shoes back on before going to the bathroom (we’ve seen a lot of mystery liquids on those floors.) And finally, if you know you're prone to bromodosis—the polite scientific term for smelly feet—be considerate of your fellow passengers and leave your shoes on.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

This edition explores the first battles of the American Revolutionary War: Lexington and Concord. Today’s post comes from Tracy Baker, an intern in the National Archives Office of the Executive Secretariat.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Boston, Massachusetts, the largest city in the 13 colonies, played a critical role in the American Revolution. Frustrated with the British Crown’s implementation of taxation without representation, in 1773, colonists protested by dumping 342 chests of tea into the Boston harbor in what’s known as the Boston Tea Party.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/532892\">National Archives Identifier 532892</a>\n    </p>\n<p>The British Crown responded with the Intolerable Acts, which restricted the power of colonial governments, closed the Port of Boston, and allowed British troops to be quartered in private homes. The arrival of British warships and “Regulars” into Boston further escalated tensions in the colony. General Thomas Gage, the Royal Governor of Massachusetts, oversaw the implementation of the Intolerable Acts and led the British troops stationed in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/405229121\">National Archives Identifier 405229121</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Revolutionary leaders like John Hancock and Samuel Adams, previously residing in Boston, were forced to flee to the Massachusetts countryside. By early April 1775, only the area around Boston remained under British control, while the rest of Massachusetts was in open rebellion.</p>\n<p>As tensions rose, American colonists developed alert signals and prepared minutemen to fight at a moment’s notice. Moreover, both the British and Americans employed a network of spies to gather intelligence. When General Gage received orders from London to use force in repelling resistance and to arrest Revolutionary leaders, the prelude to the American Revolutionary War unfolded.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/532844\">National Archives Identifier 532844</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/135797826\">National Archives Identifier 135797826</a>\n    </p>\n<p>At 10 p.m. on April 18, 1775, using intelligence from British spies, Gage ordered Lieutenant Colonel Francis Smith to march 700 soldiers to Concord to seize and destroy a known stockpile of military supplies. Dr. Joseph Warren, a physician in Boston, quickly learned of General Gage’s plans and sent Paul Revere and William Dawes to alert the Massachusetts countryside.</p>\n<p>Two lanterns were hung in the Old North Church, the tallest structure in Boston, to signal that the British were heading west by water. At 12:30 a.m. on April 19, 1775, Revere and Dawes arrived in Lexington and met briefly with John Hancock and Samuel Adams before continuing west. When word of the British movement arrived at Concord, the town’s minutemen and militia quickly began removing and hiding any remaining military stockpiles. Meanwhile, Captain Parker of the Lexington Militia mustered his company on the town green.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/6219851\">National Archives Identifier 6219851</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Ferrying 700 British soldiers across the Charles River took over three hours. By the time the royal troops completed the river crossing at 2 a.m., any hope of secrecy was spoiled. The colonists rang bells and fired gunshots through the night. Cold and wet, the British troops began their 16-mile march to Concord.</p>\n<p>At 4:30 a.m., Captain Parker of Lexington armed his militia and prepared to meet the British infantry on the path to Concord. Parker is known to have proclaimed to his militia, “Stand your ground. Don’t fire unless fired upon, but if they mean to have a war, let it begin here.”</p>\n<p>Around 5 a.m., British forces confronted the militia on the Lexington Green. The exact details of what happened in Lexington that April 19th morning remain a mystery. Parker’s men, outnumbered, began to withdraw from the British line. However, when a gunshot from an unknown source went off, the British and militiamen engaged in a volley of shots.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/595246\">National Archives Identifier 595246</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/6883170\">National Archives Identifier 6883170</a>\n    </p>\n<p>The fighting in Lexington resulted in the death of 8 colonists and the injury of 10 others. The British troops suffered no casualties and continued on their march to Concord. Reuben Brown, an alarm rider stationed in Lexington, hastily raced to Concord to inform the town leadership of the shots fired. Knowing the war had already begun at Lexington, the Concord militia and minutemen waited for the British troops to arrive.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/135797302\">National Archives Identifier 135797302</a>\n    </p>\n<p>When the British regulars entered Concord at 7 a.m., they sought to secure the two bridges in the town as soon as possible. The colonial militia, once again outnumbered, retreated across the North Bridge and away from the town center. Under the orders of Royal Governor Gage, the British regulars started searching the town and houses.</p>\n<p>The British troops had intelligence that James Barrett of Concord was gathering and storing arms and military supplies. Seven British companies went west across the North Bridge to search Barrett’s house. Understanding that the bridge was their only access point back to the full forces of the British troops, three companies of British soldiers stayed to maintain control of the North Bridge while the remaining companies continued west to search Barrett’s farm.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/454997821\">National Archives Identifier 454997821</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Near the North Bridge, under the cover of Punkatasset Hill, colonial militia members spotted smoke coming from the Concord town center. Concern quickly spread through the ranks of the colonial troops. Around 9:30 a.m., in an impromptu decision, several companies of colonial troops began marching toward the North Bridge. The three British companies left to guard the bridge were hopelessly outnumbered.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Roosevelt to President Harry S. Truman also happened suddenly. While at his cottage in Warm Springs, Georgia, Roosevelt died at 3:45 p.m. on April 12, 1945, after suffering a brain hemorrhage.</p>\n    <p>After presiding in the Senate, Vice President Harry S. Truman had gone to Speaker Sam Rayburn’s office. The White House press secretary reached him there and told him to come to the White House at once. When Truman arrived, Eleanor Roosevelt told him that President Roosevelt had died. At 7:05 that evening, Truman took the oath of office as President of the United States.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/prologue.blogs.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/73-1909.jpg?resize=685%2C542&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/338954914\">National Archives Identifier 338954914</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>While unexpected transitions are always upsetting, for many President Roosevelt death was especially traumatic. For young people, Roosevelt was the only President they had known, as he had been President for over 11 years. Roosevelt guided the nation through the worst economic depression in our history, and, since 1941, led the country through the trials of World War II. Many people barely knew anything about Harry S. Truman and felt unsure about his leadership.</p>\n    <p>One group of people with confidence in Truman’s leadership and skills were his many friends and acquaintances throughout Missouri. Almost immediately, they wrote to Truman to express words of support and encouragement. Truman’s high school math teacher, Ardelia Palmer, wrote to her former student the following day.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/prologue.blogs.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/828216-01-01-678x1024.jpg?resize=678%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/173979799\">National Archives Identifier 173979799</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>One of Truman’s comrades in World War I, Judge Albert Ridge, <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/173979730\">wrote to Truman</a> saying, “Everyone I have met in Kansas City expresses great confidence in your capacity to pick up the reins of government and carry on, and lead us to peace and a greater America.” Truman received <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/173979607\">a telegram</a> from Kansas City businessman and friend Benjamin Sosland, who stated, “To me you have the qualities and the character that is needed to give to America the leadership that it needs at this time.”</p>\n    <p>Truman also received letters of support from politicians across the country. Former President Herbert Hoover immediately reached out to the new President via telegram, telling him, “You have the right to call for any service in aid of the country.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/prologue.blogs.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/hst-ppf_95_01-02-1024x738.jpg?resize=685%2C494&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/7234169?objectPage=3\">National Archives Identifier 7234169</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>In his reply to former President Hoover, Truman added a <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/7234169?objectPage=4\">handwritten postscript</a>, “I assure you I shall feel free to call upon you. Thanks for the offer.”</p>\n    <p>Truman also received a letter of support from the man who would run against him in 1948, Governor Thomas Dewey of New York. Governor Dewey wrote, “Permit me to extend to you . . . my best wishes for your every success in leading the United States through the difficult years ahead.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/prologue.blogs.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/827621-01-02-728x1024.jpg?resize=685%2C964&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/173979677?objectPage=2\">National Archives Identifier 173979677</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>Celebrities also reached out to President Truman to offer words of encouragement. Baroness Maria Von Trapp, of the Von Trapp family singers, wrote to Truman. In her letter, she wrote, “It was with the greatest joy of heart that we read your message in the paper this noon, ‘Please pray for me, I really mean it.’ It made the deepest impression on us, and we do not want to lose any time in letting you know that we already started on the very first evening after you had taken your oath, to pray for our new President.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/prologue.blogs.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/hst-ppf-9v45-vontrapp-02-705x1024.jpg?resize=685%2C995&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/7839916?objectPage=2\">National Archives Identifier 7839916</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/7839916?objectPage=3\">\n        <graphic data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"685\" height=\"1003\" data-attachment-id=\"38134\" data-permalink=\"https://prologue.blogs.archives.gov/2025/04/09/presidential-transitions-roosevelt-to-truman/hst-ppf-9v45-vontrapp-03/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/prologue.blogs.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/hst-ppf-9v45-vontrapp-03-scaled.jpg?fit=1746%2C2560&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1746,2560\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Baroness Maria Von Trapp to President Harry S.

She had suddenly become First Lady when President Warren Harding died on August 2, 1923, and her husband, Calvin Coolidge, became President. Mrs. Coolidge wrote, “I am confident that our nation will be guided wisely through these challenging times by President Truman.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/prologue.blogs.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/5956068-095-002-1024x411.jpg?resize=685%2C275&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/496087003?objectPage=2\">National Archives Identifier 496087003</a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/prologue.blogs.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/5956068-095-003-1024x774.jpg?resize=685%2C518&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/496087003?objectPage=3\">National Archives Identifier 496087003</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Learn about Harry S.

Roosevelt signed legislation establishing the National Archives on June 19, 1934. For its first 15 years, the National Archives operated as an independent agency with the Archivist of the United States being appointed by the President.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/prologue.blogs.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2014/08/08441_2005_001_pr-e1409221509818-669x1024.jpg?resize=669%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"First page of the National Archives Act, June 19, 1934 (National Archives Identifier 299840)\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/299840\">National Archives Identifier 299840</a>)</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/prologue.blogs.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2014/08/08441_2005_003_pr-e1409221533507-667x1024.jpg?resize=667%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Third page of the National Archives Act, June 19, 1934 (National Archives Identifier 299840)\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/299840\">National Archives Identifier 299840</a>)</p>\n    <p>Then, in the late 1940s, the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government, known as the Hoover Commission because former President Herbert C. Hoover chaired it, began to study changes to government to promote efficiency. When the commission set out, they hadn’t planned on addressing the issue of records management. However, Assistant Archivist of the United States Wayne Grover recommended that it looked into the issue, hoping to bring more attention to records in federal custody.</p>\n    <p>This backfired and on June 30, 1949, <a href=\"https://prologue.blogs.archives.gov/2024/06/17/how-the-national-archives-became-nars/\">Congress passed legislation</a> moving the National Archives into the newly created General Services Administration (GSA) and renamed it the National Archives and Records Service (NARS). Moving forward, the Administrator of the GSA appointed the Archivist of the United States, not the President. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/prologue.blogs.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/04/06241_2009_001_pr-666x1024.jpg?resize=666%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/prologue.blogs.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/06241_2009_002_PR-668x1024.jpg?resize=668%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>From the National Archives’ perspective, it and the GSA did not have compatible missions—the National Archives stored and preserved federal government records of enduring value, and advocated for scholarly research of those records. The GSA was created to streamline the administrative functions of government, and manage public buildings and property.</p>\n    <p>From the very beginning, the historical and archival communities questioned the wisdom of placing our nation’s documentary heritage in the hands of those who are also, as Maryland Senator Charles Mathias put it, “the custodian of washrooms, storerooms, and workrooms.”</p>\n    <p>Throughout the GSA years, historical and archival communities made several calls for an independent National Archives, but the big push came in 1979. That year Admiral Rowland Freeman, Administrator of the GSA, directed the National Archives to come up with a plan to decentralize its holdings from Washington, DC, to the various regional archives around the country.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/prologue.blogs.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Regionalization-of-Records-NA-Issuance-Jan.-22-1980-RG-64-P-42-794x1024.jpg?resize=685%2C883&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>After intense criticism from the historical community, Freeman dropped the decentralization plan, but the fight over the issue, and other issues between the GSA and the National Archives, resulted in a push to have Congress pass legislation to separate NARS from the GSA.</p>\n    <p>At this same time, <a href=\"https://prologue.blogs.archives.gov/2016/06/20/fighting-for-independence-sixth-archivist-robert-m-warner/\">Robert Warner</a> had became the sixth Archivist of the United States. Warner had made it his mission to gain independence for the National Archives. According to his book,<i> Diary of a Dream,</i> a group of six dedicated staff members met regularly to discuss their strategy in regards to Congress, the press, other allied agencies, and anyone else who might help get National Archives its independence. </p>\n    <p>In 1980 Senator Robert Morgan introduced the first bill to make the National Archives independent of the GSA. Although the Senate never acted on it, the Morgan Bill was an important step in the fight for independence.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/prologue.blogs.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/s_2852_nara_1980_print-699x1024.jpg?resize=685%2C1003&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Other pieces of legislation were introduced, but it was S. 905, which Senator Thomas Eagleton introduced in 1983, that garnered enough bipartisan support to move forward. In addition to organizations like the American Historical Association, the National Association of Government Archives and Records Administrators, the Coalition to Save Our Documentary Heritage, and the Society of American Archivists, groups of genealogists, educators, and other professionals also lobbied members of Congress and their staffs, educating them on the importance preserving and making government records available.</p>\n    <p>In early October of 1984, both the House and the Senate passed the bill and sent it to President Ronald Reagan on October 4 for his approval. Fifteen days later, on the advice of Edwin Meese, then counselor to the President, Reagan signed the bill into law effective April 1, 1985. The legislation reestablished the National Archives as an independent agency whose head was appointed by the President.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/598392\">\n        <graphic data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"632\" height=\"945\" data-attachment-id=\"17974\" data-permalink=\"https://prologue.blogs.archives.gov/2016/03/24/claudine-weiher-the-fight-for-independence/10576_2004_001_a/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/prologue.blogs.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/10576_2004_001_a.jpg?fit=632%2C945&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"632,945\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;US National Archives &amp; Records A&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Public Law 98-497, Establishment of an independent National Archives and Records Administration\\r10576_2004_001&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"10576_2004_001_a\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;Public Law 98-497, Establishment of an independent National Archives and Records Administration, 10/19/1984.

    "body": "<p><i>In celebration of the upcoming 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, we’re focusing on key events in the history of our nation’s independence. </i>This edition provides deeper insight into Patrick Henry and his famous proclamation: “Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death.” Today’s post comes from Tracy Baker, an intern in the National Archives Office of the Executive Secretariat. </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/41679145\">National Archives Identifier 41679145</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Following the Seven Years’ War (1756–63), the British Crown needed to raise money to account for the massive accumulated debt. The Crown decided that increasing taxes on the North American colonies would serve as a sufficient solution. Specifically, Parliament enacted various taxation acts, including the Sugar Act (1764) and the Stamp Act (1765). The colonists, many of whom fought alongside the British military just a few years prior, were outraged by the onset of taxation without representation, deeming it a violation of British constitutional law.</p>\n<p>As a newly selected member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, the first democratically elected legislative body in the British American colonies, Patrick Henry gained popularity as an outspoken opponent of Parliamentary taxation. In May of 1765, Henry introduced the Stamp Act Resolves, protesting the Stamp Act and asserting colonial rights. In a speech delivered to the House of Burgesses, Henry warned that King George III risked the fate of the backstabbed Julius Caesar if he continued to disregard American liberty.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/532930\">National Archives Identifier 532930</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Tensions between the Crown and the colonists continued to escalate and culminated in the <a href=\"https://prologue.blogs.archives.gov/tag/boston-tea-party/\">Boston Tea Party</a>. Following the rebellion in Massachusetts Bay, the British Parliament passed the Intolerable Acts (Coercive Acts) in 1774, aimed at punishing the colony for their blatant insubordination. In response to the Intolerable Acts, the Virginia House of Burgesses called for a day in June to be set aside to mourn the “destruction [of] Civil Rights.” </p>\n<p>As a result of the “Day of Fasting, Humiliation and Prayer,” the Virginia colony’s royal governor, Lord Dunmore, dissolved the House of Burgesses. Feeling as though their personal liberties were under attack, colonists throughout America called for a boycott of British goods.</p>\n<p>All of the colonies, except for Georgia, sent delegates to set up the terms and means for the enforcement of the boycotts, in what we now know as the <a href=\"https://prologue.blogs.archives.gov/2024/09/03/the-first-continental-congress-convenes/\">First Continental Congress</a>. Patrick Henry, among the seven representatives sent from Virginia to attend the Continental Congress, proclaimed, “The distinctions between Virginians, Pennsylvanians, New Yorkers, and New Englanders, are no more. I am not a Virginian, but an American.”</p>\n<p>When the Congress adjourned, Henry and the other delegates returned to their respective colonies, with plans to reconvene the following year if their grievances were not addressed satisfactorily. Back home in Virginia, Henry began working to organize a volunteer militia company for Hanover County and dealt with the tragic death of his first wife, Sarah Henry.</p>\n<p>In March 1775, Henry resumed an active leadership role in the Revolution, serving at the Second Virginia Convention, which had been set up following the British termination of the House of Burgesses. On March 23, 1775, the fourth day of the Convention in the Henrico Parish Church (<a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/41679145\">St. John’s Church</a>), Patrick Henry introduced three resolutions. The resolutions called for the preparation of a “well-regulated militia,” condemned the royal governor for failing to call the House of Burgesses into session, and called for the Virginia “colony to be immediately put into a posture of defense.”</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/93971844\">National Archives Identifier 93971844</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/93971990\">National Archives Identifier 93971990</a>\n    </p>\n<p>During the succeeding debate over the resolutions, concerns arose regarding whether the move would invite conflict. The emboldened Patrick Henry rose from his seat and delivered his most famous speech in support of his resolutions. Henry warned delegates not to let false hope cloud their judgment, stating there “was no way of judging the future but by the past,” and urged the delegates to understand that “the war [had] actually begun,” thus necessitating the need for a posture of defense.</p>\n<p>The transcription of Henry’s speech is accredited to William Wirt, former United States Attorney General and American author. In the 1817 publication <i>Sketches of the Life and Character of Patrick Henry</i>, Wirt reconstructs the speech given by Henry to motivate his fellow Virginians toward militia preparations for the looming war. In the speech, Wirt describes a dramatic ending to Patrick Henry’s speech in which, with “both arms extended aloft,” his “brows knit,” and “every feature marked with the resolute purpose of his soul, [Henry’s] voice swelled to its boldest note of exclamation,” and proclaimed “give me liberty, or give me death!”</p>\n<p>The intense description of Patrick Henry’s speech in Wirt’s publication has led some historians to question the accuracy of the transcription. Wirt’s quest to depict Henry’s life 19 years after the death of the revolutionist was difficult. Wirt used a variety of media to gain insight into what happened in the Henrico Parish Church, including Henry’s personal collection and interviews with those who had heard Henry deliver his speech. Despite this, Wirt admitted to embellishing the speech as there was no extant written copy.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/535746\">National Archives Identifier 535746</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Although the famous Liberty or Death speech accredited to Patrick Henry may not be a verbatim transcript, it is well known that the delivery of the speech was powerful enough to carry Henry’s proposed resolutions to pass by a majority of 65 to 60.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>In today’s fast-paced world of quick chats and surface-level conversations, the ability to foster meaningful connections has become increasingly valuable. At the heart of this skill lies something deceptively simple yet powerful: asking good questions. Not just any questions, but ones that encourage deeper thinking and authentic sharing, leading to stronger relationships both personally and professionally.</p>\n<p>Think about the last time you felt truly understood during a conversation. In these moments, it’s often not just what we say, but what we’re asked that makes the difference. The right question can unlock thoughts and feelings we didn’t even know we wanted to share.</p>\n<h3>Table of Contents</h3>\n<h2>The Power of Meaningful Questions</h2>\n<p>Imagine you’re at a party making <a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/762891/small-talk-guide\">small talk</a>. Instead of the usual “How’s work?” someone asks, “What’s been inspiring you lately?” Suddenly, the conversation shifts. You find yourself sharing thoughts about a book that changed your perspective or a recent experience that moved you. The interaction transforms from polite chit-chat to genuine engagement.</p>\n<p>This power extends beyond social situations. In professional settings, thoughtful questions can lead to better problem-solving and stronger teams. During brainstorming, rather than asking “Any ideas?” try “What would we do if resources were unlimited?” Questions like these spark <a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/834723/how-creativity-can-help-you-get-ahead-in-life\">creativity</a> and innovation.</p>\n<h2>Building Deeper Connections</h2>\n<p>In personal relationships, the right questions create closeness and understanding. Instead of “How was your day?” ask your partner “What was the best moment of your day?” This invites them to share experiences and emotions that might otherwise go unmentioned.</p>\n<p>Self-reflection benefits from good questions too. Asking yourself “What am I avoiding?” or “What would I do if I wasn’t afraid?” can lead to valuable insights and <a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/731921/how-to-make-positive-changes-now\">positive change</a>.</p>\n<p>What makes a question “good”? It’s not just the words, but the intent behind them. The best questions come from genuine curiosity and a desire to understand, not to confirm existing beliefs or direct conversations toward predetermined conclusions.</p>\n<h2>The Impact of Thoughtful Conversations</h2>\n<p>Meaningful conversations are investments in our relationships and <a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/855966/personal-growth-in-life\">personal growth</a>. Through them, we develop empathy by understanding others’ experiences and perspectives. When a coworker seems stressed, asking “What’s been the toughest part of your week?” shows care and helps us provide better support.</p>\n<p>These deeper exchanges create shared experiences and mutual understanding, moving us beyond surface-level interactions. Consider the difference between discussing weather with a neighbor versus exploring hopes for your community’s future. The latter builds stronger connections and shared purpose.</p>\n<p>Research supports this impact on wellbeing. A study in Psychological Science found that people who engage in substantial conversations tend to be happier than those who stick to small talk. The happiest participants had twice as many meaningful conversations and one-third as much small talk as the unhappiest ones.</p>\n<p>At work, thoughtful questions drive innovation and problem-solving. A manager transformed her team’s struggling project by asking, “If we were starting this project today, knowing what we know now, what would we do differently?” This fresh perspective led to successful strategy changes.</p>\n<h2>Creating Better Questions</h2>\n<p>Crafting powerful questions starts with genuine curiosity. Before asking something, consider what you really want to learn about the person or topic. It’s the difference between asking “How’s the new job?” out of politeness versus “What’s been most surprising about your new role?” from genuine interest.</p>\n<p>Open-ended questions invite richer responses. Instead of “Did you enjoy your vacation?” ask “What moment from your trip will you remember most vividly?” This encourages sharing specific experiences and emotions.</p>\n<p>Context matters too. Questions appropriate for close friends might be too personal for new acquaintances. Being mindful of relationships and situations helps create comfortable, meaningful exchanges.</p>\n<h2>The Art of Listening</h2>\n<p>Good questions are only half the equation. <a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/833813/active-listening-skills\">Active listening</a> completes the connection. This means focusing fully on the speaker, understanding their message, and responding thoughtfully. In our distraction-filled world, this skill requires intention and practice.</p>\n<p>Active listening involves giving your complete attention. Put away your phone, maintain appropriate eye contact, and use non-verbal cues like nodding to show engagement. These simple actions encourage others to open up and share more deeply.</p>\n<p>Another key aspect is providing feedback to ensure understanding. This might involve summarizing what you’ve heard or asking clarifying questions. The goal isn’t to evaluate or judge, but to truly understand the speaker’s perspective and experience.</p>\n<h2>Overcoming Conversational Challenges</h2>\n<p>The prospect of deeper conversations can feel intimidating, especially with new people. This <a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/973451/anxiety\">anxiety</a> is common – the racing heart, sweaty palms, and fear of saying the wrong thing. However, several strategies can help overcome these barriers.</p>\n<p>Preparation helps <a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/891308/build-confidence\">build confidence</a>. Having a few thoughtful questions in mind can provide a safety net in social situations. This isn’t about scripting conversations but having starting points for meaningful dialogue.</p>\n<p>Being kind to yourself is crucial. Everyone has awkward moments, and not every conversation will flow perfectly. Each interaction is a chance to learn and improve, not a test to pass or fail.</p>\n<p>Focusing on the other person can help manage social anxiety. When you’re genuinely interested in understanding someone else, self-consciousness often fades naturally. Remember that most people appreciate sincere interest in their thoughts and experiences.</p>\n<h2>Technology and Modern Communication</h2>\n<p>Technology has transformed how we connect, creating both opportunities and challenges for meaningful conversation. While digital tools help us stay in touch across distances, they can also create barriers to authentic connection.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is one of the most widely recognized frameworks for understanding human <a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/614250/how-envy-drains-your-motivation\">motivation</a>. While originally proposed in the 1940s, its principles remain relevant today, offering profound insights into how people’s needs drive their behaviors across various <a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/900399/aspects-of-life\">aspects of life</a>. By exploring this theory and its applications, we can uncover practical strategies for <a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/855966/personal-growth-in-life\">personal growth</a>, workplace improvement, educational success, and even healthcare advancements. Let’s dive into how this timeless concept continues to shape our understanding of motivation and fulfillment.</p>\n<h3>Table of Contents</h3>\n<h2>The Foundations of Maslow’s Hierarchy</h2>\n<p>Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is typically represented as a pyramid with five levels, each corresponding to a category of human needs. This pyramid format effectively illustrates the progression from basic survival needs to more complex psychological and self-fulfillment needs, showing how each level builds upon the previous one.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Physiological Needs</strong>: The most basic requirements for survival, such as food, water, shelter, sleep, and reproduction. These are the foundation upon which all other needs are built.</li>\n      <li><strong>Safety Needs</strong>: Once physiological needs are met, people seek safety and stability. This includes physical safety, financial security, health, and protection from harm.</li>\n      <li><strong>Love and Belonging</strong>: Social connections become a priority, encompassing relationships with family, friends, and communities. Humans have an inherent need to feel loved and included.</li>\n      <li><strong>Esteem Needs</strong>: At this level, individuals focus on achieving self-respect and recognition from others. This involves feelings of accomplishment,<a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/610923/how-to-build-self-confidence-from-scratch\">confidence</a>, and a sense of value.</li>\n      <li><strong>Self-Actualization</strong>: The peak of the pyramid represents the fulfillment of personal potential,<a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/834723/how-creativity-can-help-you-get-ahead-in-life\">creativity</a>, and self-growth. It’s about becoming the best version of oneself.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Maslow argued that people generally address these needs sequentially, starting with the most basic ones. However, this model isn’t rigid; individuals may fluctuate between levels depending on life circumstances.</p>\n<h2>Transforming the Workplace Through Maslow’s Principles</h2>\n<p>Understanding the hierarchy of needs can revolutionize workplace dynamics. Forward-thinking organizations address employee needs holistically, enhancing <a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/what-is-productivity\">productivity</a>, morale, and retention. Consider how each level translates into actionable strategies:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Physiological Needs</strong>: Provide fair wages, adequate breaks, and comfortable working conditions to ensure employees’ basic requirements are met.</li>\n      <li><strong>Safety Needs</strong>: Offer job security, enforce ethical practices, and create a safe physical environment.</li>\n      <li><strong>Love and Belonging</strong>: Foster a culture of collaboration and inclusion through team-building activities, open communication, and recognition of diverse perspectives.</li>\n      <li><strong>Esteem Needs</strong>: Implement programs that acknowledge individual achievements, provide opportunities for skill development, and encourage employee contributions.</li>\n      <li><strong>Self-Actualization</strong>: Encourage innovation, creativity, and personal growth by supporting employees’ professional aspirations and offering mentorship programs.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>For example, companies like Google integrate these principles seamlessly by offering free meals (physiological needs), wellness programs (safety needs), and creative freedom (self-actualization). This holistic approach results in thriving, innovative workplaces where employees feel valued and inspired.</p>\n<h2>Empowering Education With Maslow’s Framework</h2>\n<p>Maslow’s hierarchy offers valuable guidance for educators aiming to create environments where students can excel. By addressing each level of the pyramid, schools and educators can foster engagement and success:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Physiological Needs</strong>: Ensure access to nutritious meals, hydration, and comfortable learning spaces.</li>\n      <li><strong>Safety Needs</strong>: Establish clear rules, prevent bullying, and create a predictable, stable environment.</li>\n      <li><strong>Love and Belonging</strong>: Promote supportive teacher-student relationships and encourage collaboration among peers.</li>\n      <li><strong>Esteem Needs</strong>: Recognize and celebrate student achievements, fostering confidence and a sense of accomplishment.</li>\n      <li><strong>Self-Actualization</strong>: Inspire creativity and critical thinking by providing opportunities for exploration and self-expression.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>When foundational needs are met, students are more likely to thrive academically and personally, unlocking their full potential.</p>\n<h2>Holistic Approaches in Healthcare and Counseling</h2>\n<p>In healthcare and counseling, Maslow’s hierarchy can guide practitioners toward more effective and compassionate care. Holistic approaches that address both physical and emotional needs result in better outcomes:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Physiological Needs</strong>: Ensure access to basic medical care, proper nutrition, and rest.</li>\n      <li><strong>Safety Needs</strong>: Provide a secure environment, clear communication, and trustworthy care providers.</li>\n      <li><strong>Love and Belonging</strong>: Build rapport with patients and involve their families in the care process.</li>\n      <li><strong>Esteem Needs</strong>: Respect patients’ autonomy and validate their concerns, enhancing their self-esteem.</li>\n      <li><strong>Self-Actualization</strong>: Support long-term wellness goals and personal development through tailored care plans.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>This comprehensive approach not only fosters recovery but also promotes dignity and empowerment, encouraging patients to take active roles in their well-being.</p>\n<h2>Adapting Maslow’s Hierarchy for Modern Times</h2>\n<p>While Maslow’s hierarchy remains influential, it’s important to acknowledge its limitations and modern adaptations. Critics argue that the model oversimplifies human motivation by implying a strict progression of needs. Additionally, it lacks empirical evidence and may not account for cultural differences or individual variability.</p>\n<p>Modern adaptations address these concerns by incorporating additional dimensions, such as cognitive, aesthetic, and transcendence needs. For instance:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Cognitive Needs</strong>: The desire for knowledge, understanding, and mental stimulation.</li>\n      <li><strong>Aesthetic Needs</strong>: The appreciation of beauty and balance in life.</li>\n      <li><strong>Transcendence Needs</strong>: Connecting with something greater than oneself, such as spirituality or altruism.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>These updates make the model more flexible and applicable to diverse contexts. Schools that adopt inquiry-based learning address cognitive needs, while healthcare providers use healing environments to meet aesthetic needs. By embracing these nuances, the hierarchy becomes a more robust framework for understanding and addressing human motivation.</p>\n<h2>Applying Maslow’s Hierarchy to Personal Growth</h2>\n<p>For individuals striving for personal growth, Maslow’s hierarchy provides a roadmap for identifying unmet needs and setting meaningful goals. Here’s how to use it in daily life:</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

The constant emotional drain, manipulation, and criticism can leave even the strongest individuals feeling depleted and questioning their self-worth.</p>\n<p>But there’s hope. With the right strategies and mindset, you can not only survive but thrive in the face of narcissistic behavior. This guide will help you navigate these challenging dynamics, protect your well-being, and rediscover your strength.</p>\n<h3>Table of Contents</h3>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#understanding-the-narcissists-playbook\">Understanding the Narcissist's Playbook</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#the-hidden-toll-how-narcissists-drain-your-time-and-energy\">The Hidden Toll: How Narcissists Drain Your Time and Energy</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#setting-boundaries-the-foundation-of-self-protection\">Setting Boundaries: The Foundation of Self-Protection</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#the-art-of-non-engagement-disrupting-their-patterns\">The Art of Non-Engagement: Disrupting Their Patterns</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#reclaiming-your-energy-the-power-of-self-care\">Reclaiming Your Energy: The Power of Self-Care</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#educating-yourself-knowledge-as-empowerment\">Educating Yourself: Knowledge as Empowerment</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#recognizing-when-to-leave-protecting-your-long-term-well-being\">Recognizing When to Leave: Protecting Your Long-Term Well-Being</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#thriving-beyond-narcissism\">Thriving Beyond Narcissism</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>Understanding the Narcissist’s Playbook</h2>\n<p>To effectively handle interactions with narcissists, it’s crucial to first understand what drives their behavior. Narcissism is characterized by:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong>An inflated sense of self-importance</strong>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>An insatiable need for admiration</strong>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>A profound lack of empathy for others</strong>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<p>These traits manifest in many ways, from dominating conversations to expecting special treatment in every situation. It’s not just about being self-centered; it’s about a fundamental disregard for others’ thoughts, feelings, and experiences.</p>\n<p>For example, a narcissist might monopolize discussions, constantly redirecting attention to themselves. Over time, this behavior can erode your sense of value and importance, whether in personal relationships or professional collaborations.</p>\n<h3>Narcissistic Traits vs. Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD)</h3>\n<p>It’s important to note that not everyone who exhibits narcissistic behaviors has NPD. Narcissistic traits exist on a spectrum:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Mild narcissistic tendencies</strong>may appear in individuals who occasionally act self-centered but can still recognize and adjust their behavior.</li>\n      <li><strong>Full-blown NPD</strong>is a clinically diagnosed condition involving pervasive patterns of grandiosity and entitlement.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Understanding this distinction helps you tailor your strategies. For someone with NPD, protecting yourself often becomes the priority, as the prognosis for change is typically poor. However, for those with narcissistic tendencies, managed interaction and boundary-setting might yield better outcomes.</p>\n<h2>The Hidden Toll: How Narcissists Drain Your Time and Energy</h2>\n<p>One of the most insidious aspects of dealing with narcissists is how they gradually consume your emotional and mental resources. Often, this drain happens so subtly that you don’t notice the extent of it until you’re completely exhausted.</p>\n<h3>Recognizing the Patterns</h3>\n<p>Consider how much time and energy is spent on:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Direct interactions with the narcissist</li>\n      <li>Preparing for these encounters</li>\n      <li>Recovering from their impact</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>You might find that what seemed like occasional annoyances actually occupy a significant portion of your day. This isn’t just about time spent in their presence; it’s the mental replaying of conversations, second-guessing decisions, or bracing yourself for the next encounter.</p>\n<h3>Taking Back Control</h3>\n<p>Start tracking how much of your energy is consumed by these interactions. This awareness often serves as the wake-up call needed to <a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/797417/how-to-make-changes-in-life\">make changes</a>. Once you’ve recognized the toll, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Identify opportunities to minimize contact.</li>\n      <li>Set boundaries that protect your time.</li>\n      <li>Prioritize activities that replenish your energy.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>Setting Boundaries: The Foundation of Self-Protection</h2>\n<p>Establishing boundaries is one of the most effective ways to protect yourself from a narcissist’s behavior. However, it requires strategy, consistency, and <a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/973509/resilience\">resilience</a>.</p>\n<h3>Steps to Setting Effective Boundaries</h3>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Clearly Define Your Limits</strong>Take time to reflect on what behaviors you will no longer tolerate. Write these boundaries down to make them tangible.</li>\n      <li><strong>Communicate Assertively</strong>Use “I” statements to express your needs, e.g., “I need uninterrupted time to focus on my tasks” rather than, “You’re always interrupting me.” This approach reduces defensiveness and keeps the focus on your needs.</li>\n      <li><strong>Anticipate Pushback</strong>Narcissists often react negatively to boundaries. Expect resistance and be prepared to stand firm. Consistency is key.</li>\n      <li><strong>Enforce Consequences</strong>Follow through if boundaries are crossed. For example, if a narcissist constantly interrupts you, end the conversation politely but firmly: “We can continue this discussion later when interruptions aren’t an issue.”</li>\n    </ul>\n<h3>The Reality of Boundary-Setting</h3>\n<p>Boundary-setting isn’t a one-time event; it’s an ongoing process. As situations evolve, so too will your boundaries. Be patient with yourself and recognize that this is a sign of growth, not failure.</p>\n<h2>The Art of Non-Engagement: Disrupting Their Patterns</h2>\n<p>One of the most effective techniques for dealing with narcissists is learning the <strong>Grey Rock Technique</strong>. This involves becoming as uninteresting as possible to the narcissist by minimizing emotional reactions and keeping interactions neutral.</p>\n<h3>How to Apply the Grey Rock Technique</h3>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Keep responses short and unemotional.</strong>For example, reply with “I see” or “That’s interesting” rather than engaging deeply.</li>\n      <li><strong>Avoid sharing personal information</strong>that could be used to manipulate you.</li>\n      <li><strong>Maintain politeness without enthusiasm.</strong>The goal is to provide no emotional fuel for the narcissist’s behavior.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>By disrupting their expected patterns of interaction, you reduce their ability to draw energy or satisfaction from engaging with you. While this approach may feel unnatural at first, it’s a powerful way to protect your peace of mind.</p>\n<h2>Reclaiming Your Energy: The Power of Self-Care</h2>\n<p>Dealing with narcissistic behavior can be emotionally draining. To counteract this, adopt an <strong>Energy First Mindset.</strong></p>\n<h3>Practical Steps to Replenish Your Energy</h3>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>Imagine being swept off your feet by a whirlwind romance, only to discover it’s a calculated tactic of manipulation. This is the essence of love bombing, a phenomenon gaining increasing attention in the world of relationships. Love bombing is a manipulative strategy where someone overwhelms their partner with excessive affection, attention, and adoration, often with the hidden agenda of control. At first, it can feel like a dream come true, but the reality can be far more damaging.</p>\n<p>Consider Sarah, who met Tom at a friend’s party. Within days, Tom was texting her constantly, surprising her with lavish gifts, and proclaiming she was his soulmate. Sarah felt like she was living a fairy tale, but her friends began to worry about the intensity and speed of the relationship. This scenario, while seemingly romantic, illustrates how love bombing often begins – a flood of affection that can mask darker intentions.</p>\n<h3>Table of Contents</h3>\n<h2>\n      <strong>The Allure and Danger of Overwhelming Affection</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>We’ve all experienced the rush of attraction when meeting someone new. Your heart races, your palms sweat, and you can’t stop thinking about them. It’s a universal experience that poets and songwriters have celebrated for centuries. But when does this natural excitement cross the line into something harmful?</p>\n<p>Love bombing amplifies this initial spark to an unsustainable degree. The person engaging <a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/580032/love\">in love</a> bombing showers their target with compliments, attention, and grand gestures of affection. At first, this can feel like winning the emotional lottery. The intensity of their attention can make you feel uniquely special and understood. However, this overwhelming affection often serves a manipulative purpose. It is designed to fast-track intimacy and make you dependent on their validation.</p>\n<p>The danger lies in how this behavior exploits our natural desire for connection and validation. It bypasses the healthy pace at which trust and intimacy normally grow. When someone offers everything you’ve ever wanted in a partner within a short span of time, it’s easy to ignore red flags. The constant attention, extravagant gestures, and declarations of love can leave you breathless – but also blind to the true motivations behind these actions.</p>\n<p>This manipulation can leave you vulnerable, creating an emotional imbalance that’s difficult to recognize until it’s too late. And when the affection suddenly diminishes or turns into criticism, it can leave you questioning your own judgment and worth.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Understanding How Love Bombing Progresses</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Love bombing typically unfolds in phases, each with distinct patterns that help create and sustain the manipulative dynamic. By understanding these phases, you can better identify and protect yourself from emotional manipulation.</p>\n<h3>\n      <strong>Phase 1: Idealization</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>This is the phase where the love bomber creates an environment of seemingly perfect romance. Their actions include constant texts and calls, lavish gifts, and grand romantic gestures. They may praise you effusively and claim to understand you in ways no one else ever has. At this stage, everything feels magical. You’re swept up in a tidal wave of affection and attention that feels both exhilarating and unique.</p>\n<p>However, the intensity of this phase is often a red flag. Genuine connection takes time to develop, and this flood of affection can create a false sense of intimacy. If the relationship feels too good to be true, it’s worth stepping back and assessing whether the affection is truly genuine or part of a calculated effort.</p>\n<h3>\n      <strong>Phase 2: Devaluation</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>Once the love bomber feels they have secured your trust, the dynamic often shifts. The constant affection may be replaced by subtle criticisms or manipulative behaviors. Compliments turn to put-downs, and they may begin to question your decisions or belittle things they once praised. You might feel confused by their sudden change in demeanor.</p>\n<p>This phase can also include gaslighting, where the love bomber invalidates your feelings or perceptions, making you question your reality. They may isolate you from friends and family, suggesting that these relationships are interfering with your connection. This tactic deepens their control and makes it harder for you to reach out for help.</p>\n<h3>\n      <strong>Phase 3: Discard</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>In some cases, the relationship ends abruptly. The love bomber may withdraw entirely, leaving you feeling abandoned and bewildered. Alternatively, they might cycle between moments of affection and periods of neglect, keeping you emotionally off-balance and dependent on their approval. This rollercoaster dynamic can erode your <a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/597693/why-people-who-have-a-life-purpose-have-higher-self-esteem\">self-esteem</a> and make it difficult to leave the relationship.</p>\n<p>It’s important to recognize that not all relationships follow these exact stages, but the pattern of idealization followed by devaluation is a hallmark of love bombing.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>The Lasting Emotional Impact</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>The aftermath of a love bombing relationship can be deeply painful and long-lasting. Victims often report feelings of confusion, self-doubt, and <a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/887331/emotional-exhaustion\">emotional exhaustion</a>. The stark contrast between the initial idealization and subsequent devaluation can leave you questioning your judgment and struggling to trust others.</p>\n<h3>\n      <strong>Common Effects Include:</strong>\n    </h3>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Lowered Self-Esteem:</strong>Constant criticism and emotional manipulation can undermine your<a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/610923/how-to-build-self-confidence-from-scratch\">confidence</a>.</li>\n      <li><strong/>The stress of navigating the relationship’s highs and lows can take a toll on your mental health.<a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/973451/anxiety\">Anxiety</a>and Depression:</li>\n      <li><strong>Isolation:</strong>Many victims find themselves distanced from their support systems, making it harder to seek help.</li>\n      <li><strong>Trust Issues:</strong>Moving forward, it can be challenging to trust new partners or even your own instincts.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>These emotional wounds may persist long after the relationship ends, but recovery is possible with time, support, and self-care.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Recognizing the Signs and Taking Action</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Self-compassion is far more than an indulgence—it’s a powerful cornerstone for building personal <a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/973509/resilience\">resilience</a> and extending authentic compassion to others, creating a foundation for meaningful connections and emotional strength. To truly cultivate empathy and kindness for others, we must first learn to extend that same grace to ourselves.</p>\n<h3>Table of Contents</h3>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#why-self-compassion-matters\">Why Self-Compassion Matters</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#from-self-to-others-the-ripple-effect\">From Self to Others: The Ripple Effect</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#debunking-myths-the-truth-about-self-compassion\">Debunking Myths: The Truth About Self-Compassion</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#techniques-for-self-compassion-from-letter-writing-to-rain-meditation\">Techniques for Self-Compassion: From Letter-Writing to RAIN Meditation</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#expanding-empathy-the-role-of-loving-kindness-meditation\">Expanding Empathy: The Role of Loving-Kindness Meditation</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#understanding-empathy-and-compassion\">Understanding Empathy and Compassion</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#cultivating-compassion-in-daily-life-mindfulness-beyond-meditation\">Cultivating Compassion in Daily Life: Mindfulness Beyond Meditation</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#the-transformative-power-of-compassion\">The Transformative Power of Compassion</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<h3>Why Self-Compassion Matters</h3>\n<p>Self-compassion entails treating yourself with the same kindness, understanding, and care you’d offer a close friend. It’s about acknowledging your humanity, accepting imperfections, and recognizing that struggles are a universal experience. Studies show that self-compassion leads to increased happiness, motivation, better relationships, and reduced <a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/973451/anxiety\">anxiety</a> and depression.</p>\n<p>Kristin Neff, a pioneer in self-compassion research, breaks it down into three components: self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness. These elements combine to create a foundation for <a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/845528/emotional-resilience\">emotional resilience</a>. When we’re compassionate toward ourselves, we’re better equipped to manage stress and respond to life’s challenges with grace.</p>\n<h3>From Self to Others: The Ripple Effect</h3>\n<p>Self-compassion doesn’t end with the self. By practicing it, we become more attuned to the struggles of others, fostering a natural extension of kindness and empathy. This ripple effect strengthens relationships and community bonds, illustrating how self-care directly influences societal well-being.</p>\n<h2>Debunking Myths: The Truth About Self-Compassion</h2>\n<p>Despite its benefits, self-compassion is often misunderstood, with many associating it with weakness, self-indulgence, or avoidance of responsibility. Common myths prevent people from embracing this transformative practice, leaving them stuck in cycles of self-criticism and <a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/888734/rebound-from-burnout\">burnout</a>. Let’s address and dispel these misconceptions.</p>\n<p>One of the most pervasive myths is that self-compassion makes you weak or complacent. In reality, self-compassion fosters resilience. By treating yourself kindly during setbacks, you build the emotional strength needed to bounce back and face challenges with renewed determination.</p>\n<p>Self-compassion is often conflated with self-indulgence, but the two are vastly different. While self-indulgence involves unchecked gratification, self-compassion focuses on long-term well-being. It’s about making choices that nurture your growth, even if they’re difficult in the short term.</p>\n<p>Another misconception is that self-compassion is an excuse to avoid responsibility. On the contrary, self-compassion helps us acknowledge mistakes without harsh judgment, creating a safe space for accountability and improvement.</p>\n<p>By debunking these myths, we clear the way for more people to embrace self-compassion as a transformative tool for personal and interpersonal growth.</p>\n<h2>Techniques for Self-Compassion: From Letter-Writing to RAIN Meditation</h2>\n<p>Self-compassion is not just a mindset; it’s a practice. Incorporating tangible techniques into your daily life can help you cultivate a kinder relationship with yourself. Here are two powerful methods to get started:</p>\n<h3>Writing a Letter to Yourself</h3>\n<p>Letter-writing is a simple yet profound way to nurture self-compassion. Here’s how to practice it:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Set the Scene</strong>: Find a quiet, comfortable space where you can reflect without interruptions. This creates a calming environment that allows you to focus deeply and engage fully in the exercise, enhancing its effectiveness.</li>\n      <li><strong>Imagine a Compassionate Friend</strong>: Think of what a kind, understanding friend would say to you in your current situation.</li>\n      <li><strong>Write Freely</strong>: Draft a letter to yourself from this perspective, offering encouragement and understanding.</li>\n      <li><strong>Revisit the Letter</strong>: Keep the letter and read it during challenging times to remind yourself of your innate worth.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>This exercise helps reframe negative self-talk and creates a supportive internal dialogue.</p>\n<h3>The RAIN Meditation</h3>\n<p>RAIN is a four-step mindfulness practice designed to cultivate self-compassion during difficult moments:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Recognize</strong>: Acknowledge what you’re feeling.</li>\n      <li><strong>Allow</strong>: Accept your emotions without judgment.</li>\n      <li><strong>Investigate with Kindness</strong>: Explore the underlying causes of your feelings with curiosity and care.</li>\n      <li><strong>Natural Awareness</strong>: Rest in the awareness that these feelings are temporary and do not define you.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Practicing RAIN regularly can help you respond to life’s challenges with greater ease and self-kindness.</p>\n<h2>Expanding Empathy: The Role of Loving-Kindness Meditation</h2>\n<p>Loving-kindness meditation (LKM) is a powerful practice that extends the benefits of self-compassion to others. Rooted in Buddhist traditions, LKM involves sending goodwill and positive intentions to yourself and others. Here’s how it works:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Start with Yourself</strong>: Begin by silently repeating phrases like, “May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I be free from suffering.”</li>\n      <li><strong>Extend to Loved Ones</strong>: Gradually extend these wishes to friends and family.</li>\n      <li><strong>Include Difficult People</strong>: Challenge yourself to send goodwill to those you find challenging.</li>\n      <li><strong>Embrace All Beings</strong>: Expand your circle of compassion to include everyone, everywhere.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Research shows that LKM enhances empathy, increases positive emotions, and reduces biases. For instance, a study published in the Journal of Happiness Studies found that participants who practiced LKM for just 15 minutes a day experienced significant improvements in their emotional well-being and social connectedness. By practicing loving-kindness, you build emotional resilience and foster deeper connections with others.</p>\n<h2>Understanding Empathy and Compassion</h2>\n<p>Although empathy and compassion are closely related, they are distinct concepts. Understanding their differences is crucial for cultivating a balanced approach to emotional intelligence.</p>\n<h3>Empathy: Feeling with Others</h3>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>O n the evening of June 5, 1944, Louis Leroux, his wife, and their six children scrambled atop an embankment near their farm to investigate the sounds of distant explosions. Three miles south, Allied fighter-bombers were attacking bridges over the Douve River on France’s Cotentin Peninsula. In the fading twilight the family watched silhouetted warplanes peel away from the glowing tracers of German anti-aircraft fire that stabbed skyward. When the excitement ended, the Lerouxs returned home to bed, unaware that their farm would play a vital role in the Allied liberation of France.</p>\n<p>Their slumber was disturbed a few hours later by the droning of low-flying aircraft. Gazing out their windows, they were startled to see descending parachutes. “They looked like big falling mushrooms,” recalled Madame Leroux. “We didn’t know what they were but could see that they were landing in the marshes.” When shrapnel from German flak shells pelted the roof, Madame Leroux and her husband gathered their children to take shelter in the stone stairwell.</p>\n<p>The farmstead sat on the east bank of the Merderet River, which bisected the Cotentin Peninsula north to south. The farm overlooked one of just two crossing points: the La Fière Bridge on the road to the village of <a href=\"https://www.historynet.com/82nd-airbornes-special-relationship-with-d-day-village-endures-virtually-amid-pandemic/\">Sainte-Mère-Église</a>. While on the high ground, the family home was closer to the riverbank than originally intended thanks to the German occupiers who, recognizing the defensive potential of the landscape, had manipulated locks to flood the area with seawater. Rivers and streams had overflowed their banks to turn wide swaths of bucolic fields into swampland and a shallow lake. </p>\n<p>At dawn on June 6, a platoon of Germans arrived at the Leroux’s farm. They searched the stables and occupied the house while the family retreated upstairs to the main bedroom. When gunfire erupted outside, the Lerouxs again scrambled for cover. Bullets cracked through windows, splintering shutters and ricocheting off interior stone walls. The staccato of German Mausers, MP40s, and MG42s echoed through the house as the occupiers fired back at the attackers.</p>\n<p>During a pause in the shooting, the family rushed downstairs, past wounded Germans sprawled in the kitchen, and into the wine cellar. Wanting to flee, they nudged open the external cellar door. Spotting a soldier—who they thought was British—they yelled, “Français! Français!”</p>\n<p>He replied in French: “Stay where you are and close the door!”</p>\n<p>Several hours later the door opened, and the same soldier commanded them, again in French, “Get out!”</p>\n<p>The Lerouxs now realized the soldiers were American paratroopers. They questioned the French family to learn how many Germans were inside, and then the shooting resumed as the French family sought cover. “The noise took our breath away,” admitted Madame Leroux. The Americans were peppering the house with rifles and machine guns. The skirmish ended after a bazooka round exploded into the house and paratroopers sprinted in to herd the surrendering Germans out. In the lull that followed, the Lerouxs celebrated their violent liberation by gifting a bottle of Calvados brandy to the Americans. “They asked us to drink some first,” recalled Madame Leroux, “which we did. Then they all drank some.”</p>\n<p>The paratroopers, there to seize the bridge and expecting a German counterattack, told the Lerouxs it was too dangerous for them to stay. The family packed food and blankets before walking to a neighbor’s home. During their exodus, they passed more American troopers heading to the bridge.</p>\n<p>The La Fière bridge was the D-Day objective of the <a href=\"https://www.historynet.com/wanted-kill-germans-conversion-james-megellas/\">82nd Airborne Division</a>’s 1st Battalion of the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment. Capturing the bridge intact was critical to the Allies’ plans: first, they needed to prevent the Germans from using it to move reinforcements against the landings at <a href=\"https://www.historynet.com/dday-beaches-names/\">Utah Beach</a> and second, they wanted the bridge to serve later as an artery for armor and infantry to break out from the beachhead toward the ultimate objective: the port of Cherbourg. </p>\n<p>A member of the 505th later described the nighttime parachute drop they had made into Normandy as “a model of precision flying and perfect execution.” Pilots of the 315th Troop Carrier Group—veterans of missions in Sicily and Italy—had dropped their passengers right on target. Under the command of Lieutenant John “Red Dog” Dolan, Able Company assembled 98 percent of its troopers within an hour. The 505th’s sister regiment, the 507th, was supposed to land on the opposite side of the Merderet, but it was not as fortunate. Weather, anti-aircraft fire, and hopelessly lost pilots scattered them across 60 square miles.</p>\n<p>With their drop zone just a half-mile from their objective, Dolan’s lead platoon pushed through the graying light of dawn and reached the Leroux’s farm in 30 minutes. The troopers immediately searched the bridge for demolition charges and put the German occupiers under siege. By mid-morning, with the help of paratroopers from the 508th PIR, the east side of the bridge was secure, but the scattered state of the 507th left the defense of the west side in a weakened state.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>Of all the city slickers ever to venture into the 19th century American West, Oscar Wilde towered above the rest, preening like a peacock with his ostentatious wardrobe, his philosophy of art and his knack for spilling printer’s ink across the pages of Western newspapers. In the parlance of the cowboy, Wilde exemplified the “swivel dude,” a gaudy fellow worthy of a second look or a tip of the hat. The flamboyant poet and playwright not only turned heads with his eccentric outfits, but also left Westerners scratching their noggins over his esoteric lectures on “The Decorative Arts” and “The House Beautiful.” For the better part of two months in 1882 Wilde pranced his way across the frontier, a wholly different breed of pioneer.</p>\n<p>Arriving in New York City on Jan. 3, 1882, Oscar Fingal O’Flahertie Wills Wilde spent 51 weeks touring the United States and Canada, traveling 50 of those days west of the Mississippi River. Twenty-seven years old when he arrived, he had accomplished little beyond graduating from Magdalen College, Oxford, self-publishing a play and a thin book of poetry, and ingratiating himself into London’s high society with his quick, sardonic wit. During college and afterward Wilde evolved into both a disciple and a proponent of aestheticism, a philosophy best summarized as “art for art’s sake.” Proponents, or aesthetes as they were called, valued form over function. Aestheticism countered the function-intensive machines of the Industrial Revolution and the Victorian belief that literature and art should provide moral and ethical lessons and restraints on society.</p>\n<p>While other aesthetes made greater contributions to the philosophical movement, none was more visible than Wilde, largely due to his extravagant dress and a peculiar fixation on sunflowers and lilies as “the most perfect models of design, the most naturally adapted for decoration—the gaudy leonine beauty of the one and the precious loveliness of the other giving to the artist the most entire and perfect joy.” Wherever he spoke in America, runs on florist shops depleted the supply of those two flowers, as fans and skeptics alike were eager either to laud or mock Wilde with them.</p>\n<p>Among the skeptics, dramatist W.S. Gilbert and composer Arthur Sullivan parodied the aesthetes with a “fleshly poet” named Reginald Bunthorne, the lead character of their 1881 comic opera <i>Patience</i>—the follow-up to their hit comic operas <i>H.M.S. Pinafore</i> and <i>The Pirates of Penzance</i>. On the back of the duo’s latest success, their producer, Richard D’Oyly Carte, decided to take <i>Patience</i> across the pond to North America. Doubting that Americans would understand the play’s satire, Carte sought an “advance poster” of aestheticism to promote it. Wilde was the natural choice, as Carte was already serving as the poet’s booking manager.</p>\n<p>Likely massaging Wilde’s ego with a suggestion his poetry was also popular in the United States, Carte persuaded the Irishman to assume the mantle of the fictional Englishman Bunthorne for a lecture tour. The clincher was Carte’s offer of half the net profits.</p>\n<p>What Wilde excelled at most in his young adulthood was self-adoration and self-promotion, often erasing the line between fame and notoriety. When he arrived in New York, the young nation’s biggest celebrity was dime novel hero Buffalo Bill. By the time the aesthete returned to Britain, Wilde—if not eclipsing the future Wild West showman as a household name—had certainly drawn more news coverage than William F. Cody. At very least Wilde was the first celebrity who became famous merely for being famous, launching the superficial celebrity culture that permeates American popular culture to this day.</p>\n<h2>“lord of the lah-de-dah”</h2>\n<p>Wilde stood 3 inches over 6 feet. Protruding from his elongated, colorless face was a prominent nose over coarse lips that sheltered greenish-hued teeth, discolored from too many Turkish cigarettes and too few toothbrushes. His thick eyebrows shaded attentive eyes, and a long mop of tawny brown hair brushed against his shoulders. “He looks better in the dark, perhaps” quipped one St. Louis journalist. A portrait of Wilde printed in the competing <i>Leavenworth Times</i> prompted Kansas’ <i>Emporia Daily News</i> to observe, “If it is anything like correct, there will be no chance for Oscar to get a wife in this neck of the woods.”</p>\n<p>What Wilde lacked in looks, he made up for with a voguish wardrobe that ranged from dark formal suits to gaudy shirts and cravats in vibrant purples, greens and yellows. For his first appearance west of the Mississippi he chose a more subdued outfit, his trademark knee britches in black over black silk stockings and patent leather pumps with large silver buckles. Above that he wore a white shirt and white waistcoat topped with a long-tailed black coat and white kid gloves.</p>\n<p>His presentations, though, were neither as bright nor as entertaining as his attire. Wilde read his speeches in a monotone voice with a verbal quirk accentuating every fourth syllable. In advance of his February tour date in St. Louis the <i>Globe-Democrat</i> reported, “Curiosity to <i>see</i> Oscar Wilde is greater than to <i>hear</i> him.” Following his lecture there to an audience of 1,500 a subhead in the paper’s coverage pronounced, A Large and Fashionable Audience Bored by His Talk on Art. The reporter, like many other Western newsmen, christened Wilde “the lord of the lah-de-dah.” Others just labeled him an “ass-thete.”</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>Frenchman Henri Farman was already a celebrated cycling champion, race car driver and entrepreneur when he ordered a biplane from the world’s first airplane factory, Les Frères Voisin. Five months later, in January 1908, he won Ernest Archdeacon’s prize for the first officially observed heavier-than-air flight over a one-kilometer circular course.</p>\n<p>A week after making Europe’s first flight outside France (in Belgium), Farman lunched with <a href=\"https://www.historynet.com/wright-brothers-a-promise-of-flight-fulfilled/\">Wilbur Wright</a> in Paris in June. They got on famously; when Wilbur explained his plans to make demonstration flights in France, Farman replied that he had accepted an offer from a consortium of St. Louis businessmen. He would get $25,000 for touring the United States for 90 days, plus $200 per flight. The organizer was Tom MacMechan, editor of <i>American Aeronaut</i>. “These public demonstrations ought to bring about a great popular realization of the practicability of dynamic flight,” enthused <i>Aeronautics</i>, another aviation journal. </p>\n<p>After learning that aviator <a href=\"https://www.historynet.com/aviation-pioneer-glenn-curtiss-may-96-aviation-history-feature/\">Glenn Curtiss </a>had flown his <i>June Bug</i> on July 4 to win the $25,000 Scientific American Cup for the first public powered flight in America, Farman crated his Voisin for shipment across the Atlantic. He sailed with his assistant, Maurice Herbster, and his wife, arriving in New York on July 26 to an enthusiastic welcome. Headed by Curtiss, a welcoming committee from the Aero Club of America chartered a tug to escort the Farmans’ ship to the pier, where automobiles whisked them to the Hotel Astor on Times Square.</p>\n<p>Farman had become front-page news, where he was hailed as “the world’s champion aeronaut” and “the man with the practical aeroplane.” The military was keen to witness his demonstrations, and with <a href=\"https://www.historynet.com/orville-wright-toys/\">Orville Wright</a> planning test flights for the government at Fort Myer, Virginia, an international contest seemed possible. Farman even challenged Orville to a contest for a $10,000 purse, but Wright declined. Farman was unfazed: “If they consider their machines superior, why don’t they accept my challenge? I could gain much valuable data from a contest, and surely my machine, with its long list of record flights, has at least some points of information for my brother aviators.” </p>\n<p>As the venue for his demonstrations, Farman chose the horseracing track in Brighton Beach, New York, which in 1907 had been converted to host 24-hour endurance motor races known as “Grinds.” Farman arranged to remove large sections of an infield fence while he had his crates hoisted onto theatrical scenery trucks and unloaded in the track’s old betting ring. When customs officers did not arrive as expected to examine the contents, Farman sent away his hired stevedores. Then the revenue men finally arrived and Herbster had to recruit a crew of unskilled locals. They dropped one of the crates, damaging the airplane’s tail cell and rudder. Despite the damage, the appraiser declared the Voisin’s new Antoinette V8 engine to be the finest piece of machinery he had ever seen, saying that “all who examined the machine were greatly impressed with its workmanship, which is exquisite.” Farman spend the next day on repairs, reassembling the airframe and installing the engine.</p>\n<p>At a banquet at the Astor on July 30 one news account noted that “the ballroom was full of balloonites, with here and there a submarine fiend, an auto crank or a common scientist wedged in among the number.” Charles Manly, the engineer and test pilot for aviation experimenter Samuel Langley, congratulated France on its aviation experimenters and described Farman as “a man destined to do great good for aeronautics and create enthusiasm among millions.” Farman’s riposte was equally gracious to those on this side of the Atlantic: “We foreigners owe credit to Octave Chanute for the basic principles of our apparatus, and to the Wright brothers, pioneers after Mr. Chanute.”</p>\n<p>After the guests had consumed a model of the Voisin confected from spun sugar, Farman made a less-than-sweet dig at the secretive and litigious Wrights. “I carry on my experiments in public because that seems advantageous,” he said. “The work is difficult enough, and it is better for others to see what you are doing and for you to see what they are doing, each improving by the mistakes of the other.”</p>\n<p>Farman was not alone in resenting the Wrights’ secrecy, even on home turf. <i>The American Magazine of Aeronautics</i> opined, “Farman has perhaps done more, through publicity, to brush away the cobwebs of doubt than the Wrights. Even here, we doubt that the Wrights ever flew, while we read of the Farman’s flights with less astonishment than at the invention of a headacheless booze.” James Means, editor of <i>Aeronautical Annuals</i> agreed, saying, “Owing to the public exhibitions of flights with motor-aeroplanes in France, the Frenchmen are in a fair way to get years ahead of us in aviation, as they did with the automobile.” </p>\n<p>“We are disgusted with some American inventors who have been chasing the almighty dollar instead of solving the problems of flight,” railed MacMechan in the <i>American Aeronaut</i>. For impeding the free exchange of ideas, he argued, the Wrights should forfeit their place in history for making the world’s first airplane flight. He added, “After Farman’s flight, there will be no difficulty raising capital to finance the cost of building aeroplanes and conducting experiments.” </p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Virtually every Old West aficionado is familiar with Buffalo Bill Cody’s popular Wild West shows, which traveled the United States and across the Atlantic Ocean in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. During <a href=\"https://historynet.com/buffalo-bill-italy-tour\">Cody’s 1890 and 1906 European tours</a> throngs of Italians in arenas from Rome to Bologna thrilled at the showmanship of Buffalo Bill and his revolving cast of characters. The 1906 tour was the last to Europe for Buffalo Bill, who a decade later teamed with the <a href=\"https://historynet.com/miller-brothers-wild-west\">Miller Brothers 101 Ranch Real Wild West</a> but by then was too frail to travel overseas.</p>\n    <p>Within decades Americans huddled faithfully around TV sets in living rooms nationwide to indulge a seemingly insatiable fascination with Western lore and dramatized portrayals of real-life cowboys, Indians, cavalrymen and gunmen. Though few channels were on the air by the mid-1950s, dozens of Western series aired weekly, at least one or more nightly. Western junkies could also take in Saturday afternoon B reruns of black-and-white “oaters” on the small screen at home or the latest Technicolor weekend matinees on the big screens at local movie theaters.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, another American harboring a fascination with the Old West embarked on a tour of Europe, searching for a gunmaker who could replicate the Colt 1851 Navy per-cussion revolver, the weapon of choice of Wild Bill Hickok, among other Western gunfighters. Val J. Forgett Jr.—gun collector, Civil War re-enactor and owner of the New Jersey–based Service Armament Co.—ultimately found what he was looking for in Italy. In 1957 Forgett founded Navy Arms, a subsidiary cap-and-ball revolver line within Service Armament, and a year later rolled out his first Colt Navy replicas in unison with gunmakers Vittorio Gregorelli and a young, astute Aldo Uberti from the northern Italian firearms manufacturing center of Gardone Val Trompia. Forgett’s first imports didn’t bear the later obligatory Italian proof marks but were merely stamped GU, or G&amp;U, for Gregorelli and Uberti. In 1959 Uberti began producing replica firearms under his own trade name. He and Forgett were the driving forces behind the enduring popularity of Italian-made replica Old West firearms. It took the American entrepreneur and the skilled Italian gunsmith to make many a would-be gunhand’s dream an affordable reality.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.historynet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/uberti-replica-rifle-ww-spring-2024-scaled-1024x214.jpg\" alt=\"Uberti’s copy of the Winchester Model 1866\"/>\n    <p>Around the same time, with the centennial of the American Civil War fast approaching, the <a href=\"http://www.n-ssa.org\">North-South Skirmish Association</a> (N-SSA) found its ranks expanding. N-SSA’s competitive shooters (Forgett among them) were in dire need of usable guns, as the supply of wartime arms had begun to dry up. Blame the collector market, which had snapped up most original firearms of the era, in turn driving up prices on those remaining in circulation. Particularly scarce and expensive were Confederate firearms, which had been produced in far fewer numbers. Thus, in 1960 Navy Arms introduced a pair of percussion revolvers based on the Colt Navy and dubbed the “Yank” and the “Reb.” The steel-framed Yank adhered to the styling of the Colt Model 1851, while the brass-framed Reb faithfully recreated <a href=\"https://www.historynet.com/confederate-brass-pistols/\">the Griswold &amp; Gunnison, a Southern copy</a> of the Colt Model 1860. Fine examples of either can reap well into the five figures today.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.historynet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/aldo-uberti-ww-spring-2024-756x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Aldo Uberti\"/>\n    <p>Uberti’s and Forgett’s respective lines continued to expand, leading to a second generation of replicas of the “smoke wagons” of old. In 1973 Navy Arms introduced copies of the Winchester Models 1866 and 1873, the first of the company’s replica lever-action rifles. Over the decades at least a dozen different Italian gunmakers have entered the replica arms market, including Davide Pedersoli and Giuseppe Pietta, introducing everything from Colt Single Action Army “Peacemakers” to Spencer carbines. Uberti’s present-day line includes dozens of models.</p>\n    <p>Another Italian export that drove the popularity of Old West replica arms was the “spaghetti Western” film subgenre, a darker take on the traditional Western, whose productions were directed and scored by Italians, co-starred Italians and were filmed in both Italy and Spain. The heyday of these popular big-screen adventures (roughly 1964–78) brought to superstardom such American actors as Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef and featured full-screen closeups of the co-starring firearms.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.historynet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/clint-eastwood-fistful-dollars-ww-spring-2024-808x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Clint Eastwood in Fistful of Dollars\"/>\n    <p>Any sharp-eyed, gun-savvy viewer can quickly discern an Italian replica from an original. For example, many replica Colt Single Action Army revolvers are fitted with brass trigger guards—an option unavailable on original Peacemakers, though most percussion-era revolvers did have brass trigger guards. Colt 1851 Navy revolvers could be special-ordered with silver-plated guards, while the fluted 1861 Navy—another hard-to-find original Colt on the collector market—had blued-steel trigger guards. To their credit, Uberti and other Italian makers equipped later iterations of their replica Peacemakers with the correct steel trigger guards.</p>\n    <p>One thing is as sure as shooting, the Italian connection reverberates to this day in the ranks of such competitive shooting organizations as the N-SSA and the Single Action Shooting Society, not to mention on the big and small screen. Despite reports to the contrary, the decades-old transatlantic fascination with the Old West is alive and well.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>The motor launch tied up at the small-boat pier in Seeadler Harbor in New Guinea to disembark a dozen men from the ammunition carrier USS <i>Mount Hood</i>. The date was November 10, 1944. Led by the ship’s communications officer, Lieutenant Lester Hull Wallace, the group had several errands to run on shore before returning to the ship. Wallace planned to take a couple of men with him to the fleet post office to pick up mail. Others were headed to headquarters to obtain charts and manuals. Two had dental appointments and two were on their way to the brig. The sailors were just splitting up when a tremendous blast knocked them off their feet. When they looked out into the harbor, they were stunned to realize that their ship was being wracked by explosion after explosion.</p>\n<p>Seeadler Harbor was off the northeast coast of Manus Island, 250 miles north of mainland New Guinea. It was one of the finest anchorages in the Southwest Pacific Theater, measuring 15 miles long and four wide, with ample depth for capital ships. The army had taken the island from the Japanese in early March 1944 and within days U.S. Navy Seabees had begun to build a major advanced operating base capable of supplying and repairing the ships of Admiral <a href=\"https://www.historynet.com/was-halsey-out-of-his-depth/\">William F. Halsey’</a>s Third Fleet as it supported <a href=\"https://www.historynet.com/macarthur-no-one-knew/\">General Douglas MacArthur’</a>s leap-frogging drive along New Guinea’s north coast to retake the Philippines. That same month a survey ship marked out more than 600 moorage sites throughout the vast harbor. The Manus base grew over the summer and became dotted with hundreds of buildings—mostly Quonset huts used as barracks for thousands of sailors and as warehouses for the vast amounts of materiel necessary to carry on the war.</p>\n<p>On the morning of Friday, November 10, <i>Mount Hood</i> was one of some 200-odd ships in the harbor. The vessels ran the gamut from patrol boats to escort carriers and also included landing ships, tanks (LSTs), destroyers, and civilian-crewed freighters. <i>Mount Hood</i> was anchored at berth 380, near the harbor’s center, four miles from the entrance and 2½ miles from land. It was the first of eight AE class ammunition ships that had been converted for the U.S. Navy, with a length of 460 feet, a displacement of 14,000 tons, and a cargo capacity of 7,800 tons. <i>Mount Hood</i>’s keel was laid down in September 1943 and it began service as a cargo vessel named the SS <i>Marco Polo</i>. Once the navy took over, it converted the ship into an ammunition carrier. Commissioned in July 1944, the vessel was renamed after the dormant volcano that provides Oregon with its highest point. Its captain was Commander Harold A. Turner. </p>\n<p>Turner struggled to find qualified seamen for his crew and many of those he received were raw recruits with no experience at sea. After an unusually short fitting out and a shakedown cruise in the Chesapeake Bay, <i>Mount Hood</i> stopped at Norfolk, Virginia, to load 5,000 tons of explosives and ammunition. On August 5, 1944, with its hold filled, <i>Mount Hood</i> departed Norfolk bound for the Admiralty Islands via the Panama Canal. The ship reached its final destination, Seeadler Harbor, on September 22. Its mission was two-fold: to dispense its cargo to other warships, and to take on any unused munitions from homeward-bound vessels. </p>\n<p>On November 10 <i>Mount Hood</i> was ringed by nine landing ship, mechanized (LCM) boats and was the center of a humming hive of loading and unloading activity. The small-engine repair ship USS <i>Mindanao</i> was anchored off the ship’s port side just 350 yards away. USS <i>Argonne</i>, another repair ship that also served as the task force commander’s flagship, was 1,100 yards off. </p>\n<p>Wallace and his going-ashore party piled aboard the captain’s 40-foot gig and at 8:25 a.m. they shoved off toward the beach. As he headed toward shore Wallace noted that aerial depth charges were being loaded aboard the <i>Mount Hood</i> from the landing craft moored alongside.</p>\n<p>A lanky, bespectacled 29-year-old native of Georgia, Wallace had graduated from Atlanta Tech High School and earned his law degree from George Washington University in Washington, D.C., in 1941. Afterward he married Mildred Virginia French and went straight into the service of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, working in the estate and gift tax branch—but not before registering as an officer in the Naval Reserve. In 1942 the navy called him up and assigned him a place in the Bureau of Naval Personnel. After a year there the navy sent Wallace to its communications school at Harvard University, and then to the Sub Chaser Training Center at Miami, Florida. In the summer of 1944 the lieutenant was transferred to USS <i>Mount Hood</i>—his first at-sea deployment. He put his Ivy League training to good use when setting up the ship’s communications department.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",
