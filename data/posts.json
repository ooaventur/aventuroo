    "body": "<p>Ayesha Fernandez loves to tell stories. Like the tale of the tortoise and the hare—not the familiar version, but what happens next. The hare, she often narrates, realises that he needs to work harder to win. She also narrates the story of the teacher who fills a jar with stones, asking students if the container is full. When they reply with a yes, she fills it with gravel, which takes up the space between the stones. The students again reply that the jar is full. She repeats the process with sand and the students give her the same answer. She finally fills it with water, proving them wrong yet again.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/workplace-monk-mode-focus-tasks-office-111711905144063.html\">Also read: How to organise your work life like a monk</a>\n    </p>\n<p>These may sound like tales that Fernandez, 40, tells her young daughter, but her audience is actually her colleagues, clients, team members and senior leaders at her workplace.</p>\n<p>Fernandez finds stories effective in communicating varied information at work, whether data, technical details, processes, or abstract ideas. The hare and the tortoise tale illustrates that it’s never too late to change and get back to the top. The teacher story, on the other hand, shows there’s always room for improvement. “It helps the listener to connect and brings emotion to what would otherwise have just been a list of facts and figures. People’s attention is tuned to focusing on a story,” says the Bengaluru-based sales director at American software company Salesforce.</p>\n<p>Fernandez is among a growing number of professionals who are using storytelling in the workplace to convey information, make connections, entertain and make messages stick.</p>\n<p>Using stories to communicate in the office is not a new concept. For years, leaders have used them to build a more collaborative workspace. Storytelling has become a more important and integral part of the office now, because they help employees break away from the constant noise they are surrounded with, whether it’s in the form of leadership gurus giving<i> gyaan</i> on Twitter or forwarded WhatsApp memes explaining why it’s a “good idea” to take leave from work immediately after a confrontation with the manager.  Effective in-person storytelling helps bring the message home. The bonus points are that stories bring some heart to boring data, motivating and inspiring listeners and developing trust among people.  </p>\n<p>Studies, too, have shown that it is easier to remember random lists of words when embedded in a story. Author Paul Smith highlights storytelling’s effectiveness for varied learners in his book, <i>Leader As Storyteller: 10 Reasons It Makes A Better Business Connection</i>. The vocal aspect appeals to auditory learners, who prefer discussions and lectures; mental pictures help visual learners; while the emotional connection and feelings evoked stay with kinesthetic learners who imbibe learning through feeling and doing, Smith writes. </p>\n<p>People may be technically proficient, but there is also a need for them to be good communicators. “Whether in finance, marketing, or HR, many professionals need this skill. How do you persuade and influence people and push a call to action? You do it through stories,” says Debolina Dutta, organizational behaviour and human resource professor at the Indian Institute of Management Bengaluru, who conducts a post graduate and executive program on storytelling for business.</p>\n<p>But what distinguishes storytelling for business? Indranil Chakraborty, author of<i> Stories At Work </i>and founder of communications consultancy, StoryWorks, which helps business professionals become compelling communicators through storytelling, mentions three key distinctions in business storytelling. Stories in business are used to make point; they help wrap facts in context and deliver them with emotion; and brevity is key.  </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/social-media-professional-work-office-elections-censor-111713161320733.html\">Also read: Watch out, your social media posts might cost you a job</a>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/business-storytelling-happier-workplaces-communication-connection-111713719757190.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Art historian Alka Pande is multi-tasking. When talking about book cover design in the run-up to the Oxford Bookstore Book Cover Prize announcement anytime this month, she cuts out to handle something else for a minute. When she returns, she takes a minute to pick up the conversation again. “Attention span,” she says with a grin. “It’s also one of the reasons why the attractiveness and seductiveness of a book jacket becomes so important.”</p>\n    <p>Pande, who has been chairing the prize’s jury since its inception, is only half-joking. In a crowded bookstore, an eye-catching book jacket that attracts potential readers could be the first point of the book’s marketing success. With online marketplaces, cover design that is striking even in the size of a thumbnail becomes important.</p>\n    <p>Book covers have been around as long as books have, of course, but in recent years, a few things have put them in the spotlight: authors have been naming and thanking cover designers either in the acknowledgement sections of their books or during promotions, designers have been showcasing their professional portfolios and working on self-branding, and award categories for book cover design have emerged.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Also Read: </i>\n      <i>The comfort of books in our loneliest hours</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>The jury of the Oxford Bookstore’s Book Cover Prize 2023 arrived at their current shortlist of six after sifting through 300 entries. The Publishing Next Industry Awards 2023, which announced its winners in the last week of March, has three categories for book cover design: English (introduced with the first edition of their awards in 2016), Indian Languages (since 2019) and Children’s Books (intermittently since 2019). This acknowledgement of genre-specific design sensibilities in a category rarely fêted in India is pleasantly surprising.</p>\n    <p>Such diversity “is the sign of maturity and evolution in the market,” says Lisa Rath, partner at Delhi-based design and branding studio Itu Chaudhuri Design, which has worked on jackets of books such as Arundhati Roy’s <i>The God of Small Things </i>(IndiaInk and Penguin Books, 1997), <i>The Doctor and The Saint</i> (Penguin, 2019) and Mujib Rizavi’s <i>Sab Likhni Kai Likhu Sansaara</i> (Rajkamal Prakashan, 2018). She notes that the likes of a neon cover or a chalk-like typeface, common today, were rare a decade ago<i>. </i></p>\n    <p>The book cover is more than a rectangle. “I like to see an artist use the entire space, and the imagery flow from the front to the spine to maybe a flap,” says Danica Desilva, artist and jury member at the Publishing Next Awards for the last two years. While doing this, a designer ought to also think about bringing the book’s essence into an image, she says.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Also Read: </i>\n      <i>Recreating covers of books banned through history</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Rath calls this “depicting the temperament of the book”, making the job a balancing act between faithful interpretation and an original comment.</p>\n    <p>The book cover has become a space for the visual and literary arts to meet. “Book cover design<i> </i>is an inherently collaborative process,” says Antra K., who won in the Best Cover Design category at the 2022 Atta Galatta-Bangalore Literature Festival Book Prize for Saeed Naqvi’s <i>The Muslim Vanishes</i> (Penguin, 2022). </p>\n    <p>Over the years, she has learned how to blend her ideas seamlessly with the author and editor’s inputs, while also accommodating the pulls and pushes of a book’s marketing team. “Art can seem like an insular process,” she says. “But with a book cover, I know I’m making it for the author, the reader and for myself—and that’s quite exciting.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/book-cover-design-oxford-bookstore-book-cover-prize-publishing-next-industry-awards-111713670258266.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>On a windy April day, we were at Baragaon in the languorous city of Guwahati, Assam. In the sky, a large bird flapped its wings slowly. It was the bird we were looking for; we moved in its direction. We went down a kaccha path and then turned right. The road ended in a towering garbage mountain.</p>\n<p>It was an overwhelming sight. The garbage mountain was massive, with the solidity of a building or a monument. And it was alive. On thousands of kilos of plastic, food and solid trash, things were slowly moving. A cow chewed her cud, picked from the garbage. I wondered what she was eating, because the dominant feeling was poisonous. The stench was overwhelming, moving in pulses and waves like it wouldn’t mind socking us in the face. Plastic bags were everywhere, waiting to come alive on headwinds. Dust was omnipresent—some of it could have been the Brahmaputra’s silt, the rest was detritus. There was a haze in the air, but the birds and animals broke through the miasma and carried on their business. Kites did sorties in the air. Crows hopped about, suddenly taking off like smoke. And Greater adjutant storks moved ponderously through, their baby-pink neck pouches swinging like pendulums. Their gait had a certain gravitas, a sense of an inevitable closing of the loop. Greater adjutant storks were once the symbol of the municipality of Kolkata because they scavenged in garbage dumps. Decades ago, they soared in the skies with <i>Gyps </i>vultures, both looking for carcasses. Now, vultures are critically endangered, and Greater adjutant populations are much smaller in India—restricted to rural Bihar near Bhagalpur and rural parts of Assam and Guwahati.</p>\n<p>The faces of the storks have a marbled, mottled pattern, like they are in various stages of decomposition. A proud kind of decomposition, a frankness that feels like a homage to their surroundings—to the bacteria and microbes that surround the discarded and rotting. This is amongst the world’s largest storks, and its beak is pale, the eyes bone-white. And behind the heads of the storks, there is a glistening pink portion. It looks like a brain. Two spots of colour stood out on the garbage mountain in that blistering, dusty place—the brain-like back of the stork’s head, and the floral yellow<i> kurta </i>of a young ragpicker going up the mountain. She walked with consummate ease, as if she was going up a rolling, grassy hill. A child shrieked, pausing mid-play with a friend, before tumbling on the brackets of the mountain. Sobered, she resumed her work of parsing through the trash. The stork nearby opened its great black wings—like a thundercloud on the horizon, seeming to shake off the shrieks of children playing. Just as easily, the bird tucked its wings back, all threats of an angry rumble abated. In a single foot of space, there was a cow, a person and a threatened stork. They seemed to have an old acceptance of each other.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/greater-adjutant-scavengers-india-wildlife-environment-111713517039022.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Every five years when India votes, everyone gears up for the “world’s largest election”. “India watchers” are eager to tell you “everything you need to know”, X analysts put out quick-fix opinions, and people publish outdated lists of “books to understand India today”. Democracy, at its core, is about equality—and that’s not only about politics, it is also about the way we live. Or rather, choosing how we want to live is actually a deeply political decision, and even those who say they are “apolitical” are still making a political choice of not caring. So, this week, we look at the fundamentals of living in a democratic society through a curated set of books we think you’d like to read. That doesn’t mean that we’ve picked 1,000-page doorstoppers. Instead, we decided to go with comedy, fiction, parody, poetry and stories that have shaped people’s ideas of democracy.</p>\n    <p>Twelve writers tell us about their favourite stories that changed their view of the world, and moulded their personal beliefs about equality, identity and nationalism while being an engaged member of a larger community or the country. On our request, they have picked writing in languages other than English to reflect the variety of mores that characterise India.</p>\n    <p>Film critic Raja Sen selects shows—past and present, witty and dramatic, and all available in India—that will get you thinking about the challenges facing a democracy. From the evergreen classic political comedy <i>Yes, Minister </i>to the hard-hitting <i>Maharani </i>with Huma Qureshi, these shows hold lessons about the state of the country. While each of these books and shows make for good weekend reading and watching, we also hope they will help you look within and reflect on first principles before you go out to vote.</p>\n    <p>Elsewhere in the issue, we address the other big preoccupation of the month—summer. One columnist makes a case for being a little kinder to make the rising temperatures somewhat bearable, another story delves into the trend of dessert cocktails, while our compilation of products to keep you cool is inspired by the shades and shapes of mangoes.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Write to the editor at shalini.umachandran@htlive.com</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>@shalinimb</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/opinion/stories-vote-elections-books-politics-tv-series-111713580789309.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Every five years, as Indian democracy gears up for its biggest carnival—the general election—publishers fall in step with the spirit of the season. Suddenly bookshops are flush with political titles. From itinerant reporters with their ears to the ground to armchair analysts making heavy-duty predictions to politicians of all colours lobbying for their cause, everyone wants a piece of the democratic pie that is the Indian book trade.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, there is value in reading contemporary critiques of the state of the nation. But even as we delve into immersive reportage, the data stories, the autobiographies and hagiographies, it’s crucial to remember our primal understanding of the promises of democracy. That’s why, instead of putting out a list of new political books that have graced bookshops this election season, we decided to go back to the first principles. We invited 12 distinguished writers to tell us about some of their formative memories and literary experiences of democracy.</p>\n<p>What follows is an eclectic garland of ideas, thoughts and inspirations, strung together with remembrances of poems, stories, novels, non-fiction and defining moments from the past.</p>\n<p>Each of these pieces draws our attention to a point of view that is unique, a history of emotions that straddles reading, watching, conversations, and other traces of memory. We hope you will be inspired to look up some of the works mentioned and allow them to expand and complicate your consciousness.</p>\n<p/>\n    <p>\n      <i>Harishankar Parsai’s satire resonates with the drama of elections to this day</i>\n      <i>—Amitava Kumar</i>\n    </p>\n<p>I was recently writing about the drama of elections in a constituency near Gaya for my forthcoming novel, My Beloved Life. I thought of what might be the best description of this process—in Vikram Seth’s A Suitable Boy. A mofussil air, the petty intrigues, the shifts in fortune. By the time I was ending my book, however, I inserted a scene that is a classic in Hindi literature, Harishankar Parsai’s <i>Inspector Matadeen Chand Par</i> (1994), or Inspector Matadeen on the Moon.</p>\n<p>The father and daughter duo who narrate my novel are on their way to a restaurant in Atlanta. The father is talking bitterly about politicians in Hindi, his voice growing louder as he quotes Parsai, delivering his lines as if at a kavi-sammelan. Even as I imagined the scene, I felt I was paying homage to a writer whose deft satires gave his readers a small measure of agency. A political system that left them helpless could not take away from them the freedom of laughter. Here is what the father recites: “How politicians hear the call of the people just before the elections, this is a trade secret and cannot be shared. The call of the people is sometimes like the bleating of a lamb. The lamb is calling for its mother but it is the wolf who arrives instead. Even if the lamb stays silent, the wolf comes and asks, Did you call me? The lamb says No, I didn’t even open my mouth. The wolf says, in that case I must have heard your heart’s call.”</p>\n<p><i>Amitava Kumar, author of several works of non-fiction and four novels, grew up in Patna and teaches at Vassar College in New York.</i>\n\t                                    </p>\n<p/>\n    <p>\n      <i>True democracy requires a deep consciousness of humanity</i>\n      <i>—Gogu Shyamala</i>\n    </p>\n<p>As children, we grew up with stories about independence, freedom and nationalism. Barring a few small treats such as the children’s magazines Chandamama or Bommarillu, we had little access to anything more than school textbooks. So it was only as I grew up and started attaining some paripakvata (maturity) that I began to comprehend ideas like democracy. When I saw children drop out of school, or when I began to comprehend how caste and untouchability is practised in everyday life, I grew restless with asantrupti (discontent). I started looking at the ideas of freedom and the independence movement through the lens of caste. It changed everything.</p>\n<p>In 1910, the famous playwright and poet Gurajada Apparao wrote <i>Desamante mattikaadoi, desamante manusholoi </i>(<i>A nation doesn’t mean a land, it means a people</i>) in his patriotic poem <i>Desamunu Preminchumanna </i>(Love your Country). It was a great way to bring humanity into conversations about nationalism. But things stopped there.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/democracy-books-elections-2024-politics-literature-111713514096553.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Sudipta Das has witnessed drastic ecological changes over the years in her hometown of Silchar in Assam. “These days, we are getting excessive rainfall during what are supposed to be dry months. Nature is disturbed. Floods arrive earlier than usual, and with greater ferocity,” says the 39-year-old artist, who is currently based out of Vadodara, Gujarat.</p>\n<p>Das has witnessed a disproportionate impact of these natural calamities on women in Silchar. It is the women of the household who flush out the water from homes, arrange for food, and take care of the farmlands. “They end up falling ill the most during this time,” says Das, who is known for her figurines, crafted from rice paper and Hanji paper, depicting the migration of communities due to political and geological changes. Deeply touched by the suffering of women during natural upheavals, the artist—who calls herself an ecofeminist—has been creating works for the series, <i>Mother and Child</i>.</p>\n<p>Ecofeminism—the intersection of feminism, politics and ecology—isn’t a new term. It was first coined by French writer Francoise d’Eaubonne in her 1974 book, <i>Le Féminisme ou la Mort</i>. She wrote: “Ecofeminism relates the oppression and domination of all marginalised groups (women, people of color, children, the poor) to the oppression and domination of nature (animals, land, water, air, etc.).”</p>\n<p>As the world goes through drastic ecological changes, the concept of ecofeminism has acquired greater urgency. “The climate crisis is not ‘gender neutral’,” states a report, dated 28 February 2022, on the UN Women website. “Women and girls experience the greatest impacts of climate change, which amplifies existing gender inequalities and poses unique threats to their livelihoods, health, and safety. Across the world, women depend more on, yet have less access to, natural resources.”</p>\n<p>Art too has been responding to the concept of ecofeminism since the 1970s. A landmark 2020 exhibition, <i>ecofeminism (s)</i> —curated by Monika Fabijanska, an art historian who specialises in women’s and feminist art at the Thomas Erben Gallery in New York—offered a historical perspective of this genre of art, and its relevance today. The curatorial note stated that “ecofeminism is one of the richest hidden caches of contemporary art. It is art that delights the eye, provokes the mind, and can inspire change. It also restores art’s function to what it was before the Enlightenment, when both science and art were tools to understand the world and propose solutions.”</p>\n<p>The exhibition looked at the works of pioneering artists such as Betsy Damon, Ana Mendieta, Aviva Rahmani and Cecilia Vicuña, “and how their ideas and strategies are continued, developed or opposed by the young generation”. In India too, over the past few decades, contemporary artists such as Vibha Galhotra, Sonia Mehra Chawla, Navjot Altaf and Rohini Devasher have consistently been responding to political and environmental ecologies, but without really defining themselves as ecofeminists.</p>\n<p>However, there has been a change in the way artists are now excavating complex relationships between gender, ecology, capitalism, oppression, and more. The scope has expanded to include queer histories, anti-nuclear war sentiments, and privatisation of land resources. The mediums too have moved beyond painting and sculpture to include performance art and multimedia, with the body playing an integral role in the work. Bhavna Kakar, founder, Gallery Latitude 28, Delhi—who represents ecofeminist artists such as Das and Manjot Kaur— feels that this genre of art plays, now more than ever, a pivotal role in amplifying suppressed voices, evoking empathy, and inspiring action towards collective responsibility to nurture and protect our ecosystem for future generations.</p>\n<p>\n\t                                        \n\t                                    \t2023 witnessed some of the highest temperatures on earth, and many countries around the world grappled with extreme weather conditions. It is no wonder then that the past two years have seen a rise in the number of exhibitions focusing on ecofeminist art as well in response to these changes. For instance, the Tai Kwun Contemporary in Hong Kong presented <i>Green Snake: Women-Centred Ecologies</i>, between 20 December 2023 and 1 April 2024.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/ecofeminist-art-intersection-feminism-ecology-climate-change-politics-111713457421850.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

My parents driving across five states to stay with our four-year-old who would have been your sibling, his hand waving out the car window when they drove him to preschool the morning we left for the hospital, as if waving you goodbye. Canceling the baby books and the teething ring but not catching the gray stuffed bunny that still arrived and that your father hid in his closet so I wouldn’t see it but still did, clutching it to my chest and hearing the howl. Telling our four-year-old there would be no sibling. Giving him the bunny that would have been yours that eight months later he still holds to his own chest in his sleep. Seeing just this morning the last item I placed on the registry for you, a package of pacifiers three days before you died inside me. Letting go of your father’s hand and your aunt’s hand when the doctors wheeled me back for surgery. Selecting an urn at the funeral home, one shelf of infant-sized vessels. Filling out the cremation forms, never married, birth and death the same date. Standing on the driveway the night before the funeral home told us you would be cremated, half-sane beneath the midnight stars, your father and sibling long asleep inside the house, the only place I knew to go to still look for you, your last night on the sear of this earth. Our child hugging the stuffed bear that the funeral home sent with the urn, zipped inside something we could still hold. Sharing the same room, however many brief minutes, when the doctor pulled you from me in the surgical theater, the exact number of seconds I will never know, my brain fuzzed out into anesthetized unconsciousness. The doctor capturing your footprints, what your father and I opened on the day you should have been born, ink-blue and perfect. Inking the songbird after which you were named into my arm, measured to the exact size you were, the tattoo artist’s needle never digging deep enough, a pain I wanted to feel bleed down into bone. Reading the post-loss notes in my medical record, a detailed and clinical description of your removal from my body that concluded nonetheless in an entire paragraph on grief, containing your name, that I should carry your legacy forward by telling your story. Hearing your name in our child’s mouth, what we never told him, what he must have still heard. He said your name at bedtime last month and the breath stopped in my lungs and I asked if he meant the gray bunny beside him on the pillow and he shook his head, he said the bear, he said the stuffed bear, he said,<graphic src=\"https://brevitymag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Valente-Pear-1-300x233.jpg\"/></p>\n    <p>\n      <i>we’ll take care of Wren.<br/>___</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>___</p>\n    <p><a href=\"http://www.annevalente.com\"> Anne Valente</a> is the author of two novels, </p>\n    <p><i>Our Hearts Will Burn Us Down</i>(William Morrow/HarperCollins, 2016) and</p>\n    <p><i>The Desert Sky Before Us</i>(William Morrow, 2019), as well as the short story collection,</p>\n    <p><i>By Light We Knew Our Names</i>(Dzanc Prize, 2014).

G is at the hospital. Their kids are on their way.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>A Bit of It</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Hours later, a posted photo of the accident site on Facebook shows one car destroyed, the front end crushed, the rest damaged by fire. D’s car is farther down the four-lane highway, twisted sideways and pressed against a guardrail. “Whoever was driving the less damaged car,” the poster writes, “is the one who was seriously injured.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>A Glimpse of It</i>\n    </p>\n<p>In the comments that scroll below, a familiar name says she’s so sorry she didn’t recognize D’s car as she was slowly passing by in the one open lane. “All I thought was how awful it must have been by the look of the car that hit him, how fast it must have been flying down that hill to have its engine explode like that.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Some of It</i>\n    </p>\n<p>The following day, an electronic newspaper article reports that it’s still undetermined how it happened, but the elderly driver of the car that was struck while attempting to cross Rte. 15 was entrapped for two hours, that after being extracted, he was life-flighted to the hospital. “After extensive surgery, he is listed in critical condition. The other driver, nineteen, escaped serious injury even though his car was demolished and caught fire.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>More of It</i>\n    </p>\n<p>The detailed police report, when released a week later, is one short paragraph. In three sentences, it declares that there is no evidence that the uninjured driver was speeding. That he was not impaired by drugs or alcohol. It concludes by saying that the retired professor, who has died despite two major surgeries, pulled from a side road and attempted to cross two lanes of highway with “insufficient clearance.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>The Rest of It</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Because the retired professor was more than forty years a close friend, the report’s absence of detail magnifies the immediacy of his sudden absence. There is nothing revealed about what was surely, mid-afternoon, on D’s car radio—an NPR showcase of classical music. No reassurance that his seat belt lay snug around his waist and against his chest where his heart kept its reliable pace. No mention that his vision was recently recorded as 20/20 after being restored to perfection by cataract surgery. That his trained, historian’s mind, supplemented by extensive research, was mid-way through producing another commissioned book. Not a word about the why of his choosing Laurel Road, the most unlikely route for haste or convenience or mileage saved. Not a phrase about his retiree’s love of finding an unusual rather than a shortest route to anywhere he had to drive for the errands that were within thirty miles of his home. No investigation into October’s temptation of leaves, D’s annual self-guided motor tour where ash, sycamore, maple, and beech synchronize into Pennsylvania’s spectrum upon one particular, brilliant hillside for a few hours, receiving the slanted light so perfectly that whatever errand D had could wait patiently in a neighboring town eight miles north of Laurel Road. No speculation about how, each autumn, one farmer sells cider by that roadside until October’s end, closing his stand’s produce season with something that might have held an old, faithful customer for conversation while he sampled a preview of the gallon discovered intact behind the driver’s-side seat. How that highly likely give-and-take affected timing to the smidgeon of a second when fate exclaimed “Now” as D accelerated across those two downhill lanes, the high-speed rural-area traffic light and intermittent, even what could be called “spotty” just after three p.m., NPR’s “Here and Now” begun, the sun behind him, the sky clear of clouds.<br/>\n__</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:gfincke@susqu.edu\"> Gary Fincke’s</a> essay collection </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brevitymag.com/current-issue/all-of-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

(I am not allowed to drive for a month.) I sat in the passenger seat and cried and hugged tight a gigantic red heart-shaped pillow—a pillow you must lug around everywhere and clutch against your sternum in case of coughing, laughing, or sneezing (God forbid you sneeze: the pain is majestic in its agony) and even hug at night as you attempt to sleep on your back. My wife, who is a professional therapist, patted my left knee and said, “You do belong here. It’s okay. Remember they said you might cry a lot more after. Go ahead and cry…”</p>\n    <p>With the elderly I sit in a line of gray plastic chairs and I wait for the kinesiology interns from the local college to take my blood pressure and I watch the row of televisions—game shows on silent, local news on silent, a video about the circulation of the blood and another about eating a diet rich in nuts, fruit, and fish, both on silent but with closed captions—and nod along and listen. Mostly the elderly talk about their daughters. Or about death, but in a casual manner. For example, a typical statement might be, “Well, I’ll see you on Monday, if I even wake up tomorrow at all.” Or, “A young man like you should go to Alaska. My daughter Jenny went to Alaska on a cruise. She loved it.” And of course, the weather.</p>\n    <p>The weather should be a universal language, direct and elusive, forthright and yet metaphorical, but I never know how to reply. We need rain, we don’t need rain. I agree it’s cold. Colder than the ice storm of 1973? I’m not certain.</p>\n    <p>I went on a cruise once and it made me feel like I was trapped inside a snow globe inside a disco ball inside an overripe rotting watermelon sculpture of my own bloated face. And, yes, I understand the inevitability of death—as Larkin noted, “Some things may happen, this one WILL.”—but I don’t necessarily want to dwell.</p>\n    <p>And daughters. Mine is 17, and we both believe in The Smiths. We believe in Morrissey. What else do we share? Possibly she is slipping away from me…</p>\n    <p>Surely anyone can talk about the weather, can speak of sunshine, or of sleet sweeping the roof of the rehab gym. I used to work outside, on a motley landscaping crew: an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, a schizophrenic named Maxine who lived on the psych ward of the local V.A. hospital, the young frat-bro owner of the business who was never around except for payday (under the table, cash), and me. So many stories, so many tiny stories, of a truly odd summer in Tuscaloosa, Alabama: shattered windows, malt liquor, a man abandoned in a deep forest, a runaway truck (faulty brakes), a stolen purse, the V. A. nurse… gasoline, fire, fire ants, a rattlesnake, a llama, an ostrich, and a Great Dane. Days of hammering rain, which meant no work and no money. Days of scorching sun, humidity leeching out salt and sweat as we mowed, ran the weed-eaters and the blowers, planted flowers and ground shrubs and trees, dug holes in the red clay and ate dust and felt a shift in the wind and watched the skies, yellow, soapy, strange… ”A twister coming this way,” Maxine said. And it was.</p>\n    <p>Should I share these stories with my elderly friends? No, not today. Scale, blood pressure, Spectra 360, EKG, treadmill, bike, blood pressure… I fumble for my coat and hat. An icy parking lot under a veil of wispy cirrostratus clouds. Or perhaps they are cirrus.<br/>\n__</p>\n    <p><strong>Sean Lovelace</strong> lives in Indiana, where he chairs the English Department at Ball State University.

I told you you were too good for this life. I told you that you should die because you thought that The Sea and Cake cover of “Sound and Vision” was better than the original. I didn’t really mean it. I drove you to score. I wondered if you’d have a tragic end like in the movies. <i>They only want you when you’re 17; when you’re 21, you’re no fun</i>, you sang in the car. Our lives felt tragic, and maybe they were. I bought into the romance of it. Made it feel like a movie. This was the only way I knew how to support you. Can you forgive me?</p>\n    <p>I remember when you tied me to your daddy’s bedpost, making the knots so tight I couldn’t move. You were sick of me saying no. My boner was a stand-in for yes. I didn’t have the words to ask you how you lost your virginity, the words to tell you that even though I didn’t want you like that, you were the closest to desire I had ever found. In my mind, you had always had sex. Was I even 18 then? If I hadn’t balked and begged for you to stop, I would have been a father—I’m sure of it. When people ask me about my Coney Island, I don’t have the heart to tell them; this is it. The cosmos aren’t consensual. Real life breaks you. In my dream, you would never have become a junkie. We would have named our kid Oscar. You would tell everyone that a gay man got you pregnant, and I would get so mad about it that one day we’d do it all over again. This was before the johns, when you were just a teen cokehead, a high school dropout living off the glamor of your absent daddy’s shame, before I drove you around to score, before I refused then let up just to refuse again. When it was one of your other gays who took you to your shifts at McDonald’s, to your dealers’ houses, to church. You who always needed a ride. Who was always going somewhere. Anywhere but up, you’d say.</p>\n    <p>Of course I know what Oscar Wilde has to say about stars. How many times did you recite that quote? Sneaking through the wooded trails during third period to go to my house and smoke cigarettes, coasting along country roads to your thirty-something-year-old boyfriend’s trailer in the sticks, making a home under the big Christmas tree in the mall. The cover of foliage, the hood of the car, the metal and plastic of the artificial fir: there was always a barrier between us and the night sky. It was something between protection and curse.</p>\n    <p>The first time you got arrested, the sky felt so big, it was suffocating. When I moved away, and my parents drove me the three thousand miles to the Pacific, I did nothing but encounter the mordant blankness of it, letting the pain strike me until it turned to numbness.</p>\n    <p>In my half-life since, I have learned to look at stars. You’ve got to take in the vastness like a punch to the gut. Consider your smallness. Let it mull over you. Stars have half-lives that we can’t even fathom.</p>\n    <p>Somewhere up there, Oscar is turning 18. We used to say the best die young, but eighteen years later, I feel like I’m just beginning to live. Back then, we were in the gutter, sure, but it was you who made me really look up. The absence of you, but yes, it was you.</p>\n    <p>The next time we cross paths, can you tell me if you feel the same?<br/>\n__</p>\n    <p><strong>  C.R.

When it’s ready he will call me down and seat me in the sun in the small courtyard between his house and studio, where he’s set a table for one: crisp white cloth, spotless silver cutlery. He’ll serve me orange juice, granola and coffee.</p>\n    <p>The flowers in the photograph are larger than life, velvety like the soft white skin of my inner thigh. They have been positioned against a dark background to look like a Dutch <i>vanitas </i>painting, a reminder of mortality.</p>\n    <p>My boyfriend buys me gifts: a necklace with a silver charm in the shape of an open book. He tells me he wishes he could introduce me to his parents, but they are dead. He shows me off to his neighbors at a party, wearing a new dress he chose for me.</p>\n    <p>One day I wake to find him sitting on the bed beside me. I am lying on my stomach. The bottom half of my body is naked. He has lifted the covers and, although I cannot be sure, I think he has taken a photograph.</p>\n    <p>I start to have panic attacks at work. It’s a good excuse for him to pick me up in his late model Audi, drive me back to his house and put me to bed. There’s no need to call my family or friends. He will take care of me.</p>\n    <p>One evening he is scrolling through my mobile and finds I have been messaging a friend. He hurls the phone across the room where it smacks into the wall, barely missing the picture of the flowers.</p>\n    <p>“She’s a slut!” he hisses.</p>\n    <p>He holds me down on the bed, bites my ear, presses his hands over my face.</p>\n    <p>“You’re a slut too.”</p>\n    <p>The next morning, alone in bed, I stare at the white camellias. Their broad petals seem to billow as if in a light breeze. I narrow my gaze and the flowerheads look like they are moving towards me from out of the frame. There is an object in the image I hadn’t focussed on before. It is a small human skull.</p>\n    <p>My boyfriend calls me down to breakfast. I sit at the outdoor table with my hands folded neatly in my lap, as if I am about to be photographed. He pours orange juice and steps back to watch me drink it.

    "body": "<h2>The sky above us is a complex ecosystem, just like the land and sea. A new field of research is bringing a fresh understanding of the birds, bugs and other species that live there</h2>\n<p>Each year on September 11, visitors gather at the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum in Lower Manhattan to watch an art installation called Tribute in Light. Two ramrod-straight beams pierce the night sky, representing the fallen Twin Towers and all the people who perished from the attack. Each beam is made using 44 blazing 7,000-watt xenon spotlights. On a clear night, people in the New York area can see the display within a 60-mile radius—it’s beautiful, soul-stirring, poignant.</p>\n<p>The light show is also mesmerizing to passing birds. Early September is the peak of fall migration along the Atlantic Coast, and birds from the northern United States and Canada—from warblers to sparrows to nighthawks—are streaming south through the skies above Manhattan. Once the tribute switches on, something comes over them: Researchers using weather radar and other types of remote sensing found in 2015 that the number of birds in the vicinity increased from 500 to nearly 16,000.</p>\n<p>As the birds enter the columns of light, each beam measuring 48 feet by 48 feet, they become so mesmerized that they forget themselves and their journey. They circle, zombie-like, inside the beams in growing numbers, calling out loudly, and their circling grows lower in altitude. If they fly too low in this disoriented state, they risk crashing into buildings or onto the pavement.</p>\n<p>Last year on September 11, I joined a group of binocular-bedecked staff and volunteers from the New York City Bird Alliance atop the Battery Parking Garage—the staging ground for the light show—for the group’s annual all-night vigil. Some of the volunteers had personal connections to 9/11—they’d lost loved ones or a limb or otherwise suffered trauma that day. Looking out for the birds is part of their healing journey. The light show’s producers and their equipment were stationed beside us on the roof of the garage.</p>\n<p>Around 10:30 p.m., as the birds appeared to descend into the danger zone, the aptly named Dustin Partridge, director of conservation and science for the alliance, asked the production company to switch off the installation. Immediately, the sky went dark, and the loud call of confused birds ceased. After 15 or 20 minutes, the lights went back on. (Insects get no such consideration. From our perch on the garage, we could see them wander into the source of the light beams and disappear with a loud zap and a puff of smoke.)</p>\n<p>Partridge signaled three switch-offs before midnight, and after that, the birds stayed out of the beams until daybreak. “If we weren’t there, the situation would be very different,” he told me after the all-nighter. “We would quite literally have thousands of birds becoming exhausted and falling from the sky or colliding with buildings nearby.”</p>\n<p>The vigil that night was a practical application of a young field called aeroecology. For a long time, scientists who studied flying creatures focused on their earthbound activities: nesting, foraging and mating. Because of a lack of technology, their time in the sky was largely left out. In the 1940s, George Lowery, an eminent ornithologist and zoologist at Louisiana State University, organized volunteers to document nighttime migrations of birds as their silhouettes crossed the face of the moon. But as recently as 2008 such studies were still rare enough that Thomas Kunz, a bat biologist at Boston University, wrote an influential paper, titled “Aeroecology: Probing and Modeling the Aerosphere.” He urged fellow scientists to regard the space above the ground not as a transitional void between point A and point B, but as a complex ecosystem in its own right.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/new-science-aeroecology-tells-more-about-amazing-creatures-humans-can-ensure-survival-180987151/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The structure is known as a <a href=\"https://esahubble.org/wordbank/planetary-nebula/\">planetary nebula</a>, though the term is a bit of a misnomer—it comes from the fact that early astronomers described the shapes of these nebulas as resembling planets. In reality, planetary nebulas like NGC 6302 are formed when a star nears the end of its life, as the outer layers of the star are shed into a cloud of glowing gas and dust. The planetary nebula phase is extremely short-lived on astronomical timescales, lasting only about 20,000 years.</p>\n    <h4>Fun fact: Planetary nebulas</h4>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/research/topic/planetary-nebulas\">Planetary nebulas</a> are formed by stars with <a href=\"https://esahubble.org/wordbank/planetary-nebula/\">0.8 to 8 times</a> the mass of our sun.</p>\n    <p>This cosmic butterfly is considered bipolar, because it has two lobes spreading out in different directions and giving it its “wings.” What looks like the butterfly’s body is actually a side view of a dark band of dusty gas—known as a <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2006/07/Dust_torus_around_a_supermassive_black_hole\">torus</a>—hiding the nebula’s central star.</p>\n    <p>The JWST image, taken with the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/webb/mid-infrared-instrument-miri/\">Mid-Infrared Instrument</a> (MIRI), focuses on that torus. The researchers also used radio data from the<a href=\"https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/home/\"> Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array</a> (ALMA) to supplement the space telescope’s observations. They were able to determine the location of the nebula’s central star, which, at 220,000 degrees Kelvin, is one of the hottest planetary nebula stars in the Milky Way. The research was published in the <i>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</i><i> </i>on August 27.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/HbRzasisfYu9w6n75eKn_bSk6KU=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(425x215:426x216)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/4b/a0/4ba0314e-9379-4606-9efa-3e836a4a3bf4/butterfly_nebula_ngc_6302_webb_and_alma_image_annotated.jpeg\" alt=\"an annotated image of the Butterfly Nebula\"/>\n    <p>Importantly, the new observations also allowed the researchers to gather more information about the formation of cosmic dust. The torus is made up of tiny crystalline silicates, such as quartz, and irregularly shaped dust grains. The grains are just a millionth of a meter long, but that’s larger than most cosmic dust. This indicates the dust has been around for a while and is also suggestive of the beginnings of planet formation.</p>\n    <p>“For years, scientists have debated how cosmic dust forms in space. But now, with the help of the powerful James Webb Space Telescope, we may finally have a clearer picture,” says <a href=\"https://profiles.cardiff.ac.uk/staff/matsuuram\">Mikako Matsuura</a>, an astrophysicist at Cardiff University in Wales who led the research, in a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250828002403.htm\">statement</a>. “We were able to see both cool gemstones formed in calm, long-lasting zones and fiery grime created in violent, fast-moving parts of space, all within a single object.”</p>\n    <p>“This discovery is a big step forward in understanding how the basic materials of planets come together,” adds Matsuura.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/1MW6Sa45JOi1kFna18Hwy-qsHZI=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(2550x850:2551x851)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/97/38/97384179-339f-4642-8015-e062af9ae1d3/butterfly_nebula_ngc_6302_hubble_webb_alma_images.jpg\" alt=\"a panel of three images showing different views of the Nebula\"/>\n    <p>The researchers spotted iron and nickel in jets that extend outward from the star, opposite each other. They also noted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), carbon-based molecules that, on Earth, are often found in campfire smoke or burnt toast. They’re also <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2021/space-complex-carbon-molecules-0318\">abundant in space</a>, and scientists suspect they play a key role in the formation of stars and planets, writes <i> Space.com</i>’s Keith Cooper. The PAHs in the Butterfly Nebula have a ring-like structure and likely formed when a bubble of wind from the central star hit the surrounding gas. They could be the first evidence of PAHs in an oxygen-rich planetary nebula, per the statement.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/see-the-stunning-butterfly-nebula-in-a-new-image-from-the-james-webb-space-telescope-180987267/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Publications including “Mademoiselle,” “Glamour” and the long-forgortten “Charm” first emerged in the 1930s to satisfy an emergent force in the workplace</h2>\n<p><i>Charm</i>amid traffic on Park Avenue. William Helburn / Getty Images</p>\n<p>Sometime during the Great Depression, a high school student named Helen Ralston complained to her father that she and her friends were fed up with <i>Vogue </i>and <i>Harper’s Bazaar</i>. The French couture and luxurious lifestyles promoted in their pages were unattainable, she said, while the articles did not speak to the interests of young women or girls her age. There were another 40-odd women’s magazines on the market, but all were aimed at housewives. </p>\n<p>Luckily for Helen, her father, Henry W. Ralston, a vice president of the New York publishing company Street &amp; Smith, was in a position to address her concerns. Since the 19th century, his firm had been turning out men’s and boys’ fiction by authors like Horatio Alger and Bret Harte, plus pulps and comic books like <i>Detective Story</i> and <i>Buffalo Bill</i>. Fired by this bracing wisdom from his daughter, in February 1935, Henry and his colleagues introduced <i>Mademoiselle</i>, the country’s first magazine for young women, which also became the first “career-girl” magazine in the United States. </p>\n<p>The extraordinary early history of <i>Mademoiselle</i>, and of the similar publications it inspired, is little known. A close study of their archives reveals an era of remarkable advancements for American women—poignant, as it proved so fragile. Nonetheless, these women writers and editors helped write an early and important draft of 20th-century American feminism. And they did it in style. </p>\n<p><i>Mademoiselle</i>’s first issue, conceived by a primarily male editorial team, got off to an inauspicious start. Later a newsagent told the editors that its few buyers were mostly men who, drawn by the saucy French name—and perhaps also by the cover photo, of a woman in a backless evening gown—mistakenly assumed it was a “girlie book.” Instead, the issue contained a grab bag of material concocted for a youthful female reader, including fashion sketches, girls’ adventure stories and overwrought tales of romance, one concerning a Southern gent who shocks himself by falling for a Yankee at a ball. Humiliated by low sales, the editors swiftly withdrew the sorry experiment from newsstands and halted publication for a month to regroup. </p>\n<p>Thankfully, by then they had hired Betsy Talbot Blackwell, a 29-year-old journalist with more than a decade’s experience in fashion reporting and marketing. Blackwell also had an adolescent stepdaughter, an impressive bullpen of writer friends on whom she could call and above all a keen sense of what young women wanted: something totally unlike their mothers’ magazines.</p>\n<p><i>Mademoiselle</i> originally targeted women between the ages of 18 and 30, all of whom had come of age knowing they could vote. “What nobody seemed to have noticed was that women had changed,” Blackwell later reflected. “Younger women were in revolt. Their ideas were different from their mothers’....They were not interested solely in recipes or babies. They were going to college. They were getting jobs.” </p>\n<p>She went after college women, publishing first-rate writing by authors like the wildly popular French writer of the day known as Colette, and pulling together an advisory “College Board” of students, who sent in tips about fashions and social trends. The magazine drew more eyeballs with an annual August “Guest Editors” issue, also assembled by students. This gambit, for which <i>Mademoiselle</i> is best remembered today, later helped launch literary stars like Sylvia Plath and Joan Didion. </p>\n<p>Other attention-getting ploys included a series in which a Hollywood makeup artist revealed beauty tricks used by actresses, adapted for home use. When a self-described “homely” nurse wrote in, begging <i>Mademoiselle</i> to transform her “from ugly duckling even into a pale pink swan,” the editors created the first makeover. Nurse Barbara’s metamorphosis made national news, winning a page of admiring coverage in <i>Time</i> magazine. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/first-magazines-written-for-career-women-reveal-portrait-immense-creativity-hope-180987174/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

News like this prompted Torako to write to her husband, whom she hadn’t heard from in a year. She starts her letter stating, “Even the indomitable Yamato spirit seems to have had no choice but to surrender before the power of science,” referencing the cultural value of <i>Yamato-damashii</i>, or Japanese soul, along with the U.S. use of the atomic bomb <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/nine-harrowing-eyewitness-accounts-bombings-hiroshima-and-nagasaki-180975480/\">in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</a> Then, Torako gives updates on their three children and their new living situation. She concludes by writing, “Please come home quickly. We don’t need anything—just your safe return. Even if it’s autumn or winter, with you back, the house will feel like spring again. So, with that in mind, the entire family is waiting for your return.”</p>\n<p>Her letter was never delivered to Tadao, as he had already died (according to the Toyoshima family). This letter was also never returned to Torako. Instead, decades later, it arrived at the Smithsonian affiliate <a href=\"https://www.evergreenmuseum.org/\">Evergreen Aviation &amp; Space Museum</a> in western Oregon. Now the museum, working closely with <a href=\"https://www.obonsociety.org/\">Obon Society</a>, a nonprofit organization also based in Oregon, is returning Torako’s letter and many other letters written to Japanese military members in 1945 to the descendants and relatives of their intended recipients. The correspondence contains names and addresses, making it possible for the groups to find the families in Japan.</p>\n<p>The Evergreen Aviation &amp; Space Museum is a nonprofit that <a href=\"https://www.evergreenmuseum.org/about/\">focuses</a> on “preserving the artifacts and telling the stories of the men and women who impacted our current-day aviators, astronauts, engineers and explorers.” Some of its artifacts include the <i> Spruce Goose</i> (a wooden plane with a 320-foot wingspan) and the </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.evergreenmuseum.org/exhibit/titan-ii/\">Titan II</a>(a 103-foot-tall rocket used in the U.S. space program).</p>\n<p>The collections department at the Evergreen Aviation &amp; Space Museum stores and processes all artifacts that have been donated, gifted or lent to the museum. Jean Herkamp, the lead of volunteers for this department, describes her staff as “the caretakers of all the items.” In September 2024, fellow volunteer Barb Pittman was organizing shelves when she came across a small bag with Japanese writing on it. In the bag she found 116 objects: a mixture of postcards and letters in envelopes, all written in Japanese. Pittman then brought these objects to Herkamp’s attention.</p>\n<p>The full history of how this correspondence arrived in the U.S. and where it stayed over the intervening decades is not completely clear. Herkamp and the Evergreen team were able to piece together some information about the messages’ histories. They came to the museum in 2010, when a woman named Helen Hayley donated them, stating that they were found by her father who served during World War II and had since died. Hayley’s father said he found them in a “<a href=\"https://postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibition/about-postal-operations-administration/dead-letter-office\">dead letter</a>” file when he worked at a post office in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/a-batch-of-undelivered-wwii-letters-intended-for-japanese-soldiers-ended-up-in-an-oregon-museum-decades-later-now-experts-are-returning-the-lost-correspondence-to-their-families-180987271/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It had been tucked away in storage for half a century</h2>\n<p>In the 1970s, Oretta Kanady was working at the Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino, California, when she noticed an old logbook in the trash. She didn’t know what it was, but she asked her superiors if she could keep it. They said yes.</p>\n<p>When she got home, she gave the tome to her teenage son, Michael William Bonds. He never examined it closely—but he kept it.</p>\n<p>“I’ve had it ever since,” Bonds, now 65, tells the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2025/08/18/pearl-harbor-navy-attack-book-lost-archives-found/\"> Washington Post</a>’s Michael E. Ruane. “In the last few years, I’ve moved here, moved there. It’s just been in a box.”</p>\n<p>The volume turned out to be a logbook from the naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. Now, half a century later, the National Archives has recovered the text, which includes records from before, during and after the <a href=\"https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/topics/pearl-harbor-december-7-1941\">attack on December 7, 1941</a>.</p>\n<p>At more than 500 pages, the logbook contains “regular, handwritten entries from March 1941—when war in Europe was raging but prior to the entry of the United States—to June 1942 at the <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/true-story-battle-midway-180973516/\">Battle of Midway</a>,” according to a <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/news/articles/nara-recovers-phny-logbook\">statement</a> from the National Archives.</p>\n<p>Bonds didn’t recognize the logbook’s significance until last year, when he moved in with his fiancée, Tracylyn Sharrit, in Hemet, California. She was helping him unpack his books when she noticed the mysterious volume. Every page that had been filled in featured a stamp at the top, which read either “Pearl Harbor” or “Pearl Harbor, T.H.”—short for <a href=\"https://www.hawaiimagazine.com/hawaiis-statehood-remembered/\">Territory of Hawaii</a>.</p>\n<p>The logbook recorded the barometric pressure, air temperature, water temperature, wind direction, wind force and weather every four hours, as well as the names of the ships that came and went each day. It also featured a section at the bottom of each page titled “remarks.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.army.mil/article/272241/remembering_pearl_harbor\">2,400 Americans</a>perished during Japan’s attack in 1941.</p>\n<p>On December 6 and 7, 1941, the “remarks” sections contained the <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/552663772?objectPage=286\">following notes</a>: “At 0657 unknown submarine (Japanese) attacked—was attacked and sunk near entrance. At 0755 Japanese aircraft and submarines attacked Pearl Harbor and other military and naval objectives on Oahu.”</p>\n<p>Sharrit was stunned. Could this kind of contemporaneous account be valuable? The couple contacted experts at <a href=\"https://www.whitmorerarebooks.com/\">Whitmore Rare Books</a> in Pasadena, California, to find out.</p>\n<p>“When someone reaches out and says, ‘Hey, we’ve got the station logbook during the attacks of Pearl Harbor,’ your ears perk up,” Dan Whitmore, the founder of the company, tells the <i>Washington Post</i>, which first reported the discovery. “That’s a significant cultural object.”</p>\n<p>Whitmore wasn’t sure how much it was worth, though he wondered if it could be a lot—maybe even six figures. But there was one complication: He worried the book could still be considered government property.</p>\n<p>When Whitmore contacted the National Archives, he learned that his hunch had been correct. A special agent with the National Archives flew to California, and the couple handed over their discovery. As gratitude, they received two National Archives T-shirts.</p>\n<p>“This special item is one of the few surviving records that helps tell the story of the ‘<a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1986022.afc1986022_ms2201/?st=text\">date which will live in infamy</a>,’” says Jim Byron, a senior adviser at the archives, in the statement. “Thanks to the efforts of [a] historically conscious California couple, it is now available to the American people, allowing everyone to better appreciate their history—and especially the sacrifice and heroism of December 7, 1941.”</p>\n<p><i>West Virginia</i>and USS</p>\n<p><i>Tennessee</i>after the attack on Pearl Harbor.

After all, without his mother’s keen eye, “it would have been gone and nobody would have ever seen it again,” he tells the <i>Washington Post</i>. “All I got was a T-shirt so far.”</p>\n<p>But officials are thankful that the logbook has returned to the National Archives, where it was formally unveiled in August.

    "body": "<p>T20 cricket was already a slam-bam affair compared to longer forms of the game. Relatively small grounds and mostly easy wickets made it even more so in the Indian Premier League (IPL). And yet, some IPL administrators wanted to give “entertainment” a bigger push, with more fours and sixes.</p>\n<p>So they came up with an “impact sub”, which essentially gives a team an extra batsman. In a 20-over game, that’s a huge deal. It means a team can have seven specialist batsmen plus an all-rounder or two. And yet, when it’s their turn to bowl, they can still have a full complement of their five best bowlers and more.</p>\n<p>With eight or nine batsmen, a team can keep going hard for 20 overs even if it loses two wickets every five overs. There’s almost no fear of getting bowled out or running out of batsmen in this scenario. So we are getting used to 250 plus scores.</p>\n<p>Is that high entertainment though? What makes cricket a nuanced game are the choices it forces captains, coaches, and players to make. On a particular surface, for example, should you aim for 250 and risk getting bowled out for 150, or settle for 200?</p>\n<p>The fundamental problem with the impact sub is that it has destroyed these trade-offs that make cricket truly engrossing. We anticipated this, in an article in <i>Lounge</i>, two years ago, titled <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/why-the-ipl-does-not-need-a-supersub-111663669791842.html\"> Why the IPL does not need a ‘supersub’</a>, before the rule was introduced in IPL 2023. Now, several players, including Indian captain Rohit Sharma, are speaking out on the damage it’s doing.</p>\n<p>While Sharma talks about the harm to Indian cricket because all-rounders are sidelined, it is sucking the life out of T20 cricket in even more insidious ways. Here are five reasons to drop the impact sub:</p>\n<p><strong>Diminishing value of wickets: </strong>After Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) got off to a blistering start in Delhi on 20 April, left-arm leg-spinner Kuldeep Yadav of Delhi Capitals (DC) struck three quick blows. Then Axar Patel removed Heinrich Klaasen with the first ball of the 10th over. SRH’s top four batsmen were back in the hut with 11 overs to go.</p>\n<p>Normally, a slowdown or even a collapse would have ensued—a fair price to pay for being ultra aggressive with the bat. But with extended batting resources, the loss of wickets barely made a dent in the scoring. SRH ended up with 266 and won easily.</p>\n<p>This is just one example of the diminishing value of taking wickets because teams have an extra batsman. Yadav’s triple-strike on a batting paradise in a small ground counted for almost nothing. When there are no consequences to going gung-ho with the bat, it’s no fun to see 250 plus scores.</p>\n<p><strong>Choice of playing 11: </strong>Eleven players in a team is one of the fundamental characteristics of cricket. Over decades, it has created a fine balance between batsmen and bowlers. Indian coach Rahul Dravid must have agonised over the fifth bowler before picking Shardul Thakur for his all-round promise, and leaving out strike bowler Mohammed Shami from the playing 11 of the 2023 ODI World Cup at the outset. Shami came in after four matches and became the highest wicket-taker of the tournament.</p>\n<p>These are the sorts of choices that coaches and captains had to make when picking a playing 11 in the IPL too, which fans enjoyed debating. Now the impact sub, who is really a 12th member in the side, has destroyed this strategic aspect of the game. The rule says, you can have your cake and eat it too.</p>\n<p>With an impact sub, Imran Khan would not have required his ingenuity of picking five specialist bowlers to win the 1992 ODI World Cup for Pakistan. Every team would have had five specialist bowlers instead of fiddling with all-rounders.</p>\n<p><strong>Lowering stature of bowlers: </strong>The T20 game is already stacked against bowlers. Most wickets are flat, grounds are small, and the white ball stops swinging after four overs. Now the impact sub has added the pressure of the top order swinging at every ball with impunity.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/indian-premier-league-ipl-2024-impact-subs-cricket-t20-111714052296487.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n\t                                        \n\t                                    \tMany years ago in a café in Paris, psychoanalyst Sudhir Kakar and novelist Namita Gokhale spent hours talking about mysticism and the Bhutanese-Tibetan monk Drukpa Kunley. Sometime later, some of these thoughts made their way into Kakar’s 2008 book <i>Mad and Divine: Spirit and Psyche in the Modern World</i>. The book, which specifically had a chapter devoted to Kunley, challenged the prevailing notion in psychoanalysis that the body and spirit ought to be studied separately. </p>\n<p>“It is such a deep and important book,” recalls Gokhale, who authored<i> Mystics and Sceptics: In Search of the Himalayan Masters</i> in 2023. “It was a very layered understanding of human consciousness. And he could communicate these layers with simplicity,” she notes. This was the case at the many editions of Jaipur Literature Festivals that he attended (last in 2016), of which Gokhale is co-founder and co-director. “Apart from being a great writer, he was a great communicator. There was an ease in his speaking…psychotherapists usually only analyse individuals with the grammar of the Western world. But Sudhir would always root it in and look at the Indian context. That was his genius,” she says. </p>\n<p>Gokhale’s remarks are reminiscent of what a review of Kakar’s <i>Mad and Divine</i>, published in the 2011 edition of <i>The Journal of Asian Studies </i>had also noted. The author Daniel J. Meckel, an associate professor of philosophy and religious studies at the St. Mary’s College of Maryland writes that with the book, “Kakar once again brings an extraordinary depth of psychoanalytic and Indian sensibilities to bear on topics of sainthood, religious ritual, and healing in India, as well as the profession of psychoanalysis itself.” </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Also Read: </i>\n      <i>Story of Sigmund Freud’s home</i>\n    </p>\n<p>This sense—that Kakar was one of the few intellectuals who managed to forge a new, original, and Indian path in the field of psychoanalysis—strongly colours the memories of most who remember him today. Internationally, a well-awarded academic and author of 20 books, including six works of fiction, Kakar died on 22 April. He was 86.</p>\n<p>Among his works of fiction are <i>The Ascetic of Desire</i>, a fictionalisation of the life of Vatsayana, the sage who wrote the Kama Sutra, <i>The Kipling File</i>, a similar treatment of the British Indian writer Rudyard Kipling’s life, and <i>Mira And The Mahatma</i>, another novelisation of the relationship between Mohandas Gandhi and his follower Madeleine Slade or Mira Behn. His non-fiction includes <i>Inner World</i>, a study of Swami Vivekananda; <i>Analyst and Mystic</i>, a similar study of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa; <i>Shamans, Mystics, And Doctors</i>, a psychological study of the ancient healing traditions of India; and <i>The Colours of Violence</i>, a psychoanalytical examination of the causes of communal violence in the country. </p>\n<p>Kakar, an engineer by training, also earned a doctorate in Economics from the University of Vienna, and later trained at the Sigmund Freud Institute in the University of Frankfurt.</p>\n<p>“He was a rare intellectual,” says Ramin Jahanbegloo, Iranian-born philosopher and friend of Kakar’s for over 20 years. “But beyond his work on Indian psychoanalysis and spirituality, I want to add that he had the character of a typical intellectual—he was an Indian but also a man of universal thought, always open to ideas, travelling to different countries, and meeting with psychoanalysts there—including in Iran. Not many people do that. To me that was very important,” Jahanbegloo adds. A series of his conversations and interviews with Kakar, on topics ranging from the Partition, secularism, tradition and culture, and several iconic leaders like Gandhi or Nehru, were published in the 2009 book <i>India Analysed</i>. </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Also Read: </i>\n      <i>Review of Sudhir Kakar’s ‘The Devil Take Love’</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/sudhir-kakar-works-death-namita-gokhale-ramin-jahanbegloo-111714031212094.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>When Dommaraju Gukesh lost to Alireza Firouzja in the seventh round of the FIDE Candidates 2024 chess less than two weeks ago, he started to believe that he could win the tournament.</p>\n<p>The irony is not lost on Gukesh, of how a defeat could inflate confidence instead of having the opposite effect. The day after that loss was a rest day and Gukesh woke up with “energy and positivity, fully fired up”.</p>\n<p>“If I had to pinpoint where I felt this could be my moment, it was probably after the seventh game, after I lost to Firouzja,” the champion said at a press conference in Toronto on Sunday. “I was upset after that but during the rest day I felt so good. Maybe this loss gave me so much motivation…”</p>\n<p>The 17-year-old Gukesh topped the table with nine points, becoming the youngest ever to win the Candidates tournament and only the second Indian after Viswanathan Anand to do so. The win allows him to challenge Ding Liren of China for the world title later this year. Should the Indian triumph there as well, he would be the sport’s youngest ever world champion.</p>\n<p>Gukesh’s title came after 14 gruelling rounds of chess over 18 days between eight top contenders in the open category, which included two other Indians, R. Praggnanandhaa and Vidit Gujrathi, making this the best Candidates tournament from an Indian perspective.</p>\n<p>“It was unbelievable—what he did and how he did it. I don’t think anyone thought (he would win), especially since Gukesh is the youngest and the others have so much experience… But it was consistency. He was never worse off in any of the games. He was the best player in Toronto,” says Woman Grandmaster (WGM) and commentator Tania Sachdev.</p>\n<p>“I thought that throughout the tournament he looked comfortable,” says grandmaster Dibyendu Barua, who runs the Dhanuka Dhunseri Dibyendu Barua Chess Academy in Kolkata. “He lost one game, which was an upset because he was not in a losing position. He made a mistake and he came back, which is fantastic and shows his temperament. For me, he was always the favourite among the Indians.”</p>\n<p>The tournament result was poised on a razor’s edge going into the last round on Sunday with four players shooting for the top spot. Gukesh, ranked 16th in the world, needed to not lose to world Mo. 3 Hikaru Nakamura, which he did. But the Indian was distracted by another match, which was to impact his fate.</p>\n<p>World No. 2 Fabiano Caruana and No. 7 Ian Nepomniachtchi needed wins, as the winner would take on Gukesh in a tie-breaker on Monday. But they drew, leaving Gukesh alone at the top on the table.</p>\n<p>The whole situation left Gukesh so frazzled that he went back to his hotel with coach and second, Polish grandmaster Grzegorz Gajewski, while the other match was still on. “Those 15 minutes were probably the most stressful of the entire tournament,” Gukesh told reporters, laughing.</p>\n<p>He tried to follow the Caruana-Nepomniachtchi game on commentary but could not. He then went for a walk with Gajewski, before his father Rajnikanth, a doctor, came running over to them to announce that it was over. “The walk was (emotionally) the turning point,” Gukesh said later.</p>\n<p>“In this tournament, what set him apart was his nerves. He had so much composure, maturity in his play, in practical decisions,” says Sachdev over a call. “The way he handled everything around—the fans, the tension… he was an ice man in that tournament. He feared no one. He was so cool headed when everything around him was burning.”</p>\n<p>“Finally, there is one player from India who could be compared to our own Anand,” says Arvind Aaron, who runs the Aaron Chess Academy in Chennai, over email. “Winning the Candidates with 9/14 is a tall score. Experts did not give any title chances to any of the three Indians at Toronto. This stellar show reconfirms that his (Gukesh’s) 2022 Chennai Olympiad performance was no fluke and that he is progressing to the next level.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/chess-candidates-tournament-gukesh-111713896642654.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Of all the incredible moments that India scripted at the 2022 Thomas Cup, the one that became definitive of the odds-defying, history-making team, was of the players bouncing up and down, arm in arm on the podium. Joyous, victorious.</p>\n<p>Team celebrations can generate that kind of hopped-up energy on the podium that individual triumphs lack. Away from the fiercely individual pursuits on the tour, the Thomas Cup had given the players a cocoon of camaraderie—of common goals and collective ambition. India’s badminton stars had channelled it perfectly to clinch the Cup, known as the men’s world championship, for the first time.</p>\n<p>On 27 April, when India begin their title defence in Chengdu, China, they will be hoping to recreate that team magic yet again. The team WhatsApp group, which was formed ahead of the last edition of Thomas Cup, is full of chatter again. Meetings and team dinners are being scheduled.</p>\n<p>“During the Thomas Cup, we also want to go out there and have fun, enjoy the whole process of being with the team,” says H.S. Prannoy, who is India’s No. 1 singles player going into this Thomas Cup. It was seniors Prannoy and Kidambi Srikanth who had stressed upon, and helped create, a thriving team atmosphere at the last edition.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, we don’t have anything like a team camp. We don’t have that culture like some at places like Indonesia or China. Here the players have to take initiative and make sure that we at least spend little bit of time together before we go for these tournaments,” says Prannoy.</p>\n<p>“When it comes to a normal tour event, you have your dinner, you go back to the room, you are all by yourself and sleep according to your match schedule. But in a team event, you have to spend that extra hour or so with your teammates, be it having dinner with them or doing some team activity. I am really excited about it.”</p>\n<p>The Indian players will have to believe in the collective now more than ever. They were merely the dark horses the last time around; they now go in as the defending champions.</p>\n<p>The core of the team remains the same: Prannoy, Lakshya Sen and Srikanth are the leading singles players, while Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty will be the No. 1 doubles team. In Priyanshu Rajawat and Kiran George give them some serious talent in singles reserves. M.R. Arjun and Dhruv Kapila will be the team’s second doubles pair, with Sai Pratheek as the reserve.</p>\n<p>A Thomas Cup tie consists of five matches–three singles and two doubles against ranking counterparts (No. 1 vs No. 1 and so on) of the rival team. “I think winning the Thomas Cup was one of the biggest achievements in Indian badminton,” says Sen. “As a kid I used to watch China or Indonesia lift the trophy. When I played my first Thomas Cup (2018) against China, just to see their men’s singles line-up was a bit shocking to me—there was Chen Long (reigning world champion), Shi Yuqi (All England champion at the time) and the third singles was Lin Dan(five-time world champion, two-time Olympic champion). At that time, I hardly ever imagined that we can have such a strong team and win the event.”</p>\n<p>India had never won a medal at the event before 2022, didn’t have the serial winners that China possessed in their golden age, but there was enough talent—and belief in each other—to pull off the heist.</p>\n<p>India defeated Malaysia in the quarterfinal and got the better of a star-studded Denmark (including World No. 1 Viktor Axelsen) in the semi-final. In the final, they clinched the tie against 14-time champions Indonesia in the first three rubbers. Sen set the tone with a battling three-game win over Anthony Sinisuka Ginting. Satwik-Chirag saved four match points to defeat Mohammad Ahsan and Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo 18-21 23-21 21-19, before Srikanth wrapped up the tie by beating Asian Games gold medallist Jonatan Christie in straight games.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/badminton-thomas-cup-2024-prannoy-satwik-chirag-111713895709335.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>France, for most of the world, is Paris—arguably global pop culture’s most romantic city—and Paris is France. But for the French people, perhaps, present-day Paris is the least French thing about their country. The next thing that the world loves about France is the country’s wine regions. So much so that entire vacations are spent visiting wineries in Bordeaux and Champagne.</p>\n<p>Yet, France is a lot more than Paris’ museums, churches, overpriced cafés along the Seine, Eiffel Tower, the world’s most visited monument, or the bubbles and wine tastings in chateaus of Champagne, Bordeaux and Medoc, which are usually bustling with bus-loads of wine enthusiasts and those ticking off an “authentic French experience”.</p>\n<p>Paris, a truly global city akin to New York, Berlin, Amsterdam and London, is home to the country’s richest and most successful football club, the Qatari-owned Paris Saint Germain (PSG), which also draws the maximum rebuke from most people outside of the city. And what irks Parisians the most, apart from the high rent and cost of living, is the fact that the city is always teeming with tourists no matter the time of the year; a good number of French people who move to Paris for either work or study, escape it as soon and as often as they can. This summer Paris is going to be busier than ever as it hosts the Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p>\n<p>It would be stupid to ignore local wisdom, which always beats Google and influencers’ video itineraries based on “extensive research” of 72 hours in a city, the bulk of which is probably spent in shooting content instead of feeling the pulse and pace of a place. So, I listened to my friends and took a train south to Marseille on France’s Mediterranean coast. The railway station, Gare de Marseille Saint-Charles, is one of the best places to see the city as well as to enjoy a sunset. That’s a good reason to get yourself a drink and snack as soon as you get off the train and witness the golden hour magic as the Mediterranean skies usually put on a stunning show. The only spot that has better views of entire Marseille is the city’s most visited church, Notre Dame de la Garde, up on a hillock, which is also the highest point in the city.</p>\n<p>Marseille, France’s oldest city, is a mix of the old and new and you can sense how different it is from Paris the minute you stroll through it. Unlike the wet, cold and congested Paris, Marseille greets you with good weather, moderate temperatures for most of the year and the city is not as busy either. You won’t hear as much English as you would in Paris. While all of France loves its wine and beer, the go-to drink in Marseille is pastis, a herbal alcoholic drink made from anise, fennel seeds and liquorice, drunk with water over ice. This drink, 40-45% ABV, is soothing on a warm day.</p>\n<p>You are much closer to nature in Marseille. Cassis offers some great hikes and stunning views of the sea and water from a height, and there is the lovely Calanques National Park where you can hike, spend time on the beaches and swim in the brilliant turquoise waters. You could have a relaxed day on a boat while you make your way to Calanques from Marseille. If pressed for time, you could drive through all this in a day and still be back in the city by dinner time, but you won’t be able to get down to most of the beaches or enjoy yourself in the waters.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/travel-marseille-explore-southern-france-111713506687171.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>For most working professionals today, the line between work and personal life in a hyper-connected world is blurred. We are constantly checking our smartphones, no matter the place or time and the fear of missing out keeps us tethered. Even on vacations, we tend to continuously check our work emails and group chats. The option of missing a meeting is now a thing of the past, with Microsoft Teams and Zoom calls keeping us often busy.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/millennial-bosses-leadership-workplace-culture-management-style-productivity-111712473554499.html\">Also read: Are millennial bosses really cool?</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Taking a vacation, or small breaks, allows one to completely disconnect from work. But how many of us truly stay away from replying to emails or looking at office Slack channels during a break? Is it even possible to take a vacation from work in an era where the popular belief is to stay connected 24x7? It is. Here’s how you can disconnect from work during a holiday to return refreshed and more connected to your work.</p>\n<p><strong>Blueprint for a reset</strong><br/>Just as it is at work, even for a vacation planning is key. Decide what you want to see, do and experience. If it is history that interests you, you may want to look up historical sites, if it is food, then check out the local hotspots for delicacies, and if it is adventure, then find out which activities you can indulge in. </p>\n<p>Investing time in planning allows your mind to explore new avenues, build anticipation and keep you focused on your vacation goals. In other words, during a break, one should embrace active relaxation—be it through lounging by the pool all day/ reading, or hiking, walking or simply spending quality time with loved ones. Basically, any activity that actively takes your mind off work. Plus, immersing yourself in new experiences will keep you away from checking your phone constantly and allow you to unwind.</p>\n<p><strong>Say it out aloud </strong><br/>Open communication about taking time off is as important as communication about other work matters. Inform your colleagues/peers about your vacation dates clearly and emphasize that you will only be available for an urgent emergency. Set an “out-of-office” email response and resist the urge to check or reply to messages. </p>\n<p>Often, those who are in a key leadership position may feel that the world will fall apart if they don’t check their emails for an hour—a thought process that may prevent you from going in for a full-fledged digital detox. In such a case, consider limiting your screen time. Designate specific times during the day to check for important messages that need to be addressed, but avoid getting sucked into the vortex of emails and work chats.</p>\n<p>Remember, a vacation is meant for you to recharge, not for you to be on-call all the time. That can wait till you are back in the office.</p>\n<p><strong>Set an example</strong><br/>As leaders, it’s essential to set the right example and encourage a healthy approach to vacation time. One aspect of effective digital leadership is empowering your team to handle responsibilities in your absence. This involves clear delegation, providing them with the necessary tools and resources, and fostering a culture of trust and accountability. By doing so, you not only ensure that work continues smoothly but also demonstrate your confidence in their capabilities. When you as a leader trust your teams to manage in your absence, it sets a positive example for the entire organization. </p>\n<p><strong>Technology to the rescue </strong><br/>Use the thing that keeps you hyper-connected to disconnect as well. In fact, embracing technology can enhance the vacation experience without compromising on rest and recovery. Utilising communication tools for urgent matters, setting up automated responses, and scheduling tasks in advance can help minimise disruptions during your time off. Tools like project management platforms and shared calendars can ensure everyone is informed and projects stay on track.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, practising digital leadership means finding the balance between staying connected when needed and allowing yourself and your team the space to recharge and disconnect during vacations. It’s about leveraging technology to facilitate productivity and well-being, rather than letting it become a barrier to enjoying time away from work.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/disconnect-during-vacation-reconnect-digital-leadership-active-relaxation-111713722537235.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Miller, an acclaimed poet who has recently taken up essay writing. Here’s what Matt said about working on<strong> </strong>this piece: “I’ve been thinking about and trying to write about, in poetry and prose, this experience for over 20 years now. I never quite arrived at what I was trying to say. I think only now, in middle age, with years of teaching behind me, was I able to really understand this moment.

Not some dirty or rotting smell or even the fleshy old cheese odor of people who worked too hard and lacked proper access to deodorant. It was not that at all, even if that was what I expected when I was first buzzed into New Hampshire State Prison for Men to teach a class in literature and creative writing. No, the smell was clean. Too clean. Even beyond the antiseptic clean of a hospital. This was a scrubbed-too-hard-with-rendered-animal-fat-soap clean. This was a rub-the-skin-raw kind of clean. As I walked into the prison, it was everywhere. It was the kind of clean that made you feel filthy, like you could never be clean enough, scrub hard enough to be right. You could see it on the men too — their skin was dry and tough-looking, ruddy from scrubbing with the fierce, heavy waters that came out of the old pipes in this place. The correctional officers carried it on them too, but it was mixed with whatever they brought with them from the outside: a wife’s perfume, cigarette smoke or the meat sweat of some steak and cheese sub they’d eaten at a pizza place right before their shift.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/star-student-also-committed-murder-reconcile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He shouted and banged his fist against a wall inside Toronto’s Hospital for Sick Children, demanding to know why his son had died.<br/>The boy, Kevin Pacsai, had been born just 25 days earlier with a head of dark hair like his 21-year-old father. His mother, Laurie Pacsai, also 21, thought her son was perfect. But Kevin’s heart had started to fail in his second week of life, and he had barely survived an episode of shock. His heart was structurally normal, but its conduction system seemed to be misfiring. Earlier that day, March 11, 1981, he had been transferred to the world-renowned hospital, known as SickKids.<br/>Youngsters came from all over the globe to the imposing brick building, where doctors had invented techniques that revolutionized pediatric heart surgery. Cardiologists were venerated; they seemed to work miracles to prolong the lives of children born with faulty hearts. The previous spring, the hospital had unveiled a splashy renovation of its cardiac unit, which now stretched over wards 4A and 4B.<br/>But since the summer, deaths on the cardiac unit had soared — 625 percent higher during the nine-month period between July 1980 and March 1981 than in the periods before and after, according to a later government analysis. Most of the deaths had happened overnight, when one of the eight nursing teams, headed by Phyllis Trayner, was on duty. By the fall of 1980, the five nurses had earned a nickname: “the jinx team.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/our-latest-mysterious-true-crime-story\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Beyond the boulder, a dead spruce has been partially uprooted. Its bare branches look brittle against the other, still upright, lushly-needled trees.</p>\n    <p>From the photo, it’s impossible to tell whether the boulder is drying now or about to be drenched again, or how long that spruce has been upended. Nor is it possible to say how many times I, who took the picture, have been wrong about where a story ends or where it even starts.</p>\n    <p>Take, for instance, the sailing trip that took me to that beach in the summer of 2023. Did the trip begin a decade ago when a friend and I considered the sheen of boulders in moonlight and how we mark the milestones in our lives?</p>\n    <p>Or did it begin, more concretely, when we boarded the boat in a small Maine coast cove? The sky was blue that day, the winds were good; we hoisted sail, and I, sitting up at the bow of the boat, decided that the beginning of this voyage would be a good time to make one private gesture of an ending. In my pocket was a Zip-lock bag with a few teaspoons of my husband’s ashes. We both loved the Maine coast. What better place to discretely drop a handful overboard, to mark, not a milestone, but the subsiding at last of a two-year grief and the turn to possibilities ahead.</p>\n    <p>The bow rose and dropped; the swells rocked us side to side. The tide and wind, our captain said, made the sea “confused.” Kneeling, I hung onto the stanchion with one hand, and kept the other in my pocket, ready, while I waited for a moment that said <i>now</i>.</p>\n    <p>But the finish or start of a story is often frayed and full of holes, and nothing ever opens or closes where or when we think it does. <i>Beginnings are apt to be shadowy,</i> Rachel Carson warns. Endings too. And so the ashes stayed in the baggie and when we went ashore, the dead spruce remained tilted and still, and the boulder I leaned against sat unmoving in bright sunlight. Marking nothing but the force of a long-gone glacier, it cast the darkest shadow on the beach.</p>\n    <p>But out there, on the water, the waves kept overlapping the present and the past, the sky piled up with in-betweens, and the sea, which mutes all questions about stops and starts and anything pretending to be firm, says without saying that the real story of that trip might have begun when I couldn’t mark the other story’s end.<br/>\n__</p>\n    <p><a href=\"http://www.barbarahurd.com\"> Barbara Hurd</a> is the author of </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>The Epilogues,</i>\n    </p>\n    <p><i>Listening to the Savage / River Notes and Half-Heard Melodies, Tidal Rhythms</i>(with photographer Stephen Strom),</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Walking the Wrack Line,</i>\n    </p>\n    <p><i>Entering the Stone</i>,</p>\n    <p><i>Stirring the Mud,</i>and several collaborative chapbooks with artists.

He was a businessman who railed against governmental regulations and intrusion. He liked making money and he hated paying taxes and did everything legal and not legal not to. He was being sued for sexual harassment. His only son had quit the business to become a writer. All his kids were asking him for shit and he was tired of it. Faking his death would free him from all of this. He would be dead, but not so dead that he couldn’t enjoy the fruits of his labor and deception. Watching him drive by I could see how happy he was, how free. He had avoided the two things everyone says are unavoidable: death and taxes.</p>\n    <p>Now I’ve found him, but he’s still pretending he doesn’t see me. Like we’re strangers.</p>\n    <p>“What’s your name?” I ask him.</p>\n    <p>He smiles. “My name is Harry,” he says.</p>\n    <p>I almost laugh. “Your name’s not Harry.” He turns and gives me the once over and what he sees does not impress him.</p>\n    <p>“What’s wrong with your pants?” he says.</p>\n    <p>I look and he’s right: the cuffs are too long. They’re dragging the ground.</p>\n    <p>“I’ve lost some weight,” I say.</p>\n    <p>He turns back to the mirror and brushes some light dandruff from his shoulders. It’s his reflection that talks to me now. “You’re about to lose more,” it says.</p>\n    <p>I never saw my father dead. His ashes were buried in a golden box. I cried all day the day of his funeral, even though we had been distant for many years.</p>\n    <p>But I never saw him dead. He was 67, the same age as his own father. I’m 65. It’s ridiculous, of course, all of this. I know he’s dead. I know it. But there are times, even if it’s just for a few seconds, I think he could be alive. I don’t really believe it, though. I also don’t believe he came to me in this dream to tell me that I, too, was going to die. That’s also ridiculous. But for a few seconds every day, maybe even more than a few, I think he did.<br/>\n___</p>\n    <p><a href=\"http://danielwallace.org\"> Daniel Wallace</a> is the author of six novels, including </p>\n    <p><i>Big Fish</i>, one memoir,</p>\n    <p><i>This Isn’t Going to End Well</i>, and, most recently, a collection of flash fiction,</p>\n    <p><i>Beneath the Moon and Long Dead Stars</i>, from Bull City Press.

    "body": "<p>Four decades after dozens of culturally significant objects were stolen from the Santa Ana Pueblo in New Mexico, a team of Tribal investigators has pledged to bring the missing items back home.</p>\n<p>In August 1984, the Santa Ana Pueblo (Tamaya in the Keresan language) was plagued by a 10-month-long string of burglaries. Thieves looted pottery, war shields, clothing, drums, baskets, and rugs from homes in this Native American community situated on the Rio Grande, about 20 miles north of Albuquerque. The Pueblo, generally closed to the public, opens its doors on rare occasions such as feast days, and the first thefts took place shortly after one such event.</p>\n<p>“This is particularly heartbreaking because these people took ceremonial items actively being used,” Shannon O’Loughlin (Choctaw), chief executive of the Association on American Indian Affairs, told<i> Hyperallergic</i>.</p>\n<p>The robberies continued until a sting operation in May 1985. According to court records obtained by the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/native-american-stolen-artifacts-santa-ana-pueblo-75e8271e9bb7b27778f46eb5fbfca5c8\"> Associated Press</a>, the architect of the plot was an Albuquerque-based dealer of Native American artifacts who recruited members of a nearby pueblo to infiltrate the historic village. Although the perpetrators were caught, little effort was made to recover the stolen artifacts by the FBI and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), the agencies that oversaw the case. (A spokesperson for the FBI Albuquerque Division told </p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>that “attempts to recover stolen items have been made.”</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>submitted a FOIA request for additional details.)</p>\n<p>Last fall, however, a team from the Santa Ana Pueblo took it upon themselves to track down the roughly 150 looted objects, working meticulously to return them to their rightful owners, one by one.</p>\n<p>“Memories of the thefts and the loss of cultural heritage items still weighed heavily on the community,” said Monica Murrell, director of the Santa Ana Pueblo’s Historic Preservation Department. The Pueblo tapped William Woody, a former “top cop” at the Bureau of Land Management, to join the search. Woody’s experience with cases involving the Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA) and Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) was key, and “teaming up created a synergy,” Murrell said. “Woody brings a law enforcement angle, we bring technical expertise as preservation specialists.”</p>\n<p>The task force also includes Pueblo members Jarrett Lujan and Thomas Armijo, grandson of the Pueblo’s governor, Myron Armijo, who told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that their family lost a war shield, ceramics, pottery, and jewelry in the burglaries.</p>\n<p>Working with the often scant descriptions in case files obtained from the FBI and BIA, the team began scouring auction catalogues, gallery websites, and museum databases for similar objects. “We were looking for anything that suspiciously appeared on the market in the mid-1980s, items with no former provenance,” Murrell said. Notably, pottery made on the Santa Ana Pueblo was not commonly sold to outsiders, so the few examples that make it into the hands of dealers fetch relatively high prices.</p>\n<p>The team got a big break when they discovered that several of the stolen artifacts were later sold to Larry Frank, a collector and dealer of Native American art. Frank died in 2006, but his son Ross Frank, now a professor in the Department of Ethnic Studies at the University of California, San Diego, agreed to share his father’s ledgers with investigators, yielding invaluable clues to some of the missing objects’ current whereabouts.</p>\n<p>Their first victory was a bowl that, according to Frank’s records, had been sold to a local gallery. It was illustrated in an old catalogue and matched a case file description of a medium-sized bowl with triangle designs. They were able to track the item to the last gallery to sell it, which then contacted the family who purchased it. That family agreed to return it, and this past May, the bowl was returned to the Santa Ana Pueblo.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had great cooperation from some of the galleries on getting items back, when you explain the stories. I’ve been quite impressed,” Woody said.</p>\n<p>Despite some people’s willingness to cooperate, Murrell said that not every source has been as eager to assist in their repatriation efforts.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037100/decades-after-heartbreaking-thefts-santa-ana-pueblo-recovers-stolen-artifacts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "author": "AventurOO Editorial",
    "body": "<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>LONDON — The Wallace Collection is famous for its trove of Rococo art, such as <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/tag/jean-honore-fragonard/\">Fragonard</a>’s pastel depiction of indulgent flirtation “The Swing” (1767–68), in which a woman with a voluminous skirt kicks a pink slipper into the air with coquettish abandon, closely watched by two male suitors. In his solo exhibition, Grayson Perry responds to these holdings, offering a fever-dream take on Fragonard’s painting in a tapestry entitled “Fascist Swing” (2024). Here, pastels give way to psychedelically bright colors, while the woman’s smiling expression is contorted into a mask of horror. The laughing suitors are also absent — Perry’s protagonist is alone in her mental disintegration. The work depicts a delusion of excess and grandeur much like Fragonard’s, but with a much darker, more frightening tone.</p>\n<p>“Fascist Swing” depicts Perry’s alter ego Shirley Smith, dreamed up for this exhibition as a way to explore both the Wallace Collection and his ideas around gender, class, and mental illness. Smith, Perry tells us, is a working-class Londoner whose mental illness pushed her into “delusions of grandeur,” as the exhibition’s title puts it, leading to a prolonged psychotic breakdown in which she came to believe she was a member of the aristocracy and the rightful heir to Hertford House, the home of the Collection. Smith is based in part on real-life so-called outsider artists who suffered from mental health challenges and delusions, such as Aloïse Corbaz (1886–1964) and Madge Gill (1882–61) — some of whose fascinating works are included at the beginning of the exhibition.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Grayson Perry: Delusions of Grandeur</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Visitors unprepared for Perry’s <i>gesamtkunstwerk</i> approach to this exhibition may be puzzled by this opening room, where the boundary between truth and fiction is bafflingly but effectively blurred. Fictionalized “archival” photographs of and letters by Smith sit beside real documentation of Gill’s activities at the Wallace Collection in the 1940s, with false dates attributed to the former but not the latter, for instance. Unusually, the audio guide is key to entering Perry/Smith’s world; tracks are alternately narrated by Perry and Smith, making for an immersive experience — although it is a shame that Smith is given a caricatured Cockney accent, which creates a lazily stereotyped image of working-class identity. </p>\n<p>The exhibition loosely follows Smith’s life, ending in a quasi-recreation of the bedroom in which she spent her final days. There are some beautiful objects in here, including a cabinet decorated with portraits of women from the Wallace Collection. There is also a piece called “Hospital Queen” (2024), a hand-beaded self-portrait Smith supposedly made during a stay in a mental hospital. This perhaps alludes to our somewhat morbid fascination with such objects. But even though Perry has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/apr/13/grayson-perry-donates-sketch-to-help-mental-health-support-group\">struggled with issues around mental health</a>, his treatment feels a bit flippant. </p>\n<p>Similarly, in “A Tree in a Landscape” (2024), Perry creates a family tree using portrait miniatures from the museum’s collection, labeling each one with a different mental health diagnosis. The caption notes, “We all exhibit some traits that could be pathologized.” Do we? Perry’s analysis feels glib; here, as in his treatment of Smith’s psychosis, he fails to engage with the realities of serious mental illness.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Grayson Perry: Delusions of Grandeur</i>\n    </p>\n<p>This is but one instance of a recurring lack of nuance in some of Perry’s engagements with complex issues. It is evident that he thinks deeply — but not always about the right things in the right places. For instance, “Man of Stories” (2024), a central piece in the exhibition, is a truly (and deliberately) hideous beaded sculpture of a bard-like figure, inspired by “the expert storytellers of the Luba people in central Africa,” according to Perry’s caption. It is not explained why Perry was inspired by this particular culture, or whether the Luba people have any connection to objects held in the Wallace Collection. The caption continues: “One of my ongoing concerns is over-intellectualism in Western culture, so I was fascinated by the idea of a travelling bard.” Is the implication that he is ascribing a desirable non-intellectualism to central African culture? This speaks to me, at best, of a failure to allow viewers to engage with the figure at an intellectual level, and at worst, of exoticism.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1027871/insider-artist-grayson-perry-outsider-alter-ego-wallace-collection/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><i>Cavalier Perspective: Last Essays, 1952-1966</i>(2025) by André Breton, translated by Austin Carder (image courtesy City Lights Books)</p>\n<p>What does Surrealism, a major art movement in the 20th century, have to do with surrealism, a term often used to describe so many uncanny facets of life in the 21st? The word “surreal” was first used in 1917 to describe a ballet choreographed by Jean Cocteau and composed by Erik Satie, with Cubist costumes by Pablo Picasso. Today, it has been used to describe the “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/12/alligator-alcatraz-trump-cruelty\">Alligator Alcatraz</a>” immigrant detention center and the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-04/-it-s-surreal-trump-s-freeze-on-climate-money-sows-fear-and-confusion\">Trump administration’s climate policy</a>. Does the world today merely resemble dreamlike visions by Leonora Carrington and Salvador Dalí? Or is the American mind reaching for a deeper affinity?</p>\n<p>To answer this question, we must turn to André Breton, the architect and apostle of Surrealism. At just 28 years old, Breton <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1006369/the-small-magazines-that-birthed-surrealism/\">established</a> the movement in a 1924 manifesto, where he defined it as manifesting one’s subconscious “in the absence of any control exercised by reason.” His attempt to exert dictatorial powers over this movement would be his undoing, after a caustic Second Surrealist Manifesto in 1929 largely alienated him from his peers for suggesting that he could excommunicate them. But Breton continued to think, write, and speak about Surrealism until his death at age 70. </p>\n<p>In <i>Cavalier Perspective: Last Essays 1952–1966</i>, translated by Austin Carter, an elder Breton appears for the first time in English — gentler, wiser, and far more adept at analyzing the ideological underpinnings of a movement that had ballooned into an international sensation. It’s in these late writings that his ideas about the surreal begin to mingle with our own. </p>\n<p><i>Médium: Communication Surréaliste</i>, which Breton contributed to (image courtesy City Lights Books)</p>\n<p>While it’s now understood instinctively as shorthand for unreality, one of the ironies of Surrealism is that it has never neatly circumscribed a particular style or technique, the way Fauvism or Impressionism once did. In a 1952 essay titled “Link,” Breton explains that this was by design; Surrealism was never meant to simply define an aesthetic. “When I began searching as early as 1936 for the emotional catalyst for Surrealism,” he wrote, “I discovered it right away in the anxiety inherent to a time when human brotherhood was collapsing more and more each day.” He was referring to the period between World Wars, when the “rational” forces of industrial capitalism, fractious nationalism, and global imperialism continued unabated, with violence looming on the horizon again.</p>\n<p>Breton had spent World War I in a neurological ward in Nantes, treating soldiers suffering from what we now understand as PTSD. As poet Garrett Caples writes in his excellent introduction to <i>Cavalier Perspective</i>, Breton “saw firsthand the effects of technologically advanced weaponry on the human psyche” and responded with a system of thought that was both mystical in power and revolutionary in scope. By the 1950s, Breton’s vision of a liberatory anti-rationalism had become fully postcolonial. He hailed France’s Algerian War as “an orgy of crime,” championed the work of Martinican writer Aimé Césaire and Haitian poet Clément Magloire Saint-Aude, and <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2022/07/andre-breton-haiti-revolution-communists-surrealism\">helped foment a student revolution in Haiti</a>.</p>\n<p>In <i>Cavalier Perspective</i>, Breton explores this anti-rationalism as inherently accessible and corrosive to systems of logic that demand conformity and deride creativity. His many short essays of the period championed astrology, Medieval alchemy, games of automatic word association, and emotionally expressive art forms dismissed by mainstream Western institutions as “primitive,” from Celtic poetry to African masks. I was particularly struck by “The Language of Stones,” which suggests that certain polished rocks draw sensitive seekers toward them and may even be imprinted with divine messages. Today, the theory reads like a startlingly familiar concoction of new-age natural mysticism poisoned by a terminally online paranoia that “it’s all connected” — Make America Healthy Again, <i>avant la lettre</i>.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038721/andre-breton-cavalier-perspective-surrealism/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Sorrow and searching give way to mischievous escapades, peppered with comedy and crime. Fear simmers. Tension builds. Doors slam and squeak open again, leading into well-to-do homes, modest apartments, workplaces, doctor’s offices, and winding corridors. The result is a labyrinthine, imagined architecture that feels, at turns, like one of M.C. Escher’s <a href=\"https://mcescher.com/gallery/impossible-constructions/\">impossible constructions</a> and the product of the Surrealist parlor game <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/terms/exquisite-corpse\">exquisite corpse</a>, with its neatly matched doorways cobbling together a chimera. Even though the actors, setting, and plot specifics shapeshift every few seconds, as if jumping into a different plane of a multiverse tale, the emotional thrust and action create a propulsive through line that coheres the sea of snippets.</p>\n    <p>In <i>Doors</i>, Marclay makes visible the mindless, forgettable actions of life indoors — turning keys in locks, twisting knobs, entering and exiting spaces — while exploring the ways that doors serve as charged metaphors and well-worn cinematic devices and tropes. This congress of clichés could teeter into tedium. But, with a wink and a nod, the precise editing and absurd juxtapositions between the assembled film excerpts toy with perception, flowing like a dream sequence. Doors double as sites of transformation. Space and time warp. Narratives get remixed and reinvented. Nothing is static, and anything could happen in the next scene. In this art film, as in life, the whole story can change course in an instant.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/DIG_E_2025_Christian_Marclay_Doors_04_Paula_Abreu_Pita_PS22-General-Use-JPEG-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Christian Marclay: Doors</i>at the Brooklyn Museum</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/christian-marclay\">Christian Marclay: Doors</a>\n      <i> continues at the Brooklyn Museum (200 Eastern Parkway, Prospect Heights, Brooklyn) through April 12, 2026.

    "body": "<h2>A new study delves into the development of the ilium, the largest bone in the pelvis, and the genes that underpin its formation</h2>\n<p>Walking upright on two legs is one of the key traits that sets humans apart from other primates.</p>\n<p>Now, scientists are beginning to unravel some of the developmental and genetic mysteries underpinning the shift to bipedalism. In a new study published last week in the journal <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09399-9\"> Nature</a>, researchers describe two evolutionary changes that reshaped the human pelvis and paved the way for our unique walking style.</p>\n<p>For the new study, the team focused on the ilium, the largest bone in the pelvis. Humans have two ilia—one on the right side of the spine, the other on the left—and together they help form the wide, bowl-like shape of the pelvis. (When you put your hand on your hip, you’re feeling your ilium.)</p>\n<p>Researchers collected 128 samples of embryonic tissues to compare ilium development in various species, including humans, mice, lemurs, gibbons, chimpanzees and other primates. They also studied the cells and genes responsible for the development of this bone.</p>\n<p>“What we have tried to do is integrate different approaches to get a complete story about how the pelvis developed over time,” says lead author <a href=\"https://gayani.science/\">Gayani Senevirathne</a>, an evolutionary geneticist at Harvard University, in a <a href=\"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/08/solving-evolutionary-mystery-of-how-humans-came-to-walk-upright/\">statement</a>.</p>\n<p>Their analyses revealed two important differences between humans and other species in the ilium’s development process.</p>\n<p>First, not long after the ilium cartilage begins to form in human embryos, it makes a 90-degree turn, which causes the bones to grow short and wide instead of tall and narrow. This broad, basin-like shape in humans provides anchor points for our gluteal muscles, which are essential for walking on two feet; it also supports our inner organs when we stand upright. Scientists suspect this shift occurred when early humans split from apes on the primate family tree, between five million and eight million years ago.</p>\n<p>The ilium cartilage, in other primates, grows parallel to the spine. But the dramatic turn seen in humans<strong> </strong>makes the ilia grow perpendicular to it—a radical change that was a bit of a surprise to the researchers, as they expected to find a more gradual shift.</p>\n<p>“It’s not a stepwise process,” says co-author <a href=\"https://heb.fas.harvard.edu/people/terence-capellini\">Terence Capellini</a>, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University, to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/27/science/human-evolution-ilium-bipedal.html\"> New York Times</a>’ Carl Zimmer. “It’s actually a complete flip.”</p>\n<p>Second, the bone cells that eventually replace the ilium cartilage form later in humans than they do in other primates—and they form about 16 weeks after much of the rest of the human skeleton. This process, called delayed ossification, allows the human pelvis to hold its shape as it grows. Scientists suspect this shift occurred before roughly 1.6 million years ago, when humans began to develop larger brains, reports <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/science/two-evolutionary-changes-underpinning-human-bipedalism-are-discovered-2025-08-27/\">Reuters</a>’ Will Dunham.</p>\n<p>This evolutionary change was critical not only for bipedalism, but also for giving birth safely to offspring with hefty heads. “This way, the pelvis could grow in size and maintain a shape important for walking—but also it retained the shape of a birth canal that eventually would be used to allow the passage of a big-brained baby,” Capellini tells Reuters.</p>\n<p>Scientists also pinpointed more than 300 genes that help explain these developmental variations of the human ilium. Of those, three specific genes appear to play the biggest roles: <i>SOX9</i>, <i>PTH1R</i> and <i>RUNX2</i>. Their findings are further supported by the fact that mutations to these genes can cause skeletal problems with the pelvis and disorders that affect walking.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/scientists-discover-key-evolutionary-changes-to-the-pelvis-that-helped-humans-walk-upright-180987273/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Veni Jain, 30, had an idea she believed in. Before she could act on it, however, she got married and moved to Kolkata from Delhi, where she knew no one except her husband and his family. She signed up for a Youth Ficci Ladies Organisation (Y-Flo) meeting in 2022. Two years and several Y-Flo meetings later, she has a thriving social life and is about to launch a business curating gourmet cheese and grazing boards for parties and dinners.</p>\n<p>On International Women’s Day last month, Neha Sharma, 41, attended her first-ever women’s support-cum-networking group event at Lead Like Her Club, a group exclusively for women in leadership roles in human resources. Gurugram-based Sharma, head of human resources for market operations at Airtel, found the gathering useful as she met many like-minded people at a similar stage in their careers. “Everyone wanted to come together as a community to figure out ways in which we can give back to working women,” says Sharma.</p>\n<p>Jain and Sharma are among a growing number of women who are turning to women-only groups because regular networking groups don’t do enough for them. “Women frequently encounter the double bind dilemma, where they are expected to be assertive but not aggressive, nurturing but not weak. Gender pay gaps and lack of representation in leadership roles further exacerbate these challenges, making it crucial for women to have spaces where they can discuss and address these issues,” says Aparna Acharekar, 46, co-founder of women’s networking platform Coto. Coto started in October 2022 and has 400,000 members and 7,000 communities, or groups based on various interests. Community heads decide how often they meet.“Further, responsibilities like childcare and household management disproportionately fall on women, creating a constant tension between work and home.”</p>\n<p>All business owners need like-minded people to consult, create, caution and celebrate, says Elisha Saigal, 40, the Mumbai-based founder and CEO of El Sol Strategic Consultants, who has been part of multiple women’s networking groups, including Ladies Who Lead, for five years. “Your teams share your vision, wins and annual goals, but you need a closed circle to course correct, reflect and motivate,” she says. “We brainstorm, co-create, party, unlearn and learn from each other. We share similar business hiccups and help each other navigate them.”</p>\n<p>Women-only support groups foster empathy through shared experiences, says Radhika Yuvraj Iyengar, 47, India country director for Women In Tech Global, an organisation championing diversity in STEM. The group has 528 members in India and 10,000 globally. The India arm started six years ago, and its members meet once a week. A global meet-up is held once in two months; they use both virtual and in-person meetings. “The struggles faced by Indian working women are widely acknowledged, yet not universally comprehended. Issues such as achieving work-life balance, managing work and family obligations, addressing health and wellness concerns, navigating adversity including toxic work environments, all while striving to maintain dignity and break barriers, remain complex and often misunderstood. By participating in women-centric groups, individuals can freely express themselves, find common ground, and grow together,” explains Hyderabad-based Iyengar.</p>\n<p>Such groups are also a good way to build a community of friends for oneself in a new city. They also helped working women navigate the challenges of the pandemic, bringing them closer. “Surviving and thriving in 2020 wouldn’t have been possible without this support,” says Saigal.</p>\n<p>Workspaces and culture remain largely patriarchal, which is why women often turn to groups that understand their unique circumstances and challenges as well as get advice. “Studies have shown that women are interrupted more frequently, receive less credit for their ideas, and are underrepresented in decision-making positions. They face microaggressions and gender biases that hinder their professional growth and networking opportunities,” says Acharekar, who is based in Mumbai.</p>\n<p>One word that consistently comes up among founders and members of women-only networking groups is “community”—for both work and fun. Garima Dhamija, 50, and five others co-founded Lead Like Her in Gurugram in 2022 with the aim of creating and giving back to the community of working women. It now has 50 members and they meet fortnightly. The group is restricted to the National Capital Region (NCR).</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/women-groups-networking-work-office-111714324086252.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Unlike other two-year-olds, Timtim loves broccoli and peas. He starts the day with two boiled eggs, each stuffed with a broccoli floret. His dinner includes a portion of boiled peas. “If my baby doesn’t see the greens, he won’t eat,” laughs Delhi-based software engineer Saurabh Khurana.</p>\n<p>When Khurana, 35, adopted Timtim, a Retriever, from an animal shelter in 2022, he was clear that he wanted to feed him nutrient-rich, freshly cooked food. So, he would wake up at 5am and, with the help of his wife, prepare Timtim’s food—a combination of chicken, rice and vegetables. But combined with office workload, it was an exhausting drill.</p>\n<p>Early last year, Khurana started to look for brands that serve healthy pet food with “human-grade” ingredients, or made in accordance with regulations for ready-to-eat human food products. Today, Khurana depends on three platforms to deliver food for his dog—sometimes, it is pork and lentils; often, rice, chicken and vegetables, including peas. The food resembles, even almost tastes like, what humans would eat.</p>\n<p>“I have tasted all the food that I have ordered. It’s like what we eat, minus the salt and masala,” says Khurana, who spends ₹15,000 on pet food every month, about 10% more compared to when he used to cook at home for Timtim. The dog seems to have adjusted well to the “outside food”. “Why should he eat stinky, packaged food (referring to kibble), when I can afford to give him food that looks like food and keeps him healthy?” says Khurana.</p>\n<p>As millennials and Gen Zers reimagine the idea of parenthood, they are ready to spend more time and effort to ensure their beloved pets eat nutritious food, even if it means shelling out more money. Several startups and brands are banking on this visceral urge. From gluten-free to vegan and vegetarian diets, the Indian market is slowly and steadily seeing a rise in pet food that’s seemingly less processed and, in some cases, more closely resembling human food.</p>\n<p>According to Statista, the 2024 revenue in the pet food market in India amounts to $640 million (around ₹5,300 crore). It is expected to grow annually by 12.63%, hitting $1.03 billion in the next four years. Globally, the most revenue is generated in the US (over $57 billion in 2023).</p>\n<p>While there’s no official data on the growth of “human-grade” pet food in India, a quick search online and in retail stores for bespoke and “holistic” options is enough to give an idea of how serious people are becoming about the wellness of their pets. “Being a pet parent is different from being a human parent. When you are a pet parent, you know that unless something untoward happens, you will outlive your pet,” says Ishmeet Singh Chandiok, a pet parent and chef who has done stints at Hyatt and JW Mariott. He’s the founder of Harley’s Corner, a ready-to-eat premium dog food brand that claims to use human-grade ingredients and zero preservatives to create meals.</p>\n<p>Among the dishes Harley’s offers are Goulash ( ₹625 for 900g; to give an idea, a 30kg dog needs 360-450g a meal), a low-fat meal that comprises a blend of sorghum millet, pumpkin seeds, brewer’s yeast, sweet potato, chicken, brown rice, cod liver oil, wheat germ oil, vegetables, algae calcium and seaweed powder; and Wooferole ( ₹800 for 900gm), a “full dietary meal” that combines fish, brown rice, quinoa, pumpkin, algae calcium, and vegetables. My dog and I tried the Goulash. It looked and tasted like chicken khichdi, without salt and spices. My dog finished it in seconds.</p>\n<p>“By just changing the food, if I can have my dog live even a year longer, it would be priceless,” says Singh. “This kind of belief is driving the interest in human-grade pet food, besides growing awareness in general around wellness and what you yourself eat and feed your pet.”</p>\n<p>Human-grade pet food, in simple words, means food fit enough for human consumption. “Humans can eat it but it’s not recommended since pet food has added vitamins, minerals and supplements that are more suitable for animals,” says Shivangi Raina, a Bengaluru-based veterinarian.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/pet-food-good-enough-for-humans-to-take-a-bite-of-111714046366689.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The athlete as backwards prophet is the fashion. What would you tell your younger self, we ask? Write a letter to him, please. And so greying, considered heroes give wise advice to the reckless, obsessive, dynamic creatures they once were.</p>\n<p>He, the Olympic champion, isn’t the looking-back kind. But we want to examine the bones of athletic journeys and younger athletes want to peer down the roads he walked. And this is when he’ll say repeatedly that yes, sure, he reached several goals yet he “failed miserably”.</p>\n<p>Failed?</p>\n<p>In “achieving my fullest potential?”</p>\n<p>But wait, what was the problem?</p>\n<p>“My lack of balance.”</p>\n<p>Abhinav Bindra is talking about something beyond just mere winning. About winning well. About courage of a form we don’t always acknowledge. Courage to take days off, to do less, to not be consumed by sport, to not get imprisoned in the unhealthy grip of competition.</p>\n<p>“Why did I have self-doubt?” he says. “Because all my eggs were in one basket. Because my self-worth depended on where my name was in the ranking list. I didn’t have the courage to let go.”</p>\n<p>“My most successful years, in terms of quality, were in the US in 2001 when I was a student-athlete. I had only so many hours to train. I was challenged intellectually, I was challenged outside the field of play. I went on hikes. Even if I didn’t win in Athens (Olympics, 2004), I was at my best then. And it was because of balance. If everything rests on one pillar and there’s an earthquake, everything shakes.”</p>\n<p>Then he became obsessive, his life a narrow pursuit of gold, and ironically it’s what he got. But if he stayed balanced, could he have been even better? A career never answers every question.</p>\n<p>It’s 16 years since Bindra won 10m air rifle gold in Beijing and since it’s Olympic year, he’s a fair subject for another interrogation. After all, he’s not the athlete I knew. He has a taste for occasional Vesper martinis—shaken, of course—but, to put it politely, there’s nothing much else about him which says James Bond. Except the weapon. The last gun he has left from 22 years of shooting is a gold rifle presented to him by Walther, the gun-maker to 007. The other guns have gone, some pellets remain and a few jackets. His athletic skin has been shed. Now he’s someone who used to be talented.</p>\n<p>Singer Jon Bon Jovi recently spoke about buying back his first guitar. Then he played it, for it’s what musicians do. But athletes let go. Exhausted and played out, they don’t look back. They might clutch on to a little memorabilia, as Rahul Dravid has with a few bats and gloves, but as the Indian cricket coach said, they’re “in some boxes that I haven’t opened in years”.</p>\n<p>But didn’t he, batting engineer, ever step back into the nets, just you know to remember the sound and sensation of timing? Like strumming an old guitar?</p>\n<p>“Never hit a ball in the nets after I stopped,” he replied.</p>\n<p>Athletes often stay in sport, in some form, for it’s all they know. Dravid turned mentor.

Vasudev, as well as the late sculptor S. Nandagopal, have hilarious and moving stories about the founding of Cholamandal Artists’ Village—the home of the Madras Art Movement of the 1960s; stories that are testament to the support they provided one another. In Mumbai, members of the Progressive Artists’ Group (PAG), formed a few decades earlier in 1947, may not have lived in each other’s houses but they had a similar camaraderie and shared sentiments about the direction of art in a newly independent country. In Paris, about a hundred years before PAG, another group of artists banded together, played with light and colour, and brought spontaneity to art by painting outdoors, picking everyday subjects, and infusing art with a sense of movement and brightness.</p>\n    <p>Without this kind of community, artists wouldn’t thrive, and without inspiration from the past, there is little new or original they could create, as our story marking the 150th anniversary of Impressionism shows.

Before that, he had only come across reproductions of paintings by these artists while pursuing a bachelor’s degree in art at the Sir J.J. School of Art in Mumbai. “As arts students in India in the 1970s-80s, we learnt so much from these masters but were unable to view even a single one of these original paintings. We only knew of them through reproductions, or if someone showed 35-mm slides,” says Dodiya, a leading contemporary artist who is currently showing his solo, <i>I Know You. I do. O’ Stranger</i>, at the Galerie Templon, Paris.</p>\n<p>His exhibition coincides with an important milestone in art history—2024 marks 150 years since the first Impressionist exhibition was held in Paris. Dodiya reflects on that moment when he first entered the Musée d’Orsay, which has one of the largest collections of works by Impressionist artists. The ground floor featured a work by Honoré Daumier, who painted life on the street and in the train carriage. “His work was not entirely Impressionist, but was along those lines. On display on the upper floor of the museum was the controversial work <i>Le Dejeuner sur l’herbe (The Luncheon on the Grass)</i> by Edouard Manet,” he recalls. The large oil on canvas, painted between 1862-63, featured a nude female with two fully-dressed men, while on a picnic somewhere in rural France.</p>\n<p>It was not just the large works that impacted Dodiya but also small-scale landscapes by Monet, Camille Pissarro and Alfred Sisley. “I continue to visit the museum during every visit to Paris,” he says. “I take profound delight in the way these artists painted. There is a lifelike quality, and yet the rendering isn’t rooted in realism. Rendering is one thing and transforming is another. In these works, we can see the transformation of life, light and time, which is very critical to Impressionism.”</p>\n<p>What makes Impressionist artists so popular across the world—including in India—150 years after they first exhibited at the studio of photographer Nadar in Paris? To understand this, one has to look at the history of this significant movement, which was rooted in an act of rebellion. In the middle of the 19th century, a jury of artists from the Académie des Beaux-Arts would select artworks and award medals as part of its official exhibition Salon de Paris. In 1874, however, artists such as Monet, Degas and Pissarro decided to organise an exhibition that didn’t subscribe to the style of academic realism—rooted in Biblical and mythological themes—preferred by the Salon. So, 30 artists, who collectively called themselves the Société Anonyme des Artistes Peintres, Sculpteurs et Graveurs, came together in this landmark show, which heralded the birth of Impressionism as a movement.</p>\n<p>Also read: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/how-to-lounge/art-culture/retrospective-at-dag-saluting-the-indomitable-spirit-of-gogi-saroj-pal-111713968923067.html\">Saluting the indomitable spirit of Gogi Saroj Pal</a>\n\t                                    </p>\n<p>\n\t                                        \n\t                                    \t“The independent artists, despite their diverse approaches to painting, appeared to contemporaries as a group.

    "body": "<p>An understanding of entrepreneurs overcoming the odds in gaining access to capital is part of Hardika Shah’s inheritance. As a child growing up in 1980s Mumbai, the CEO and founder of non-banking financial company (NBFC) Kinara Capital, witnessed her mother running a provision store on the ground floor of a building where her parents had an apartment. In pre-liberalisation India, customers were often short of cash at the end of the month, which meant her mother would extend them credit while herself being perpetually short of cash to expand. “Every one (of her customers) was operating salary cheque-to-salary cheque, so she always had this working capital gap,” recalls Shah. But every few weeks, “this random guy would come with a paper bag with cash. There was this unofficial credit community. That was how you got working capital through the Gujarati community.”</p>\n<p>It is perhaps not a coincidence that Shah would eventually start Kinara Capital in 2011, focusing on unsecured lending to small business owners similarly starved of working capital, after a successful stint in consulting. In 1988, Shah had moved to the US for undergraduate studies and then joined Accenture, where she worked for two decades. Shah’s frenetic travel schedule meant that over a decade had passed before she returned to India in 2003. When she visited India that year to set up an office for a client, Microsoft, in Hyderabad, she realised that she had missed witnessing the liberalisation of India’s economy by then finance minister Manmohan Singh and his successors. Shah felt like Rip van Winkle. “You end up in a time warp,” says Shah, 53. But as so often in India, she also noticed the growing disparities between “entitled engineers” and the rest: “You realise so many are left behind.”</p>\n<p>Moved by the experience of watching India’s rapid growth phase unfold but also conscious that this wasn’t benefiting everyone—she was particularly concerned about the unequal lack of access to credit—Shah returned home to the Bay Area. The following year, she started mentoring social entrepreneurs studying at Santa Clara University and at Stanford University, both in California. In 2007, she began an executive MBA while still working for Accenture, shuttling between classes at New York’s Columbia University and the University of California Haas business school campus in Berkeley.</p>\n<p>Shah had juggled academics and work before in Mumbai, receiving internships as a market researcher and later as a font designer while still in high school, earnings she put away towards the exorbitant costs of higher education in the US. After she finished school in Mumbai, in an India before large student loans, Shah received an early lesson in being unable to raise credit. Her parents sold their apartment in Mumbai so that she could study computer science and liberal arts at Knox College in Illinois, US. While she was in college, the rupee was substantially devalued in 1989 and her parents said they would be unable to continue to fund her education. Shah received permission to work off campus and spent weekends working as a receptionist in a nursing home and got jobs during summer holidays as well.</p>\n<p>Completing her MBA in 2009, Shah took a couple of months off and again visited India. In Mumbai and Chennai, she met anyone who would give her the time to talk about finance directed at MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises). She found credit in India to be characterised by a strange dichotomy. Banks loaned money to those with land or other collateral while others relied on relationships or chit funds to raise cash. “I looked at it and thought, ‘Most of our nation doesn’t have land, capital or property.’ I saw this missing middle beyond micro finance.” On her return to the US, she raised $180,000 in seed capital primarily from her classmates in the MBA programme and Accenture colleagues, and Kinara Capital was born.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/hardika-shah-kinara-capital-profile-nbfc-micro-lending-india-111714108834045.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The Surrealists understood that so much depends on context: What is ordinary lining a glove, for instance, becomes <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/works/80997\">grotesque in a teacup</a>. Angolan artist Sandra Poulson — who studied fashion in Lisbon and London, and lives between the latter, Angola’s capital, Luanda, and Amsterdam — operates under a similar ethos of off-kilter recontextualization. In her first museum exhibition, at MoMA PS1, she presents wooden assemblages embedded in or punctured by the floating signifiers connected with Angola after its Civil War (1975–2002), which began immediately after the nation gained independence from Portugal. A bed frame lurches drunkenly toward the viewer; a mirror sits sullenly in the corner, a headboard bolts upright like a soldier. Across these mostly household objects, Poulson emphasizes that history is something that haunts you as you sleep, as you dress, as you look at yourself in the mirror. </p>\n<p>Several complex circuits converge in Poulson’s work: the global trade routes that brought this specific wood into the artist’s path; symbols connected to important events in Angolan history as they intersect with world events; and, finally, Poulson’s own stylistic iconography. The material itself is freighted: Vintage Dutch objects made from wood that might be sourced from Angola sit along chipboard furniture made in China in an American style. It is the physical manifestation of a global trade network made local, the items carrying evidence of their circulation — peeling inventory stickers or faded stamps — and their use, such as the ring imprint of a cup.</p>\n<p>Poulson’s method, then, is not so much about lodging one signifier (logos, presidents’ silhouettes, and symbols of local organizations) into another (wood) so much as colliding them together. Her interventions certainly draw attention to the unseen forces that have shaped these objects — the symbol for the European Union, a dominant trade partner, appears multiple times. But by setting them in wood, rather than more ephemeral media such as digital imagery or even apparel, she draws attention to their significance and heft: These symbols and what they represent do not simply layer over your skin; they puncture the way you live.</p>\n<p>Some of the furniture-as-artworks on view, such as the found mirror “Untitled (Mirror)” or the wooden speaker “Leitura dos Acordos de Alvor, January 1975” (Reading of the Alvor Accords), which plays aloud the Angolan independence agreement, feel both underdone and too on-the-nose. While I liked that the former made a trick mirror of the exhibition space, intensifying its surreality by reflecting and recombining the other absurdist objects on its surface in jarring and unexpected ways, positioning a found object in the corner as the sole intervention felt a bit cheap compared to other works, and fell proportionately flat to me. Meanwhile, the latter emits audio so softly that I think even Portuguese speakers would miss its significance; even when noticed, the work’s intended effect of drawing attention to the way history permeates lived experience is already achieved more compellingly by other pieces in the show.</p>\n<p>plywood, and steel</p>\n<p>The more successful<strong> </strong>objects on view are simultaneously unfinished and highly finished, heightening their absurdity. In “Cabinda Dreams” (all works 2024), a bedframe with the EU logo punched into the cheap wooden headboard has been sawed at a clean diagonal on one end so that it angles haphazardly, as though pleading for help or reaching to grab you. Other objects short-circuited my sense of material logic: The wooden headboard of “Candidato a Presidente da República de Angola” (Candidate for President of the Republic of Angola) sits upright on a sheet of rusted steel, uncannily unsupported. I couldn’t determine either the quality or weight of the wood. Elsewhere — particularly in “Confessionário” (Confessional) — there are apertures where there shouldn’t be, glass where you wouldn’t expect it. And walk around to the back of “Igreja Universal do Reino de Deus” (Universal Church of the Kingdom of God) and you’ll see that it’s been blown out, the cheap corkboard drawers sagging from the lack of support, speaking to the disasters that hide beneath the veneer of stability. Meanwhile, “Propaganda Flush” declares and then immediately curtails its function: The toilet is suspended in the air, torn from the sewage pipes that make it what it is. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035186/sandra-poulson-haunted-house/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>LONDON — There is something both frightening and fascinating about a sculpture that could kill you. Hamad Butt’s <i>Familiars</i> (1992) is a series of three sculptures that, if broken, could toxify the air and cause significant harm. “Familiars 3: Cradle” resembles a huge Newton’s cradle, common as a desk toy, wherein a ball is dropped against a stationary line of similar balls, causing the one at the other end to swing away before it falls back to repeat the process. In this case, however, the spheres are made of vacuum-sealed glass containing greenish-yellow chlorine gas — playing with this toy would spell disaster. </p>\n    <p>This series exemplifies Butt’s career-long exploration of risk and contagion. Made at the height of the AIDS epidemic, and shortly after the artist’s own diagnosis, which would lead to his premature death two years later, <i>Familiars</i> throws oblique light on the threat of disease and the complex, often contradictory emotions thrown up by the risk of contagion. Another piece in the series, “Familiars 1: Substance Sublimation Unit,” consists of a ladder whose rungs are glass tubes containing a heating element and iodine crystals. The heaters periodically turn on and off, sublimating the iodine into an eerie purple gas, again both fear-inducing and alluring.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/07/qFTKw-1200x1865.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1865&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/07/fP2PO-1200x2086.jpeg?resize=1200%2C2086&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>These are confident, conceptually complex, and allusive works, coolly holding their own in the large space of the opening gallery. Their minimalist and scientific aesthetic also offers an intriguing foil to some of the artist’s earlier paintings and drawings, displayed upstairs. A wall text notes that Butt saw his sculptures and paintings as closely connected, particularly in terms of color, but while his sculptures are more formal, his works on paper and canvas are significantly more figurative. “No Title: Figures with Muzzles” (c. 1984) shows nude men being chased into a body of water by dogs in barbed-wire muzzles. The scene, apparently lit by a bare lightbulb, feels both bleak and emotional, perhaps drawing from Butt’s experience of being a queer Pakistani in Britain in the 1980s.</p>\n    <p>Symbols of fear and contagion emerge repeatedly throughout Butt’s oeuvre. One series of drawings from 1990 features illustrations of triffids, the menacing plants from John Wyndham’s 1951 sci-fi novel <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-day-of-the-triffids-john-wyndham/17204649?ean=9780593450086&amp;next=t&amp;affiliate=539\"> The Day of the Triffids</a>. Butt draws a parallel between these monstrous plants and HIV’s indifference to human life, which he saw as an unstoppable force intent on fulfilling its destiny.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/07/N9m33-1200x1133.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1133&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>These drawings are directly connected to the installation “Transmissions” (1990), which consists of nine glass books engraved with a triffid and illuminated by ultraviolet light, which can cause damage to human eyes. Visitors are encouraged to put on protective glasses to view the installation, which draws attention to the scapegoating of sexual and racial minorities during the AIDs crisis and beyond. Here, as elsewhere, Butt’s work cleverly and powerfully plays with our sense of fear, examining its source, whether instinctual or instilled in us by political, religious, or media manipulation. In his hands, contagion becomes both poetic device and devastating lived reality — and we are invited to share the complicated emotions it evokes.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/07/uopDJ-1200x917.jpeg?resize=1200%2C917&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/07/5XmdF-1200x799.jpeg?resize=1200%2C799&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.whitechapelgallery.org/exhibitions/hamad-butt-apprehensions/\">Hamad Butt: Apprehensions</a> <i>continues at Whitechapel Gallery (77-82 Whitechapel High Street, London, England) through September 7.

Some live in an ostensible future and others in an ostensible past, both close together and distant. As Clang wrote in a piece for <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/john-clang-being-together\"> LensCulture</a>, diasporic families can be “made whole again through the use of a third space, a site that is able to reassemble them together within the photographic space that we call a family portrait.”</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://johnclang.com/reading-by-an-artist\"> Reading by an Artist</a>, an ongoing performance series that began in 2023, Clang pulls from a decade-long study of </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.feng-shui-institute.org/Chinese_Astrology/ZWDS-astrology.html\">(紫微斗数)</a>\n    </p>\n<p><i>,</i>sometimes called purple star astrology in English.

Although he occasionally conducts readings by request through his </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://johnclang.com/\">website</a>, his series is experienced through scheduled performances, including one in the upcoming</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.e-flux.com/announcements/6783961/ghost-2568-wish-we-were-here\">in Bangkok, Thailand, starting October 15.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>In popular apps like CHANI and Co–Star, users plug in their birth date and location and receive a natal chart that references one’s Sun, Moon, and Rising sign, along with other details. These charts come from <a href=\"https://time.com/5315377/are-zodiac-signs-real-astrology-history/\">Western astrology</a>, whose roots can be traced back to the Babylonian system, and every day, users can get a glimpse of what astrological forces may be shaping their lives.</p>\n<p>It’s a similar process for ziwei doushu: Clang requested basic details around my birth date in advance of our session so he could develop a chart. Getting a reading done by the artist transformed the experience, as he mediated the process through conversation. When I sat down with him at Galerie Lelong, he had a paper notebook and a tablet propped up on a stand. He pulled up my chart with a printout and on the screen in front of me, a series of squares with each palace laid out. The tablet app he used allowed him to move forward and backward by decades in my life, capturing different versions of me through time and space.</p>\n<p>Clang then homed in on a few squares: my Life palace to point out my challenges with burnout, my Career palace to note what he calls my “scholar energy,” and my Travel palace to observe my frequent sojourns. With each series of observations, he did a gut check with me to make sure his reading was landing effectively. It did.</p>\n<p>At this point, a skeptic could argue that these broad observations stem from topics I’ve written about publicly before (a quick look at <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/author/an/\">my  Hyperallergic bio and datelines</a>, for example, would confirm my frequent travel) and could just as easily have been Googled. The skeptic would be right, to a certain extent, but the reading was just getting started. And in any case, that critique would miss the point of Clang’s work.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035796/john-clang-reading-by-an-artist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>MIAMI — On a July afternoon, in an abandoned boutique sandwiched unassumingly between a dentist’s office, a Latin grocery store, and a barbershop, Little Havana residents and artists gathered for their afternoon <i>cafecito </i>ritual. But instead of coffee, the plastic fluted espresso cups held swamp mud from the Everglades and checkpoint soil from the entrance to Alligator Alcatraz, the notorious immigrant detention center at the center of a <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032766/alligator-alcatraz-construction-halted-but-native-heritage-remains-at-risk/\">lawsuit</a> alleging violations of the National Environmental Policy Act and <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032766/alligator-alcatraz-construction-halted-but-native-heritage-remains-at-risk/\">Miccosukee land protections</a>. On Thursday, August 21, a judge ordered the <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article311770767.html\">halting of operations</a> at the prison, but the state quickly filed a motion to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/22/alligator-alcatraz-closure-appeal-immigration\">appeal</a> the decision.</p>\n<p>The performance by Miami artist Agua Dulce, titled “Untitled (todo lo que toques se transforma)” (2025), took place at the opening of <i>The Artist As Activist</i>, curated by Isabella Marie Garcia with works by members of Artists 4 Artists (A4A). In recent history, the advocacy group has mobilized in response to local challenges like the <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/913047/art-alluding-to-pro-palestine-slogan-nixed-from-miami-beach-display/\">censorship</a> of political art for Palestine, inequitable pay, and <a href=\"https://www.americantheatre.org/2025/08/01/miami-dade-budget-proposes-major-cuts-to-arts-funding/\">funding cuts</a>. But since Alligator Alcatraz’s construction, A4A has shifted into high gear, convening artists to employ a range of defensive strategies against detention — accompanying migrants to their court hearings, participating in direct action, collecting stories of those detained, leading workshops to help affected families, and creating graphics to build awareness about the history and contemporary politics of the camp.</p>\n<p>Misael Soto, a lead organizer of A4A, told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that they want the organization to “commit itself to taking a stance,” encouraging artists to draw on their special expertise to “affect real change in this city.” </p>\n<p>“I was thinking of artists who are doing creative work, but also doing work for others,” said Garcia. “Artists who work in organizing spaces don’t often get the chance to show their work publicly.”</p>\n<p><i>The</i> <i>Artist As Activist</i>, on view through September 7, includes works by members Motyko, Fola Akinde, and Agua. The show occupies a storefront in a strip mall in Little Havana, a historically Cuban neighborhood that holds layered histories of migration and is home to residents of varied and often precarious legal status. </p>\n<p>“This show speaks to people who inhabit the space naturally,” said Agua. “It’s been interesting to disrupt the mundanity of people going about their days. That’s what makes this space powerful — you’re not expecting to engage with it.”</p>\n<p>Behind the glass, the installation unfolds as a triptych: Motyko’s mixed-media collages at the foreground, Akinde’s cartographic screenprints on the side, and Agua’s altarpiece on the ground. In the background reads the exhibition’s resonant message: “The Gestapo is here, has been here and its name is ICE. No to Alligator Alcatraz!” Translations in Spanish and Kreyòl ripple down.</p>\n<p>“We’re in a more removed part of the city from where a lot of the Alligator Alcatraz situation is in effect,” Garcia explained. She hopes that the installation serves as a public reminder that, despite diminishing news coverage and hopeful developments in the courts, people are still being kidnapped and unlawfully detained.</p>\n<p>Familiar motifs of immigrant life flank the explicit imagery about the detention center. Motyko’s collages include cutouts from magazines, personal photos, newspapers, websites, and archives, combining roosters with cans of condensed milk, whispers of lace with elders’ ringed hands. Two collages draw on the grief and instability that loom over mixed-status and undocumented families.</p>\n<p>Motyko’s father came from Cuba on the Mariel boatlift, her mother from Honduras on Temporary Protected Status. The collage “Untitled”<i> </i>(2023) splices a line of migrants diagonally across a Social Security card, white space in between marking an absence of family milestones: a mother’s funeral, a wedding, a birthday. </p>\n<p>Another overlays agricultural workers protesting the governor’s veto of the Heat Protections Bill onto a plastic Publix shopping bag. The proposed measure would have mandated rest, water, and shade for outdoor laborers, but ultimately failed, even after 29-year-old Mexican farmworker Efraín López García <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/climate-change/article277399723.html\">died</a> of heatstroke on the job in Miami. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036413/with-cafecito-cups-and-direct-action-miami-artists-rise-against-alligator-alcatraz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Egyptian officials told <i>Agence France-Presse</i> that the area may be part of the long-lost seaport Canopus, a prominent trade, religious, and luxury hub that flourished during Egypt’s Ptolemaic dynasty and the Roman empire. A combination of <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/sunken-underwater-anicent-cities\">rising sea levels and continuous earthquakes</a> drowned the metropolis and neighboring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/15/lost-cities-6-thonis-heracleion-egypt-sunken-sea\">Thonis-Heracleion</a> approximately 1,200 years ago.</p>\n    <p>Like its ancient predecessors, Alexandria is also vulnerable to rising sea levels. The United Nations estimates that at least <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/29/climate/coastal-cities-underwater.html\">a third of the historic city will be underwater or uninhabitable</a> by 2050, displacing 1.5 million of its six million residents.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2230463146-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The resurfaced artifacts include remnants of buildings that may have been religious spaces, residences, and commercial businesses. Officials also recovered partially preserved pre-Roman statues of sovereigns and sphinxes, such as a beheaded Ptolemaic granite sculpture and an incomplete sphinx with a cartouche bearing the inscription of Ramesses II, whose reign as pharaoh was the second longest in Egyptian history. Other finds included rock-carved ponds used for fish cultivation and water storage.</p>\n    <p>The newly recovered artifacts are set to be featured in an ongoing exhibition at the Alexandria National Museum exploring the Greek, Roman, and Hellenistic history through underwater archaeology, <i> NBC </i>reported. </p>\n    <p><i>Secrets of the Sunken City</i>opened this week and currently displays 86 artifacts.</p>\n    <p>“There’s a lot underwater, but what we’re able to bring up is limited, it’s only specific material according to strict criteria,” Egypt’s tourism and antiquities minister Sherif Fath told <i>AFP</i> about the recently retrieved archaeological treasures. “The rest will remain part of our sunken heritage.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036426/ancient-sculptures-recovered-from-sunken-city-off-alexandria/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p><i> Kenny Nguyen: The Divine Eye</i> is an evocative, large-scale installation that invites viewers to engage with the rich spiritual and cultural history of Vietnam through the lens of Caodaism. Rooted in the synthesis of Eastern and Western philosophies, Caodaism — a syncretic religion founded in Vietnam in the 1920s — serves as both inspiration and metaphor in this work, which is on view at the </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/4fNyL7p\">Halsey Institute of Contemporary Art</a>at the College of Charleston in South Carolina through December 6.</p>\n    <p>In his practice, Nguyen transforms torn strips of silk by dipping them into acrylic paint, layering them onto canvas, and hanging them dynamically on the wall to construct new topographies. Now for the first time, his technique has been adapted to form columns that reflect Caodaism’s distinctive temple architecture, marrying traditional Eastern elements with Western influences to create a visual dialogue between the past and the present, the local and the global.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Kenny-Nguyen-The-Divine-Eye-2-1-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Caodaism emerged in response to the tumultuous history of Vietnam in the early 20th century, during a time of colonial occupation and national struggle. In the face of foreign domination and the erosion of indigenous cultural practices, this new religion synthesized elements from Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, Christianity, and other world religions to form a unifying spiritual force. Although Nguyen is not a practicing member of the faith himself, his grandmother was a member of the temple that inspired his work. This connection left a lasting imprint on his understanding of Caodaism and its significance to the Vietnamese people. For the artist, the creation of “The Divine Eye” (2025) is deeply personal.</p>\n    <p>Nguyen’s use of silk is deliberate and symbolic. By pushing the limits of the material, he aims to emphasize concepts of transformation and perseverance, mirroring the journey of the Vietnamese people — both within their homeland and in the diaspora. In many ways, the work is intended to reflect the strength and grace of his grandmother and others in their community who have preserved their culture and spirituality amidst adversity.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Kenny-Nguyen-The-Divine-Eye-3-1-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Through the hybrid form of architecture, intricate folds of silk, and the profound symbolism of the Divine Eye — an all-seeing force that guides and protects — Nguyen hopes to create a space of reflection and connection, speaking not only to the spiritual beliefs of Caodaism but also to the resilience and ongoing transformation of Vietnamese culture. Through Nguyen’s art, viewers are invited to look inward and outward, to witness the past’s impact on the present, and to consider the transformative power of heritage in shaping the future.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>To learn more, visit  halsey.charleston.edu.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Kenny-Nguyen-The-Divine-Eye-4-1-1200x972.jpeg?resize=1200%2C972&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Kenny-Nguyen-The-Divine-Eye-5-2-1200x954.jpg?resize=1200%2C954&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035821/kenny-nguyen-the-divine-eye/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Then, you google everyone involved, get excited to chat with anyone who’s seen the movie in question, and find yourself still thinking about it weeks later. Here’s one movie from this year that did it for me…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sorry-baby-movie.jpg\" alt=\"sorry baby\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p><i> Sorry, Baby</i> bowled me over. Eva Victor’s directorial debut, which they also wrote and starred in, follows Agnes through a few years of her life, sequenced out of order. There’s “The Year With The Baby” and “The Year With The Really Good Sandwich,” but also “The Year With The Bad Thing.” When Eva shared the movie poster on Instagram, they confirmed that “nothing bad happens to the cat.”</p>\n    <p>Instead, it is Agnes to whom the bad thing happens. “I wrote this film because there’s a part of my experience of trauma that I haven’t seen on-screen often: the part where you’re confused,” Eva said during a <a href=\"https://www.sundance.org/blogs/give-me-the-backstory-get-to-know-eva-victor-the-writer-director-behind-sorry-baby/#:~:text=When%20awful%20things%20happen%20to,re%20not%20like%20everyone%20else.\">Sundance interview</a>. “I spent years floating, just trying to accept that I went through something bad.” The movie “honors those years lost,” as they put it. To write the script, Eva holed up in Maine one winter with their cat and many cans of split pea soup.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/try-this.gif\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>The warm friendship between Agnes and Lydie (Naomi Ackie) is the central love story animating the movie. But, as Lydie’s life carries her away from the small town where they met during grad school, Agnes feels stuck. Getting an impressive teaching job at the university means staying in a place marred by a devastating experience during her time as a student. “Bad thing” is a euphemism, but also, with its childlike clarity, a perfect description.</p>\n    <p>Offering a really moving portrait of trauma’s reverberations and one person’s recovery, <i>Sorry, Baby </i>is also very funny. In the theater, I laughed a lot and cried a little. I loved Agnes and would’ve been happy to spend a hundred years with her. Of the movie’s reception, Eva recently told the <i> L.A. Times</i>, “I keep hearing, ‘Oh, Agnes is so awkward.’ I’m like, ‘What the hell?’ I’m very humbled by people’s reactions to how bizarre they think that character is because I’m like: ‘Oh, I thought she was acting legitimately normal, but okay.’”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-02-at-4.01.57-PM.png\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>What’s been your favorite movie so far this year?

I also made a day trip to Devil’s Bridge, a place I had only seen in a couple of episodes of <i>Hinterland,</i> a noir crime drama set in Wales. The dark and atmospheric Devil’s Bridge comprises three bridges that span the Afon Mynach, a tributary of the Rheidol. Each one, built upon the previous bridge, can be reached by the Rheidol Steam Railway, and had made it to my travel wish list since I saw the show in 2018.</p>\n<p>I am not the only one who’s guided by the screen when it comes to travel plans. According to Expedia, the screen is sparking wanderlust across the world. The travel company’s 2023 report <i>The No-Normal: Unexpected Travel Trends</i> revealed that 66% of travellers worldwide have “considered visiting a destination after seeing it featured in a show or movie they have streamed at home, and 39% have booked a trip for the same reason”. The company’s Unpack 2024 research predicted that the trend would continue this year, with “movies and streaming shows (the) top inspiration for travel”.</p>\n<p>Be it gorgeous landscapes of New Zealand (<i>The Rings of Power</i>) or the natural beauty of Maui and Sicily (<i>The White Lotus</i>), the urbanity of Paris (<i>Emily in Paris</i>) or the glamour and glitz of New York (<i>Sex and the City</i> reboot), travellers are planning trips to locations popularised by TV series and movies.</p>\n<p>In fact, Expedia believes this will lead destinations such as Thailand (<i>The White Lotus,</i> season 3), the Scottish Highlands (<i>Outlander,</i> season 7), Malta (<i>Gladiator 2</i>), Greece (<i>Argylle</i>) and South Korea (<i>Squid Game,</i> season 2) to trend in 2024.</p>\n<p>Nishant Pitti, CEO and co-founder, EaseMyTrip, agrees that seeking holiday inspiration from films, soaps or sitcoms is the new global travel trend that is influencing tourists’ holiday plans and is expected to gain momentum this year. “This is a rather unconventional take on travelling and vacationing, with new movies and TV series generating higher interest in travel to those places,” he says.</p>\n<p>The trend has been around for a while, especially after <i>Harry Potter, Game of</i> <i>Thrones </i>and <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, but screen-inspired travel has soared post-pandemic. One destination though that remains an evergreen choice for set-jetting is the UK, due to the fact that so many films and series have been shot here.</p>\n<p>Over the years, iconic film and TV franchises such as <i>James Bond, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Outlander, The Crown</i> and <i>Paddington</i> have consistently chosen UK locations and studios to house their productions. Recent films such as <i>Wonka</i> and Napoleon have boosted visitor numbers, while the growth of TV streaming has fuelled a rise in screen tourism. The fact that films and series have been filmed across Britain, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland has led to numerous set-jetting opportunities.\n\t                                    </p>\n<p>With inbound tourists spending an estimated £892.6 million (around ₹9,194 crore) in film-related screen tourism in the UK in 2019 alone, according to the British Film Institute (BFI), the country is tapping the potential of screen tourism.</p>\n<p>Pitti says the UK tops the list owing to its scenic beauty and the right blend of royalty, history and modern experiences that create the perfect backdrop for historical dramas and contemporary shows. “For instance, Chatsworth House in Peak district was featured in <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> (the 2005 version starring Keira Knightley). The UK has also been the centrepiece of shows like <i>Downton Abbey</i> and <i>Bridgerton</i> (Hampton Court Palace). Even the <i>Harry Potter</i> franchise sought inspiration from the alluring Scottish Highlands to create a mystical fantasy world for children,” he says.</p>\n<p>The choices for travellers are plentiful. The British Film Commission, the agency that supports production of international films and television in the UK, in 2022 alone supported film and TV titles such as <i>Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, The Crown, season 6, The Boys in the Boat, Black Cake</i> and <i>Napoleon</i>.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/setjetting-uk-travel-trend-expedia-111714111224778.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Imagine that your application for a teaching position has been rejected by a number of universities and teaching institutions in Europe. You advertise private tuitions but no pupils turn up. You settle for a job as a third-division clerk at a patent office, reading patent applications from nine in the morning till five in the evening, six days a week. Back home, your marriage is in trouble. And yet, you churn out no less than five theoretical papers on science, three of which will give a new lease of life to physics for another century. That was Einstein in 1905. He was a technical expert—class III at the Federal Office for Intellectual Property in Bern between 1902 and 1909, and with no access to any scientific instruments, literature, colleagues, or inspiration. He was all by himself, consumed by his thought experiments. By today’s standards of work culture, Einstein was moonlighting.</p>\n<p>Every few months, there’s a storm in a teacup about moonlighting—or working at another job while holding a steady one. The term hit headline soon after the pandemic, when work-from-home became the norm and employees logged in without the supervision of their bosses. Is it indeed “cheating” as some leaders have declared? It depends on what you do—if you do the very same work for a competitor, it is wrong. But, if the side hustle is a creative pursuit that gives you a shot at creating history, why not?</p>\n<p>Steve Wozniak was creating the future of Apple years before he left HP to set up the company with Steve Jobs. He would develop new hardware and systems with no direct relevance to the HP of the day. During the late 1980s, Tim Berners-Lee took on the side gig of automating information sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world, which led to the creation of the World Wide Web. If there is a pent-up creative capacity which is not adequately channelised by the employer, the person should be allowed to do justice to it.</p>\n<p>There are three conditions under which moonlighting makes sense, and, in fact, must be encouraged. First, when an employee’s talent is not fully utilised or developed, the employee must be allowed to take up additional tasks within or outside the formal setup. After all, it is an employer’s responsibility to tap into the resource or they run the risk of the asset eroding. It’s not just utilisation of talent, but also development and enhancement through exposure. The mythologist and writer Devdutt Pattanaik spent his early years at Sanofi Aventis and Apollo Group of Hospitals honing his skills as a writer, alongside his day job as a medical practitioner. That allowed him to craft a creative career for himself as well as entertain and inform a huge number of readers.</p>\n<p>Second, when the cause the employee is working for is broader than the firm’s immediate interest or relevance. If an employee is creating a solution that could potentially shift the paradigm of the market as a whole, the firm should be willing to fund such a venture. That’s how Intel encouraged its engineer, Ajay Bhatt, to create the USB standard that didn’t just benefit the firm to inter-operate with other devices but became an industry standard for data communication. It was not exactly what Intel, the chip maker, was known for.</p>\n<p>Third, moonlighting makes for a great investment if the employee helps the firm develop new skills and competencies. If an employee is working on a similar domain that the firm excels in then where is the firm learning from? It’s a circular flow of knowledge. It is possible that through a side-gig the employee develops new competences that would become mainstream in the organisation. This way the firm can transform to become future ready.</p>\n<p>The early experiments that the internal IT team did at Amazon with its infrastructure and computational capacity laid the foundation of AWS, which has become the biggest profit engine for the company. All such experiments were planted years before the company made any profits from its core business.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/moonlighting-side-job-part-time-work-interests-111714324643689.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>When Banksy visited New Orleans a few years after Hurricane Katrina, the artist left 17 murals behind, sprinkled across the city. One piece on the exterior of a biker bar, <i>Boy on a Life Preserver Swing,</i> had been spray-painted over and then reduced to rubble after the bar was demolished. Ronnie Fredericks, a dump truck driver, went to the site to collect the cinderblocks that made up the mural and stored them for years until he found an opportunity—and an art-loving New Orleans hotelier—to bring the artwork back to life. Ivy Knight writes a delightful <i>Oxford American</i> story about three people who come together to restore a Banksy.</p><blockquote><p>Grenier met Cummings and Fredericks at a warehouse in Bywater—the same one where she’d spent two months working on</p><i>Looters</i>. Located along the railroad tracks close to the Mississippi River, it takes up a whole city block. As she looked at the collection of cinderblocks, she had a few concerns. First was where to begin, for they were in no particular order, and she had only Fredericks’s word that a Banksy existed under the paint. And was Fredericks trustworthy? She noticed he had a tattoo of Da Vinci on his bicep. “I was a little suspicious when I saw that tattoo of Leonardo because I thought, ‘Well, maybe you’re an artist or maybe you’re a forger. I don’t know who you are yet.’” Counterfeit art is a common concern in Grenier’s work. “There will always be art forgers as long as there’s a demand for art. You’ve got to be really careful with Banksy. We know there have been some fakes,” she said. “It’s difficult to identify spray paint, because of it being a modern material and available to anybody. So, you know, initially I wasn’t that optimistic.”</blockquote><h2>More picks about art</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/07/22/thomas-kinkade-trump-america/\">The Painter of the Right</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Thomas Kinkade’s paintings show conservatives a world they have already won.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/05/22/the-man-who-wrote-take-on-me-on-the-fine-art-of-not-giving-a-fk/\">The Man Who Wrote “Take On Me” on the Fine Art of Not Giving a F**k</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Magne Furuholmen doesn’t care if the only reason you want to see his art is that he’s the A-ha guy.

    "body": "<h3>We climb glaciers and take minute measurements to understand the threats to our future. This is the story of my last, and most dramatic, trip to the Arctic.</h3>\n<p>\n      <i>My book,  Meltdown: The Making and Breaking of a Field Scientist, comes out this week, six years after I started writing it. It’s about my time as a female academic scientist traveling to remote field locations, and the illness that cut my career short. This Narratively Classic was critical for my book, as I drew heavily on its content and style to create a world that readers could understand and be immersed in. </i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>—Sarah Boon</i>\n    </p>\n<p>It was 10 p.m. one night in June of 2008 and we were cut off from our on-glacier camp. When we’d left that morning, it was sunny and the glacier surface was crisp and crunchy, perfect for our plastic boots and crampons. My graduate student and I had decked ourselves out in hats and sunscreen to protect us from the sun’s reflection off the ice, then headed up-glacier to check on a weather station and a stream gauge to make sure we were ready to capture all of the data we needed once spring melt began.</p>\n<p>It was a long day, and by the time we headed back down-glacier, toward our camp, my bad knee had started acting up and I couldn’t walk without pain. To make the situation worse, we realized that things had changed while we were away from camp. The warm day had melted the snow on the lower glacier, leaving a shifting landscape of ice slurries in hidden surface channels surrounded by small hummocks of solid ice. We got within 1,500 feet of our camp and couldn’t go any farther, as there were two slushy streams between it and us that were just too wide and deep to cross. My graduate student tried to cross anyway, but the slush was like quicksand. I had to yell at him to lie down and pull himself out by the arms instead of trying to kick out with his legs. Now he was curled up in the tinfoil blanket from the emergency kit, icy wet to the waist and moaning about not wanting to die. Thank goodness for 24-hour daylight.</p>\n<p>I couldn’t reach him, and neither of us could reach our camp. It was time to get out the satellite phone and call base camp in Resolute Bay, 250 miles southwest.</p>\n<p>Not all Arctic researchers have had the luxury of satellite phones or shortwave radios. Take the English explorers at the turn of the century: If they got in trouble on their travels, they had only themselves to rely on. Searchers were only sent out if the expedition didn’t return after several years. This is what happened to Captain Sir John Franklin, who set off to traverse the last unexplored section of the Northwest Passage in 1845. The story ends badly — Franklin and his crew died of zinc deficiency and scurvy, some resorted to cannibalism, and they left artifacts strewn across the Arctic tundra as they tried to walk for help. Franklin’s wife pushed for a search for the missing expedition as early as 1848, but it was too late for Franklin and his crew. More than 50 expeditions searched for 12 years before concluding that every one of the 129 men was gone. The searchers found only graves, relics and Inuit stories about the expedition. It wasn’t until 2014 that Parks Canada and the Royal Canadian Geographical Society finally found one of Franklin’s abandoned boats, the H.M.S. <i>Erebus</i>, on the seabed where the Inuit had always said it was. The wreck of the H.M.S. <i>Terror</i>, Franklin’s second boat, was found in 2016 by the Arctic Research Foundation. Both sites are currently being explored in collaboration with the local Inuit.</p>\n<p>The Arctic has long tempted researchers to take risks to answer questions of science. Consider Norwegian Fridtjof Nansen, who suspected that, rather than being static, sea ice was a dynamic system that moved ice from east to west across the Arctic Ocean, from Siberia to Greenland, and potentially over the North Pole itself.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/the-secret-life-of-a-scientist-new-book\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Looping through the branches and woven between the trees was a series of tripwires adorned with silver Christmas bells. My father told me he put them up to keep the deer from eating our apples.

For writers, that means carving out the time and space to finally give our creative projects the attention they deserve. We’ve designed our Narratively Academy summer class schedule with that in mind. And since we know summer is also for giving yourself a break, all of our upcoming summer classes are either short (one to three sessions) and/or designed so you can attend asynchronously. </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Sign up this week (by Sunday, June 15) and take 20% off any one of these classes by using the code EARLYSUMMER at checkout.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Read on for everything we have on tap!</p>\n<p>But before we get to the brand-new classes, just a quick reminder that we have Abeer Hoque back teaching <strong> The Insider’s Guide to Writing Personal Statements and Applying for Grants &amp; Residencies</strong> this coming weekend, June 14 and June 21. There are just two seats left in this small class, so if you want in, grab yours now!</p>\n<p>We all know that one of the trickiest things to write about honestly is family — especially parents. Talk about navigating emotional minefields! That’s why we’re so pleased to have Ladane Nasseri, a MacDowell fellow who has published everywhere from <i>The New York Times</i> to <i>McSweeney’s</i>, teaching a two-hour seminar later this month, <strong> The Way They Were: Writing About Parents and Formative Relationships</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you’re working on a memoir or a personal essay that you want to infuse with original reporting and research, don’t miss this class. Kristina Gaddy — acclaimed author, essayist and editor at the literary journal <i>true </i>— is leading a special two-part craft-focused seminar in July called <strong> Reporting the Personal Essay</strong>. Students really loved the first edition of this class last year, and Kristina has now expanded it to include a second day where you can discuss your own works-in-progress.</p>\n<p>This summer, just 10 writers will have the chance to work one-one-one with Narratively executive editor Jesse Sposato. Jesse edits almost all of the memoir pieces that are published on Narratively, and this is the very first time she’s teaching <strong> Summer Memoir Mentorship: Perfecting the Personal Essay</strong>. If you have a draft of a personal essay and you’re ready for professional feedback, Jesse will review and critique your story, hop on a one-on-one call to discuss edits with you, then review your revision and help you get it all polished up and ready to submit to publications. </p>\n<p>We could not be more excited about this next class which, honestly, everyone on our team wants to take ourselves! If you’re a journalist, essayist or other writer who has always wanted to try your hand at a screenplay, this summer is your chance to commit. Bill Gullo is a very accomplished Hollywood screenwriter and longtime educator. In <strong> this fun, fast-paced summer class, he’ll show you how to write a “vomit draft” of a screenplay in six weeks</strong>. What’s a vomit draft? It’s just what it sounds like: fast and disgusting, but productive. Plus you’ll feel better after you’re done! Any professional screenwriter will tell you about the importance of getting the first draft finished so you can step back and see what’s working and what’s not. Throughout these six weeks, Bill will walk writers through all the details of how to get that full first draft finished in a way that allows you to move forward with intention.</p>\n<p>One of our perennially popular classes, Katey Schultz’s <strong> The Fine Art of Deep Revision</strong> explores how revising your own writing can be efficient, productive and even fun — once you identify the concrete techniques that work best for you. Our three previous sessions of this class all sold out quickly, so grab a seat now if you want to get to work on revising your writing projects this August.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/first-look-check-out-our-new-summer-classes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s a balmy August night, lit by a big, yellow moon. Two fishermen in a boat are earning their keep out there off the shore of Antibes in southern France. One of them aims at a large, curmudgeonly fish with a pitchfork, the other tries his luck with a fishing line. A cautious crab keeps a safe distance.<strong> </strong>Gas lamps reflect on the water’s surface and flicker into the air. A girl on a bike observes the whole scene from a high dock while licking an ice cream. She’s there with a friend, it seems. </p>\n    <p>Luxurious Monaco is less than an hour away by car. Beachy Nice is even closer. Everything looks fine and lovely. But beneath these calm waters swirl malignant tides that portend the onset of a Second, much deadlier World War just a few weeks away.</p>\n    <p>This scene in Pablo Picasso’s “Night Fishing at Antibes” stopped me in my tracks during a visit to the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) on a hot Saturday afternoon in New York City.</p>\n    <p>Currently hung on a wall at a busy intersection connecting two escalators on the museum’s fifth floor, it’s nearly impossible to have a private moment with this Cubist masterpiece, much less heed its alarm that we’re never really too far away from a third, infinitely more horrific World War, probably powered by AI.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/image00002-1200x900.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>This sprawling piece (6.75 by 11.3 feet, or two by 3.5 meters) was acquired for MoMA in 1952 by Olga Hirsh Guggenheim, wife of industrialist-philanthropist Simon Guggenheim, brother of Solomon R. Guggenheim, who started his own eponymous museum on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue. The Guggenheims made their fortune from building a global mining and smelting empire, which reached its peak during the First World War. They, among others, have been <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt130hv7t\">accused of war profiteering</a> by gouging the price of copper, which was essential for the arms industry. Many in the family have abandoned the mining industry since then. Now we recognize them more as great patrons of the arts, just as we do many contemporary MoMA donors and board members accused of <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/871887/protesters-hit-moma-again-demanding-museum-drop-board-chair-marie-josee-kravis/\">extractivism</a> and <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/521733/moma-private-prison-open-letter/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20denounce%20MoMA\"s%20connections%20to%20mass%20incarceration%2C,letter%20reads.%20%E2%80%9CStopping%20the%20global%20cycles%20of\">profiting off the military-industrial complex</a>.</p>\n    <p>And isn’t it an interesting coincidence that 1939, the year Picasso made “Night Fishing at Antibes,” is also the year he loaned “Guernica” (1937), his most famous anti-war painting, to MoMA for safekeeping after the outbreak of the war in Europe? Such is history, a turning wheel of irony. The people collecting and safeguarding the anti-war art are often the same ones selling the bombs.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/image00001-1200x900.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>PING</i>! As I stood blocking escalator traffic while contemplating these entanglements, a notification on my phone screen announced that the United States, 80 years after the atomic end of World War II, had <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-orders-nuclear-submarines-moved-after-russian-provocative-statements-2025-08-02/\">positioned nuclear submarines close to Russia</a>.</p>\n    <p>Outside the museum, an August sun flagellated the asphalt roads, concrete pavements, and skyscrapers of Midtown Manhattan. It was a vengeful, punishing sun. A jingoistic sun that wants you to go the hell back to where you came from. Nevertheless, the streets teemed with people shopping, sightseeing, and licking ice cream — just going about their normal business.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>At first glance, the two Super 8 films that comprise <a href=\"https://ufuomaessi.com\">Ufuoma Essi’s</a> <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/5813\">exhibition</a> at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) seem to compete for attention. “Bodies In Dissent”<strong> </strong>(2021) juxtaposes the artist’s footage of a performer with archival film of a 1960s jazz concert and a dancer in a succinct six minutes. On the opposite side of the gallery, “Half Memory”<strong> </strong>(2024) coalesces three years of filming in the United Kingdom, United States, and France into an allusive, nonlinear 27 minutes. Soon, though, the two works come to complement each other, their dreamlike atmospheres opening onto shared themes of history and memory threaded through with the voices of Black artists and intellectuals. </p>\n    <p>In “Bodies In Dissent,” Essi’s scenes of artist Nambi Kiyira performing in a grassy green field are interspersed with black and white video of then-married jazz drummer Max Roach and singer Abbey Lincoln during a 1964 concert, and archival clips of dancer Loretta Abbott. Kiyira, wearing a long black dress, is seen alternately from afar and up close, backed by audio from the concert.</p>\n    <p>“Half Memory” takes Toni Morrison’s essay “The Site of Memory” (1986) and her concept of “rememory” — repressed memories returning via a living force — as a jumping-off point for an exploration of individual and collective memory and history. In it, grainy imagery of public places like cities and beaches — suggesting both anonymous found footage and surveillance videos — is layered with the words of Morrison and other Black feminist scholars.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Essi2-1200x883.jpg?resize=1200%2C883&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>Most online descriptions of Essi’s work, including her own artist statement, put forth a didactic portrait of the films (her website states that her art “revolves around Black feminist epistemology and the configuration of displaced histories”). These themes inhere in the references and connections she brings to light, but the films themselves are far more abstract and intuitive than academic and dry. The meditative pace and washed-out color palette of “Half Memory” reflect the ways that memories cohere, dissipate, and reemerge, while the pastoral setting of “Bodies In Dissent,” framing the performer’s elegant movements and form, renders the work lush and painterly.</p>\n    <p>The show’s location, in one of MoMA’s free ground-floor galleries, is a boon for art lovers who don’t have $30 to spend on a museum visit. Essi’s focus on music and landscape calls to mind some film works by Cauleen Smith (for instance, her 2017 ode to Alice Coltrane, “Pilgrim”). Smith’s more cinematic vision strikes a balance between abstraction and narrative that Essi’s works don’t quite achieve — and maybe weren’t meant to. But the artists are separated by a generation or more (Essi was born in 1995, three years before Smith released her feature film, <i>Drylongso</i>), and Essi’s aesthetic is still evolving. </p>\n    <p>Some contextualizing materials, such as archival texts or background on Roach and Lincoln’s activism through music, might have brought the show to another level. However, Essi’s great skill in these pieces lies in articulating her conceptual concerns through aesthetic and sensory means. “Half Memory” evokes the workings of memory and its relationship with official and repressed histories through its fluid montage, while “Bodies In Dissent” interweaves the past and present of Black arts and activism through music and the body. The effect is subtle, but it lingers.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Essi4-1200x894.jpg?resize=1200%2C894&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Essi5-1200x867.jpg?resize=1200%2C867&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Essi6-1200x919.jpg?resize=1200%2C919&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/K4A0765_PRESS-2000x1334-1-1200x800.jpeg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Projects: Ufuoma Essi</i>at The Museum of Modern Art, New York (photo Jonathan Dorado)</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/5813\">Ufuoma Essi</a> <i>continues at the Museum of Modern Art (11 West 53rd Street, Midtown, Manhattan) through October 13.

But hers are especially unique. The Tlingit artist, born and based in Juneau, Alaska, is trained in both Ravenstail and <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/985534/reviving-tsimshian-weaving-with-threads-of-community/\">Chilkat</a> weaving practices. She learned the art forms from her ancestors and elders, including her late mother, Clarissa Rizal — one of the last living apprentices of Master Chilkat <a href=\"https://www.arts.gov/honors/heritage/jennie-thlunaut\">Weaver Jennie Thlunaut</a> — and weaver Kay Field Parker. Hope’s Labubus are dressed in traditional Ravenstail regalia, woven robes, and headdresses made of Merino wool.</p>\n    <p>“They’re actually repurposed dance cuffs,” Hope told <i>Hyperallergic</i>, describing the process as “Indigenizing the Labubus.”</p>\n    <p>Hope planned to sell the regalia at the <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035211/dispatches-from-the-ever-evolving-santa-fe-indian-market-2025/\">Santa Fe Indian Market</a> during her recent trip to New Mexico, but after posting a Ravenstail Labubu on her Instagram on August 5, the clothes almost completely sold out within days. At the market, she gifted one to a tourist from Trinidad, who planned to give it to his father. “So the regalia has made its way down to the Caribbean,” she said. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/4R1B0280-1200x1419.jpg?resize=1200%2C1419&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Kathryn Bunn-Marcuse, curator of Northwest Native Art at Seattle’s Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture, also acquired two outfits via Facebook messenger, initially purchasing a Tlingit outfit beaded by Hope’s <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/yourauntiedee/\">Aunt Deanna</a>. Bunn-Marcuse was excited to add multiple artists to the collection; the second acquisition will be woven by Hope, contributing more mini Ravenstail attire “to represent the regalia that we love and share on the northwest coast of Alaska and Canada,” in the artist’s words.</p>\n    <p>Emphasis on <i>we</i>: For Hope, one of the most important components of her practice is sharing. She began teaching public weaving workshops in the early aughts with her mother. “I loved the community that was being built and expanded,” she said, “and the feeling of creating work that’s bigger than any one of us. Sitting in a quiet space alone — that’s a disservice to my weaving community, to my Native community. If I do that, the work is not serving its highest good.” Hope added online classes to her repertoire at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and now has Labubu regalia materials available for purchase on her website, in preparation for a public virtual course.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/jami-powell-osage-holding-doll-by-lily-hope-tlingit-credit-kaela-waldstein-1200x1799.jpg?resize=1200%2C1799&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Even if participants have no weaving experience, the kit “is a very beginner-accessible project,” Hope added. It includes a pre-drilled header bar, the initial band that spreads out a loom’s warp threads. “People who’ve never done this before can get to work right away. You can just snap the header bar on a basket or toilet paper roll.”</p>\n    <p>And the workshop is truly for everyone, Hope emphasized. “Ravenstail geometric weaving has been in the hands of many nations for 40 years,” the artist said, “so I don’t pause to share the knowledge with people of any nationality.”</p>\n    <p>To those who are curious: The kit doesn’t include Labubus themselves; any dolls that don’t become models are given to her children, who adore them. “My children help me unbox them,” Hope said. “For every six or 12 that I buy, they each get to keep one.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036741/the-indigenous-artist-making-dazzling-labubu-regalia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

New evidence now suggests that the damage was far less than initially feared and may not have warranted the harsh two-year sentence for Phoebe Plummer and the 20-month sentence for Anna Holland.</p>\n    <p>The two Just Stop Oil activists hurled soup at van Gogh’s 1888 painting “Sunflowers” in London’s National Gallery and then glued themselves to the wall, an act that made global headlines. The painting was protected by thick security glass, but social media reacted strongly to the protest that aimed to draw attention to the climate crisis.</p>\n    <p>A Freedom of Information request from <a href=\"https://novaramedia.com/2025/08/22/the-national-gallery-only-spent-150-retouching-van-gogh-frame-after-just-stop-oil-souping/\"> Novara Media</a> revealed that the museum’s head of framing, Peter Schade, estimated the cost of retouching the frame at £150 (~$203). According to the media outlet, the museum also spent around £250 (~$338) restoring the wall, plus £35 (~$47) for paint, totaling about £435 (~$588) for all damages. In September 2024, when reporting on the sentencing, the </p>\n    <p><i>BBC</i>said that the pair caused</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly7zy3d3exo\">£10,000 worth of damage to the gold-colored frame</a>of the glass-covered painting in what they characterized as an “attack,” but provided no evidence or</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>source for their estimate. The British public broadcaster added that the museum had purchased the frame in 1999 and that it was valued at £28,000.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Judge Christopher Hehir, who presided over the case, ruled that the value of the damage was irrelevant for the jury, thus preventing its members from hearing these figures. The activists were found guilty and received a combined three-and-a-half-year sentence. <i>Novara Media</i> inquired about a full restoration of the frame, but the museum reportedly declined to comment.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMAGE_JustStopOil_NationalGallery5_14102022-1200x874.png?resize=1200%2C874&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The judge, known for his harsh stance on climate activism, stated in his sentencing remarks, “It is not the value of the damage caused to the frame that is the most serious aspect of your offending … You came within the thickness of a pane of glass of irreparably damaging or even destroying this priceless treasure, and that must be reflected in the sentences I pass.”</p>\n    <p>Human rights lawyer <a href=\"https://juststopoil.org/2024/10/16/five-legal-missteps-in-judge-hehirs-sentencing-of-plummer-and-holland/\">Aabhinav Tyagi has written about five alleged legal missteps</a> in the sentencing of these eco-activists, and questions remain as to whether justice has actually been served. Pussy Riot member Nadya Tolokonnikova chimed in on the pages of the<i> </i><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/03/vincent-van-gogh-just-stop-oil-sentencing-nature-painter-protesters-soup-sunflowers\"> Guardian</a> shortly after the verdict, writing in the activist pair’s defense: “Nature was Van Gogh’s ultimate muse. He loved it, as do Phoebe and Anna. I believe he would have approved of Phoebe and Anna’s action — it belonging to the tradition of activists and artists defying norms to create a new, better world. In the case of Just Stop Oil, to save our one and only planet from destruction and protect the natural world that Van Gogh so loved.”</p>\n    <p>This case highlights the debate over what counts as peaceful protest versus violent crime. According to Tyagi, “Judge Hehir classified the activists’ actions as violent, equating throwing soup at a protected painting with physically assaulting a person. This characterization enabled the judge to disregard the protections for peaceful protest under the European Convention on Human Rights, bypassing Articles 10 and 11, which protect freedom of expression and assembly.”</p>\n    <p>As museum protests continue to draw attention, debates over protest rights and proportional sentences are likely to persist. One may argue that the cases of eco-protests at museums were the canary in the coal mine for the larger Gaza protests that have since followed, since many of the same issues outlined by Tyagi — including punishment based more on perceived risk than on actual harm and the proportionality of sentences — are more relevant than ever.</p>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i> reached out to the National Gallery for comment and has not yet heard back.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036809/why-did-eco-activists-get-years-in-prison-for-only-588-in-damages/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "author": "AventurOO Editorial",
    "body": "<p><i>Perfection</i>(2022), translated by Sophie Hughes and published by New York Review Books (image courtesy New York Review Books)</p>\n<p>I started reading Italian novelist Vincenzo Latronico’s <i>Perfection</i> (2022)<i> </i>splayed out languidly<i> </i>on the beach. Then I was sitting up, nerves ablaze, and then on the train, the world outside whizzing past unnoticed, and then in bed that night, my Kindle having temporarily usurped my iPhone, and then it was over. I felt abuzz, delirious, called out. Reading <i>Perfection </i>is as uncanny and disturbing as looking at your doppelganger. I’m not a Southern European emigré to Berlin, like the main characters, Anna and Tom. But I am a part of the art world of New York, and their East Berlin reads a lot to me like my Brooklyn and Lower East Side. Because, as Latronico himself points out, their neighborhood could “just as well have been New York — or anywhere in the world, for that matter.”</p>\n<p>Translated by Sophie Hughes and published in English earlier this year, <i>Perfection </i>is fundamentally about making meaning in a world where the real and digital, the local and global, have fused into one hybrid, monstrous, relentless thing. Latronico lampoons a specifically white-collar, self-styled cultural person with an art critic’s attention to detail, and perhaps the pettiness as well. Anna and Tom are graphic designers, and though they think of social media and the internet as a “constellation of distractions,” there is, in reality, no distinction between “the personal and the professional — between news stories and banter, project pitches and catchy pop hooks.” As the author puts it: “They would drift from one thing to the other, because one thing was the other.” But though Latronico delights in ridiculing his characters, he also recognizes them as hapless avatars of a globalized culture flattened by the internet. They live as though trapped in a screen, seemingly unable to really touch or taste the world as their lives unfold like the images they consume.</p>\n<p>The Berlin art scene, as experienced by Anna and Tom, is as surface-level as those images. It’s just another part of their protracted going-out routine that begins on Saturday morning and runs into the following afternoon. “Table tennis in Arkonaplatz” or “bocce on Paul-Lincke-Ufer” blends easily with an “independent art space above a car wash in Friedrichshain,” a “basement gallery on Graefestraße.” Descriptions of these events will be familiar to anyone who frequents a gallery circuit anywhere in the world: little clusters of people huddled under the “neon glow” of a streetlamp, the “empties piled up around plastic beer crates on the pavement.” They have learned to “talk the talk,” Latronico writes, but they didn’t actually “get it.” They go to openings because art is the “pulse of their life in Berlin”; galleries, he writes, are both “a stage and a social hub.”</p>\n<p>It’s not just the art world that’s been razed to the level of abstraction in <i>Perfection</i>. It’s literally everything. It’s sex: “One of them would read a piece by a New York journalist about how she’d taught her boyfriend to use a double strap-on and then send the affiliate link to the other over Slack.” It’s history: Living in East Berlin, Anna and Tom can vaguely connect “place names and crucial events from the previous century … but really their awareness didn’t exceed a few anecdotes rattled off to make it look like their life there had more substance.” It’s political engagement: the <a href=\"https://www.unhcr.org/us/news/stories/2015-year-europes-refugee-crisis\">refugee crisis</a>, with its “image[s] of migrants crammed into dinghies beside grey military patrol boats,” becomes just another part of the “information landscape,” along with the “dusty yellow photos of wars in the Middle East, or the red and cobalt blue of the smoke grenades at G8 protests.” Real life collapses into RGB pixels. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036701/vincenzo-latronico-perfection-novel-is-the-art-world-black-mirror/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I’m satiated, I have energy and you’ve heard it before – <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/how-to-go-from-blonde-to-brunette/\">my hair is the healthiest</a> it’s ever been.</p>\n<p>Anyway, to get everything all in one place for you, here is my entire day of food and supplements.</p>\n<h2>What I Eat In A Day and My Bowl of Meat:</h2>\n<p>+ As soon as I wake up I remove my <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/the-skinny-confidential-mouth-tape-is-here-for-your-deepest-beauty-sleep-ever/\">mouth tape</a> then I <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/bye-bye-bad-breath-everyone-tongue-scraper/\">scrape my tongue</a> (my fave is <a href=\"https://wellnesse.com/products/coppertonguescraper?oid=20&amp;affid=174\">this one</a> by Wellnesse). You should do this before consuming anything so you don’t swallow the bacteria that grows in your mouth overnight. Then it’s right into hydrating with tons of water that I keep right beside my bed.</p>\n<p>+ Once I’m downstairs I’ll take <a href=\"https://justthrivehealth.com/discount/Skinny\">Just Thrive probiotics</a>, because they’re one of the only ones that actually survives the trip to your gut. And I’ll also do a water with fresh lemon juice, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3wsZhk1\">unflavored electrolytes</a> or <a href=\"https://www.gopjn.com/t/8-12762-307361-261816\">Kroma’s Cranberry Hydration Elixir</a>, depuffing drops (sold out but get <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4bZFQQ2\">the debloat pills</a>), <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3uNke8H\">apple cider vinegar</a>, <a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1818040&amp;u=3239803&amp;m=113313&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=\">Quinton minerals</a>, and <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3I9Jed9\">colostrum</a> (listen to <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/the-skinny-confidential-him-her-podcast/id1093028505?i=1000628218024\">this episode</a> to learn more).</p>\n<p>The tumblers I like for water concoctions right now are these <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3UQDP2c\">glass ones</a> and the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3uJwbw2\">Simple Modern 40oz</a> ones.</p>\n<p>+ After the kids have breakfast, Townes and I go for our circadian walk. When we get home I’ll have an <a href=\"https://www.owlvenice.com\">Owl Venice bone broth</a> with lemon, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3wsktGJ\">turmeric</a> and <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3UKC3Qm\">Celtic salt</a>.</p>\n<p>+ Approximately 90 minutes after waking up I’ll do an iced coffee with raw milk. So many coffee beans contain mold and chemicals so I like <a href=\"https://getkion.com/collections/see-all?utm_source=theskinnyconfidential&amp;utm_medium=grin&amp;platform=grin&amp;link_id=901932&amp;token=I1ig1VYsapR97bn3xXrjICbxDaWf3izF&amp;contact_id=f8f17aef-04fa-4673-8770-b9356d52d2e9&amp;attribution_window=30\">Kion</a> the best. Huberman says “you need to let some adenosine fix itself on receptors before you consume coffee.” You can get raw milk from the Farmer’s Market but do your own research. Most days I add the coffee alkalizer by <a href=\"http://www.getoffyouracid.com/?afmc=2c&amp;utm_campaign=2c&amp;utm_source=leaddyno&amp;utm_medium=affiliate\">Get Off Your Acid</a> (use code SKINNY for 20% off your first purchase and get the strawberry kiwi minerals too).</p>\n<p>Michael and I think it’s the perfect pre-workout drink because it gives you a bit of protein, carbs, and fat, plus amino acids, antimicrobials, vitamins and minerals. Oh, and an iced coffee is best served with nugget ice. <a href=\"https://bit.ly/48s8DJY\">This is the machine</a> I recently bought and I fully recommend it along with this white <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3SON2Wb\">W&amp;P Porter tumbler</a>.</p>\n<p>+ Around 9:30/10 I head to the gym to <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/my-trainer-brent-hruska-on-micro-dosing-lowering-cortisol-how-yoga-changed-his-life/\">lift weights</a> with yet another drink concoction. Creatine is the most studied supplement in the world and it helps increase your performance and strength. <a href=\"https://www.livemomentous.com/skinny\">Momentous</a> is the one I use and I have 5 grams with a school of <a href=\"https://getkion.com/collections/see-all?utm_source=theskinnyconfidential&amp;utm_medium=grin&amp;platform=grin&amp;link_id=901932&amp;token=I1ig1VYsapR97bn3xXrjICbxDaWf3izF&amp;contact_id=f8f17aef-04fa-4673-8770-b9356d52d2e9&amp;attribution_window=30\">Kion mango amino acids</a>. And I’ll sip it during my workout.</p>\n<p>+ When I get home I’ll have a protein shake with <a href=\"https://bit.ly/48xiQoA\">Thorne fiber</a>. The protein I like right now is <a href=\"http://paleovalley.com/skinny\">Paleo Valley</a> vanilla. I do 2 scoops for 26 grams of protein and 1 scoop of fiber which is equal to 10 grams.</p>\n<p>+ After that I’ll have 3 poached or scrambled <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3P27H86\">eggs</a> with a bit of <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3SZUVs7\">Primal Kitchen ketchup</a> and a slice of sourdough with <a href=\"https://bit.ly/49wWVir\">grassfed butter.</a> Katie has been <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/sourdough-for-beginners/\">making sourdough</a> for me, but I also <a href=\"https://www.idevaffiliate.com/33359/idevaffiliate.php?id=248\">love this one</a>.</p>\n<p>+ For lunch and/or dinner I have a big bowl of meat. I take Force of Nature <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3wztSMC\">ground beef</a> or <a href=\"https://bit.ly/42ZAO1W\">venison</a>. Cook it up and then top it with <a href=\"https://bit.ly/48zxWtq\">Yellowbird hot sauce</a>, raw cheese, and <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3wBVFft\">Siete chips</a>. For snacks, I like venison meat sticks by <a href=\"https://mauinuivenison.com/?gclid=CjwKCAiAx_GqBhBQEiwAlDNAZq887S-BqJr52yUksAddPOmvATB91VtKIQ1oYVvH-OU6DMeMjdTP_RoClc8QAvD_BwE\">Maui Nui</a>, but <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3uH2BaF\">Chomps</a> and <a href=\"https://bit.ly/42UQlQs\">Paleo Valley</a> have delicious clean ones too. I shared my <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/paleovalley-beef-stick-review/\">Paleovalley Beef Stick Review</a> here.</p>\n<p>+ In the afternoon I’ll have a protein matcha with <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3SWuIun\">almond milk</a>. <a href=\"https://www.gopjn.com/t/8-12762-307361-261816\">Kroma’s matcha</a> has 10 grams of protein and is ceremonial grade. Matcha is such a good coffee replacement if you’re looking to cut down on caffeine.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/what-i-eat-in-a-day/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>You may know by now that mouth taping has been the most life-changing practice in Lauryn’s life. It’s changed her entire face, increased her energy levels and brightened her eyes.</p>\n<p>The benefits speak for themselves, but let us remind you, consistency is key.</p>\n<p>Over the years Lauryn’s developed some tips and tricks, of course, and today we’re sharing them all with you to enhance your experience and maximize your results.</p>\n<h2>Lauryn’s Mouth Tape Tips: Maximize Your Results</h2>\n<h3>\n      <strong>LIFT YOUR FACE</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>As I’m applying <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/mouth-tape?selling_plan=4150198365\">mouth tape</a>, I pull my face up instead of down. It helps my tongue rest in a proper position and also lifts my entire face.</p>\n<h3>\n      <strong>REMOVE WITH MIST</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>When removing your mouth tape, use a mist to ensure it comes off gently and doesn’t pull at your skin. I love <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3B1xbOK\">Primally Pure’s Plumping Mist</a> or <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/ice-queen-face-oil?selling_plan=4027154525\">Depuffing Oil</a> to make it super easy.</p>\n<h3>\n      <strong>REUSE YOUR TIN</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>You can find mouth tape tins all over my house, in all my bags, in my bathroom and on my nightstand. I use them for lip gloss, prenatal vitamins, throat coat drops when I’m recording – for everything.</p>\n<h3>\n      <strong>WEAR YOUR RETAINER</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>If you use a retainer or mouth guard, you can still use them while you wear mouth tape. I wear my mouth guard every night and wake up feeling energized and refreshed.</p>\n<h3>\n      <strong>USE THE SLIT, OR DON’T</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>We designed mouth tape with optionality. You can use the slit if you like to sip water through the night, or pull it up over your top lip if you don’t need it.</p>\n<h3>Benefits of Mouth Taping:</h3>\n<p>Breathing through your nose can help you establish a stable breathing pattern, which can help you fall asleep faster, stay asleep longer, have a deeper sleep, AND wake up feeling more refreshed.</p>\n<p>All those little hairs in your nasal passages serve a purpose. And that purpose is to prevent the introduction of viruses, bacteria, &amp; other gross things into the body. Mouth breathing while sleeping makes it so much easier for these yucky things to enter the body. But, the good news is your nose was literally MADE to be one of the body’s first lines of defense from any &amp; all sickness.</p>\n<p>Mouth breathing at night is one of the most common causes of nasal congestion &amp; that annoying sound we call snoring. Not only can snoring disrupt your breathing pattern throughout the night, it can also really annoy your SO.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.sleepfoundation.org/snoring/mouth-taping-for-sleep\">Sleep Foundation</a>, mouth taping for sleep changes the angle of your palate &amp; tongue, and thus, mouth taping reduces snoring. No snoring = better sleep = better LIFE! (P.S. another super handy hack to prevent snoring is <a href=\"https://getcanopy.co/products/tsc-humidifier\"> The Skinny Confidential x Canopy Humidifier</a>.)</p>\n<p>Ok, guys. This one gets a little gross…but we’re gonna go there anyway. When you breathe through your mouth at night, it can cause dry mouth, bad breath, cavities, yellow teeth, gum disease, &amp; tooth decay. It can also introduce yucky bacteria &amp; viruses to your oral microbiome and long story short…it’s NOT GOOD for your <a href=\"https://www.colgate.com/en-us/oral-health/respiratory-conditions/mouth-taping-for-sleep\">oral health</a>. You will see an instant increase in oral health by mouth taping at night. For more on oral health you have to check out <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/how-to-heal-your-oral-microbiome/\">this post</a>, there are so many good tips.</p>\n<p>Sleep disorders &amp; major disruptions in breathing throughout the night can have some seriously negative health effects. These effects can include stroke, heart attack, high blood-pressure, &amp; other cardiovascular issues. Mouth taping will help you regulate your breathing, which will help prevent spikes in blood pressure &amp; adrenaline.</p>\n<p>Nitric oxide is produced in the nostrils of all humans. So, when we inhale through the nose, the nitric oxide goes all the way through the airways &amp; deep into the lungs. This promotes everything from relaxation to expansion of blood vessels to the destruction of some bacteria &amp; viruses.</p>\n<p>Have you tried mouth taping? What is the number one benefit you noticed and how long did it take to see it?</p>\n<p>x, Lauryn and The Skinny Confidential team</p>\n<p>+ <i>Give yourself a  total mouth makeover.</i></p>\n<p>++ <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/mouth-taping-tips-for-beginners/\">Mouth Taping tips</a> for beginners.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/lauryns-mouth-tape-tips-maximize-your-results/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Summer is here and with it comes the opportunity to get outside, enjoy the hot weather, and even do some traveling. It’s SO good for you to spend time outside and ground yourself in nature. And, summer is the perfect time to do just that.</p>\n<p>But, summer has its drawbacks, of course. The intense heat is no joke. Plus, the hot weather can also cause you to develop swollen feet and ankles. We’d rather pass on that aspect.</p>\n<p>That’s why today, we’re sharing a guide on how to stop feet from swelling in hot weather. There are lots of things we want to do this summer, so there’s no time for swollen feet. Today, we’re going to talk about why it happens and how to prevent it.</p>\n<h2>How To Stop Feet Swelling In Hot Weather</h2>\n<p>We’re here to help you out if you suffer from ankle and foot swelling in the summer months. First, we’ll dive into what causes the swelling in warm weather so that we can better understand what’s going on how to stop it. Then, we’ll get into our tips and tricks for stopping the swell!</p>\n<h3>Is It Normal For Feet To Swell In Hot Weather?</h3>\n<p>Yes, it’s totally normal for feet to swell in hot weather. Of course, if it’s happening all the time, you should definitely talk to your doctor. Some swelling is normal, while other swelling can come from health conditions that affect blood circulation, like venous insufficiency or kidney disease. In some cases, swelling especially if it’s sudden, painful, or only in one leg can be a sign of a blood clot, which requires prompt medical attention.</p>\n<p>But, in general, it’s actually not surprising at all that feet swell in the heat, as it can be caused by our bodies’ cooling mechanisms. Let’s dive into what that looks like.</p>\n<h3>What Causes Feet To Swell In Hot Weather</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thefeetpeople.com.au/learning-hub/why-do-my-feet-swell-in-the-heat/#:~:text=Unfortunately%2C%20this%20expansion%20can%20also,baths%2C%20can%20worsen%20the%20swelling.\">When your body needs to cool off, it naturally expands your blood vessels</a> (aka <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557562/\">vasodilation</a>). The reason this works is that the blood vessels then allow more blood to flow closely to the skin, helping the heat transfer out of your body. </p>\n<p>This mechanism can cause more fluid to leak into the surrounding tissues. But why does it end up in your feet and ankles?</p>\n<p>Gravity is what pulls the fluid down to your feet and ankles. You’ll find that this is even worse when you’ve spent a long time sitting or standing. In hot weather, the way your body moves fluid back up to your heart slows down. This is when feet tend to swell.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320603#definition\">Dehydration can alert your body to retain fluid because it’s expecting a period of drought, with little to no water</a>. This will cause more fluid buildup in your tissues. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://myhealth.alberta.ca/Health/pages/conditions.aspx?hwid=not245134&amp;lang=en-ca#:~:text=The%20balance%20of%20salt%20in,conditions%20that%20affect%20their%20circulation.\">Increased salt levels can cause the body to hold onto more fluid</a>, which will be drawn by gravity towards your feet.</p>\n<h3>How To Stop Feet From Swelling In Hot Weather</h3>\n<p>By now, you’ve gotta know how important it is to stay hydrated. Even though it may seem contradictory, increasing your water intake actually helps reduce fluid retention.</p>\n<p>Lauryn is all about upgrading your water so that it boosts your hydration levels even more. You can do this so efficiently with <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/beauty-salt\">Beauty Salt</a>. It’s a quick scoop of powder to add to your water, and it hydrates you from inside out (with beauty benefits). </p>\n<p>Long periods of sitting or standing can be a serious contributor to feet, ankle, and leg swelling. Just think about it like this: when you move, you’re helping your heart pump blood and fluid through your system more efficiently. This can reduce the buildup of fluid occurring at your feet.</p>\n<p>If you’ve been dealing with a lot of swelling, you may need to look at the amount of salt in your diet. The right salt level is different for everyone, and too much can cause your body to retain water, making swelling worse. So, if you’ve been having a lot of salty snacks, try minimizing your salt intake and see if that helps.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/how-to-stop-feet-swelling-in-hot-weather/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I've regretted not standing up to her ever since.</h3>\n    <p><i>Last week, over at Narratively Academy, we</i> <i>hosted a live video chat between two literary legends, Lee Gutkind and Dinty W. Moore, breaking down what (the heck) a flash essay is ( check it out here if you missed it). Following the insightful and inspiring talk, we ran a special flash essay contest with the assignment to write about a moment you regret. We got so many great submissions that, as always, it was hard to choose a winner. But one, from writer Jen Shepherd, really stood out, and we’re pleased to share that piece with you today.</i> </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>We hope you love it as much as we do!</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>“Now that he’s become unresponsive, it won’t be long. Maybe 24 hours,” the hospice nurse explained. I expected to be by his side when he died. We’d spent our entire lives knowing each other. He was there when I was 16 after the head-on collision resulted in that nasty concussion. I was there for him after he burned both hands making homemade fudge, his favorite Christmas tradition. When I had chicken pox, didn’t make the volleyball team, and had my heart broken more than once, it was his shoulder I cried on. When he had no one else to lean on, the world went dark and he turned to the bottle or the drugs, it was my turn to listen.</p>\n    <p>My first marriage was a fail. His second marriage was a fail, although none of us would say it out loud. My relationship with my father was unique. Our closeness had always been envied by my friends, by most people really. It was not, however, envied by Wife Number Two. I sensed she disliked me from the start, that she was jealous. But this was never discussed in our family, though it was always the elephant in the room. The poor man was stuck in the middle, forever navigating the icy waters between the two of us. “Why can’t everyone just love each other?” he’d ask. But I couldn’t love someone who pulled him away from me. Who went out of her way to keep him all to herself like a special secret.</p>\n    <p>I wanted to stay at the house. I wanted to sleep on the couch, on a chair, on the floor, in my car. As long as I could be there. Holding his hand. Watching him take that last precious breath of life. But she said no. And I didn’t argue. I didn’t stand up for myself. I let her call the shots. I was weak. Scared. She scared me with her large stature, head of frizzy gray hair and those dark brown eyes forever boring into mine. “No,” she said. So I kissed him goodbye and walked out the front door. In the driveway, I glanced up at his bedroom window, glowing yellow from a single pale bulb. I knew in my heart I was making a mistake. I should have stomped right up those concrete stairs, threw open that damn door and announced without hesitation, “I’m back and I’m staying. And I don’t give a damn what you think.”</p>\n    <p>But I missed it. He died the next morning, just as the pink-tangerine sun streaked across the bay. I was walking the dogs along the shore. It was 7 a.m. I knew the moment it happened. I felt the energy surge from my feet through my head like a weird out-of-body experience. I should have been there.</p>\n    <p>I should have been there.</p>\n    <p>But I wasn’t.</p>\n    <p><strong>Jen Shepherd</strong> is a lifelong photographer and writer. Her work has appeared in The Rumpus and Autism Parenting Magazine. She was shortlisted for Fractured Lit’s 2025 Anthology Prize and was awarded sixth place in the 2024 Writer’s Digest Personal Essay Awards.

    "body": "<h3>Sixteen years after going to prison, Kwaneta Harris tells her 13-year-old self everything she wished she knew sooner.</h3>\n<p>Dear Kwaneta,</p>\n<p>Growing up, attending an all-white Catholic school with two other Black girls, Brooke and Amy, makes you really hate having your name. But guess what? You won’t always. You, Ms. People Pleaser, will demand your name not be shortened or mispronounced. How can I be so sure? I’m you, at 52.</p>\n<p>You don’t believe me? Of course not. You stopped believing everything and everyone at age 12. Now, you’re 13 and addicted to sexual self-destruction. You’re still suspicious? Allow me to convince you with our deepest secret: At age 12, you were kidnapped and gang-raped for three days.</p>\n<p>This was 1984, and the police refused to search for a Black girl. So, the community did. Your family, friends, church and the neighborhood organized search teams and canvassed door to door, checking garbage dumpsters, abandoned houses and cars. Finally, they rescued you.</p>\n<p>Mom was almost arrested after the Catholic hospital nurses implied that because of the assault and subsequent S.T.D.s, you were promiscuous. They wanted to perform surgery, but Mom didn’t trust them to cut your toenails, let alone your body parts. You just went home.</p>\n<p>That first night, you overheard your Southern Baptist grandfather and great-uncle despairing: “When they found her, she ain’t look like she was even trying to get away. Probably was her boyfriend...runaway. If she start actin’ like her crazy daddy, she going to a home.”</p>\n<p>After hearing that, you spent every day pretending. Pretending to be normal. You laughed and joked. You studied your peers to mimic their behavior. In 1984, nobody understood the trauma of childhood sexual violence. That you don’t just “get over it.” This is how trauma works: Every new encounter or event is always contaminated by the past.</p>\n<p>You wore your Sunday best and carried your scrapbook stuffed with honor awards and report cards. You were walking stiff, still recovering from the surgeries. Mom made you take a second shower with instructions not to apply Jean Naté perfumed talc after. She combed your hair in two braids, removed the nail polish and wiped off the Bonne Bell lip gloss. All this for an appointment with police detectives. Granny kept saying to show them your grades. You were afraid of those two burly detectives grilling you, under the pretense of playing devil’s advocate, about boy crushes, menstruation and sex. You never actually opened the scrapbook. Because of those bullies, you end up carrying a lifetime of distrust for law enforcement.</p>\n<p>In school, everybody knew about the assault. But your nonchalance gave them — and law enforcement — permission to see you as the trope of the “hypersexual Black girl.” You played into the myth.</p>\n<p>In gym class, boys you’d played floor hockey and soccer with since third grade pulled you into the sports equipment closet to grope you…and more. The girls called you a slut, but the boys called you cool. The only people willing to hang out with you were the boys who never asked, just took — sharing you with older brothers while coaches looked the other way.</p>\n<p>Eventually, you will learn about adultification of Black girls and the high standards to be deemed a credible “victim.” Still replaying that scene with detectives and regretting not opening your scrapbook? Girl, let that go. It wouldn’t have made a difference.</p>\n<p>The heavy mask and shame you carry from those early years will push you to remain in two abusive marriages longer than you should, believing that if you were quieter and more obedient, these men would change. If you could just stop provoking them. Listen, you can only change yourself. Forget what you learned in Catholic Mass and Baptist Sunday School about women’s roles — your value isn’t determined by a man. All the years of playing pretend will catch up with you, and the next time a man harms you, you will finally stick up for yourself. This act of self-preservation will lead you to prison.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/letter-to-my-teenage-self-saved-power-words\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Over </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-parade-turnout-protest-no-kings-millions-1235365602/\">5 million turned out</a>to support the “</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1020681/photos-capture-millions-marching-in-epic-no-kings-protests/\">No Kings</a>” marches across the country on June 14 to protest Trump’s policies and a “military parade” on his birthday, budgeted at</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://au.news.yahoo.com/army-reveals-scale-damage-done-130929092.html\">$45 million</a>. But where can we turn to for resistance strategies? Might the historical rise of authoritarianism in the ancient world help us understand its rapid expansion today? A freely downloadable book by top ancient historians across the globe,</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783111705446/html\">(De Gruyter, 2025),</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>argues that it can.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>In the new anthology, edited by Frederik Juliaan Vervaet, David Rafferty, and Christopher J. Dart, the authors collectively claim that readers can use Ancient Roman history to make sense of the rapid descent into fascism in the United States. A key reason for choosing Rome as a parallel to America is the extraordinary nature of the moment we are living in.</p>\n<p>“Before now, no long-established democracy has fallen to internal causes except Rome,” the editors told <i>Hyperallergic</i> in a statement. “Several of the old, consolidated democracies around the world are in trouble, and political science has only recently started to confront that as a problem; they are used to thinking of consolidated democracies as pretty safe.” </p>\n<p>The book treats the late Roman Republic as a dataset. Although the editors noted that Rome did not have the same scope in terms of policing, healthcare, or inflation controls, they explained that democratic decay or creeping authoritarianism is primarily about “interactions of political institutions, about the relative power of the different parts of the state.” While comparisons between Rome and America are nothing new, <i>How Republics Die </i>analyzes these empires’ parallel lives to underscore the consistent methods used by autocrats to shift societies away from dissent, democracy, or independent thinking, toward a triumphalist narrative of the past that culminates in their own ascent. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.walksinrome.com/blog/maps-and-mussolini-via-dei-fori-imperiali-rome\">four large maps</a>that showed Rome’s ascent and empire from 753 BCE to 117 CE, along with a new map of Italy’s future conquest of Africa in 1936, which had to be removed because the campaign was a failure. This image is from 1935. (image public domain via the</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/maps/2022/03/out-and-about-in-a-provincial-empire-of-fascism/\">Library of Congress</a>)</p>\n<p>Although the United States became a “<a href=\"https://www.colonialwilliamsburg.org/discover/civics/was-the-united-states-founded-as-a-republic-or-a-democracy/\">mixed government</a>” predicated on republican and democratic models of governance, Rome adopted a republican model in 509 BCE. This came in the wake of the overthrow of the city’s last king. Four centuries after Rome’s Republic began, the underpinnings of the state and the explicit policies that limited the power of ambitious politicians began to erode rapidly. The book looks particularly at this period from the end of the Roman Republic to the rise of the Augustan New Order (133 BCE to 14 CE) — a time when Rome began to transition from an electoral republic to a military monarchy. Vervaet, Rafferty, and Dart told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that the decades marking Rome’s shift from a republic into an autocracy were heavily influenced by the arts. They also suggest how we might cross-compare Ancient Rome and America with other moments of rising authoritarianism around the world, such as in India and Belarus.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037152/an-ancient-roman-guide-to-donald-trump-authoritarian-playbook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>OTTAWA — I first encountered multidisciplinary artist Skawennati in person at her December 2019 talk at the former McLuhan Centre for Communication and Technology in Toronto. I recall that the artist wore Barbie-doll pink; I later learned that she is a Barbie fan.</p>\n<p>At the talk, Skawennati introduced herself as both an urban Kanien’kehá:ka (Mohawk) woman and a cyberpunk avatar. She discussed her longtime practice of costuming avatars in cyberspace as a means of realizing Indigenous peoples’ self-determination. This work takes place on a thriving, futuristic island built and maintained by the research-creation studio, Aboriginal Territories in Cyberspace (AbTeC), in the virtual world, Second Life. Later, she shared work-in-progress documentation for the project <i>Calico &amp; Camouflage</i> (2020–22), a fashion line of Turtle Island “resistance wear” — her interpretation of traditional ribbon shirts and combat pants as Kanien’kehá:ka protest gear — for both avatars and IRL models. </p>\n<p>At the time, I was taken by Skawennati’s commitment to working within a massive multiplayer virtual world that was, in my view, a ghost town. She was adamant that if the platform were to “sunset,” she would stop making her avatars: “In the end, I know it’s not mine,” she shared with me in a 2020 interview for <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-in-america/features/skawennati-abtec-island-indigenous-community-second-life-1202693110/\">an  Art in America profile</a>. The Montreal-based artist utilizes these characters, as well as settings and backdrops she has built and designed in AbTeC, for her machinimas and machinimagraphs — films and photography produced within virtual worlds. “That’s why I take lots of pictures, lots of documentation. As long as you know you’re not actually in control, you have a lot of control.” </p>\n<p><i>Skawennati: Welcome to the Dreahouse</i>at the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa. Foreground: the diptych “Dancing with Myself” (2015); background: “Birth of an Avatar (Homage to Mariko Mori)” (2017)</p>\n<p>Yet, as her current National Gallery of Canada (NGC) mid-career survey <i> Skawennati: Welcome to the Dreamhouse</i> proves, the trajectory of the past 25 years of her work lies not only in these machinimas and machinimagraphs, but also in her burgeoning work with fashion. The </p>\n<p><i>Calico &amp; Camouflage</i>collection was part of a turn in her understanding of the virtual as increasingly hybrid performative experiences involving garment-based sculptures and textiles. Within the NGC exhibition catalog, contributors Cheryl Sim and Mojeanne Sarah Behzadi make the case for how formative Skawennati’s engagement with fashion has been to her work overall. As exhibition curator Wahsontiio Cross, of the NGC, writes in the accompanying catalog, her creation of fashion and textiles has resulted in the artist finally “bring[ing] her idea of the future into the present.”</p>\n<p>The exhibition design for <i>Welcome to the Dreamhouse</i>, in which each room is perfectly structured for its intended purpose, is reminiscent of the Barbie Dreamhouse, aligning Skawennati’s multidisciplinary works with open-ended play. However, the artist clarified in conversation with <i>Hyperallergic</i> that she and Cross were drawn toward the “dreamhouse” concept for its aspirational potential. “A dreamhouse feels attainable. It might take work, but people think they can achieve it. I wanted to say with this show, this concept, this title, that a peaceful and just future is attainable.”</p>\n<p>Among the longstanding themes that carry through the show, a core motif is Indigenous futurism, wherein the pain of the colonial past is worked through a “future imaginary.” The term, coined by Skawennati’s partner and frequent collaborator, Jason Edward Lewis, reclaims historical narratives and centers Indigenous peoples in “exploring new cultural configurations that will enable us not just to survive, but thrive.”</p>\n<p>Across different galleries, visitors encounter new and old characters from the artist’s moving and still image works. Many involve Indigenous sci-fi retellings of Hotinonshón:ni cosmology and histories, ranging from the creation story told in “She Falls For Ages” (2017) to the ancestral narrative of the Iroquois confederation, updated to the year 3025, in “The Peacemaker Returns” (2017).</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036805/skawennati-cyberpunk-future-is-now-national-gallery-canada/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

According to Joslin, Temporary Deputy Superintendent Ray McPadden of the National Park Service (NPS) told them that they had “[failed] to demonstrate acceptable conduct” after they hung the Trans Pride flag on the face of the granite monolith El Capitan.</p>\n    <p>“The messages my termination send out to the public is that if you have an identity that has been turned into a ‘ideology’ not in line with the current administration, your rights will be different than other Americans that fall into the ‘ideal standard’ for who and what a person should be, look like, and believe in,” Joslin told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. </p>\n    <p>An NPS spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic </i>in a statement that the agency is “pursuing administrative action against multiple employees for failing to follow National Park Service regulations.” They declined to comment on the specifics of Joslin’s case.</p>\n    <p>“We want to emphasize that we take the protection of the park’s resources and the experience of our visitors very seriously, and will not tolerate violations of laws and regulations that impact those resources and experiences,” the spokesperson said, alleging that “several unauthorized demonstrations involving El Capitan” last year had drawn complaints from visitors.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/sj-with-flag-1-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Joslin stated that they displayed the flag for about two hours on May 20 during their off-duty hours, and noted that Yosemite regulations did not ban the hanging of flags at the time. The following day, however, the NPS appears to have updated the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/management/upload/yose-compendium.pdf\">park’s rules</a> to prohibit the display of “any banner, flag, or sign larger than fifteen square feet” on any natural or cultural features without a permit, citing the need to “provide for an unimpaired visitor experience” and “protect natural and cultural resources.”</p>\n    <p>While the new version of the compendium with the ban is dated May 20, the signature from the park’s acting superintendent, Raymond McPadden, is dated May 21, 2025. Previous versions of the compendium, accessed by <i>Hyperallergic</i> via the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250227002244/https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/management/upload/yose-compendium.pdf\">Wayback Machine,</a> did not mention flags or banners. </p>\n    <p>Hanging flags on the famous vertical wall of El Capitan is a tradition that many climbers have long participated in. In February, park employees <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/us/yosemite-upside-down-flag-protest.html\">flew an inverted United States flag over the side of the monolith’s cliff</a> to protest the Trump administration’s cuts to the National Park Service. Last June, climbers hung a banner that read “Stop the Genocide” to decry the US-backed Israeli military’s assault on Palestine.</p>\n    <p>The NPS’s termination of Joslin’s employment comes amid the Trump administration’s ongoing attacks on LGBTQ+ rights and visibility. In February, the national parks agency <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/990547/trans-rights-groups-protest-scrubbed-stonewall-monument-website/\">expunged all references to trans and queer people</a> from its website describing the 1969 Stonewall Rebellion. The erasure then <a href=\"https://www.them.us/story/stonewall-bisexuals\">extended to mentions of bisexual people</a> in May.</p>\n    <p>“In my celebration of identity and acceptance, I’ve been disparaged and deemed unacceptable,” Joslin told <i>Hyperallergic.</i> “It’s a tragic juxtaposition of how to treat human beings.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036200/us-parks-agency-fires-ranger-who-displayed-trans-pride-flag-yosemite/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Colorado, the suit claimed that the town had violated the artist’s constitutional right to free speech. </p>\n    <p>In last week’s settlement, Vail agreed to several concessions, including funding an art program “for underrepresented and economically disadvantaged people” and hosting a powwow led by SeeWalker every year for the next five years.</p>\n    <p>“The intention is to allow other underrepresented artists, including Native American people, to have the opportunity of creating art in the town of Vail in place of my own missed opportunity,” SeeWalker said in a statement.</p>\n    <p>The settlement also included Vail’s commitment to sponsor a “community forum” on Israel and Palestine that would include interfaith leaders and host an annual Indigenous-led cultural sensitivity training for employees of the municipality’s Arts and Public Places Department.</p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for the town of Vail did not respond to <i>Hyperallergic</i>‘s<i> </i>inquiries about when or how it would implement the terms of the settlement.

Months later, however, the town of Vail rescinded the opportunity after she posted an image of a pro-Palestine artwork on her Instagram that she said was unrelated to her public commission. In a public <a href=\"https://www.vail.gov/Home/Components/News/News/1509/15\">statement</a>, the town said it removed SeeWalker from the project because it would “not use public funds to support any position on a polarizing geopolitical issue.” </p>\n    <p>The painting “G for Genocide,” however, was created on SeeWalker’s own time and had not been submitted as her design for the public mural. She told <i>Hyperallergic </i>in an earlier <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/959839/aclu-sues-colorado-town-over-cancellation-of-native-artists-residency/\">interview</a> that she created the work after observing common threads between Israel’s assault on Gaza and the history of Native Americans in the United States. The artwork was included in a December 2024 <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/972948/things-not-seen/\">collaboration</a> between <i>Hyperallergic</i> and <i>Jewish Currents </i>that highlighted artists who had been silenced or censored over their support of Palestine. </p>\n    <p>SeeWalker told <i>Hyperallergic </i>that settling with Vail was advantageous in that it allowed her to secure programming that other artists can benefit from, whereas a trial might only have yielded a financial result, if any. She said the settlement could have included additional terms she bargained for, but she intended to maximize community benefit over her own grievances.</p>\n    <p>“Even if one other person is impacted in a good way, that is enough for me,” SeeWalker said. “My dad once told me, ‘Danielle, if you don’t speak up, no one will do it for you.’ I carry that with me everywhere I go.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036790/colorado-town-settles-with-native-artist-danielle-seewalker-who-brought-free-speech-lawsuit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>I met someone mid-flight and we immediately hit it off. Rather than try to keep in touch, we imagined what our lives would have been like if we were together. It was almost as good.</h3>\n<p><i>We’ve been publishing  the winners of our True Romance Writing Prize collaboration with Belletrist and actress Emma Roberts these past few weeks. So far, we’ve shared the grand prize–winning essay in the shortread category, by Maggie Hart, and the longform winning story, by Olivia Shaffett. We’re elated to be bringing you the first shortread finalist this week, a banger of a piece from Katharine Coldiron. This is what Katharine had to say about how the piece came together: “This was the first piece I’d written on a prompt in years. I read the call for entries and thought immediately of this tale. I worked it through in the shower and put it down in a rush. I polished it a little, et voila.” A great reminder to follow a spark and go for it!</i> </p>\n<p>I was 19 or 20, a smoker, on a plane from New England to New Orleans. Next to me sat a man, around 19 or 20, a smoker. We looked at each other and liked what we saw; we talked to each other and liked what we heard; we, simply, hit it off.</p>\n<p>And not as friends. In that way that enlivens your whole body. Chemistry, pheromones, attraction. Whatever you call that, when the person is someone whose skin you badly want to touch from the first moments of meeting them.</p>\n<p>As we talked, we realized there was no way we’d ever meet again. I was visiting my mother for the summer in a place I would never live permanently. He was laying over in New Orleans on the way back to Wyoming or Oklahoma or North Texas, I don’t remember. I don’t even remember his name. I know he came from a place I’d never been and seemed unlikely to visit: a landlocked place. All my experiences had been coastal, due to my Navy father — I never lived anywhere you couldn’t park a 40,000-ton ship near.</p>\n<p>We told the truth. We made each other laugh.</p>\n<p>There was no social media then, and we both had precisely the quantity of life experience that advised us not to persist or pursue this connection. A little less and our romantic sides would have tried to build faith in a long-distance something; a little more and we would have recognized that such an instant, holistic connection is too rare to waste.</p>\n<p>Instead, we had the plane ride, and that was all.</p>\n<p>How will I remember you? I asked, or something less obvious that posed the same question.</p>\n<p>He dug in his pocket. I just bought this, he said. It was a rectangular Bic lighter with a picture of a cowboy on it, either at dusk or sunrise.</p>\n<p>I unzipped the front pocket of my backpack and pulled out an oval Bic lighter. It was a paisley design with a lot of purple in it. I’d chosen it because it was eye-catching and pretty without any pink.</p>\n<p>We traded.</p>\n<p>As we taxied, he said to me, I wish I could kiss you.</p>\n<p>Silence for a minute.</p>\n<p>Let’s pretend to be together, I said. As we’re getting off the plane, let’s pretend that we’re boyfriend and girlfriend. We’ll hold hands and talk about where to go for dinner. Then you’ll go to your gate and I’ll go to baggage claim.</p>\n<p>Yeah, he said.</p>\n<p>And you could kiss me then, I said. But not, like, really dramatically, like in the movies. Just like you do it all the time.</p>\n<p>He nodded.</p>\n<p>That was right. That was the right thing.</p>\n<p>I tried not to be sad.</p>\n<p>I still have that lighter. I find it in boxes of old stuff I go through from time to time, trying to discard what I no longer need. It’s been 15 years since I smoked, but I will not throw away that lighter.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/well-always-have-the-plane-ride\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He’s a husky guy, with sand-colored hair, who can down beer after beer without losing his faculties, a practice that gives him cred with this crowd. He caught eyes with an intoxicated skinhead, who stared at him suspiciously and then said to a friend next to him: “That’s the guy who wants to study us.”</p>\n    <h2>Keep reading with a 7-day free trial</h2>\n    <p>Subscribe to Narratively to keep reading this post and get 7 days of free access to the full post archives.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/secret-life-of-the-professor-who\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

There was just one thing she needed to figure out first.</h3>\n<p>\n      <i>It was such a joy to collaborate with Emma Roberts, Karah Preiss and the whole Belletrist team on the  True Romance Writing Prize this year. After announcing the winners a few weeks ago, we’re excited to finally share the first piece of the bunch, the grand prize–winning essay in the shortread category, which comes to us from Maggie Hart. Maggie opened up a bit about writing this piece and others like it: “After I completed my chemo treatments, I felt awkward and ugly in my baldness, convinced I’d never be able to exist normally again, much less date. But finding small moments of humor and lightness helped me get through. I think lots of people view serious illness as something that only happens later in life, which just isn’t true — so I like sharing my stories about navigating the weirdness of cancer survival and young adulthood all at once.” Congratulations again, Maggie! And readers — you’re in for a treat. </i>\n    </p>\n<p>“I’m sorry,” I said to Nick, who stood staring at me in the dim light, his bare chest rising and falling with quickened breaths, his lips swollen from my kissing them. “It’s just that…well, I’ve been really racking my brain here, and I just don’t think there’s a sexy way to do this.”</p>\n<p>My fingers lingered at my forehead, on my hairline. My wig gripped my scalp like a barnacle on a boat, the scratchy fibers relentlessly digging into my skin, one of many small, manageable pains I had in those days. It had to come off for what was about to happen, I knew that. There was really no way around it. Leaving it on was impossible — I had a profoundly humbling vision of the wig abandoning ship mid-action, slipping loose and tumbling onto the floor in a sad, sweaty heap. It had also been quite an investment — although I still do not understand why a bunch of fake hair costs multiple hundreds of dollars — so I didn’t want it to get hopelessly matted. And what if, in the throes of passion, he forgot that the hair was fake and tried to <i>pull it</i>…</p>\n<p>No. No! Obviously, it had to come off. But <i>how, </i>exactly? I wished he’d look away, spare me, if only partially, from the humiliation of my baldification, the world’s least seductive strip tease.</p>\n<p>Nick smiled at me encouragingly. He was kind and tattooed and had long dark hair that was beginning to streak with gray. I’d never been with a man who had hair longer than mine, although, that winter, any man with any hair at all had hair longer than mine.</p>\n<p>Four months after my last round of chemotherapy, I decided that it was time I put myself out there, that I date. Why not? The chemo had, miraculously, worked. My blood counts were relatively normal, I hadn’t needed a platelet transfusion in weeks and my oncologists gave me the all-clear, so it was time that I shifted my attention away from my no-longer-imminent death to something much more invigorating: the pursuit of reassurance. I needed to know that my body worked, that I still knew how to have a conversation that was not about being sick, that this whole cancer thing had not rendered me sexless and unlovable at just 25 years old. So, I went where every woman in her 20s goes when she needs reassurance: the apps.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/unexpected-challenges-dating-cancer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Hair care shelves are packed with big promises… and even bigger ingredient lists that often do more harm than good. We’re talking harsh chemicals, synthetic fragrances, and irritating additives your hair definitely doesn’t need.</p>\n<p>We believe nature knows best when it comes to beauty. Natural ingredients aren’t just safer and gentler on your hair, they <i>actually</i> work.</p>\n<p>Take rosemary oils, for example. It’s all-naturél and does wonders for your hair and scalp. Pair it with castor oil, a tried-and-true remedy that’s been used for generations on everything from skin to hair, and you’ve got a powerful combo for long, shiny locks.</p>\n<p>Today, we’re sharing a simple DIY natural hair treatment using both rosemary and castor oil. It’s easy to make at home and perfect for nourishing, strengthening, and encouraging thicker, healthier hair.</p>\n<h2>Castor Oil and Rosemary Oil for Hair Recipe</h2>\n<p>We’re <i>big</i> fans of castor oil, and for good reason. You can use <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/castor-oil-for-lymph-nodes/\">castor oil for lymph nodes</a>, to <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/how-to-make-eyebrows-thicker/\">make your brows thicker, fuller, and longer</a>, and, as an overnight detox—check out our post “<a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/discover-the-nighttime-benefits-of-castor-oil-patches/\">Benefits of Castor Oil Patches</a>” for more information on that.</p>\n<p>After realizing how powerful of an oil it is, we had to try it on our scalp and hair, too. And as we looked into the idea further, we found that rosemary oil pairs perfectly with castor oil to boost hair growth totally naturally.</p>\n<p>Here’s how you can make your own castor and rosemary oil hair treatment:</p>\n<h3>Is Castor and Rosemary Oil Good for Hair?</h3>\n<p>Yes! There are so many rosemary and <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/castor-oil-for-hair/\">castor oil benefits for your hair</a>. The nutrients in the oil can increase blood circulation to the scalp, promoting hair growth. At the same time, castor oil’s antimicrobial properties can keep your scalp healthy, reducing dandruff and scalp infections. </p>\n<p>Beyond stimulating hair growth, the combination of rosemary and castor oils can also strengthen and moisturize brittle and dry hair. Their rich, hydrating consistency helps add shine and reduce frizz by smoothing those hair cuticles.</p>\n<p>Basically, castor oil + rosemary oil = all your hair goals.</p>\n<h3>What Does Rosemary and Castor Oil Do for Hair?</h3>\n<p>Promotes hair growth</p>\n<p>Improves scalp health</p>\n<p>Moisturizes hair</p>\n<p>Strengthens hair strands</p>\n<p>Protects hair from damage</p>\n<p>Reduces hair shedding</p>\n<p>Prevents dandruff and dry scalp</p>\n<p>Reduces scalp inflammation</p>\n<p>Improves hair thinning</p>\n<h3>How to Make Rosemary and Castor Oil for Hair Growth</h3>\n<p>2 tablespoons <a href=\"https://bit.ly/45wFcID\">cold-pressed castor oil</a></p>\n<p>1 tablespoon <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4mvm8Ax\">jojoba oil</a>, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4fRGRvF\">coconut oil</a>, or other carrier oil </p>\n<p>5-10 drops <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4mxwnnV\">rosemary essential oil</a></p>\n<p>In a small glass or ceramic bowl, combine the castor oil, carrier oil, and rosemary essential oil.</p>\n<p>Fill the sink with a few inches of warm water. Then, place the bowl in the warm water (don’t let any spill over the top). Let it sit for a few minutes to warm the oils.</p>\n<p>The warmth from the mixture helps your pores open up and absorb more of the oil. Make sure you don’t microwave it though, because it can reduce the potency and degrade the beneficial nutrients.</p>\n<p>Wet your scalp and then use your fingertips to apply the oil blend directly onto your scalp, section by section. Massage the oil gently into your skin with your fingers or a <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3HLcN8q\">scalp massager</a> for 3-5 minutes. (Use code TSC25 for 25% off the Pellequr scalp massager.)</p>\n<p><br/>Then, pour a dime-sized amount of oil into your palm and rub your hands together to warm it up. Starting from the mid-lengths, work your way down to the ends, smoothing the oil evenly through your hair. Repeat until all strands are lightly coated.</p>\n<p>Let the oil sit on your hair for 30 minutes to 2 hours. You could even let it sit overnight for a deep treatment, too. Just make sure to use a <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4msBZ2u\">shower cap</a> to protect your bedding.</p>\n<p>Make sure to shampoo thoroughly—we even recommend shampooing twice to remove all the oil and buildup. Then, condition your hair as usual for soft, refreshed strands.</p>\n<h3>How to Use Rosemary and Castor Oil for Hair Growth</h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/castor-oil-and-rosemary-oil-for-hair-recipe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Having a baby and 2 other young kids is the best, but I mean, life is busy. This summer has been wild with three kids but also nice and relaxing with lots of family time at home.</p>\n<p>If you want to hear about Bond’s birth story, you can listen to it <a href=\"https://tscpodcast.com/episodes/\">here</a>. In the episode I talk about what I did to prep for birth, the epidural, Panicky Susan, practices and products that have been crucial postpartum and how I plan on losing 25 lbs.</p>\n<p>Here are some essentials that have been helping me fit in self-care when time is tight, and things that have been keeping Zaza and Townes occupied this summer so I can soak up Bond in this special newborn stage.</p>\n<h2>My Postpartum Lifesavers</h2>\n<p><strong>Ice Roller:</strong> First thing in the morning, throughout the day, in the evening you’ll catch me <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/how-to-use-an-ice-roller/\">ice rolling</a>. It’s a nice pick-me-up and the depuffing happens instantly. The <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/mint-roller\">Mint Roller</a> has been such a necessity for my sore nipples, too. Speaking of sore nipples, if you’re breastfeeding you have to try these <a href=\"https://bit.ly/45X8iQi\">Silverettes</a>.</p>\n<p>And while we’re talking about ICE, these <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4mLp7Fa\">Frida Mom instant ice pads</a> are amazing. You crack them and they get all cold and you put them in your underwear. So soothing post-birth.</p>\n<p><strong>Everything Spray:</strong> After I cleanse in the morning I love to use this mist. It’s hydrating, healing and you really can use it for everything. Use it as a toner, after a day in the sun, post-shave or as a wound remedy. (Use code SKINNY.)</p>\n<p><strong>Branch Basics:</strong> If there was ever a <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/your-non-toxic-product-guide/\">time to go non-toxic</a>, it’s with a new baby. From the cleaning concentrate to the laundry detergent, I feel confident using this around the house and on all of my kids’ clothes. (Use code SKINNY15.)</p>\n<p><strong>Beauty Salt:</strong> Now that I have 3 kids, I’m looking to streamline more than ever. Knowing that I get 3 supplements in one efficient scoop and that I’m hydrating properly with beauty benefits is a crucial way to start my day.</p>\n<p>It’s unflavored so I like to <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4oXFzTX\">froth it up</a> with Cymbiotika’s <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-24038909\">elderberry</a> or <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-24038961\">Vitamin C</a>. It’s like a little mocktail with health benefits. You can check out all our favorite Cymbiotika supplements <a href=\"https://partners.cymbiotika.com/TSC\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Claw clip:</strong> When I’m holding my newborn, I want my hair out of his face and off my neck and shoulders. Especially if they’re nursing or sleeping, the last thing you need is your hair tickling them awake. I love these claw clips because they’re big, easy to use and super cute to have in all your bags or around the house. </p>\n<p><strong>Pajamas:</strong> I’m a pajama connoisseur and I really stocked up before the baby came. These ones are so comfy (I have tons) and make you feel cute when you’re hanging around the house in a baby daze. I adore this collab with Eden Rock. When I was at the hospital I wore baby blue ones by <a href=\"https://djerfavenue.com/en-us/go-slow-pj-shirt-blue/\">Djerf Avenue</a> and they are the COMFIEST.</p>\n<p>You can shop everything <a href=\"https://www.shopltk.com/explore/laurynbosstick/productsets/11f055ef920ff5d68edd0242ac110019?utm_source=Klaviyo&amp;utm_medium=campaign&amp;utm_campaign=6%2F30+Lauryn%27s+Postpartum+Must-Haves&amp;utm_klaviyo_id=&amp;_kx=_eqU_s1fa4WWy8azfU4uPg.SDGCtL\">here</a>. I’m especially in love with <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4l347rW\">the pajamas</a> and recently got <a href=\"https://www.shopltk.com/explore/laurynbosstick/posts/f590b286-7397-11f0-b194-0242ac110022\">these ones</a> too. They’re so cute and gave me and Zaza and little matching moment on our Aspen trip.</p>\n<h3>Kid-Approved Activities</h3>\n<p>Like I said, we’ve been home a lot except for our trip to Aspen. We’ve been going for walks, playing in the backyard, gardening, Townes goes to tumble class and we <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/theskinnyconfidential/list/35BEQEFPYEJ3U?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_aipsflist_6E501VG26GKHQR3VM7PR\">read a lot of books</a>. On top of that, baking, cooking and just relaxing, here are some things Zaza and Townes loved to do this summer:</p>\n<p>Scrapbooking: You can buy kits or go to a local shop and choose <a href=\"https://bit.ly/41rC52f\">fun pens</a>, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4mCmaG9\">stickers</a>, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3V0ZJPc\">scissors</a> and make your own scrap books or vision boards. My kids loved <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4mFkBaD\">gluing</a> their own pictures and magazine cut outs into <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4mzDZ90\">their books</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/postpartum-lifesavers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Believe it or not, we encounter radiation every day. We’re not just talking about the electromagnetic and corpuscular radiation from the sun, though. We’re also exposed to it from artificial things like cell phones, Wi-Fi routers, radio broadcasts, smart meters, and even home appliances.</p>\n<p>Here’s the thing: you need to protect yourself from all kinds of radiation. We put on <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/sunscreen?selling_plan=4150296669\">SPF</a> to protect our skin from the sun, right? But what about when it comes to protecting ourselves from our phones and other Bluetooth devices?</p>\n<p>The good news is that there are ways to block this artificial radiation, too. That way, you can keep your family safe from any potential harmful effects without unplugging from the modern world.</p>\n<p>Here’s how you can stay connected <i>and </i>protected:</p>\n<h2>How to Block Cell Phone Radiation + What You NEED to Know About EMF</h2>\n<p>The sun showers us with ultraviolet (UV) radiation, while our everyday devices emit electromagnetic field (EMF) radiation.</p>\n<p>Just like UV rays, this type of radiation is totally invisible. That’s why it’s so important to know exactly what it is, where it’s coming from, the potential risks, and, most importantly, how you can protect yourself.</p>\n<p>Before we jump into things, it’s important to note that <i>not</i> all EMFs are bad! Take electromagnetic therapy, for example, that uses electric fields to stimulate the body’s natural healing process. Sometimes they can do pretty amazing things… when they’re necessary. </p>\n<p>Just check out the Gary Brecka episode of <a href=\"https://tscpodcast.com/episodes/gary-brecka/\">The Him &amp; Her Show</a><i> </i>to learn more.</p>\n<h3>What Is EMF Radiation?</h3>\n<p>Electromagnetic field (EMF) radiation is made up of electric and magnetic fields working together. As a result, this is the invisible energy that’s all around us. It exists across the <i>entire </i>electromagnetic spectrum, which includes everything from the low-frequency waves from power lines to the higher-frequency RF radiation used by cell phones and Wi-Fi.</p>\n<p>Essentially, electromagnetic fields (EMFs) include lots of different frequencies. Some are so low we can’t see or feel them, like those from household appliances. Others, like visible light, are easily detectable by the naked eye. All of these are types of electromagnetic radiation, just at different energy levels.</p>\n<p>As we mentioned earlier, not all types of radiation deserve a red-flag warning. Just like spending time in the sun has its benefits, certain frequencies of EMFs can be helpful, too. You can learn more about that from longevity expert Gary Brecka in our post <a href=\"https://tscpodcast.com/superhuman-protocol/\">What is the Superhuman Protocol?</a></p>\n<h3>Is EMF Radiation Harmful?</h3>\n<p>There’s a lot of debate about whether EMF radiation causes adverse health effects, but there is NOT a debate over whether it impacts our bodies. Even the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-electromagnetic-fields\">World Health Organization </a>acknowledges EMFs absolutely have biological effects.</p>\n<p>So the question is: Does long-term exposure to EMFs at <i>any </i>frequency cause health problems?  There’s research out there that says it does, and health organizations are telling people to be mindful of exposure to be safe. </p>\n<p>Here are some problems EMF radiation may cause:</p>\n<p>Sometimes, exposure to EMF radiation can bring on headaches, fatigue, dizziness, brain fog, or even skin sensitivity. For some, it’s because of too much exposure, but others are just naturally more sensitive to these fields.</p>\n<p>Radiofrequency EMFs from cell phones, smartwatches, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth devices can trigger <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/oxidative-stress\">oxidative stress</a> in our bodies. When this stress isn’t kept in check, it can damage our cells and DNA.</p>\n<p>Over time, as our body’s repair systems and immune defenses weaken, abnormal cells may not get cleared out properly. This, in turn, can lead to an increased risk of cancerous tumor growth.</p>\n<p>DNA damage caused by ongoing oxidative stress can actually accelerate biological aging. This means your tissues, organs, and skin cells lose their ability to repair and regenerate effectively, making your body more vulnerable to wear and tear.</p>\n<p>As a result, you might start to look and feel physically older. We’re talking things like wrinkles, low energy, and slow healing times. This doesn’t just impact your health, it <i>also </i>impacts your self-esteem.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/how-to-block-cell-phone-radiation-what-you-need-to-know-about-emf/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Let us introduce you:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/celestethomas/\">Celeste</a> is an LA based Registered Nurse, holistic skincare expert and non-toxic lifestyle advocate who’s been weeding through all the crap the beauty industry feeds us to give us some tired and true recommendations that really work. After suffering from acne and even being on Accutane, Celeste learned how to actually heal her acne from within with lifestyle practices, diet and skin-safe products. Today she is going ot share her top tips with YOU.</p>\n<p>Let’s welcome Celeste to the blog.</p>\n<p>+++</p>\n<p>Hi loves! My name is Celeste Thomas, I’m a registered nurse and holistic skincare expert who’s overcome some majorly acne prone skin. My mission is to use everything I’ve learned over the past 15 years in the skincare and wellness industries to help you feel your most skin confident.</p>\n<p>I am that one friend you can always text for the best recommendations and honest reviews. I have researched it all when it comes to skin health and as someone prone to acne, I’ve learned that the most trendy, expensive products aren’t always the best choice. In this post I’m giving you the simplest, most budget-friendly tips to help your skin glow from the inside out.</p>\n<p>Here are 10 nutrition, exercise, and health tips that I live by.</p>\n<h2>Celeste Thomas on Nutrition, Health and Exercise</h2>\n<h3>Protein at every meal</h3>\n<p>Think Lauryn’s <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/what-i-eat-in-a-day/\">plate of ground beef</a>. IYKYK. Protein helps stabilize my blood sugar so I’m not sneaking my daughter’s cereal by 10AM. Protein also supports the skin’s collagen and elastin production, pretty much making you the hottest, most energized version of yourself.</p>\n<p>If there’s no protein, I’m not wasting my time. At least 20g of protein at every meal/snack is my goal and I even put it in my drinks. Here’s how I add protein to my morning matcha:</p>\n<p> Packet of <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4dJ9TvG\">Pique Matcha Tea</a></p>\n<p>1 Scoop of <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3T7g5oU\">Be Well by Kelly Grass Protein Powder</a> (20g of protein)</p>\n<p>1 Scoop of <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3T7lkoM\">Ancient Nutrition Collagen Powder</a>  (10g of protein) </p>\n<p>1-2 Tbsp of <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4g213L8\">Almond Milk Concentrate</a></p>\n<p>1 Tsp of <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3X6UA96\">NOW Foods </a>Organic Monk Fruit</p>\n<p>Whisk, pour over ice and enjoy.</p>\n<h3>Eating Home Cooked Whole Food Meals</h3>\n<p>I know this can sound daunting, but I try to do this as much as possible because it’s so worth it. I have more energy, clearer and brighter skin, and increased mental clarity when I am nourishing my body with home cooked whole food.</p>\n<p>It allows me to avoid the skin busting big 3 (stay tuned for this in the next tip).</p>\n<p>I cook 80% of my meals, so when I do decide to go balls to the walls with steak frites, a dirty gin martini, and apple pie à la mode I get to fully enjoy it because it’s an occasional treat, not my multiple times a week crutch because I didn’t have a plan and postmates’d shitty Chinese food in a hunger panic.</p>\n<p>I plan ahead and order groceries from Costco, Whole Foods, or Sprouts and treat myself to kid-free solo dates to the farmers market. Another way I keep it simple is by repeating meals. Burger night, taco night, and steak night are on rotation weekly, no shame in keeping it basic.</p>\n<h3>Eat to Glow</h3>\n<p>Diet is a huge component to keeping my skin clear. No matter how much money you spend on products, if you don’t nourish your skin internally you’re not going to get the Hailey Bieber glaze you want. The #eattoglow diet is anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, and supports clear skin, I swear by it. It’s all about adding in as much organic produce, grass-fed organic meat, and wild caught fish as possible and avoiding the big three.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>The Big Three: </strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Seed Oils:</strong> A recent peer reviewed <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0228074\">study</a>, found that people with acne have higher lineactic acid, which can also be found in various seed oils. I opt for <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3XnfGBu\">tallow</a> or <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3XlMoD2\">Ghee</a> while cooking or <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4dDjjc0\">organic EVOO</a> for cold preparations like salad dressing. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/celeste-thomas-on-nutrition-health-and-exercise/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Call it cliché, but the minute September hits, I can’t wait to start making soup. Sure, it may not be *that* cold out yet, but there’s something about the nostalgia of the season that comes flooding back with every bowl I make. (That and there’s always <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/07/5-summer-recipes-that-will-indulge-your-inner-child/\">gazpacho</a> for warmer days, right?) <br/>While I have a go-to list of fall soup recipes I lean on, I’m always up for refreshing it. (After the year we had, a refresher definitely felt in order!) Therefore, I took it to the internet to add a few more into rotation for this season, and I’m here to share my winning options with you today. So in the name of all that’s cozy and comforting, let’s dive in, shall we?</p>\n    <p>An oldie but a goodie, this soup always sounds like a good option. For this recipe specifically, underneath the bubbly layer of melted cheese (which I love oh-so-much) you’ll find two *secret* additions that make it really hit the spot. Click the link below to see what I’m talking about!</p>\n    <p>It wasn’t until later in life that I discovered my love for mushrooms. (And I’m so glad I did!) This vegan and gluten-free soup is one of the reasons for this, because of its creamy consistency and nourishing ingredients. It’s safe to say I will be making this once the first day of chilly temps hits.</p>\n    <p>Speaking of something I came to love later in life, soba noodles also make the list. I love their slurp-able qualities, especially when floating in a flavorful, savory broth. For cold season coming up, I’m convinced this is a perfect antidote!</p>\n    <p>My grandma used to make a variation of this recipe when we’d visit her on winter days. In fact, just looking at this recipe, I can practically taste the familiar herby goodness greeting my mouth. I like this rendition both for its flexibility (you can adjust based on what you have on hand) and budget-friendly ingredient list. Therefore, it’s a win-win in my book!</p>\n    <p>Soup season would be nothing without a little chili in the mix! Thanks to a little help from my favorite Cello cheese (their cheese is seriously so rich and delicious), we can make the ultimate comfort food to welcome the new season (and maybe watch a football game or two!).</p>\n    <p>I’m always looking for a recipe in which I can incorporate chickpeas, aka my favorite source of plant-based protein. The moment I laid eyes on this dish, which also uses my favorite spices—ginger and turmeric—I knew it would make my list!</p>\n    <p>Seafood lovers, rejoice! This ensemble, complete with homemade stock, is the ideal transitional soup to take you from summer to fall.</p>\n    <p>Last but not least is this colorful and zesty vegetarian recipe! Packed with sweet potatoes, fire-roasted tomatoes, and corn, it’s filling and fiber-rich. Better yet, it can be made in minutes thanks to the holy-grail kitchen appliance, <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/11/ive-owned-the-instant-pot-for-5-years-heres-my-honest-review/\">the Instant Pot</a>! (Psst! Don’t have one? Don’t worry, you can make this over the stovetop too!)</p>\n    <p>Sarah Schuh is a copywriter and freelance writer living in Chicago.

These reviews are intended to provide detailed information on products that may be of interest to you, so if and when you’re in the market for a given item, you have all the info you need to decide whether to make a purchase.</p>\n<p>The DRx SpectraLite™ FaceWare Pro is an FDA-cleared face mask from Dr. Dennis Gross that uses red and blue LED light therapy. The <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-7715167\">blue light</a> treats acne and evens skin tone and texture, while the <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-7715178\">red light</a> smooths lines, supports natural collagen production to firm skin, treats signs of sun damage, and treats inflammation.</p>\n<p>I have sensitive, dry skin that is starting to show fine lines. I also have dark spots on my nose and cheeks and I often deal with my skin looking a bit dull and red. Occasionally, I have mild hormonal acne. Because I have sensitive skin, I have to be careful with acids and harsh serums. Before I bought this mask, I had recently been diagnosed with early-stage rosacea. I noticed I was getting really red on my nose and cheeks when drinking alcohol, having spicy food, or being in the sun for a prolonged period.<i> </i></p>\n<p>I bought this mask in May 2024. I had previously tried the <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-7553836\">Solawave Wand</a> and found my skin benefited from red light therapy. With the Solawave Wand, I noticed some improvements in my skin pigment and texture. I noticed my dark spots looked minimized and my skin looked more radiant and firm.<br/>I wanted to invest a little more in an LED mask I could simply leave on without needing to manually move it to each part of my face. <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-6562814\">The Dr. Dennis Gross LED mask</a> is designed to treat the issues I noted above, like fine lines, dark spots, redness, and acne.<br/>Before I bought the Dr. Dennis Gross LED mask, I had purchased <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3B2Kajq\">this $150 LED mask</a> and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3XqwdTJ\">this $70 LED mask</a> through Amazon. I returned them both because they didn’t charge or stay on my face well. I was also worried about using a device sold by a third-party vendor, especially when using bright light so close to my eyes. Ultimately, I decided I wanted to try a product from a more reputable, well-researched brand. The Dr. Dennis Gross mask is FDA-cleared, which means it is a professional-grade LED therapy. </p>\n<p>I try to use the mask daily. Realistically, I use it about three days a week, because you know, life. To use, I wash my face and pat it dry, place the device on my face, turn it on, and use it for the programmed duration of three minutes.<br/>There are three modes: red anti-aging mode, blue anti-acne mode, and combined red and blue light mode. I usually do the red light mode. Afterward, I apply my normal skin products. <br/>This mask can be used morning or night. For best results, the brand recommends daily use—consistency is key! For more information, reference <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-7715195\">the full list of instructions</a> from Dr. Dennis Gross.</p>\n<p>With regular use, I’ve noticed the fine lines on my face are minimized and the redness has improved to the point it is not noticeable anymore. I’ve also noticed an improvement with hormonal acne. My cheeks have fewer dark spots but my nose continues to be a problem area that I am going to consult my dermatologist about at my next appointment. Overall, this product has been effective for me so far and I’m eager to continue using it long-term.</p>\n<p>No. I’ve used it regularly for four months and I have no complaints. It keeps a charge for a long time and is durable. I love the comfortable silicone lining too!</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/09/dr-dennis-gross-spectralite-faceware-pro-led-mask-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Maybe they’ve got a gift for being super organized and calm while juggling all the moving parts of getting a meal to the table. And then there are the rest of us, those who want to have people over but get tangled up in all the reasons to postpone.<br/>Hosting doesn’t have to be formal. It doesn’t have to look like my parties or any others you see on Instagram. <strong>The point of entertaining is to gather people to spend time together—regardless of the size of your home or your cooking skill level. </strong>Even without the pressure of comparison, it can be overwhelming to think of everything you have to do before and during such an occasion.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://housecall.substack.com/p/how-to-have-people-over\">I want you to have people over.</a> So I asked my friend (and generous host) <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lisahackwith/\">Lisa</a> to collaborate on a new entertaining series on Wit &amp; Delight called “Come Over For…” In each post, we’ll share all the essential information for hosting a delightful party around a specific theme or idea, including a timeline for the day before and the day of, a detailed grocery list, and recipes for each menu item. The series aims to make it easy to replicate these kinds of occasions for your group of friends or family.<br/>Lisa and I have been cooking and sharing meals for a long time. She entertains beautifully and is a gracious, calm host for big parties and small dinners alike. She’s also an incredible cook and has been developing her own recipes. She created all of the recipes in this post! By collaborating on this series, we’re exploring a richer approach to hosting that combines both of our styles and expertise.</p>\n<p>Beyond cooking and entertaining, Lisa is the founder of <a href=\"https://hackwithdesignhouse.com/\">Hackwith Design House</a> and a multi-hyphenate creative who’s good at everything she does. And, importantly, she’s confident in her abilities to create. I admire this about her so much because half the battle of creating is being willing to try. <br/>Lisa and I wanted to keep every recipe and step in this series light and doable. It’s entertaining without all the extra fuss. It’s a reminder that a simple approach to hosting can still feel special.</p>\n<p>For the first iteration, we curated a casual dinner party that’s easy, beautiful, delicious, and memorable. A tall order to fill but we did it! The menu for this casual dinner party is meant to be easy to bring to the table but still special. It’s vegetarian, filling, and delicious, so everyone will be satisfied. <br/>Here’s the menu, including a cocktail to start the evening:</p>\n<p>Whenever I’m hosting a dinner party, these are the things I like to keep in mind to ensure a low-stress, enjoyable evening.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forms.gle/gGMcSDGs1TcqPYDZ7\">We’ve taken care of this for you</a>! When creating a menu for a dinner party, I like to consider the number of people attending and what steps it takes to get the food to the table. This menu is perfect for up to six people but can easily be scaled up without much effort.<br/>Here’s another tip: If you’re cooking a new dish and want to practice making it, consider doing a trial run first. Make it a week or so before the party for your family or yourself so you can get comfortable with the steps.</p>\n<p>Plan the prep so you’re not feeling rushed the evening of your dinner party. Lisa and I put together <a href=\"https://forms.gle/gGMcSDGs1TcqPYDZ7\">a timeline</a> for what needs to be done beforehand and leading up to the party so you have an idea of how to pace yourself and the evening.<br/>For more tips on planning, creating a guest list, and sending invitations, read this post: “<a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/08/how-to-plan-a-dinner-party/\">How to Plan a Dinner Party: My Best Tips to Simplify the Process</a>.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/08/casual-dinner-party/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>As the seasons shift and we transition into the fall, I take stock of my closet and make a plan for edits, purchases, and repairs. I like to think of it as a “back to basics” approach. This isn’t about trends; it’s about timeless pieces that define your personal style. Much of my core style has been inspired by a classic French look. Whenever I find myself getting caught up in trends, this anchors me back to a place where I can make solid purchasing decisions that will add some oomph to an already solid foundation.  <br/>Sézane recently launched an extensive collection of classic pieces that are perfect for rounding out what might be missing in your wardrobe. Think of it as a “French Core” collection—iconic pieces that will not only be in stock now but will also remain essentials long after the latest monthly edit.</p>\n<p>The Vassili jacket is the epitome of effortless style, blending the structure of a blazer with the casual ease of a jacket. Made from high-quality materials, this piece is perfect for layering over anything—from a simple tee to a blouse. Pair it with jeans for a relaxed look or throw it over a dress for a more polished vibe. The Vassili jacket works seamlessly with both casual and dressier pieces, making it a must-have for any wardrobe.<strong>Fit Notes:</strong> I’m wearing a size small and could have sized up.</p>\n<p>The Peter skirt brings a touch of classic femininity to your wardrobe. Its navy color adds a sense of sophistication, while the A-line shape flatters every body type. Whether you’re dressing for work or a weekend brunch, this skirt will be your go-to. Pair the Peter skirt with a crisp white shirt for a classic look, or style it with a colorful sweater for a pop of personality. It’s an easy piece to dress up with heels or keep casual with flats. This skirt is a workhorse!<strong>Fit Notes:</strong> It runs big! Size down.</p>\n<p>The length of the Martin crop trousers makes them ideal for transitioning between seasons, and the tailored fit ensures they’re as flattering as they are stylish. Pair these trousers with a simple tee and sneakers for a casual look, or dress them up with a blouse and heels. They’re versatile enough to take you from a day at work to an evening out.<strong>Fit Notes:</strong> These run small—size up if you are in between sizes.</p>\n<p>Mary Janes are a timeless shoe style, and the Mélanie Mary Janes take this classic silhouette and elevate it with a modern twist. Their patent black finish adds a touch of sophistication, making them suitable for both casual and formal occasions. Pair the Mélanie Mary Janes with anything from dresses to trousers. Their versatility makes them a key piece in your wardrobe, offering endless styling possibilities. The heel isn’t too high, making it a great shoe for a wedding or any other occasion that requires you to dress up for long periods.<strong>Fit Notes:</strong> These run true to size.</p>\n<p>No wardrobe is complete without a little black dress, and the Nicia dress reimagines this classic piece with subtle yet stylish details. It is VERY Françoise Hardy! Its simple silhouette makes it incredibly versatile, while the high-quality wool fabric ensures it’s a piece you’ll reach for time and time again. Wear the Nicia dress with the Mélanie Mary Janes for a chic, understated look, and add bold accessories for a statement-making outfit. This dress is your canvas—style it any way you like.<strong>Fit Notes:</strong> This dress runs true to size.</p>\n<p>These iconic items are not only versatile and stylish but also embody the essence of classic French style.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>For <i>The Atlantic</i>, Nancy Walecki remembers her father, Fred Walecki, who as owner of Westwood Music, sold instruments to the likes of David Crosby, Graham Nash, Bernie Leadon, all musicians who birthed the California Sound of the ’60s and ’70s. Walecki wasn’t just a salesman; he was considered a matchmaker who took pride in pairing each player with the perfect instrument. Chris Hillman, a founding member of The Byrds, described Westwood Music as “‘the hardware store’ of the L.A. music scene.” </p><blockquote><p/><i>Check this out</i>: the three-word portal into the Fred Walecki Experience.<i>Check this out</i>, and<a href=\"\">he’d hand John Entwistle his first-ever Alembic bass</a>, a brand he would go on to use for many years with the Who.<i>Check this out</i>, and he’d pull out a guitar by Mark Whitebook or David Russell Young, luthiers he’d discovered in the mountains of Topanga Canyon, and whose instruments he sold to James Taylor and Gram Parsons. Glyn Johns bought a David Russell Young so he’d have a good acoustic guitar for the rock bands he worked with. (Johns showed me that guitar when I visited him at home last fall; he apologized for all the scratch marks. “Everybody’s played this,” he said. “Eric has played it; Jeff Beck’s played it; Jimmy Page has played it.”)</blockquote><blockquote><p>Early in her career, Bonnie Raitt was playing in little clubs and “wasn’t even expecting to do this for a living. It was kind of a hobby for me,” she told me. But Dad, she says, “showed me around and showed me the whole world of things that I could have.” He explained how different amplifiers could change her sound, and he took her to a trade show where he introduced her to the genteel, rather ancient chairman of Martin Guitar, C. F. Martin III.</p><p>Raitt has a mischievous, bawdy sense of humor. (As a kid, I understood I was never to repeat a Bonnie Raitt joke.) Dad told C. F. Martin that Raitt was a rising star and may be in need of a custom-made guitar. “What I really need is a custom-made IUD,” she said. Martin had no idea what she was talking about, so Dad jumped in: “Uh, it’s a lot like a Martin D-35.”</p></blockquote><h2>More picks about music</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2023/05/19/the-epic-return-of-lucinda-williams/\">The Epic Return of Lucinda Williams</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Having once left an abusive relationship, Van Etten hears in Williams’s lyrics the strength of a woman who refused to let darkness define or diminish her.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2019/11/21/trigger/\">Trigger</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Willie Nelson’s been playing the same guitar — a Martin N-20 classical — for 50 years.</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2024/01/16/joni-mitchells-best-album-is-turning-fifty-its-not-blue/\">Joni Mitchell’s Best Album Is Turning Fifty.

Kendra Greene beautifully reflects on the generations of families growing up in California, our changing climate and way of life, and the experiences and memories that shape us and which we carry within our bodies, wherever we go.</p><blockquote><p>A few years before I had nieces at all, I remember thinking that I felt a shift coming, a kind of tipping point, that already, even in terms of technology, so much had changed so fast that there was about to be too much to explain to someone new to all of it, a child or an alien, and I meant just the part I’d lived through. Even just that, a few decades, was about to be impossible, all of it still recent memory, but simply too much.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It was last summer I first noticed the people I knew in Salt Lake talking about wildfires in the tongue of my West Coast childhood. It happened with locals and transplants alike, in canyons and coffee shops, at a friend’s house in the hills looking across the sweep of the valley. Not only the language, the fact of air quality and containment and evacuation route and how much longer can we stay, but something in the tone, what I can only name a familiarness, the sound of understanding.</p></blockquote><h2>\n\t\t\t\t\tMore picks from <i>Nautilus</i>\n\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/06/13/cemetery-tombstone-decay-ruins/\">The Gravekeeper’s Paradox</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“People want permanent tombstones that also show decay.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/04/24/najin-fatu-rhino-deextinction-colossal/\">The Last of Their Kind</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Are efforts to resurrect the northern white rhino more technological hubris than genuine conservation?”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/03/14/when-did-i-start-getting-cancer/\">When Did I Start Getting Cancer?</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“An environmental chemist investigates the origins of her leukemia.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/01/08/scent-makes-a-place/\">Scent Makes a Place</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“How the desert taught me to smell.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2024/12/23/this-ocean-wave-has-rights/\">This Ocean Wave Has Rights  </a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“The true meaning of legal protection for nature.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2024/11/22/the-once-and-future-woods/\">The Once and Future Woods</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Cathedrals, seed banks, and oaks: How to live in times of change.”</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/08/27/climate-california-wildfire/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>As Chandler Fritz makes his way to the bucking chute in his grandfather’s boots and a DIY cup, he turns over the forces that have moved him to ride a bull. In his telescopic essay, Fritz moves between Paleolithic cave paintings and gas-station epiphanies, the roots of early North American bull-riding events and a short list of the beef he’s consumed in the days before his fated meeting with Babyface, his steer. “A perversion,” he writes, “is a turn from a previous path to meaning. It is the betrayal of an exact course.” But I’d take a true course over an exact one any day.</p><blockquote><p>I can’t tell you why I wanted to do this, but I can tell you exactly when I made the decision to do it. I was filling up my mother-in-law’s Hummer at the Shell right off the Piestewa Highway a few days after the ocotillos bloomed. My wife and I had just decided we were going to try to have kids. I know what you’re thinking, but that’s not exactly it. I don’t want to ride a bull before I have a kid. I want to make a bunch of money and buy a house and a Subaru before I have a kid.</p><p>But I was standing there pumping midgrade octane into the H3 and staring at the McDowells and thinking about how I knew the pump number where I was standing, knew the name of the mountains I was looking at, knew the hard smell of the gasoline and the flaming blue of a passing attendant’s uniform—knew these things</p><i>exactly</i>, the way I had always determined to know the world—and suddenly I thought I should probably ride a bull. Or, more accurately, I suddenly found that I was going to ride a bull, as I had already reached for my phone and called Buffalo Chip and got my name on the list before any normative notion of whether I<i>should</i>do this crossed my mind. It was a kind of fait accompli accomplished by my unconscious, the type of action one associates with creatures of lesser intelligence. It cost forty dollars, and I signed a waiver—anyone can do it. At least, anyone can try.</blockquote><h2>More picks from The Paris Review</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/07/08/monks-in-jersey/\">Monks in Jersey</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Two cars full of supplies and people for a weekend of living more with less.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/05/22/recurring-screens/\">Recurring Screens</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“A screen saver periodically smokes the locusts out, thereby saving the screen from the disfigurement of monotony.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/05/14/crew-change-guide-train-hopping/\">The Hobo Handbook</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“You can’t buy such a book, can’t download it, can’t trace its often multiple authors.

There she profiles seven hopefuls from all walks of life who still relish the American dream: running a successful small business.</p><blockquote><p>There’s something quietly radical about that. In a country where “entrepreneur” has become a buzzword for tech bros and hustlers, the students at Hot Dog U are a different breed. They’re working-class dreamers. Retired couples. First-generation families. People who don’t want to disrupt the industry. They just want a patch of sidewalk, a roll of napkins, and a line of hungry customers.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Bill is the head of Hot Dog University. He’s your professor of encased meats, your guide through everything from cart etiquette to bulk ordering logistics. Bill makes you feel like you’re the most important person in the room. Like you could sell a thousand hot dogs by sheer charm and will. When you step off the elevator, you’re greeted by Bill and by the start of the Vienna Beef Hall of Fame: posters, trinkets, and sausage-themed memorabilia spanning more than a century. It’s like a hot dog museum married a high school hallway. At some point, it starts to feel a little mythic — like the yellow brick road, if Oz were made of mustard and meat.</p></blockquote><h2>More picks about food</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2024/06/18/i-spent-a-week-eating-discarded-restaurant-food-but-was-it-really-going-to-waste/\">I Spent a Week Eating Discarded Restaurant Food.

Her interest veers from curiosity into conservation when she and a couple of friends volunteer for a horseshoe monitoring session with the NYC Bird Alliance. There, they helped log and tag horseshoe crabs emerging from the water at high tide to mate on Plumb Beach.</p><blockquote><p>Agnes and Ashe waited behind, picking up trash as Ann gave us the outline of our night. She kept checking her watch, waiting for the precise moment of high tide: 7:29 P.M. Using two white pipes connected into a square, we prepared to survey the number of horseshoe crabs present that night at random. The pace at which we had to stop and check for critters was a bizarre math problem that I couldn’t quite follow. Meanwhile, two volunteers carried clipboards to note the number of horseshoe crabs in the sample field. I looked around. So far there weren’t so many. As requested, we looked around and grabbed the numbers of those already tagged.</p></blockquote><h2>\n\t\t\t\t\tMore picks from <i>The Paris Review</i>\n\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2024/08/07/scrabble-anonymous/\">Scrabble, Anonymous</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Somehow, doing it with other people took the stain away, made it feel fun instead of abject.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2023/11/14/so-fierce-is-the-world-on-loneliness-and-philip-seymour-hoffman/\">So Fierce Is the World: On Loneliness and Philip Seymour Hoffman</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“I believe we must reinvent loneliness in order to survive it.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>“Standard of Fear,” a project led by Lauren Caruba and Marin Wolf of <i>The</i> <i>Dallas Morning News</i>, details the consequences of recent laws restricting abortions in Texas, which now has “one of the country’s most strict and punitive abortion bans.” In this story, Caruba and Wolf, with María Ramos Pacheco, illustrate the final hours of Porsha Ngumezi and Brenda Yolani Arzu Ramirez, two women who died following delays in care. The <i>Morning News</i> team does admirable work to demonstrate the loss of medical expertise, confidence, and data following the Texas bans. The depth of the team’s reporting is most clear, however, in the stark, harrowing narratives of Ngumezi and Ramirez.</p><blockquote><p>At the outset of Texas’ abortion ban, medical experts worried women like Porsha and Brenda would die from delays in care.</p><p>It may never be known exactly how many Texas women have died as a result of the state’s abortion restrictions. It’s not always possible to determine to what degree the bans, and the fear around them, influenced a patient’s care.</p><p>And the state</p><a href=\"\">is not trying to find out</a>. The Texas Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Review Committee, the body responsible for investigating maternal deaths, has announced it is not investigating cases from 2022 and 2023, including the immediate aftermath of the state’s almost-total abortion ban.<p>To help fill that gap,</p><i>The Dallas Morning News</i>gathered hundreds of pages of autopsies and death records of maternal deaths that have occurred since Texas restricted abortion in late 2021.<i>The News</i>then asked obstetricians, including those specialized in abortion procedures, to review cases where abortion care might have been lifesaving.<p>In the cases of Brenda and Porsha, those experts agreed. They both died after hospitals chose not to provide abortion procedures.</p></blockquote><h2>More picks about reproductive rights</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2021/09/03/the-last-summer-of-roe-v-wade/\">The Last Summer of Roe v.

The former distorts the Earth’s poles, making landmasses like Greenland and Antarctica <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/21/nx-s1-5508358/mercator-map-africa\">appear disproportionately</a> large. Advocates for the change argue that the map misrepresents and diminishes the world’s perception of the African continent. The Equal Earth map, on the other hand, enlarges the continent to more accurately reflect its relative size.</p>\n    <p>First devised in 1569 by Flemish cartographer Gerardus Mercator, the ubiquitous Mercator projection features<strong> </strong>longitude lines that are equally spaced vertically across the globe. Latitude lines, however, are unevenly spaced, with the gaps between them growing wider the further out they are from the equator. This scaling creates a distorted, stretched-out effect at the top and bottom of the Earth. As a result, Greenland appears about equal in size to the entire African continent, when in reality the latter is about<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/03/05/how-big-is-greenland/81597696007/\"> 14 times larger</a>, according to some estimates.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/De5V0-1200x2609.jpeg?resize=1200%2C2609&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>“The current size of the map of Africa is wrong,” Moky Makura, executive director of the nonprofit organization Africa No Filter, told <i>Reuters</i> in an interview about the Mercator map projection. “It’s the world’s longest misinformation and disinformation campaign, and it just simply has to stop.”</p>\n    <p>In the Equal Earth map projection, continents appear to more closely match their real relative sizes. Unlike the Mercator map, in which latitude and longitude lines meet at 90-degree angles, its lines are curved to reflect the earth’s spherical shape, leading to a more accurate portrayal of the African continent’s scale.</p>\n    <p>Some technology companies allow users to switch between map projections, but the Mercator remains the default on many services. A Google spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that users can choose between it and globe views of the Earth on its desktop Google Maps interface. The Google Maps mobile app, however, uses the Mercator map, according to <i>Reuters</i>.</p>\n    <p>The Correct the Map campaign launched a <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/correctthemap-to-show-africa-s-true-size?recruiter=1363623859&amp;recruited_by_id=31b50b20-d90f-11ef-a26d-ff384a668a53&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_campaign=petition_dashboard&amp;utm_medium=copylink\">petition</a> calling for the United Nations and the British Broadcasting Company (BCC) to adopt the Equal Earth map, encouraging other organizations to follow suit. The petition had garnered nearly 7,000 signatures as of the time of publication.</p>\n    <p>“This distortion isn’t just a cartographic error — it’s a narrative failure,” Correct the Map’s petition text reads. “In a world where size is often equated with power, misrepresenting Africa’s true scale reinforces harmful misconceptions about its geopolitical and economic significance.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035968/africa-wants-a-more-accurate-world-map/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Seven years in the making, the show is curated by Carmen C. Bambach, an Italian Renaissance art scholar in the museum’s Department of Drawings and Prints who previously worked on The Met’s blockbuster exhibitions <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2003/leonardo-da-vinci\"> Leonardo da Vinci: Master Draftsman</a> (2003) and </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/press-releases/michelangelo-2017-exhibitions\">(2017–18).</a>\n    </p>\n    <i>Michelangelo: Divine Draftsman and Designer</i>\n    <p>Many of these pieces, The Met’s Director Max Hollein said in a statement, have never before been shown together — making the exhibition an “exceptionally rare opportunity” to explore the depth of Raphael’s artistry.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Portrait-of-Baldassarre-Castiglione_1514-1516-1200x1489.jpg?resize=1200%2C1489&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Raphael: Sublime Poetry</i> will span the artist’s early years in Urbino to his untimely death at the age of 37 in Rome, tracing the development of his ideas and creative process across his lifetime in a roughly chronological order. Thematic presentations — including recent scientific research, preparatory drawings, and a focus on his approach to portraying women — will aim to contextualize Raphael’s practice in a new light.</p>\n    <p>Among the masterpieces on display will be Raphael’s oil portrait “<a href=\"https://www.raphaelpaintings.org/portrait-of-baldassare-castiglione.jsp\">Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione</a>” (1514–16), which depicts the eponymous Italian diplomat in an intimate, soft lighting and striking, realistic detail, and his tender “<a href=\"https://www.nga.gov/artworks/26-alba-madonna\">Virgin and Child with Infant Saint John the Baptist in a Landscape (The Alba Madonna)</a>” (1510), which showcases the artist’s expertise in color and balance.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/The-Head-and-Hands-of-Two-Apostles-Auxiliary-Cartoon-for-the-Transfiguration_ca-1519-20-1200x1651.jpg?resize=1200%2C1651&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Sublime Poetry</i> will notably examine Raphael’s work through the lens of his “unique artistic personality.” Vasari, in his extensive chapter on Raphael’s short but prolific life, praised not only the painter’s embodiment of Renaissance virtues but also his enviable social ease, which earned him friends, patrons, and the admiration of artists and assistants in his workshop.</p>\n    <p>“Nature created him as a gift to the world,” Vasari wrote. “After having been vanquished by art in the work of Michelangelo Buonarroti, it wished to be vanquished through Raphael by both art and moral habits as well.”</p>\n    <p>The show is slated to open on March 29 and run through June 28.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Portrait-of-a-Lady-with-a-Unicorn-1505-6-1200x1543.jpg?resize=1200%2C1543&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037141/a-landmark-raphael-retrospective-is-coming-to-the-met/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

They are policing imagination itself,” Sherald wrote in her opinion, titled “Censorship has taken hold at the Smithsonian. I refused to play along.”</p>\n    <p>The artist <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1029808/amy-sherald-cancels-smithsonian-show-citing-censorship-of-trans-artwork/\">cancelled</a> the NPG’s planned exhibition of her touring show, <i>Amy Sherald: American Sublime</i>, in July, <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1029808/amy-sherald-cancels-smithsonian-show-citing-censorship-of-trans-artwork/\">claiming</a><strong> </strong>that she learned<strong> </strong>the institution was considering removing her painting “Trans Forming Liberty” (2024). The work envisions the Statue of Liberty as a Black trans woman, modeled after drag performer and musician <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/basit_/\">Arewà Basit</a>, and graced the cover of the <i>New Yorker</i> <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1031893/amy-sherald-trans-lady-liberty-painting-graces-new-yorker-cover/\">earlier this month</a>. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/07/DSC03749-1200x927.jpg?resize=1200%2C927&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>Last week, the painting appeared in a <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036180/trump-targets-lgbtq-history-migrants-and-more-in-chilling-smithsonian-hit-list/\">26-item list</a> of artworks and exhibitions posted by the White House shortly after the administration <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1033993/trump-american-exceptionalism-smithsonian/\">demanded</a> the Smithsonian hand over materials so that it could make “content corrections.” In her essay, Sherald reiterated that she made the decision to pull her show from the NPG because of the institution’s “attempted censorship of [her] painting.” (The institution has publicly <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/artist-amy-sherald-cancels-smithsonian-show-censorship-concerns-rcna220865\">denied</a> that it censored “Trans Forming Liberty,” and told <i>Hyperallergic</i> in a statement that it “could not come to an agreement with the artist.”)</p>\n    <p>“While no single person is to blame, it’s clear that institutional fear shaped by a broader climate of political hostility toward trans lives played a role,” Sherald wrote. “This painting exists to hold space for someone whose humanity has been politicized and disregarded. I cannot in good conscience comply with a culture of censorship, especially when it targets vulnerable communities.”</p>\n    <p>Sherald also cited other moments of political interference in the Smithsonian’s history in her essay, including former President Woodrow Wilson’s insistence that the institution implement Jim Crow racial segregation during his presidency in line with his <a href=\"https://calendar.eji.org/racial-injustice/apr/11\">segregation of the federal government</a> when he took office in 1913. Because the institution operates in a public-private arrangement, receiving funding from both federal and corporate sources, the Smithsonian <a href=\"https://siarchives.si.edu/history/featured-topics/African-Americans/american-negro-artists\">resisted</a> pressure from the White House.</p>\n    <p>But Sherald cautions that there have since been successful efforts to influence the content of the institution’s museums. A 2010 campaign by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/dec/01/smithsonian-pulls-christ-video\">right-wing Catholic League</a> led the National Portrait Gallery to remove a video work by David Wojnarowicz depicting Jesus being eaten by ants, a commentary on the federal government’s homophobia and failure to take action during the HIV/AIDS epidemic.</p>\n    <p>In her essay, the artist invoked a quote by former Metropolitan Museum of Art Director Philippe de Montebello: “A museum is the memory of mankind.”</p>\n    <p>“If that is true, then to manipulate museums is to manipulate who we believe we are,” she wrote of the quote. “Control the memory and you control the future.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037072/amy-sherald-speaks-out-on-cancelling-her-smithsonian-show/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>HAMBURG, Germany — “Ok, stop the cameras,” the head conservator commanded from the belly of the storage department. “I want to hear what these instruments sound like without Satch wearing the gloves.” The other assembled staff, seated in a scatter of folding chairs beneath the MARKK ethnographic museum in Hamburg, lowered their phones and tucked them away.</p>\n<p>These museum workers had gathered in the MARKK’s basement to oversee and document artist and musician Satch Hoyt “un-mute” the African instrument collection, as he calls it. A masterful player of wind and percussion alike, Hoyt has been working to gain access to African instrument collections in colonial and ethnographic museums so that they may be played again. Within certain African diasporic traditions, some of these instruments are understood as tools to communicate with the creator and ancestors. Thus, this un-muting is not a mere symbolic act protesting the enforced dormancy of museum storage, but an affirmation of fluid continuity between the living and ancestral realms.</p>\n<p>Surrounded by masks and statues in the dimly lit storage den, who seemed to be watching, Hoyt dispensed with the white archival gloves he had previously been instructed to wear. He then began, gently, to play a sanza.</p>\n<p>“And then,” Hoyt recalls, “It was — <i>Pffuuumm</i>, you could just feel the energy all of a sudden in the room.” Touching the instrument with bare skin invited a rush that the gloves had shielded. “There was a feeling of gratitude,” he said, “of ‘Oh, cool — somebody’s reactivating this instrument.’ Somebody’s actually, finally returning it to its proper use.” Hoyt grinned. “It was like they were going, ‘Yeah, we needed to hear this’” — “they,” in this case, referring not to the MARKK staff watching as he acquainted himself with the museum’s African instruments, but to the audience of masks and statues overhead. “If it happens, you just feel it,” he said, referring to the rush of presence he feels when an instrument has been successfully “un-muted.” As soon as you put your lips on the embouchure, a certain feeling happens….”</p>\n<p>Born in London in 1957 to an English mother and a Jamaican father, Hoyt’s early acculturation came at a time when the British Empire was in free fall, as many of its colonies, including Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, and Uganda, had recently won their independence. Artists, intellectuals, and musicians of the African diaspora converged on the fallen and swinging capital, forging a new era of Pan-African thought. Hoyt’s early mentors were of this milieu, including the Trini filmmaker Horace Ové and the exiled South African jazz trumpeter and flautist Mongezi Feza. In Australia, he was embraced by the First Nations painters Clifford Possum, Turkey Tolson Tjupurrula, and Johnny Warangkula Tjupurrula. Later on in New York, he ran with the pioneering Afrofuturist MC and visual artist <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/tag/rammellzee/\">Rammellzee</a>, as well as cultural critic and musician Greg Tate and the band Burnt Sugar the Arkestra Chamber. In Paris, he accompanied Louise Bourgeois on recordings of her poetry and composed for Grace Jones. His list of friends and collaborators is long and illustrious, but nowadays, Hoyt is increasingly focused on ancestral ties, and is coordinating recording dates in museum basements instead of commercial studios. </p>\n<p>The process of “un-muting” first occurred to Hoyt in 2017 at the Berlin phonographic archive, while he was studying the wax cylinders that archaeologist Leo Frobenius recorded in the Congo a century before.<strong> </strong>Wax cylinder recordings typically feature a bed of unruly static, through which distant intimations of highs can be heard. The rest — overtones, textural detail, any semblance of bass or mid-range frequencies — is left to the imagination. Unsatisfied with daydreaming, Hoyt decided to cut a new path.</p>\n<p>“With the phonographic recordings that Frobenius did, afterwards, he acquired the instruments that people had been playing. So, I thought, ‘Well, we’ve got all of these instruments, which are in these ethnographic museums. I can play them. I’ve collected them over years, and they should be sounded.’”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037093/satch-hoyt-artist-freeing-museum-musical-instruments/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>There are people in my life who are the most wonderful gift givers—always thoughtful, always unique, always spot-on. I’ve learned some lessons from these friends and family members on how to be a really excellent gift giver, and I’m sharing them with you today. These gift-giving ideas apply to any occasion—from holidays to birthdays and every little celebration in between. Here’s to sharing meaningful gifts with the people we love.</p>\n    <p>People tell you what they love, and thoughtful gift-giving starts with <i>listening</i> in those moments. With everyone in my life, I’ve been listening to what they say and tuning into what excites them. I keep an ear out for gift ideas all year round so I’m not rushing when the holidays (or birthdays) arrive.<br/>Have they started a new hobby? Ask how it’s going and glean inspiration from there. Are they making a big transition into retirement or moving across the country? Listen for ways to help out, celebrate, or honor the milestone. The best gifts are the ones that show someone you notice the little things they’re loving or pursuing. </p>\n    <p>Don’t count on yourself to remember the ideas you pick up through all of your listening. Figure out a way to collect the information and organize it. I mainly use the iPhone Notes app. Joe and I have a shared note with a list of the birthdays of people in our lives. Underneath each name, I’ll write down thought starters for gifts and things I know they enjoy. I also save some ideas verbally in the Voice Memos app, which is an easy way to get ideas out of my head in the moment so I can revisit them later.</p>\n    <p>If you’re stuck, don’t be afraid to ask the person for a short list of exactly what they want. Some people shy away from being this direct or think it takes the magic out of gifting. I think it’s a perfectly reasonable way to ensure you’re giving a gift that will be used and enjoyed. When I ask for a list, I find the gifting experience just as enjoyable as when I think of gift ideas on my own. This leads me to my next point…</p>\n    <p>Don’t worry about coming up with the “perfect” gift idea. You don’t have to surprise them with something unexpected either! Choosing a gift from their wish list is a wonderful way to delight them <i>and</i> get them something they really want. I got Joe a specific pair of shoes he asked for on his birthday, and his reaction was as if it was a total surprise. He was so excited!! It reminded me that true surprises are overrated sometimes. </p>\n    <p>Watch out for the temptation to overcompensate, especially when you’re not sure what your giftee wants. When it comes to gift-giving, we often end up spending too much, which makes everyone uncomfortable. I think of the episode of <i>The Office</i> where Michael gave a video iPod in the group exchange when the spending limit was $20. <br/>Often, sentimental gifts mean as much (if not more) than costly items. For Joe’s birthday this year, I recorded a video about why I love him and the kids did too. It was a unique way to capture this moment in time and it didn’t cost a thing. If overcompensating is a pattern of yours, hopefully the ideas in this post will help you avoid it! <br/>For more gift-giving inspiration, I’ll be sharing my holiday gift guide on Wit &amp; Delight this month! Until then, browse <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/11/holiday-gift-guide-2023/\">last year’s gift guide</a> to get the gift ideas flowing.</p>\n    <p>Kate is the founder of Wit &amp; Delight.

    "body": "<p>Swapping favorite reads is my favorite form of social currency. I devoured some really special books this year and felt it was the right time to compile a list of the ones that stayed on my mind long after I read the last page. My criteria for what makes a read share-worthy extends beyond just liking the book. Many of these authors made me feel uncomfortable and squeamish, and that’s how I like it—but that’s not to say I don’t enjoy an escapist book.<br/>Today I’m sharing a short and incomplete list of the books I couldn’t stop talking about this year.</p>\n<p>Ever heard of a “Messy Perfectionist” before? Katherine Morgan Schafler’s <i>The Perfectionist’s Guide to Losing Control</i> resonated with me deeply because it delves into the origins and complexities of perfectionism, offering a 360-degree perspective on the many ways it manifests itself. I found Schafler’s insights and personal anecdotes refreshing. She suggests we discard the label “recovering perfectionist” (one I have subscribed to) and instead look at perfectionism as a superpower to be harnessed for good rather than hold us back. <br/>I read this book twice this year and plan to pick it up again over the holiday break.</p>\n<p>In <i>Bittersweet</i>,<i> </i>Susan Cain explores the concept of bittersweetness and how embracing both positive and negative emotions can lead to a richer and more fulfilling life. Through beautiful personal stories and research, Cain argues bittersweetness is an essential part of the human experience and that it can help us appreciate the beauty and fragility of life.<br/>This book touched parts of myself I had long shuttered away as weird, sensitive, and something I should never express in public. Yet they’re so core to who I am. Susan Cain continues to be a champion for sensitive, quiet, deep thinkers.</p>\n<p><i>Slowing</i> is a guide to living a slower, more intentional life. It offers practical strategies for reducing stress, increasing mindfulness, and finding more joy in the present moment. This book is organized around the process of learning to slow down, which I found incredibly helpful. We can’t run before we can walk, and <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/10/how-to-slow-down/\">slowing down in adulthood</a> is most definitely a learned skill.</p>\n<p>A time-travel love story meets workplace comedy with the twists and turns of a spy thriller. This book defies genres and delighted me with its whip-smart prose and deeply human characters.</p>\n<p>Everyone has an opinion about this book. I love it like I do a flawed but well-intentioned friend. I admire the creative choices July makes in all her work. Her willingness to leave things unapologetically messy and self-serving made her the perfect artist to crash into the public domain, shouting about the indignities of being a woman of a certain age. Post-childbearing deserves to take center stage and be seen. There’s something about that feeling of wildness that precisely captures the awakening I’ve just started to experience, and I know I’m not alone. <br/>It is interesting to hear what people under <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/10/turning-40-lessons-learned/\">the age of forty</a> think about the book. They’re often wide-eyed, terrified, and turned off by its barbaric and messy nature. To them, I say, you’ll get it when you’re ready.</p>\n<p>This book is essential for anyone brave enough to take their creative expressions seriously. Turn to any page and find a reason to keep pursuing that nagging urge to make something meaningful from the mystery of intuition.</p>\n<p>Like so many of you, the poem that made Maggie Smith famous came at the exact time I needed it most. This is the story of what happened to her marriage and career afterward.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

Sorting needs versus wants can be a tricky business, akin to sorting out the opinions others have of you versus the ones you have of yourself—murky territory for lifelong people pleasers. Where do I begin and who should I be in the end?<br/>Here lies the link between our perceived worthiness and how we spend. And it is one of the reasons my relationship with money has never been great. <br/>This concept became starkly clear as I cataloged my closet using the digital app <a href=\"https://whering.co.uk/\">Whering</a>. I’ll write about this in another post because it’s incredibly helpful. The process itself made me <i>nauseated—</i>also up for discussion in a forthcoming post. My <i>stuff</i> is an accumulation of my personas—all pieces of a whole, but not the whole me. I am done carrying the weight of all that. <br/>I’ve taken a curious view of my spending habits—<i>sans shame</i>—and I can see both sides of the coin. I see products that I do not want to live without. And when I look at what I use <i>every single day</i>, it becomes clearer what needs to go. Focusing on what you really like makes it a lot easier to let go of what you don’t. <br/>If you had to pick up and move right now or downsize significantly, what would you take with you? What do you miss when you’re away from home? They are good questions to help narrow in on where your needs and wants align in a Venn diagram and pinpoint the products worth the spend. Here are mine at this moment in time.</p>\n<p><i>$850</i><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3qw4C42\">This espresso machine</a> is the first thing I touch in the morning. I use it multiple times a day and it has held up nicely over the past four years. Embarrassingly, I could not live without it. Read more about this espresso machine in my <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/03/delonghi-la-specialista-espresso-machine-review/\">product review blog post</a>. <i>This product was gifted to me as part of a partnership.</i></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ginnysimsceramics.com/shop\">These mugs</a> are made by hand in Ginny’s Minneapolis studio. Something about grabbing your favorite mug makes the ritual of coffee in the morning significantly better. Full stop. </p>\n<p><del>$699</del> $599<a href=\"https://hearthdisplay.com/products/hearth-display?sca_ref=5623484.023SkepF7Z&amp;utm_source=uppromote&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=4040\">The Hearth Display</a> is how I keep track of my kids’ stuff, how my kids keep track of their stuff, and how Joe keeps track of our stuff. What I love about this display is it’s physically hanging in my office. My family can track our calendar, routine, and to-do lists without needing to bug me for instructions or a list. Hearth also has a handy AI “helper” that allows you to text items that need to be added to your calendar. I send my kids’ sports schedules, lunches, field trips, and events in a text message and VOILA, they’re on the calendar. It’s the single best device I’ve added to our family’s life. <i>This product was gifted to me as part of a partnership.</i></p>\n<p><i>$278</i><br/>You can throw <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-7907352\">these silk PJs</a> in the wash and they feel great on your skin. Also, I look really good in them. The cut is 10/10. </p>\n<p><i>$182</i><br/>I’ve tried many vitamin C products over the years and <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-8458929\">this one</a> is the GOAT. Worth every penny you’d save not buying other products that do what this one does. </p>\n<p><i>$56</i><br/>My skin always looks really good when I wear <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-6873408\">this sunscreen</a>. It can even replace a moisturizer, thus extending the life of my fancy nighttime moisturizer. <i>This product was gifted to me by the brand.</i></p>\n<p><i>$20 for a pack of 10</i><br/>I’ve purchased <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3BPw19N\">these sheet masks</a> seven times in the past three years. They add an instant zap of moisture to my skin. The price is reasonable enough that I don’t feel too guilty using them regularly. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/10/best-products-in-my-daily-routine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

And there’s a lot to navigate when it comes to neutral <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/03/choosing-a-paint-color/\">paint color selection</a>.<br/>I wanted to share a few of the best neutral paint colors I’ve used in our homes, why I’ve been drawn to them, and what I think they bring to a room. In the list below, I’m including four very different colors: white, cream, light pink (which visually reads as neutral), and black.<br/>If you’re deciding on a neutral paint color for your home, I hope this post serves as a helpful resource for you. This is also a great post to bookmark for your future design projects!</p>\n    <p><i>Where I’ve used this color: </i>The <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/01/basement-family-room-paint-reveal/\">basement family room</a> in our current home and the main floor in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2020/04/were-moving-a-goodbye-to-the-house-that-built-our-family-of-5/\">our previous home</a>.<br/>This is a crisp white that doesn’t feel sterile. It’s a warm color but because it doesn’t have too many yellow tones, it doesn’t read as cream. As design trends are moving toward warmer colors, this is a great classic white paint color to use.</p>\n    <p><i>Where I’ve used this color: </i>The <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/01/basement-family-room-paint-reveal/\">basement family room</a> in our current home.<br/>If you’re seeking a light neutral color that has a bit more visual weight to it, Sail Cloth might be the color for you. It’s a warm color that’s a step more creamy than White Dove. If you want to highlight the contrast between two neutrals, you could pair Sail Cloth and White Dove together like I did in our basement family room.</p>\n    <p><i>Where I’ve used this color: </i>The trim in both the <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/08/entryway-design-elements/\">entryway</a> and <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/03/guest-room-design-wallpaper-paint/\">guest room</a> in our current home.<br/>Setting Plaster is a great color to use if you want something a step beyond white or cream that isn’t <i>too </i>saturated. While it is light pink, it still reads as a neutral color and is a versatile option for so many kinds of rooms.</p>\n    <p><i>Where I’ve used this color:</i> The cabinetry in our <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2016/03/wd-renovation-domino-magazine/\">previous home’s kitchen</a>.<br/>This is a beautiful black-gray color that brings depth without overwhelming an entire room. Sometimes, a really dark black color can feel so overpowering it dominates every other design feature in a space. Wrought Iron has a softness to it that I really love.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

That was one of the big secrets I had tucked under my pillow. Life is busy and I don’t have the energy to puff myself up and cheerlead anymore. What I can do, however, is slow down enough to notice when I need rest. <br/>The dichotomy of being bone tired and having a renewed sense of purpose in life is fascinating. It’s like learning to tame a new kind of beast, one that responds to tenderness rather than domineering, alpha-like control. Life is busy, getting things done matters, and enjoyment matters, too. So what does the balance look like? How is slowing down even possible in a busy season of life?<br/>I don’t have a perfect system. But I am not willing to go back to “keeping up” or feeling <a href=\"https://housecall.substack.com/p/how-to-stop-focusing-on-what-you\">a pervasive sense of lack</a>. Instead, I have a values-based approach, a willingness to keep practicing these habits, and a lot of forgiveness for myself. Because I’m tired. And I’m alive. </p>\n<p>When I’m rushing through life, I’ve noticed my pace is reflected through physical cues in my body. A few examples include:</p>\n<p>In practicing slowness, the most important thing for me is to notice and gently redirect these physical responses. I unclench my jaw, take a few slow, deep breaths, loosen my grip on the wheel, and sit up straight with relaxed shoulders. Keep in mind that your physical responses to busyness may look different than mine. Tune into what they are for you and slowly begin to redirect them.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/10/how-to-slow-down/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>40th reunion. 40. How did she get so old so fast? She was popular and had plans. A “most likely to…” type. Succeed. Be on TV. Own a beach house in La Jolla. She did none of that and didn’t want any of that, but the party at Penmar Golf Course — $100 for hors d’oeuvres with an open bar — has her feeling jittery, thinking about what might have been. Most likely to become a cliché is more like it. She kept the yearbook, Venice High 1985, and opens it periodically to reconcile it with what she sees in the mirror. She’s not entirely unhappy. Her hair is still blonde, no bangs glued straight with gel! Her blue eyes look tired now but mascara helps. And she’s bigger, like everyone else. But her tits look good, even better than back when she survived on diet coke and Marlboro lights. She will not take Ozempic, at least just yet, like her friends. No Botox either but she knows it’s just a matter of time. Everything is just a matter of time.</p>\n<p>She looks at the scrawl on the back page — “My one regret: not asking you out…” — from the skinny kid with the big nose and curly mop, the one who became a writer. She probably would have said no but as the years go by, she’s developed an abstract crush on him. She’s followed his career, read a story here and there, a blog where he talks about his divorce. Divorce! When she read that, she got a tingle. She’s married and living a perfectly fine, decent, good life. But knowing he’s free out there is fun, harmless; she smiles mischievously when she sees his name on the rsvp list. She knows her husband would have no interest so she buys one ticket.</p>\n<p>What will she wear? A teal linen dress, tan flats, simple; she remembers he was short so she doesn’t want to tower over him but she does wear a push up bra so a little cleavage shows, casually, like she didn’t mean it, her boobs are so big she can’t help it kind of thing. She puts the yearbook in the large leather bag she inherited from her recently dead mother. She is hoping that maybe, after a cocktail, she could get him to sign it again, let him know that she’s followed his career, hint that it’s not too late though for what she doesn’t know. She feels reckless. Giddy.</p>\n<p>He looks different, bald now, a graying overgrown goatee; they all have changed, but she recognizes him from his author photos so she walks up, tipsy, and says, “Hey Nathan!” and he says, “Hi!” as he squints at the name tag pinned to her chest with a picture from high school on it. She says, “Mallory. We went to high school together!” and he says, “I think all of us here did!” And they laugh, she can feel her face reddening from the tequila, she’s half a margarita in. He says he doesn’t remember her and she pauses. It’s too late to run away so she pulls out the yearbook, flips to the back, points at the exact words he wrote. “You wanted to ask me out but never did!” and he says, “Huh, that sounds about right.” And she says, “Why not? Why didn’t you Nathan?” thinking that using his name will create some intimacy and he says, “I don’t know,” but he is charming enough now to say, “I was an asshole for not trying” in a tone that is more polite than flirtatious.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/getaway-car-rebecca-tiger/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>My prehistoric grandmother, exemplar of Generation W (W for Waste), shamelessly threw away new, unopened packets of Tico’s Tacos “sizzlin’ hot” salsa.</p>\n<p>Decades later I’m haggling with squatters to excavate Tico’s Tacos “sizzlin’ hot” salsa packets from garbage dumps. I showcase the packets alongside similarly excavated fast food detritus—styrofoam packaging, plastic cups and lids, faded wax-paper wrappers—all lovingly collected in a gallery behind glass. We’re rabidly nostalgic for these sorts of things because the Tico’s Tacos chain, like every fast food chain, no longer exists. Some of its architecture survives, such as dilapidated sombrero rooftops once neon-lit, and Tico the Cat statues waving hola from atop tumbledown signage. But mostly, reminders of the before times have vanished.</p>\n<p>I curate Portals to the Past on Mission St, inside the protected Zone. The gallery is three blocks east of the checkpoint, a razor-wire interface between us and the hungry world. Lately the hungry have been trying to breach our razor-wire. My contact, Zook, the squatter who led the most recent excavation for me—he claims the hungry are planning to attack again in three nights, the same goddamned night as my Tico’s Tacos exhibition opening.</p>\n<p>“You should delay your party,” old Zook says, smelling of urine. We’re just outside the checkpoint.</p>\n<p>“Why are you telling me about this?”</p>\n<p>“Telling you about what.”</p>\n<p>“The attack.”</p>\n<p>“Because, young lady, I like you. You give me work.” His toothless grin seems lecherous. I ignore it.</p>\n<p>We finish our transaction: one box of ancient and interesting restaurant condiments in exchange for one box of jackets and boots. Then Zook’s limping off into the smoky urban wilds beyond the checkpoint.</p>\n<p>It’ll be sundown soon. Portable flood lights flicker on. Security sentries inspect my ID, rush me back through the gate to safety, and I traipse down an empty Mission St sidewalk towards the gallery, eager to examine my box of treasure. But Zook’s claim about the attack irritates me. If he’s correct, my soirée will be a bust. People will be too afraid to come.</p>\n<p>Dean phones as I pass the old California Shakes coffee shop. “Did Zook get anything good?” he says.</p>\n<p>“We have a problem. He insisted there’s going to be….” I stop myself, realizing I’m likely the only one in the Zone who’s aware of this supposed attack. Saying nothing will guarantee that people can attend the soirée. “Actually, never mind.”</p>\n<p>“Never mind what.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t worry about it.”</p>\n<p>“Um, okay, so about the Ranger Rick cups, I wasn’t able to fully clean them. There’s smoke damage….” Dean updates me on this and more, but I’m distracted, conflicted about whether I should alert Security. It’d be the right thing to do. However, I’ve been working on this exhibition for months, putting so much care into it. And I really need the business. And further, Zook could be mistaken; maybe the attack is mere rumor.</p>\n<p>“Gotta go, Dean.” I disconnect the call.</p>\n<p>The gallery is wedged between a dental clinic and a market. To the east loom unoccupied green-glass skyscrapers—stilled giants, generals without wars. As always there’s not much traffic on the once-busy thoroughfare; the absence of activity creates vacuous silence and loneliness, but I’m used to it. Earlier in the day I’d unlocked and raised the gallery’s steel shielding, hoping that rare passersby might pause and admire my window display. Presently I’m touched to see an attractive young man viewing the display, a menagerie of plastic rainbow straws, remnants of a Bloopee franchise. Above the straws hangs a neat hand-lettered sign advertising my Tico’s Tacos opening.</p>\n<p>“You should come!” I place Zook’s box on the sidewalk, then gesture up at the sign.</p>\n<p>The attractive young man smiles a gleaming smile, stares at my breasts, says, “Looks interesting,” which pisses me off, not because of his ogling but rather because I remember the supposed attack and its repercussions for my soirée. “Yes, it will be interesting,” I say, flirtatiously nibbling my lower lip, concluding that old Zook is full of shit, that the attack is indeed rumor and nothing more.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/scarcity-ian-mahm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

One that uses less fuel and spews less CO2 into the air than individual cars. The space they create is a rare one: an environment where strangers are connected by the simple need to get somewhere. You can’t buy anything on a bus (like you can on a plane or train), you can’t upgrade either – you’re all in it together. As more and more public places become privatized, I feel there is a fragility to this sort of space. The Greyhound is more library than shopping mall, more community centre than curated retail space. In our post-Covid world, these vehicles also remind us of a before-time when we could sit maskless in our Greyhound bubbles, rubbing shoulders with strangers, safely breathing alongside each other without fear. They might yet become symbols for a way we once lived in each other’s presence.</p></blockquote><h2>\n\t\t\t\t\tMore picks from <i>Orion Magazine</i>\n\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2023/01/26/messengers-from-the-past/\">Messengers From the Past</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“I may have seen all there is to see at the Bosque yet I keep returning each year.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>At Disney World, the magic doesn’t unfold the same way for everyone. In his essay, Daniel Currell places two families in sharp relief: one stumbling through a gauntlet of 6 a.m. wake-up calls, app alerts, and frantic booking scrambles; the other drifting effortlessly from ride to ride, their day smoothed by money. The contrast is stark and telling. A park once imagined as a democratic playground for American families has hardened into a stratified experience, a theme-park parable of the country’s widening inequality. The fairy tale endures—but only for those who can afford it.</p><blockquote><p>When you are at a Disney park, you will inevitably hear “When You Wish Upon a Star,” Disney’s unofficial anthem. Disney adopted that song in the 1940s; its second line, “makes no difference who you are,” encapsulated its egalitarian ethos. Now the song reads to me like nostalgic, middle-class cosplay that helps us relive the Disney that Walt created. The roughly $90 to get your family cut-the-line access to a premier ride (on top of what, for a family of four, could easily be over $700 dropped on tickets already) is the real Disney, the one the market created.</p></blockquote><h2>More picks on Disney</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/07/16/dark-ride-to-the-source/\">Dark Ride to the Source</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Holding on to Joy at Disneyland.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/02/12/yesterday-tomorrow-and-banished-forever/\">Yesterday, Tomorrow, and Banished Forever</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“The Andersons were kicked out of Disneyland’s most exclusive club.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>When Laurie Abraham was diagnosed with colon cancer 14 months ago, she realized just how taboo pooping is as a topic of conversation. In particular, <i>women</i> pooping. As she went through treatment, Abraham navigated an array of awkward conversations and personal revelations, which she details in a witty, illuminating essay for <i>The Cut</i>: </p><blockquote><p>How deep did my own aversion to the scatological run? I think back: When other moms got their toddlers the classic</p><i>Everyone Poops,</i>I was like, “Do we have to?” (We didn’t.) As an 8-year-old, my younger daughter, Tess, liked to lope around the house yelling, “Poop, poop in your face!” I laughed when, at 3, she’d begun riding her rocking horse full tilt, clad only in a little black cowboy hat. I laughed when, at the same age, Edie, her older sister, told her father to “close the fucking window” during a drive. It’s not like I couldn’t handle taboo subjects. Yet every time<i>poop</i>tripped off Tess’s tongue, I’d exclaim, “Stop! Tess!” My face would contort. It contorts as I’m writing this.<p>It may be partly a generational difference; my now 21- and 25-year-old daughters still will announce their specific bathroom plans—</p><i>ladies, please.</i>But the location of my cancer must be part of its befoulment. Susan Sontag is famous for exposing the negative cultural stories that cling to cancer, but what is the lowest of the low? “In the hierarchy of the body’s organs, lung cancer is felt to be less shameful than rectal cancer,” she asserted in<i>Illness As Metaphor.</i>I also felt a shock of recognition at her observation that while tuberculosis, the other focus of her book, is linked to “delicacy, sensitivity … and powerlessness,” cancer represents “whatever seem[s] ruthless, implacable, predatory.”<p>See, colon cancer is unfeminine! (Yes, she was talking cancer in general, but the point stands.) Even the medical Establishment has spread that message. Two of the younger female patients I interviewed said doctors explicitly told them colon cancer is an “old white man’s disease,” even though it’s only slightly more prevalent in men than in women.</p><p>More broadly, colons and what comes out of them are the permitted playground of men. Delightfully, there is a whole body of research that backs this up. Bathroom graffiti is more plentiful and crap-filled in men’s toilet stalls than in women’s, according to a psychology professor named Nick Haslam. The author of</p><i>Psychology in the Bathroom,</i>he cites a study in which a “female experimenter who excused herself to use the bathroom was evaluated more negatively than one who excused herself to get some paperwork.” When a male experimenter repeated the exercise, the judginess vanished. A college student surveyed for a journal article titled “Fecal Matters: Habitus, Embodiments, and Deviance” summed up the situation: “Women are supposed to be non-poopers.”</blockquote><h2>More picks about health</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/06/26/biohacking-conference-asprey/\">Snake Venom, Urine, and a Quest to Live Forever: Inside a Biohacking Conference Emboldened by MAHA</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“While biohacking isn’t new, the rise of Robert F.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>Resurfacing from the <i>Aeon</i> archive, Katherine Harvey’s 2018 essay marked her first in-depth exploration of medieval sex—a journey that later blossomed into her book, “The Fires of Lust.” This upfront piece studies medieval Europe’s startlingly frank approach to the dangers of sex. Too much sex was dangerous, and too little sex could outright kill you. Quite the ride! </p><blockquote><p>Medieval physicians saw too much sex as a real medical concern. Conventional wisdom held that several noblemen died of sexual excess. John of Gaunt, the 14th-century first duke of Lancaster, allegedly ‘died of putrefaction of his genitals and body, caused by the frequenting of women, for he was a great fornicator’. Today, his symptoms would suggest venereal disease, but his contemporaries would probably have seen parallels with the case of Ralph, count of Vermandois. This 12th-century French nobleman had recently married his third wife when he fell seriously ill. During his convalescence, he was advised by his physician that he must abstain from intercourse, but disregarded this warning. When the doctor detected from Ralph’s urine that he had done so, he advised him to set his house in order, for he would be dead within three days – a prognosis that proved to be accurate.</p></blockquote><h2>More picks from Aeon</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/08/20/socrates-would-be-pleased/\">Socrates Would Be Pleased</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“With a class of college students and inmates, teaching philosophy in prison is a rowdy, honest and hopeful provocation.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/07/01/shoes-history-society/\">Walk In These</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Shoes are deeply personal, literally moulded to our lives.

    "body": "<p>In New Zealand, there’s a candy assortment of gangs. Most often, they ride on motorcycles, deal in narcotics, prostitution, illegal guns and fear. Recruitment’s booming as New Zealand’s underpaid police scarper to Australia, and dysfunctional kids clamber up the criminal career ladder.</p>\n<p>As a court bailiff, John Brady thought he’d seen them all: Mongrel Mob, Head Hunters, Tribesmen, Killer Beez, Black Power, you name it. But these days there was a new gang hitting the courts with increasing regularity: Grey Power.</p>\n<p>Today, he was in charge of Edith Smith, aged eighty-five. She was on so much medication it was hard to keep track of; pills for rheumatoid arthritis, underactive thyroid, high blood pressure, fluid retention, probiotics, magnesium (“keeps your stools soft”), and so much more. It takes her an age to swallow them all. She has to use a walker to get into court and John helps her to the dock.</p>\n<p>“You’re a good boy, John,” she says, looking at him with rheumy eyes. She reminds John of his grandma. Yet this little ol’ lady is apparently in charge of the most notorious gang in the country.</p>\n<p>“You’ll be right, Edith,” he says and gives her a small smile.</p>\n<p>“All rise for His Honourable Judge Adams.”</p>\n<p>“Edith, you’re meant to stand,” whispers John.</p>\n<p>“Stand? I’ve only just sat down. Bugger that.”</p>\n<p>“Court is in session, Crown versus Edith Smith.”</p>\n<p>It’s a first appearance, and Edith is facing a raft of charges. The prosecution alleges that Edith is the mastermind behind some of the most infamous crimes reported in New Zealand. The “headless chicken” where a known paedophile was mangled by a pensioner’s mobility scooter. The “rolled-over-Rowan”, a repeat rapist out on a technicality who met his demise under a pensioner’s Rolls Royce. And the “upsa-Daisy” where a woman who had scammed millions out of the elderly was found dead, floating upside down in a pensioner’s duck pond. In each case, the pensioners involved claimed, “It was an accident”, “I didn’t have my glasses on”, “My hearing aids weren’t plugged in” or “I’ve got dementia, dear” and all were let off the hook.</p>\n<p>Edith lets out a little chuckle as each one is mentioned. “OOhh, that was a good one,” she says at the upsa-Daisy. “I remember that one.”</p>\n<p>John sighs. This is not boding well.</p>\n<p>“Does the defendant have counsel?” asks the Judge.</p>\n<p>“Edith, he’s speaking to you,” whispers John.</p>\n<p>“What?! Speak up, young man.”</p>\n<p>The Judge shouts across the courtroom, “I SAID, DO YOU HAVE COUNSEL?”</p>\n<p>“No need to yell. I’m not deaf. You just need to enunciate your words better.”</p>\n<p>John had never seen Judge Adams do an eye roll before today.</p>\n<p>“Your Honour, we understand Ms Smith has declined counsel,” says the prosecution trying to be helpful.</p>\n<p>“Ms Smith, is that true?”</p>\n<p>“Well, if you’re talking about that pimple-faced boy, fresh out of law school, I thought I might do a better job myself.”</p>\n<p>“Ms Smith, these are serious charges you’re facing, and the prosecution has already indicated they’re opposed to bail. It’s in your best interests to have counsel represent you.”</p>\n<p>“As I’ve said all along, I’ve done nothing wrong. All I do is operate a Garden Club for like-minded pensioners. We like to do a bit of collective weeding.”</p>\n<p>“Your Honour, I must interject. A search of Ms Smith’s home produced copious evidence pointing to the Garden Club being a front for illegal activities where Ms Smith and her associates seem to have taken it upon themselves to mete out their own form of justice.”</p>\n<p>“Like I said, we do a spot of weeding.”</p>\n<p>“Ms Smith, I’m going to take a half-hour break. During that time I urge you to instruct counsel. Court’s adjourned.” The Judge slams down his gavel, a tad too enthusiastically.</p>\n<p>“A bit tetchy, isn’t he, John?” says Edith.</p>\n<p>“Edith, let me help you find a lawyer.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t you worry, pet. It’ll be all right. Anyone would think our Garden Club was doing something wrong with all the fuss.”</p>\n<p>John couldn’t believe what he was hearing.</p>\n<p>“Edith, it is wrong. You can’t…”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/grey-power-anne-wilkins/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>After our boss quit the senior executives replaced him with a coffee machine. They said that the consultant had delivered his report and that the replacement was appropriate and cost effective.</p>\n    <p>Each morning we gathered around the shiny appliance and said good morning. We even gave it a name which someone printed out from the label maker and pressed tenderly against the metal: “Sean.”</p>\n    <p>We poured in the beans lovingly and caressed the button and smiled as Sean internally alchemized them into the fragrant liquor that poured lusciously from the vents. Motivation improved. Team morale was at an all-time high.</p>\n    <p>Sean brought the team together in ways that we hadn’t experienced before. In those soft moments just before he ground the beans sometimes someone would be compelled to share something from deep within their private self.</p>\n    <p>“I don’t think I love my second child.” Said Linda, who usually only spoke about payroll.</p>\n    <p>“I think my erectile dysfunction is somehow linked to being jealous of my wife.” Said Brad, from IT, who usually never responded to people’s emails.</p>\n    <p>At the end of financial year staff evaluation survey we all gave Sean the highest appraisal. He was an irreplaceable part of the office – able to inspire us to the highest level of performance, help us realize our potential and foster consistent outputs.</p>\n    <p>We kept gathering around him every morning, collaborating and ideating freely.</p>\n    <p>Someone even worked out how to put little electronic inspirational messages on his display:</p>\n    <p>“Be the change you want to see in the office.”</p>\n    <p>“Your attitude is determined by your altitude.”</p>\n    <p>But after a while one of the executives grew suspicious of Sean and felt he was going outside his scope. The executive decided to put him back in his place and one sad morning we arrived to find Sean had been redeployed to the building manager’s office.</p>\n    <p>We were bereft and aimless for a time, until the boss told us a new addition would be arriving soon to bring the team culture back to an optimum level. He said he had recently read a book about how to foster collegiality for productivity and was keen to implement his learnings.</p>\n    <p>Then she arrived – shiny and new looking like a picture of perfection. She was a sparkling new toasted sandwich maker. Her name was Sharon.</p>\n    <p>As we pressed her lever down gently, the ripples of satisfaction were palpable through the team. Morale was having an uptick. Sitting around eating the toasted sandwiches, we all basked in the sensation of a hug from a mother that we never had.</p>\n    <p>We were sluggish with carbs, too contented to complain about anything, so after nodding to each other cordially we went methodically back to our tasks.</p>\n    <p><strong>Fiona Murray</strong> <i>is a writer and social worker living in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney.</i></p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/everydayfiction\">If you want to keep EDF around, Patreon is the answer.</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/irreplaceable-fiona-murray/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Jacob, a TV journalist for a regional station, was setting up the shot with Tommy, his cameraman, when Eris first approached him.</p>\n<p>“I saw what happened,” she said.</p>\n<p>“You saw the trampoline take off?” Jacob asked, giving her a quick look over as he did so, seeing if she was sufficiently telegenic for his report.</p>\n<p>“Yes, the whole thing. It was awful.”</p>\n<p>Jacob weighed her up. Local accent, but clear voice. Clean, well-dressed, nice features, not emotionally constipated. She would do.</p>\n<p>So Eris made her television debut in Jacob’s report from the scene of the fair, where unexpectedly high winds had whipped an unsecured trampoline and its four juvenile occupants momentarily aloft. No major injuries unfortunately, so not reaching the tragedy level that would make the national news and so boost his profile, but better than nothing.</p>\n<p>Two weeks later, arriving at the scene of a fire at a hospital two towns away, Jacob recognized Eris in the bystanders.</p>\n<p>“I had an appointment at the eye clinic,” she explained. “I’d just arrived when the fire broke out.”</p>\n<p>Remembering how well she’d come across in his previous report, Jacob decided to use her again. As before, she was a good witness, emotive and descriptive.</p>\n<p>Jacob thought little of this coincidence until three weeks later, when he attended the motorway pile-up. He’d arrived a bit late on the scene and was setting up a favorable angle with his cameraman when he saw one of the national broadcasters interviewing Eris.</p>\n<p>He listened in and heard her state, “Yes, I was driving along on the way to meet an old school chum when the tanker veered right across the road. I managed to brake in time but…”</p>\n<p>All through the rest of the summer, Jacob would arrive at every significant tragedy or accident, murder scene or disturbance and Eris would already be there. Even when he wasn’t working, he would see her being interviewed on his TV screen. She was never directly involved or affected, but always close enough to witness. It turned out she was even a neighbor of the “Sofa Strangler,” the serial killer who was caught that summer. “He seemed like a nice man,” she opined.</p>\n<p>Other journalists noticed her regular appearances on their screens. There was initially some suspicion that she was actively involved in these diverse tragedies, but a cursory glance at the facts showed the impossibility of this. It simply was all just a rather unlikely coincidence.</p>\n<p>Word got around locally however and it was the town’s Mayor who first approached Eris, gifting her tickets to a theatre performance at the other side of town while his inauguration was taking place in the Town Hall. It was an astute move, as it turned out, as a hostage crisis broke out at the theatre just as Eris arrived. She was subsequently interviewed about it on live TV.</p>\n<p>Local companies started approaching Eris with offers of free products if she would only stay away from their stores and offices. One less scrupulous businessman offered her money to attend the premises of his business rival and as Eris approached, the building was levelled by an engine that fell off a passing jet airplane.</p>\n<p>Despite these unique earning opportunities, fame wasn’t kind to Eris. She now had the reputation as a jinx and was consequently shunned by all and sundry. She was unwelcome at any of the local shops, while people actively crossed to the opposite side of the street when they saw her coming. Friends deserted her and even her family would only talk to her by phone.</p>\n<p>Jacob didn’t really believe that there was anything special about Eris. She didn’t have psychic powers, she wasn’t cursed. She was just unlucky, a statistical outlier, the victim of a series of coincidences, unlikely but not impossible. He knew though, that the public believed otherwise and ever alert to an opportunity to advance his career, he arranged to interview her in her home.</p>\n<p>Eris, isolated and alone, jumped at the chance to both see a familiar face and explain herself to the public, to let them see she was just a normal person.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/the-jinx-bill-cox/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Frankie, one of the managers for that day’s game, heard a commotion before we could see anything, so he held up his hand to stop us, just like John Wayne in one of those war movies we’d see at the Saturday matinees.</p>\n    <p>“What the hell is going on?” he yelled.</p>\n    <p>As we turned the corner we saw pickup trucks and semi trailers full of building materials lined up and down the street. Loud construction workers pulled materials off the trucks and piled them on our ball diamond.</p>\n    <p>Jimmy looked at me, “They can’t do this, it can’t be legal.”</p>\n    <p>“It’s gotta be a mistake,” Joey said. “If we explain to them, they’ll go away.”</p>\n    <p>Frankie and I approached a group of workers who were wrestling work fencing along one side of the street.</p>\n    <p>I tapped one of the workers, the tallest one, on his shoulder. Maybe he was the boss. Maybe he would understand. He looked at me and started to walk away.</p>\n    <p>“Mister, “ I said, “You’re at the wrong place. It can’t be here. We’ve played on this field for years. Our dads played here before the war.”</p>\n    <p>“I’m sorry, kid, the work ain’t stopping for youse kids, or anybody else” he said. “Stay out of our way. We don’t want anyone to get hurt.”</p>\n    <p>Backhoes were already starting to dig foundations for more houses and apartment buildings. Like we really needed more houses in our crowded neighborhood!!</p>\n    <p>We stood together outside of the fence, hoping it was all just a dream. We wanted to tear it down with our bare hands, but knew our parents would never support any kind of hooliganism.</p>\n    <p>More workers walking by the fence told us to go away. They told us more trailers were coming to drop off pallets of bricks and lumber. More workers would join the people already working at the lot; raucous crews of carpenters and masons to complete the destruction of our ball diamond.</p>\n    <p>The tall man who first talked to me, he wasn’t so nice when he saw us still standing at the fence. When we threw clods of dirt at the trucks, he cursed and chased us away.</p>\n    <p>“Get the hell out of here,” he yelled. “If youse don’t go home in five minutes we’re calling the cops.”</p>\n    <p>All of us shuffled down the street, shaking with rage. We bit our lips, didn’t look at each other, afraid we’d see the tears on our faces. Even though the oldest players on the teams were only 12-years-old, everyone knew that baseball players didn’t cry.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/frankcmodica/home\">Frank C Modica</a>\n      <i>is a cancer survivor and retired teacher who taught children with special needs for over 34 years.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Every time my grandpa, my mother’s father, visited us he always brought a crate of fruits or vegetables, whatever he just harvested. I remember I was in second grade when he came by with the crate and asked how I was doing in math.</p>\n    <p>“Twenty-six plus six is one,” I said.</p>\n    <p>He loved it. He was half-Irish, which made me one-eight Irish. Not much Irish, many would say, but we had our own history.</p>\n    <p>Centuries earlier expulsion waves brought tens of thousands from the Emerald Isle to our part of Central Europe. They were refugees but had standards high enough not to stop in France or Germany.</p>\n    <p>The Irish worked hard, drank hard, and intermarried with the tossed salad of Austrians, Slovaks and Hungarians. Now, after several generations, only a few know or care about having a few pints of Celtic blood. The others have been reduced to marvel why their last name is Kenedi or Onel. One thing has endured, though, and as a result all the good townspeople become Irish once a year.</p>\n    <p>Legend has it, when news arrived from Ireland about one of the more productive massacres by the British, a painting of the Madonna shed tears of blood. On the day of anniversary the faithful go to the cathedral to kiss the picture, luckily covered by glass and wiped down after each smooch by a church servant. The blood drops are faded brown, still visible enough so only the most cynical atheists would dare question the miracle.</p>\n    <p>“The blood stains will miraculously disappear the day Ireland gains total independence,” my grandpa whispered to me, standing in the long line.</p>\n    <p>Years later, after I flunked out of college the first time, I visited him. I knew he was not well, still it was surprising to find him sitting in a rickety armchair late morning. “It’s pneumonia or a bad case of influenza. Stay away, it’s probably contagious.” Then he wanted to hear about my plans for the future.</p>\n    <p>I said I was going to join the Sinn Fein since Gerry needed more volunteers. He sighed and rolled his eyes. “What for?” A frosty response from a man who had the Starry Plough banner on the wall next to the crucifix.</p>\n    <p>I said, “I’ll go to Belfast or Derry and shoot the entire magazine of my AK-47 into a bunch of English soldiers.”</p>\n    <p>He waved. “Then what?”</p>\n    <p>“Then I reload.”</p>\n    <p>He waved again. “Go tell your grandmother to boil up water for tea. That with a spoonful of honey, and in a couple of days I should be back to my vigorous self. Then you and me, we’ll be on the beach checking out the young broads in their tiny bikinis.”</p>\n    <p>Even though most family members spoke little or no English, and our combined Gaelic vocabulary barely amounted to a dozen curse words, Irish music was playing during the wake. “That was one of his last wishes,” my grandma told us. I nodded. “He was very proud of his heritage.” Grandma rolled her eyes. “No, this is for your benefit. He told me, find some Irish songs for that crazy <i>mac soith</i>.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>“Beware of the Ides of March,” Madame Hannah said, picking up the tarot card with its stormy-looking tower. The woman tapped her long black fingernails on the card. Bree wondered how the woman was able to shuffle with nails that long.</p>\n    <p>“The hides of March?” Bree asked. “What’s a March hide?” Long purple curtains covered the walls of the small room, and unscented white candles burned on the side of the little circular table.</p>\n    <p>“The Ides of March,” the fortune teller said, enunciating clearly. She flipped her hand, and her long bat-wing sleeves fluttered dramatically over the small table with its crystal ball. Bree pulled her head back to avoid getting smacked in the face. She worried about the candles.</p>\n    <p>“I’m not understanding you,” Bree sighed. “When am I supposed to be aware?”</p>\n    <p>“March 15th,” the woman frowned. “The date that Julius Caesar was murdered.” Madame Hannah looked at her as if she was a moron, but how was Bree supposed to know about Greek mythology?</p>\n    <p>“Oh well, why didn’t you just say that?” she sniffed. “March 15th is tomorrow. So what am I supposed to be looking out for?”</p>\n    <p>“Chaos and change,” the woman said dramatically, leaning so close that Bree could smell the cinnamon gum on her breath.</p>\n    <p>“Could you, like, be more specific?” Bree wrinkled her nose. “Is it like being-hit-by-a-bus type chaos, or like can’t-find-matching-socks level chaos?”</p>\n    <p>“Another card is ten dollars,” Madame set the tower card on the table and extended her hand.</p>\n    <p>“I’m good,” Bree stood, ignoring the woman’s extended palm, and walked out of the little bookshop. It was a gorgeous spring day in Chicago, and Bree took a deep breath of the fresh air, tinged only slightly with bus exhaust. Though she knew she needed to get back to her desk, she walked slowly back to her apartment, stopping by her favorite smoothie store to get a mango and chocolate super kale surprise.</p>\n    <p>The line was long, and the smoothie staff moved with a lurching apathy that made her wonder if they were all stoned.</p>\n    <p>Twenty minutes later, Bree took her smoothie from the counter and sipped the bittersweet sludge. She really needed to get back to her desk.

    "body": "<p>Sobriety is a deeply personal and often sensitive subject. The decision to embrace sobriety can stem from many reasons—rooted in health, emotional healing, and often a mix of the two. The reasons are unique to each individual and shaped by their lived experiences. When someone chooses sobriety, it can bring up emotions in others who may be struggling with their relationship with alcohol. <br/>Every story in sobriety is valid. I share my thoughts from my own journey, fully aware that my path may look nothing like yours. My experience does not define sobriety as a whole, nor does it diminish or invalidate yours. <br/>Data shows alcohol consumption in America is <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/509690/young-adults-drinking-less-prior-decades.aspx\">changing</a>. At the beginning of the year, <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/01/03/us-surgeon-general-issues-new-advisory-link-alcohol-cancer-risk.html\">a new health advisory</a> was issued linking alcohol consumption to increased cancer risk. Culturally, our relationship with sobriety is broadening. This is what my sobriety looks like today. </p>\n<p>I am eighteen and at my first house party. It is my senior year in high school. My friends and I hit it off with a group of guys entering their junior year. I stand at the far end of a swampy beer pong table, gingerly holding my red cup. Afraid and liberated, I gulp a lukewarm keg of beer, the first taste of the kind of freedom college would provide. No one was there to monitor or judge except myself. <br/>I had grown up afraid of drinking alcohol, my parents and long-term boyfriend demonizing it. I rarely saw my parents drink aside from my dad’s nightly beer, a stark departure from a drinking culture I observed in my Irish dance community. There, drinking was synonymous with everything. During trips to Ireland as a preteen in the 90s, I eyed kids my age with a Guinness, sitting at the bar with their parents. <br/>There are also memories of my grandparents: sipping Miller Light or a buttery chardonnay, eating tortilla chips, and playing cards. Their laughter is synonymous with my happy childhood, a kind of togetherness that is rare and good and worth stopping to marvel at. Today that smell of hops and salty chips brings it all back home.<br/>By the end of my 18th summer, beer signified a different kind of togetherness. A beer in my hand was connection, security, and confidence. It was a key inside places I had yet to access and a gateway to relaxed ease that had alluded me for a lifetime. <br/>Enter adulthood, and I couldn’t imagine a future without it. </p>\n<p>My relationship with alcohol was murky. At 25, I tipped over the edge, blacking out often in the month leading up to <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2019/02/how-you-find-yourself-divorced-at-27-after-11-months-of-marriage/\">my first marriage</a>. Yet I always had an “off” switch. I never worried I’d forget when enough was enough.<br/>There were times in my 30s when the draw to drink was irresistible. We bought wine in bulk during the pandemic and through our early parenting years. Wine was a daily ritual. <br/>Much of my social life has revolved around booze. Wine as an activity. Wine as a unifier. As <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2013/12/love-marriage-second-chances/\">Joe and I fell in love</a> over drinks and didn’t think twice about a weeknight martini, I had friends who decided to go sober. With it came a sense of worry we’d lose contact. Thankfully, no friendships have been lost to sobriety. <br/>I listened to stories from those who found themselves outside of once <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/01/our-friendships-evolve-because-we-do/\">close friendships</a>, othered and not offered a seat at the dinner table, hurt by the fragility of a friendship built around booze. As I asked questions about life without alcohol, they opened my eyes to a world that is just as rich in connection and flavor as all the heightened sensations I’ve come to associate with both alcohol and my relationships. <br/>The beer in hand was no longer a ticket to entry. Sobriety offered a way to access a deeper connection. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/01/why-i-quit-drinking-alcohol/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, I thought that if I acknowledged how I truly felt about it all, the delicate balance of my life would lose its shape, never to be reconstituted.<br/>We usually don’t face this circumstance unless there isn’t another option. It sits so profoundly in the dark that there isn’t a map. But we feel the threat lurking. Then something happens that turns the lights on, and there it is. We don’t always like what we see.<br/>Nothing particularly eventful happened last year. But I became “real”—real in the way we can only be when we finally allow our whole selves to be witnessed. <br/>I am only just beginning to understand what it means to be there for myself. Only beginning to take accountability for my reality.<br/>If I can tell you one thing, it’s that the things we fear facing the most are what we need to run toward. The truth really does set you free. </p>\n<p>The new year begins in earnest. We do January things even though it’s a balmy 30 degrees and not a snowflake clings to the ground. We clean out the house and make way for New Year’s intentions. We dance and drink martinis at Mancini’s. I host friends for roast lamb and cabbage and try to ignore the feeling of dread that follows me to my desk each morning. <br/>I sit at my computer. I wait to feel “good” about my career. I look at finances, which have been difficult to rightsize since laying the team off last June. There are tax bills, summer camps, and unexpected home issues that need to be paid for. Joe and I have always shared a joint bank account, but I remain in charge of the budget and big-picture view of the state of it all. I feel alone. I begin to daydream about selling everything and moving to a small cabin up north. On a beach. Anywhere but here. <br/>I go to Carlsbad with some girlfriends and forget about my troubles for 36 hours. I watch <i>Past Lives</i> on the way home and cry in public. <br/>When I arrive home, the tipping point reveals itself: Joe decides to leave his job abruptly. His toxic work environment has become impossible.<br/>It is the right thing to do. How it all went down will take me a long time to get over. I am angry. Very angry. And empathic. I agree with his decision wholeheartedly. I hold the two truths close to my heart and then feel an iciness cover everything. The show must go on, and bills are on their way.  <br/>I cut my bangs into the style of a French assassin. I feel bulletproof. I work and make pot roast and work more. I feel <i>alive</i> with purpose again. I am high on the feeling of being chased by the thought of financial ruin. <br/>I sign three months’ worth of business in a week. Maybe this is just how it has to be to feel like myself again, to feel in control and capable. I am so afraid of losing everything that I feel nothing at all. <br/>I have recurring nightmares. I walk for hours to calm down. I open up to my friend about my anger and guilt for being angry. I feel less alone in the presence of someone who sees me. I wonder if I can see myself.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/01/year-in-review-2024/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

There’s nothing wrong with big goals, but in order for them to be sustainable, to last until the following year, goals need to be doable. Second—and I believe this to be the biggest culprit of what disrupts our success—we start chasing our goals without being aware of what our lives presently look like or how we really spend our time.<strong>Becoming aware of your habits puts you in the driver’s seat and, from my experience, helps you set more appropriate, achievable goals. So how do you become aware? By tracking your habits. </strong>With all of the energy packed behind New Year’s resolutions, habit tracking may sound a little passive. Who’s got time to spend tracking their habits when what they really need to be doing is working toward the best version of themselves? <br/>Everyone.<br/>Because when you start with habit tracking, you are more likely to create achievable goals, and therefore not have to start all over next year. Progress must be preceded by awareness, otherwise, you don’t truly know where you’re coming from.<br/>A few months ago, I began scrupulously tracking my habits. I had an idea of how I spent my days, but I wanted to become clear on what I <i>really</i> spent my time doing. I already knew that <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/02/decluttering-the-mind-an-ode-to-morning-pages-2/\">I spent most mornings writing</a> (I thought) and I went to yoga a few times per week (I thought).

This awareness has led me to some incredible progress.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Only once I tracked my habits did I see the discrepancy between where I thought I spent my time and where I</p><i>really</i>spent it.

It’s life-changing, I promise.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>All you need is a notebook, a pen, and a little dedication, because you’ll need to end each day going over your habits.

    "body": "<p>Earlier this year, I shared the first post in our Wit &amp; Delight entertaining series, “<a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/08/casual-dinner-party/\">How to Host a Casual Dinner Party</a>.” This series is a collaboration between me and my friend <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lisahackwith/\">Lisa</a>. Both avid hosts, we wanted to share ideas for entertaining that are approachable and special all at once. <strong>I am so excited about our second entertaining series installment: The Dessert Party!</strong><br/>Life is full in the weeks leading up to the end of the year. Finding time to connect with friends and family can fall by the wayside, especially for those in a season when small children are part of their daily routine. <br/>Since working on this series, I’ve learned the joys of planning ahead. Thinking about ways to cut back on labor and make things special is so much easier when you’re not running on impromptu plans. Lisa and I wanted to put together a menu that would work for an afternoon gathering—think afternoon teatime, but with desserts. The concept has you delegating recipes and responsibilities to friends, which is both collaborative and fun! </p>\n<p>The idea of a dessert party is to enjoy dessert and snacks with friends or family. The menu can be casual and the workload can be split between guests so everyone makes something to share. This entertaining idea is perfect for the holiday season but it can be executed any time of year.<br/>The beauty of this kind of party is that it’s completely flexible. It can be on a weekend afternoon or evening. The guest list can be intimate or big. You can sit around a dining table or—like we did—simply gather around a coffee table in the living room. Here’s what our dessert party entailed. </p>\n<p>There were six people on our dessert party guest list, including myself. I invited a few friends who love to bake and a few friends who would rather bring savory snacks. I think six is the perfect number, but a party like this works well for scaling the guest list up or down.</p>\n<p>Because dessert is so indulgent, we designed the menu to include both sweet and savory treats. Lisa developed each of the dessert recipes. A few menu items require more time and skill; others just require a trip to the store. Three people baked desserts, three people collaborated on the charcuterie board, and I provided the bubbles as the host.<br/>For drinks, I recommend going with something special like <a href=\"https://www.champagne-billecart.fr/en/collection/brut-rose\">Billecart Brut Rose</a> or something for everyday drinking like <a href=\"https://www.shophenryandson.com/product/il-mostro-frizzante-bianco/4895?cp=true&amp;sa=false&amp;sbp=false&amp;q=true\">Il Mostro Frizzante BIANCO</a>. For those not imbibing, try <a href=\"https://drywit.com/collections/all\">Dry Wit Pippi</a>.<strong>Here’s what our menu looked like:</strong></p>\n<p>Almost everything can be done ahead of time, so the finishing touches come together pretty easily on the day of the party. For this type of party, you can include your friends in each of the prep tasks, such as:</p>\n<p>With casual parties like this one, a thrown-together feel makes everyone relaxed and comfortable in your home. Plan to sit down about 30 – 45 minutes after everyone arrives. <br/>If a collaborative prep process is not your kind of thing, set your table (or coffee table in front of the fireplace if you have one), build a fire, light candles, and put on a playlist ahead of time. Grab friends drinks once they arrive, and invite them to place their contribution on the table. Once everything has been plated, have each person share a little note about what they brought, like the delicious new cheese they found at the market, the process of piping the frosting on the cake, etc. I’ve found talking about food with friends who care about food to be lovely. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/12/dessert-party/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>“Where did you get that rug??” is one of the questions I’m asked most often. Rugs were the first big purchase decor item I started collecting when I moved into <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/06/love-letter-all-the-places-i-lived/\">my first apartment</a>. Below you’ll find my favorite places to browse and buy rugs (the former of which I am almost always doing). There is a wide variety of brands, price points, and styles represented below, for a number of reasons. <br/>Even if you plan to buy more budget-friendly rugs, I still recommend browsing brands with rugs at all price points. In my experience, getting familiar with what’s available from different designers and at different shops is one of the best ways to get to know your style and what you’re drawn to most. I’ve found that if I expose myself to unique and interesting pieces, even if they are out of my price range, I learn to easily pick out the great pieces at stores with lower price points.</p>\n<p>I love what <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15333350\">Lulu &amp; Georgia</a> is doing with their rug collaborations. The <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15333314\">Sarah Sherman Samuel collection</a> is iconic! Along with the checkerboard rug we have in our current home, we had one of the rugs from this collection in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2020/04/the-often-overlooked-importance-of-decorating-your-bedroom/\">our main bedroom</a> at our previous house and loved it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15334757\">Chairish</a> is a place I love to browse rug styles, even though most are out of my price range. On a rare occasion, I will make a lowball offer—I’ve even had said offer accepted before (the vintage rug in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/03/how-to-be-brave-with-color-and-pattern-in-your-home/\">the family room</a> is from Chairish, as is the vintage rug in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/08/entryway-design-elements/\">the entryway</a>)! They still cost an arm and a leg, but they are forever pieces from a reputable site. Keep in mind that the Chairish return policy is very strict, so if you buy one here and do not like it, you only have forty-eight hours to submit your return.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3KGVIcg\">Loloi</a> is an amazing source for budget-friendly and kid-friendly (or pet-friendly!) rugs. They carry rugs in so many gorgeous styles, no matter your personal design taste. We have used them in areas where we know the kids and dog will play hard or may be more likely to spill. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15332981\">Annie Selke</a> carries super high-quality rugs for modern and traditional spaces. I love the punchy colors and graphic prints. We got an <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15332966\">Annie Selke runner</a> (pictured above) for our <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/03/everything-you-want-to-know-about-our-basement-kitchenette/\">basement kitchenette</a>, and combined several rugs into <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15335913\">a runner</a> for our basement stairs. We also had this <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15332870\">mini-checked rug</a> in our home for many years.</p>\n<p>I love <a href=\"https://shopstyle.it/l/bC3an\">eBay</a> for the DEALS you can find if you’re willing to be patient and/or negotiate. I purchased a Swedish kilim runner from eBay for the hallway to our bedroom (pictured above).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3qWoFcy\">ECARPETGALLERY</a> is a great source for vintage rugs at deep discounts. We have rugs from this store in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/07/how-design-theory-will-help-you-choose-the-right-rug-for-your-space/\">Joe’s office</a> and <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/02/blue-room-design/\">my office/library</a>. This is usually my first stop to see if a style I found on a site with more expensive pieces is available here at a lower price point. They update inventory often and have sales throughout the year, so this spot is worth keeping on your radar.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nordicknots.com/us\">Nordic Knots</a> carries rugs in solid colors and graphic patterns that are made in relatively small batches. We have two rugs from here—a <a href=\"https://nordicknots.com/us/product/grand-brick-red/\">red rug</a> in the dining room (pictured at the top of this post) and a <a href=\"https://nordicknots.com/us/product/grand-dusty-white/\">cream rug</a> in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/05/main-bedroom-tour/\">the main bedroom</a> (pictured above). One thing to expect is that these rugs tend to shed for the first couple of months you have them, so you may need to take additional vacuuming into consideration.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

    "body": "<p>Color and pattern add so much life and personality to a home. But for many of us, it’s hard to know where to start. We’re afraid of making mistakes or our homes looking too busy or cluttered. It wasn’t until I moved into a home where color and pattern were embraced that I even felt called to use their full potential. I realized I liked to be surrounded by color and pattern more than I thought I would.</p>\n<p>Five years into living with our eclectic and colorful home, I’ve learned the benefits of embracing color and pattern aren’t as simple as using my favorite colors—although this helps. Color and pattern are tools we can use beyond aesthetic qualities to evoke emotion, signal mood and vibe, and create a dynamic visual flow to make our house even more functional and enjoyable to live in.</p>\n<p>I stopped thinking about color and pattern as something you either “like” or “dislike” and instead embraced them as design tools to express ideas fully. This means even if you’re not into big bold colors and patterns, you can still benefit from the basic principles of using them deliberately.</p>\n<p>In this post, we’ll start by exploring the emotional reasons why it’s hard to be brave with color and pattern, and then I’ll offer some tips on how to get started and get better at it.</p>\n<p>Why is it so hard to be brave with color and pattern?</p>\n<p>There are a few reasons why stepping outside our comfort zones and using color and pattern in our homes can be challenging.</p>\n<p>Fear of making mistakes. We’re afraid that we’ll choose the wrong colors or patterns, and that our homes will end up looking ugly.</p>\n<p>Fear of being judged. We’re worried about what other people will think of our homes if they’re too colorful or patterned. We all have that friend whose well-intentioned remark on something that is very “us” and not “them” came off as snarky rather than loving. And sometimes, we are the ones who misinterpret it entirely! It’s time to let all that go. Doing our own thing means people will comment. And that’s OK. Let them. Being ourselves inspires others to be braver in their expression, which in the end, benefits us all. Be the one who starts that trend.</p>\n<p>Lack of confidence. We don’t trust our own taste, so we’re afraid to make bold choices. Let’s face it—the majority of us are not color experts! With the sheer amount of colors to choose from, it’s easy to psych yourself out.</p>\n<p>If you’re ready to start incorporating more color and pattern into your home, here are a few tips:</p>\n<p>Start small. Don’t try to do too much all at once. Start with a few small changes, like adding a colorful throw pillow to your couch or hanging a patterned curtain in your bedroom.</p>\n<p>Choose colors and patterns that you love. Don’t worry about what’s trendy or what other people like. Choose colors and patterns that make you happy and reflect your personality.</p>\n<p>Experiment. Don’t be afraid to experiment with different colors and patterns. Try out different combinations and see what you like best.</p>\n<p>Trust your gut. What you are first drawn to is often the right path to follow. Trust it. If you’re not sure about something, go with your gut. You’ll make the right choice.</p>\n<p>Some Ways to Get Better at Using Color and Pattern</p>\n<p>The more you work with color and pattern, the better you’ll get at it. Here are a few ways to improve your skills:</p>\n<p>Look for inspiration. Look for inspiration in magazines, books, and online. Pay attention to how different colors and patterns are used in different spaces.</p>\n<p>Take a class. If you’re really serious about learning how to use color and pattern, consider taking a class. This can be a great way to get expert advice and learn from others.</p>\n<p>Practice, practice, practice. The more you practice using color and pattern, the better you’ll get at it.

    "body": "<p>I was recently diagnosed with rosacea, which led me to take a closer look at the skincare products I was using. Through that process, I reassessed my skincare routine, paying special attention to how my skin reacts to different factors—especially my cycle. Right before my period, I tend to get a few pimples, and my rosacea flares up, so I focus on using gentle, soothing products during that time. I figured it was time to share what my routine looks like now. <strong>Today, I’m sharing my favorite skincare products, devices, and treatments that are working for me right now.</strong> In some categories, I rotate between a few go-to options depending on the day, while in others, I have a tried-and-true favorite I keep coming back to.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Products marked with an * were gifted to me by the brand.</i>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>1. </strong><strong>Rx Cleanser With Sodium Sulfacetamide and Sulfur</strong><br/>My dermatologist prescribed this cleanser to be used before my soap cleanser. It smells gross (like eggs) but if it helps keep my mild rosacea from flaring, I’m doing it. <strong>2. </strong><strong>Emma Lewisham Illuminating Oil Cleanser </strong><strong>*</strong><br/>I alternate between this oil cleanser and the one below depending on my mood or makeup. I find this cleanser easily removes waterproof makeup and I also like to use it when I have more time to incorporate facial massages. <strong>3. </strong><strong>CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser</strong><br/>This cleanser never irritates or fails to remove my makeup, and the price makes my other outrageous purchases sting a little less.</p>\n<p><strong>4. </strong><strong>SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic</strong><br/>I’ve used this vitamin C serum for years and years—it instantly brightens my complexion. I haven’t found a vitamin C I like as much! There was a period of time when I didn’t use it, and I noticed a clear increase in dark spots—a pretty telling sign of its effectiveness IMO.<strong>5. </strong><strong>Sunday Riley Good Genes</strong><i>*</i><br/>I use this serum about twice a week. This is enough exfoliation without aggravating my skin. It’s one of those products that moves the needle in terms of improving skin tone and texture. It is technically an acid, so be careful with this one if you have sensitive skin. <strong>Use WITANDDELIGHT15 for 15% off.</strong><strong>6. </strong><strong>Beauty Pie Über Youth Neck &amp; Chest Lift Serum Spray</strong><br/>My neck is becoming an area that’s lost elasticity since I’ve dropped weight and there is a whole wide world of creams and serums out there specifically formulated to treat the neck. I like this one a lot, especially because it’s easy to apply under a cream. </p>\n<p><strong>7. </strong><strong>Revision Skincare Nectifirm® Cream</strong><br/>And speaking of neck creams, this is the one I love the most out of the options I’ve tried. If I had to choose between the serum spray or cream, I think <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4iWo16V\">the cream</a> is the way to go. <strong>8. </strong><strong>INNBEAUTY Extreme Cream</strong><i>*</i><br/>I can’t say enough good things about <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-14616649\">this</a> deeply hydrating and firming lotion. It’s made me look alive again during my driest hours. It leaves my skin looking instantly plumper and, let’s face it, lifted. <strong>9. </strong><strong>UBeauty The Super Hydrator</strong><strong>*</strong><br/>This stuff is good at delivering a deeper level of hydration than moisturizer with a formula that includes peptides, hyaluronic acid, and panthenol. I’m no scientist but they’re known for creating this formula that goes on lightweight but still gets you that deeply hydrated feeling. I like this formula for warm days or for throwing on before a workout. <strong>Use WITANDDELIGHT20 for 20% off.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>10. </strong><strong>RMS Kakadu Beauty Oil</strong><i>*</i><br/>I have used a lot of facial oils in my day, and this one is hands down my favorite. It glides on smoothly, doesn’t have the lingering similarity to olive oil, and sinks in quickly enough to apply makeup right afterward. I use this oil as the last step in my routine, both in the morning and at night. After applying, I’ll often do about 30 seconds of facial massages under my eyes and on my neck—it’s a great way to help with puffiness. <strong>Use KATEA20 for 20% off.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/03/skincare-products-routine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>This month’s theme on Wit &amp; Delight is all about <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/06/mixing-interior-design-styles-june-2023-theme/\">the art of the mix</a> in interior design. I wanted to share more info on this topic and write about <i>how</i> you can apply the art of the mix in your own home.<br/>When I first sat down to write this article, I thought of the cookbook <i>Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat</i><i> </i>by Samin Nosrat (one I highly recommend!)<i>. </i>No, this is not an interior design book, but it <i>is</i> a book that helps people figure out how to mix and balance different elements in the realm of cooking. I decided to take a similar approach and write about how one can mix different elements in the realm of interior design.<strong>Today I’m sharing the five key interior design elements all of my favorite rooms have in common: color, pattern, texture, something old, and something that grounds the space.</strong> Here’s why each of these elements matters.</p>\n<p>If you’ve ever taken a painting class, you know that painters generally begin with a big field of one color on their canvas, which they then add to as they go. Consider the room you’re designing a canvas. Choose your base color first (which may be the existing color of the room <i>or</i> a color you plan to bring in), then consider which complementary colors you’d like to add to the mix. <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2020/07/a-color-skeptics-guide-to-color-theory-in-design/\">This article on color theory</a> will help you begin to get a sense of how different colors play together. <a href=\"https://www.houseandgarden.co.uk/article/paint-colour-rules\">This article from  House &amp; Garden</a> is also an interesting take on color rules to follow, according to interior designers.</p>\n<p>Pattern adds interest, depth, and emotion to any room. Without it, a space can feel somewhat flat. Patterns can be bold or subtle, colorful or neutral, and applied broadly or selectively. From wallpaper to upholstery to rugs to decor items, there is no shortage of ways to bring pattern into a home.</p>\n<p>I LOVE adding texture to any room. Similar to rooms without pattern, rooms without a variety of textures feel somewhat dull to me. I especially like to bring in texture through fabrics (e.g., velvet, linen, wool) and materials (e.g., rattan, marble, rustic wood, metal).</p>\n<p>There is always room for <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/10/thrift-antique-shopping-tips/\">something antique</a> in any room, particularly in spaces that are mostly filled with newer pieces. Be it furniture, art, light fixtures, or small decor items, old pieces bring <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/04/add-character-to-your-home/\">character and charm</a> to a home.</p>\n<p>A grounding element is something that acts as the foundation of a room; it’s the thing that brings the entire design together. I most often use an <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/01/rug-shopping/\">area rug</a> to ground a space. It helps define the seating area in a living room, bedroom, or dining room. It also offers another opportunity to bring color and texture to a space. <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/05/best-patterned-wallpaper/\">Wallpaper</a> can also be used as a grounding element, especially if you apply it to an accent wall and use a bold pattern. </p>\n<p>If you keep these five elements at the forefront of your mind throughout the design process, the art of the mix will become so much simpler. All of these elements are things you can continue to push and pull as your design preferences evolve. After all, each room in our home is meant to be seasoned and refined, bit by bit, rather than updated and finished in one fell swoop.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested in learning more about mixing elements in interior design, these are a few resources I’d recommend:</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

My friend <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lisahackwith/\">Lisa Hackwith</a> and her partner have spent years hosting friends and family at their cabin on a small lake, and over time, Lisa has developed a creative approach to cooking that makes weekends feel both effortless and special. <br/>Instead of hauling a long grocery list up north and ultimately leaving food to waste, she embraces the challenge of using a handful of ingredients in multiple ways, crafting menus as resourceful as they are delectable. This winter, she designed a weekend-long menu for a group of six that maximizes flavor, minimizes waste, and makes hosting a well-timed and intentional endeavor. From a cozy Friday night dinner to a Sunday send-off lunch, Lisa shows us that limitations in the kitchen can lead to inspired meals.<br/>This is the third installment in the Wit &amp; Delight entertaining series. Find even more recipes and entertaining inspiration in our first two posts on hosting a <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/08/casual-dinner-party/\">casual dinner party</a> and an <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/12/dessert-party/\">afternoon dessert party</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Friday Dinner</strong><br/>Potato, Bacon, and Sharp White Cheddar Cheese Pierogies With Sauteed Leeks and Buttermilk Crème Fraîche <br/>Arugula, Crispy Leek, Date, and Crouton Salad<strong>Saturday Breakfast</strong><br/>Jammy Eggs With Pickled Leeks, Dill, Capers, Smoked Salmon, and Buttermilk Crème Fraîche Toasts<strong>Saturday Lunch</strong><br/>Grilled Sharp White Cheddar Cheese, Bacon, and Date Sandwiches<br/>Arugula and Mustard Crouton Salad With Peppery Buttermilk Dressing<strong>Saturday Dinner</strong><br/>Pan-Roasted Salmon Fillets With Orange, Leek, Date, Capers, and Dill Salad<br/>Bacon Fat Twice-Baked Crispy Potatoes<strong>Saturday Dessert</strong><br/>Vanilla Date Buttermilk Bran Cake With Orange Crème Anglaise<strong>Sunday Breakfast</strong><br/>Buttermilk Bran Pancakes With Maple Syrup<strong>Sunday Lunch</strong><br/>Creamy Potato, Leek, and Poached Salmon Soup With Dill<strong>Total cost per person:</strong> $38</p>\n<p><strong>Lisa: </strong>When my husband and I first started hosting weekend getaways at our cabin, we would usually divide and conquer meal planning equally among our friends. I noticed that when we did that everyone usually lugged up at least a cooler’s plus worth of food and we always had way too much! A lot of the time no one knew what the other was bringing so the food could sometimes be way too heavy or we’d end up bringing the same thing. I wanted to create weekend-long menus that were easy, efficient, well-balanced, and let nothing go to waste.</p>\n<p><strong>Lisa: </strong>I think restraints can sometimes give room for more creativity. When I didn’t have a world of possibilities to create something new but a concise and small ingredient list, I found it easier to come up with new recipes. I love setting out all the ingredients for one weekend and just seeing what I can come up with!</p>\n<p><strong>Lisa: </strong>Yes! Sometimes it feels like the possibilities are endless! I was working on a spring menu last May and one of my ingredients was rhubarb. I ended up making the five recipes listed below—that’s when I realized there is so much you can do with just one ingredient!</p>\n<p><strong>Lisa: </strong>I start with what’s in season. Then I pick two to three main ingredients and start to build from there. After I come up with a few ideas, usually a few more ingredients come naturally into the mix. I settle on five to eight “stars” for the weekend and then let myself free flow and come up with as many combinations as I can think of. After that, I arrange my recipes into what I think would fit best into two dinners, two lunches, and two breakfasts. Sometimes there is a snack in there, one drink, and always one dessert.  </p>\n<p><strong>Lisa: </strong>Yes, sometimes it can feel restrictive and I can’t come up with combinations I’m happy about. I usually go back to the drawing board and just try a different combination of “stars” to see if I can come up with something new I’m excited about trying. And I’ve found that once I actually start cooking and tasting, new things often arise. Sometimes the best discovered are recipes that weren’t planned in my head but by tasting as I go while playing around in the kitchen.  </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/02/winter-weekend-menu-easy-recipes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Time management and organization have never come naturally to me. When life became unmanageable—a constant since my second child arrived—I looked to the experts. Not once did I think of listening to my own rhythm and body. Productivity, I thought, was something to master, not something to understand.<br/>Then I hit a wall.<br/>I was tired of feeling like this, so I stopped fighting my own nature. I stopped taking productivity advice from people who don’t have ADHD.<br/>For years, I had been trying to contort myself into someone I wasn’t—structured, disciplined, and neatly organized. A person who could follow a system designed for a brain that didn’t work like mine. Why had I ever believed I could manage my time the same way they did?<br/>The shift was subtle but changed everything. I’m unstuck, no longer languishing, moving ahead with purpose. I know I’ll get stuck again, but I also know this: I’m done chasing solutions that were never meant to work for me.<strong>Today, I’m sharing what  does work—how I get things done without draining myself in the process. </strong>Because when we work against who we are, burnout isn’t a possibility. It’s a guarantee.</p>\n<p>I define productivity as doing what I said I’d do—for myself, for others—in a way that makes sense for my life. I spent two years trying to heal burnout by “resting,” only to feel worse with each passing day. Turns out, rest isn’t just stillness. Some kinds of rest are active, and learning to restore <i>that</i> changed everything.</p>\n<p>Different kinds of rest follow different kinds of productivity. Knowing what you need means knowing your limits. Trying to function like someone without ADHD only pushed me further from those signals. ADHD brains need different types of rest—emotional, mental, creative, physical, passive.<br/>I don’t recharge by watching TV. I recharge by reading, cooking, taking long walks, and practicing Pilates. To outsiders, it might look like I’m always going, but this kind of movement restores me. Sometimes, organizing a junk drawer is self-care. Other times, it’s a warning sign. When I’m mentally drained, TV helps. When I’m emotionally overwhelmed, it makes me feel stuck. Learning the difference changed everything.</p>\n<p>We are taught to measure our worth by what we produce. Part of my midlife journey has been rejecting that, untangling my value from my output, and focusing on <i>making</i> rather than <i>measuring</i>. If you’re in the thick of that, this post may not be what you need today.<br/>Your worth is not your work. But making—creating, moving, shaping something from nothing—is an expression of <i>you</i>. It’s life-giving. It’s confidence-building. It’s the thing that can pull you out of a spiral before it takes hold. When I started honoring my inner drive to create, productivity stopped being something I chased. It became the natural result of <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/02/the-benefits-of-flow-and-how-to-find-it-for-yourself/\">finding my flow</a>. Momentum, not depletion. Creation, not extraction. And that changed everything.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>When I started honoring my inner drive to create, productivity stopped being something I chased.

    "body": "<p>Welcome to the 300th installment — woohoo! — of A View From the Easel, a series in which artists reflect on their workspace. This week, artists bring a Parisian sensibility to Nebraska and return to their dream studio after two decades.</p>\n<p>Want to take part? Check out our <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/47316/submit-your-workspace-to-a-view-from-the-easel/\">submission guidelines</a> and share a bit about your studio with us through <a href=\"https://forms.gle/Erq7cyGEmMUxKrLe9\">this form</a>! All mediums and workspaces are welcome, including your home studio.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://laurievictorkay.com/\">Laurie Victor Kay</a>, Omaha, Nebraska</h2>\n<p><i>How long have you been working in this space?</i></p>\n<p>I’ve been in my studio, LVK Atelier, for about one year. I moved into the space shortly after my mom died from a very short battle with cancer. Moving here meant seismic change for me — leaving my family home, marriage, and longtime former studio. My mom worked with arts and accessibility. Her spirit is everywhere, and it is truly an amazing space. Every visitor feels the strong, positive, creative energy. When I moved in, I began imagining how I wanted my studio to feel, planning for months before starting construction. I was<i> </i>literally rebuilding myself while building my studio space. The first of many projects as a newly independent mid-career artist who had lost her mom and left her marriage to find herself.</p>\n<p><i>Describe an average day in your studio.</i></p>\n<p>My daily routine changes often. Constants: coffee. A long run, early-morning yoga, meditation — even a few times a week. Emails and Instagram. I read and journal. Each day is different because my practice is so varied. When I am making new work, I try to really let myself feel free. Music is so important to me. I like it loud — too loud for my neighbors. So many genres … I travel to time periods, places in the world, places in my mind with music. My <i>Composition</i> series is about music.</p>\n<p><i>How does the space affect your work?</i></p>\n<p>It is magical! The space is like a blank palette with which I can make anything. It is energetic in that my work is received and felt. I meditate often, balancing that with loud music. I feel so free here. During the first months in this space, I bought Yves Klein matte blue paint, and drew Buddhist quotes on the kitchen walls. I made a pact to be intentional about everything entering my space. I was leaving negative energy and needed a space to heal and grow. I wanted to use every corner in the space conceptually. I wanted a true artist’s home — welcoming, colorful, like a cabinet of curiosities; weird, filled with me.</p>\n<p><i>How do you interact with the environment outside your studio?</i></p>\n<p>I’m extremely involved with the art community in Omaha. This community is the reason I’ve stayed in this city. Omahans are down-to-earth and embrace bold ideas. The top three projects in my career were on the campus of the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Although I’ve moved further from the arts area, I’ve found the most important part of making art is feeling supported. My community is all over Omaha but also the world. I believe community is everywhere. Sometimes one close friend is one’s entire community. I want to continue to know my neighbors and support the arts organizations that support me.</p>\n<p><i>What do you love about your studio?</i></p>\n<p>One, I love feeling my mom’s presence. She was a mother to many beyond my family. She died too soon but left a legacy felt here. She worked with people who didn’t have access to art. Two, I love my trees. My home/studio has two massive oaks right through it. Three, I love that the studio is mine. I feel so free and independent now and don’t have to answer to anyone but myself. It was a long road to get here.</p>\n<p><i>What do you wish were different?</i></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037524/a-view-from-the-easel-300/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>It’s about that time of year when the slight crisping of the air signals that the balmy summer is departing, but hasn’t disappeared just yet. Suddenly, the fluorescent lights, lively chatter, and overpriced opening wine flowing onto the New York City streets beckon the passerby who has spent all summer tanning in Central Park. It’s fall art fair season, at last.</p>\n<p>As usual, the season’s kicking off with the gargantuan Armory Show next week, followed by a lineup of shows that range from the alternative (zines!) to the conservative and historical (Independent 2oth Century). This year brings a few changes, though: the unexpected <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032202/as-adaas-art-show-changes-course-a-nonprofit-is-left-in-limbo/\">cancellation</a> of the Art Dealers Association of America’s annual Art Show, for instance, typically an anchor of the autumn fairs. Volta is also skipping its NYC edition, while Clio is having <i>two</i> fairs in the same month. </p>\n<p>The art market might be topsy-turvy, but your fairgoing experience doesn’t have to be. Our handy guide below is here to help navigate your way through it all.</p>\n<h3>The Armory Show</h3>\n<p>September 5–7 | <a href=\"https://www.thearmoryshow.com/\">thearmoryshow.com</a><br/>Javits Center, 429 Eleventh Avenue, Midtown West, Manhattan</p>\n<p>The Goliath of the city’s art fairs, the Armory Show will once again descend upon the shopping mall-esque Javits Center to kick off New York’s fall season. More than 230 galleries will convene for the colossal event, with spotlight booths focused on the late artist Ming Fay and installation artist Sylvie Hayes-Wallace, among others. For the first time, the fair’s Platform section will be curated by a nonprofit, Souls Grown Deep, which will celebrate Black artistry from the American South with an exhibition of paintings, assemblages, sculptures, and textile works. Another fresh feature this year is the inaugural design-focused Function section, showcasing sculptural assemblages and installation works by Nikita Gale, Cauleen Smith, Ryan Johnson, and Gee’s Bend Quiltmakers.</p>\n<p>The Armory’s programming will also extend beyond the boundaries of Hudson Yards in a focused series of multi-borough partnership presentations. At the Queens Museum, a collaboration with Gagosian will produce a monumental banner reproduction of Honor Titus’s tennis painting “Louis Malle Practice” (2025) on the institution’s facade. Times Square Arts and the Whitney Museum of American Art will host nightly viewings of media artist Marina Zurkow’s multi-channel animation “The River is a Circle (Times Square Edition)” across 95 synchronized electronic billboard displays throughout the city.</p>\n<h3>Independent 20th Century</h3>\n<p>September 4–7 | <a href=\"https://www.independenthq.com/fair2\">independenthq.com</a> <br/>Casa Cipriani, 10 South Street, The Battery, Manhattan</p>\n<p>The modern art sibling fair of the contemporary-focused Independent fair returns to Manhattan’s Battery neighborhood with 31 galleries and arts nonprofits for its fourth edition. Solo, duo, and group presentations notably spotlight works by self-taught artists, Lebanese women artists, and influential figures from Latin America. Attendees can also check out a host of programs, including a live discussion between installation artist Judy Pfaff and author Joe Fig and a roundtable between directors of the Storm King Art Center, Princeton University Art Museum, the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, and Aspen Art Museum.</p>\n<h3>Art on Paper</h3>\n<p>September 4–7 | <a href=\"http://ny.thepaperfair.com\">ny.thepaperfair.com</a><br/>Pier 36, 299 South St, New York, New York</p>\n<p>Don’t underestimate the versatility of this pulpy, everyday material. Returning to its usual venue at Pier 36 on the East River, this year’s Art on Paper fair will showcase boundary-pushing artworks from over 100 galleries, such as Pace-represented artist Nina Katchadourian’s playful ecological sculptures made from found paper items. The show’s meta mini bookfair, BOOKsmART, will also return with exhibitors from more than 20 presses, including Oreades Press, Axis Press, and Central Booking. Installations like feminist participatory artist Mary Beth Edelson’s <a href=\"https://thealdrich.org/exhibitions/mary-beth-edelson-six-story-gathering-boxes-1972-2014\"> Story Gathering Boxes</a> series (1972–2014) and Ruben Castillo’s woodcuts and lithocuts exploring queer intimacy attest to the medium’s endless possibilities.</p>\n<h3>Salon Zürcher: 100 Women of Spirit +, Part 3</h3>\n<p>September 2–7 | <a href=\"https://www.galeriezurcher.com/salon-zurcher-33rd-edition-100-women-of-spirit-part-3-september-2-7-2025\">galeriezurcher.com</a><br/>Zürcher Gallery, 33 Bleecker Street, Soho, Manhattan</p>\n<p>Returning for its 33rd edition as an intimate and quieter satellite fair of the Armory Show, <i>100 Women of Spirit + </i>brings together 11 women artists at its Bleeker Street home. Deriving its name from the French phrase <i>femme d’esprit,</i> referring to intellectual and witty women, this year’s fair features psychedelic paintings by Amy Cheng, welded steel constellations by Dutch-born artist Marieken Couchius, and oil self-portraits by trauma-informed psychotherapist Trissy Callan.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037354/nyc-fall-2025-art-fair-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>LONDON — Of all the <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/y/young-british-artists-ybas\">YBAs</a> (Young British Artists) of the 1990s — including upstarts like Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin, mouthing off petulantly to the art establishment with dead livestock and unmade beds — it is Jenny Saville who has been most entrenched in the history of art. It is also Saville who can most convincingly claim to be Britain’s greatest living painter since the death of Lucien Freud (sorry, David Hockney). The artist’s superb draughtsmanship skills, informed by absorption and understanding of the Old Masters, are combined with a painterly technique that manipulates its plasticity for all its worth. (Ironically, Tracey Emin is a professor of drawing at the Royal Academy despite having no capacity for drawing.) Saville’s style is as complete and significant as that of Freud.</p>\n<p>It is hard to overestimate the impact of Saville’s early works on British contemporary painting. Her paintings often disappear into the most discerning private ownership. Those in public collections are the rare anomaly in her current survey, <i> The Anatomy of Painting</i>, at the National Portrait Gallery. As a result, some of that impact is recreated for those viewing her art for the first time. Enormous in scale, her uncomfortably close cropped depictions of women’s faces and nude bodies abound in the joy of painterly modeling, from bare — nude — patches of canvas to her swift, thick, viscous slathers, to dappled dry brush blends. The large scale alone may shock people accustomed to viewing only reproductions on screen. The distribution of muted and contrasting tones is sophisticated. In short, there is a wealth of virtuosic brushwork to drink in. </p>\n<p>Considering the painterly bombast, it is perhaps a pedantic complaint that the National Portrait Gallery has mounted an exhibition that has not a single “portrait” in it. We are given only a few of the sitters’ identities, and neither the museum nor Saville expound any particular reason for portraying them, nor any painter-sitter relationships to speak of. Hers is an academic interest with only perfunctory gestures toward body image issues, and pieces explicitly covering <a href=\"https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-5916645\">gender identity</a> are absent. In “Plan” (1993), one of the exhibition’s key works, Saville contours the nude flesh like ordinance survey map terrain, while “Ruben’s Flap” (1998–99) references the fleshy folds favored by the Dutch master, updated to the “real” folds of contemporary unidealized body types. In her most color-saturated rendering of flesh, “Figure 11.23” (1997), she deploys flat red more in the Renaissance discipline of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cangiante\">cangiante</a> – using depth of color rather than muted tones for shade – rather than realistically depicting blood. </p>\n<p>Similarly, a fantastic sequence of mother and child images that reference both Pietas and Maestas from Michelangelo, with bulbous children bending toward us, entasis-style, echo distinctly his Madonna of Bruges or the soft sfumato of Raphael, reimagined in colored pencil. Saville fails, though, to wear her influences on her sleeve when channeling her love for de Kooning into her compositions from the mid to late 2010s. Her attempts to break down nudes into intertwining layers of limbs and squiggles, shattering them with de Kooning-like surface articulation, feel forced, and obscure her gift for three-dimensional modeling. “Out of one, two (symposium)” (2016) nods to Cy Twombly simply by overlaying the nude figures with scribbles. Her academic attempts at abstraction — the opposite of Renaissance Old Master figure modeling — seem to be at the expense of her work’s soul.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036158/jenny-saville-uk-greatest-living-painter-national-portrait-gallery-london/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In photographer Alicia Vera’s portrait of her mother, Concepcion, she gazes skyward, her expression somewhere between curious and awestruck. The image has enough stylistic mottling and grain to obscure any sort of background, but Concepcion is clear: broad cheekbones, bejeweled ears, eyes full of wonder—maybe. Vera is a deeply humanistic image-maker, and it’s impossible to differentiate between a posed subject and a candid one. She approaches both with generosity.</p>\n<p>Isolated, the phrase “va a llover toda la noche,” which translates in English to “it’s going to rain all night,” feels like a snippet of poetry or song. A few years ago, it was a note left on Vera’s door by her mother. Now, it’s the title of Vera’s new project, and a self-published book of the same name, documenting Concepcion’s Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis and Vera’s experience processing it. “Every time I go home to Miami, I stay in my childhood home,” Vera shares. “My mom loves to leave notes on the door. I kept this one; a year or so later, when I was taking out all this material I had, I thought, ‘this is exactly what this feels like.’” The portrait of her mother is one of many in <i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i> (2025); alongside Vera’s portraits, the book includes archival images of Concepcion over the last several decades, text messages, emails, and other personal ephemera.</p>\n<p><i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i>(2025), with the caption: “Mom and her orchids in Miami”</p>\n<p>Vera, who is based in Mexico City, is an award-winning editorial and commercial photographer, and her personal projects feature some of her most captivating images. In “Basketball in the Sierra Norte of Oaxaca” (2018), she captured the Copa Mixe, a basketball tournament for Indigenous Mixe youth in Sierra Norte; for “Stripped” (2009–11), she spent years documenting strippers in Miami and the Bay Area. Her photos are devoid of the voyeuristic quality often visible in like-minded series by other artists; instead, she seems warmly welcomed, like a relative. She’s been photographing her own family, too, “since forever,” she says. “I think I knew deep down, one day, everything’s going to be so different. Every time I would go home, I would take a ton of pictures.”</p>\n<p>Concepcion was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease in 2018, which prompted Vera to begin photographing her more. In a Spanglish epilogue to the book, Vera writes, in English: “After my mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, I felt devastated, overwhelmed, anxious and helpless.” In Spanish, she adds: “<i>Mi mamá se me iba a ir. En mi desesperación de entender lo que le estaba pasando y porque nunca realmente sentí que la conocí, empecé este proyecto llamado</i>, <i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i>” (My mom was going to leave me. In my desperation to understand what was happening to her, and because I never really felt like I knew her, I started this project called <i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i>.) Vera’s understanding of her mother’s own personhood was limited by the challenges of their relationship—a too-common dynamic among mothers and daughters, and one that Vera has long hoped to correct. “She grew up in Mexico and I grew up in the US, so there were a lot of cultural differences,” she says. “In my 20s, I moved away and realized, ‘I really miss my mom.’ We started having these phone calls, and it hit me that my mom was an entire human … I remember trying to make an effort to get to know her, asking her really specific questions. When my mom got diagnosed, I was like, ‘Wait, but I’m just starting to get to know you.’”</p>\n<p><i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i>(2025), with the caption: “My mother as a child runs through a field with her brother in Mexico. / A prayer card found in my mother’s room.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037506/alicia-vera-photographs-depict-alzheimers-with-dignity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>A Pennsylvania art museum is suing the Trump administration after the government terminated a $750,000 federal grant for collection conservation earlier this year.</p>\n    <p>The Woodmere Art Museum in Philadelphia filed a lawsuit yesterday, August 26, against President Donald Trump, the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the agency’s Interim Director Keith Sonderling, and other administration officials, months after the agency revoked its Fiscal Year 2024 “Save America’s Treasures” grant. The museum, which operates out of a 19th-century mansion in the city’s Chestnut Hill neighborhood, alleges that Trump officials usurped Congress’s authority to distribute federal funds by prematurely terminating its grant.</p>\n    <p>The IMLS grant that the Woodmere received is administered in <a href=\"https://nps.gov/subjects/historicpreservationfund/save-americas-treasures-grants.htm\">partnership</a> with the National Park Service and awarded to “historic properties and collections.” After receiving the grant, according to the lawsuit, the museum initiated an “ambitious conservation project” to prepare an exhibition of Philadelphia artists in 2026, timed with America’s 250th celebrations. The museum received just $195,000 of its total grant before its termination. </p>\n    <p>The Woodmere hopes the IMLS will restore its funding so that it can continue its original planned <a href=\"https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/st-256887-oms-24\">project</a> to install new storage facilities, address collection crowding, and improve cataloguing efforts. </p>\n    <p>“This has delayed critical preservation, digitization, and conservation of our collection — work we hope to resume if the grant is reinstated,” Woodmere Art Museum Director and CEO William Valerio told <i>Hyperallergic. </i></p>\n    <p>With the grant expiration approaching in September, the museum stated in court papers that it has exhausted non-litigious methods of restoring the grant, including a formal appeal. Trump signed an executive order in March demanding that the IMLS and several other federal agencies <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/996700/trump-moves-to-dismantle-institute-of-museum-and-library-services/\">cease operations</a> of non-statutory functions, effectively dismantling the organization. The lawsuit asks the court to reinstate its grant and declare Trump’s gutting of the IMLS “unlawful” or “unconstitutional.”</p>\n    <p>The president proposed eliminating the organization’s funding in his Fiscal Year 2026 budget proposal, which also excluded the National Endowment for the Arts from federal dollars. A federal judge <a href=\"https://www.ala.org/news/2025/06/court-allows-trump-administration-proceed-efforts-destroy-institute-museum-and-library\">declined</a> to block Trump’s dismantling of the agency in June after other judges blocked <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1014493/museum-grants-reinstated-after-federal-court-ruling/\">some of his actions</a>.</p>\n    <p>The IMLS has not yet responded to <i>Hyperallergic’s </i>request for comment. </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037363/pennsylvania-museum-sues-trump-administration-over-grant-cuts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>CHICAGO — Though Wafaa Bilal was born in Iraq and is based in New York, his survey at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, <i> Indulge Me</i>, can be called a homecoming of sorts. In 2007, the accomplished yet underrated artist captured the art world’s attention with his durational performance “Domestic Tension,” wherein he lived for 30 days inside the exhibition space of Chicago’s FlatFile Gallery; a web camera broadcast his movements while a paintball gun was available for anyone to remotely fire at him via a website. Reconstructed as an open-face cubicle inside the museum’s pristine gallery space, the splatters of thousands of yellow paintballs on its interior walls do not convey the torturous persistence of the gun as forcefully as the brief video diary screened on a small monitor nearby. In an increasingly distressed voice, the goggled Bilal unironically thanks his audience for their participation as the gun processes a ceaseless string of firing commands. </p>\n    <p>For a significant survey, the exhibition is remarkably spare. Curator Bana Kattan selected five major projects, each one integrating technology, performance, and a conceptual approach to the conditions of being Arab in the United States in the post-9/11 era. In “3rdi,” Bilal surgically implanted a web camera to the back of his head and attached it to an internet-connected laptop slung at his waist. Each minute, the camera would take an image and send it via the laptop to a live website feed. We are privy to an oversized presentation of a year’s worth of these images, projected on a 14-foot scrim diagonally bisecting the gallery and synced to the date and time they were originally taken.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Bilal-1200x947.jpg?resize=1200%2C947&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>While Bilal once again submits himself to anonymous public scrutiny, making literal the Arab-American condition, the seemingly arbitrary images show the view from behind, telling us not where he is going but where he has been. The project title can be parsed as “third eye,” referring both literally to the camera and conceptually to the watchful eye of the state, but can also be read in Western-transliterated Arabizi as “my land,” pointing to the places from which Bilal has fled as a political refugee who could not look back.</p>\n    <p>The latest project on view, “In a Grain of Wheat,” exhibits Bilal’s persistent concern with the technological mediation of contemporary culture. Responding to the destruction of Iraqi cultural heritage by ISIS, the artist collaborated with a scientist and coder team to scan the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s lamassu and write its form into the DNA of a grain of wheat. The specific mechanics of this process are not comprehensible via the minimal didactics presented, so viewers must accept that the sculpture lives in the wheat as an act of faith in the art and science of the project. Aptly, the work demands a devotional gesture. To partake of the wheat, one must bend down before the replica winged bull to reach for the pile of seeds at its hooves. More than two decades after the American invasion of Iraq, to see mostly young non-Arab Americans readily perform this gesture of supplication to an iconic symbol of Iraqi cultural heritage makes me think that perhaps this country has forgotten its devastating entanglement with Iraq after all. Bilal, of course, cannot.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Bilal2-1200x788.jpg?resize=1200%2C788&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/001-1200x801.jpg?resize=1200%2C801&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Wafaa Bilal: Indulge Me</i>at the MCA Chicago (photo Bob [Robert Chase Heishman])</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/PXL_20250408_155635076.MP_-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/019-1200x801.jpg?resize=1200%2C801&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/025-1200x801.jpg?resize=1200%2C801&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Wafaa Bilal: Indulge Me</i>at the MCA Chicago.

It was Jimmy’s first time in the U.S., and we were all beyond excited.

Do you have scooters in England? Do you have light in England? Do you have color in England?’ It was really funny. And sometimes when Jimmy would make a joke, we would be like, ‘Is that funny in England?’ But his jokes were actually really funny.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/louis-vuitton-suitcase-store.jpg\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>Jimmy asked to see a few sights, and we were happy to oblige. “Can we go to the <a href=\"https://40visuals.com/louis-vuittons-nyc-flagship-becomes-a-giant-stack-of-luxury-luggage/\">Louis Vuitton store</a> that looks like suitcases?” he asked.

It’s hard to live an ocean away from loved ones, as I’m sure many of you experience, as well. But we’re so lucky to be able to keep in touch. When <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2011/02/14/our-grandparents/\">my maternal grandmother</a> moved from Manchester, England, to Chicago with her new <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2011/02/14/our-grandparents/\">soldier husband</a>, she could only exchange letters with her parents, until they visited many years later. Where do your relatives live? Are you close by? Half a world apart? How do you stay in touch? I’d love to hear.

    "body": "<p>Father’s Day is coming up on Sunday, June 15, and picking something thoughtful but cool for dads who know exactly what they like can be a bit tricky. Here’s a collection of Father’s Day gift ideas inspired by my husband—he loves well-made things, has a great eye for design, spends weekends biking or coaching baseball, and appreciates stylish clothing and accessories (think New Balance, Norse Projects, Bode) and great music (FKJ, Fred Again..).<br/>Joe provided his own thoughts on each of these items, both for my benefit and yours. Happy gift shopping! – Kate</p>\n<p>Yes, dads can carry tote bags—and if the dad in your life does, he’ll find that they are incredibly practical. The “go bag” of summer can hold the ever-evolving kids’ gear, swimsuits, groceries, and heck, even a bottle of wine for after the game if time allows. I live out of my tote in the summer.</p>\n<p>While these are not the glasses one would wear to a wedding reception, they are for the blossoming runner, hiker, or biker who understands how much more enjoyable the experience is with a nice pair of shades.</p>\n<p>It’s 2025, and I’m not saying our grandpas were wrong, but having rough palms isn’t a sign of bravery; it’s a sign that you might need to use some hand balm. It takes approximately six seconds to apply, and he’ll thank me later.</p>\n<p>My thoughts on sauce are pretty well documented, and this chili crisp will transform the most entry-level panini or protein into a flavor-packed experience. Heck, I put it on steamed broccoli.</p>\n<p>Our kids give me grief as they claim I have music on 90% of waking hours, and they’re not wrong. I like to play a wide array of “chunes” to help up the energy on a sleepy morning or get us pumped up before heading to the ball fields. And with a simple carabiner, this will easily clip onto Dad’s golf bag.</p>\n<p>A hat that doesn’t have a major league baseball team or local baseball association logo on it, that his partner actually thinks is cool and might borrow from him? It does exist. The seersucker material breathes and is perfect for summer.</p>\n<p>The ultimate “dad” shoe. Nothing screams I’m up at six for the soccer game quite like a gray on gray on gray New Balance 998. I recently procured my first pair of New Balance, and can attest that they are the most comfortable sneakers I’ve ever worn.</p>\n<p>I love a statement shirt that breaks out of my reliable navy, forest green, and gray color palette.  This piece of wearable art is beautiful and reminds me of something my grandmother made me when I was a child. I love <a href=\"https://bode.com/collections/mens-one-of-a-kind/products/island-sunrise-shirt-s-m\">this style</a> too.</p>\n<p>If the kids are now old enough to go on bike rides that can take the family outside of the neighborhood and to area ice cream shops, breweries, and restaurants, one thing Dad will need is a bike lock to ensure the trusty steeds are there after the meal.</p>\n<p>J. Crew makes a fantastic pair of swim trunks. In addition to my versatile solid color Patagonia baggies, the trunks here offer some fun patterns that fit well and can handle the lake, the pool, or the splash pad.</p>\n<p>Co-managing the family calendar is not for the faint of heart—I’ve found that writing things down can reduce the “oh sh*% soccer is at 5 pm?!” drills. In addition, sometimes our kids will write motivational messages on my rad dad notepad that help me through the slog of days filled with Zoom calls.</p>\n<p>Kate gave me a lot of grief when she discovered this product on my wish list, but she’s also the catalyst behind my newfound interest in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/03/skincare-products-routine/\">skin care</a>. Can you simply fill a large bowl with water and ice cubes? You sure can, but this tub has a breathing tube so you can snorkel for literal minutes without coming up for air. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/06/best-fathers-day-gift-ideas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>I love having a closed-concept home.<strong>To me, a closed-concept home means that (in most cases) there isn’t a direct view from one main living space to the next. </strong>Rooms are separated by either a wall, a door, or an archway. In our home, while there is a view from the entryway to the sitting room to the dining room, most of our main living areas are separate from the others.</p>\n    <p>A girlfriend recently reminded me what happened the first time I had her over for dinner. I let the dogs in the back door, covered in mud, and a mess quickly ensued. I closed the doors between the kitchen and the rest of the house to contain the mess, cleaned everything up, and then got back to the party pretty quickly. It was something I’d become so used to, I didn’t think twice about it! It wasn’t until she brought it up that I realized how useful the layout is for our family’s lifestyle. <br/>When we have people over, it’s also easier to do last-minute cleaning and to maintain a general sense of order since things don’t spread out from room to room as much.</p>\n    <p>Now that the kids are getting a little older, we can let them play independently more often, and Joe and I can have alone time in separate spaces. Having the rooms divided up helps facilitate this, and I treasure the alone time I can get in an otherwise busy life.<br/>It should be noted that we do live in a bigger house <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2020/04/were-moving-a-goodbye-to-the-house-that-built-our-family-of-5/\">than we did before</a>. This means there’s naturally more space to spend time separately. However, we tend to use about half of the house most frequently when it’s just our immediate family, so the closed-concept floor plan definitely still helps provide some separation. </p>\n    <p>When you are designing within an open-concept floor plan, you’re first and foremost building the design around a cohesive scheme. It takes a bit of skill to figure out how to do that. With our closed-concept spaces, it’s felt like each room can have its own personality.<br/>While I’ll consider the overall color palette of the home when I’m designing any given room, I don’t feel a need to be too closely tied to it. This made the process of experimenting with rooms in our main living areas especially fun. You can see the individual personality of different spaces in rooms like the <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/02/blue-room-design/\">blue library/office</a> and the <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/09/one-year-later-its-finally-here-the-design-reveal-of-our-family-room/\">green family room</a>.</p>\n    <p>I know from experience that when you have a big great room with a TV, it’s easier to get set in your routines. When it comes to downtime, this often includes the TV. In this home, with separate spaces without a TV, we’re drawn to do different activities.

    "body": "<p>I see such a deep connection between our interior lives and the way physical movement creates space—not just physically, but emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. Movement has been the foundation of my healing journey, and while my body may look different than it did a few years ago, it’s just a small reflection of the deep transformation I’ve experienced. When we move with intention, with presence, we start to feel what it’s like to really live in ourselves. To fully occupy who we are. <br/>That’s why I wanted to sit down with Berit Ahlgren, the founder of <a href=\"https://www.spacesunna.com/\">Sunna</a>. She’s created something that’s more than a movement class. It’s a kind of invitation. A gentle but powerful reminder that healing doesn’t have to be performative, and that we can return to ourselves at any time. I wanted to ask her how it all came to be, what keeps her going, and what she’s dreaming about next.<strong>Twin Cities locals,  check out Sunna at 514 2nd Street SE in Minneapolis! </strong>New clients can claim a </p>\n<p>Berit:<strong> </strong>This is such a beautiful, poignant question—thank you for asking. I grew up in dance and made a life and career out of it. Since opening <a href=\"https://www.spacesunna.com/\">Sunna</a>, my involvement with dance has massively slowed, but will never cease to exist. Dance has brought me joy, freedom, playfulness, and presence, as well as a powerful way to process sadness and pain. But “exercise” has always felt like a “should”—to negate what I ate and drank, to strive to look a certain way, to do what I read, heard, or saw was the right, trendy, or healthy thing every woman should be doing. I’ve had to learn to reframe my daily activity as something that helps me feel like me, an important part of how I developed who I am over four decades, a part of my day that leaves me feeling complete.<br/>I’ve learned to see movement, dance, or otherwise, as a means to find gratitude in my strength and acknowledge a privilege not everyone has. Knowing that movement brings endorphins and keeps my body healthy is a mindset I’ve adapted as I look in the mirror and witness a naturally aging body. But mentally, there is still something there that feels shame or guilt when I don’t prioritize a portion of my day to move my body. I’m still sorting this out and admit that there are layers of expectation that are likely unhealthy.<br/>Like you, I’m learning to listen more to physical feeling and not mental expectation, and perhaps because this has been a newfound understanding for me, it has shown up as a guiding force for Sunna as well. I encourage students to note their energetic, physical, and emotional selves to make a smart decision about what kind of class to partake in on any given day—feel what they really need, not just what expectations tell them. Within classes, too, I constantly remind people to tune into their feelings. What I’m offering as an instructor is a suggestion, but their agency to intensify or pare down the level of the class based on their feelings is a skill and strength to practice—one that doesn’t always come naturally in how our culture has guided us to associate with our bodies.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/05/sunna-minneapolis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>After four months <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/01/why-i-quit-drinking-alcohol/\">alcohol-free</a>, I started my “soberish” chapter in early March. It began as unceremoniously as it ended—no dramatic moment, just a quiet shift. Since then, it’s been going well: a drink or two a week. <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/08/casual-dinner-party/\">Dinner parties</a> now wrap up with one glass of wine, a feat I never thought possible.</p>\n    <p>What’s made this shift feel manageable is knowing <i>why</i> I want a drink when I do—and finding something else that gives me exactly what I was looking for. That part surprised me. Because I’ve realized, not drinking is actually easier than only <i>sometimes</i> drinking. Gray areas are squishy. And what I’ve learned in the squish is this: What I want when I crave a drink usually isn’t alcohol. It’s a moment to unwind. To relax. To savor something lovingly prepared.<br/>Now, my favorite nonalcoholic drinks are staples in my house. I reach for them more often than wine. Going dry for four months taught me that the desire to drink was almost always a desire to treat myself, soften the day, and feel a little bit held. And it turns out, I can do all of that—without alcohol.</p>\n    <p>If you are craving a cocktail, this is the best alternative I’ve found out there! I drank these through holiday parties and didn’t miss my beloved martinis once I found them.</p>\n    <p>Oh, my other beloved drink! I love all flavors of Ghia, but my favorites are the <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16781118\">Sumac &amp; Chili</a> and <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16781104\">Lime &amp; Salt</a>.</p>\n    <p>My friend Peder co-founded this NA brand, and it’s a gorgeous bottle worthy of dinner parties or special occasions. The main ingredient is pine tea (made from local white pine)—it’s spunky, fresh, and perfect in warm weather.</p>\n    <p>A genuinely delicious beer. I like the <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16782425\">Upside Dawn Golden</a> and <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16782439\">Free Wave Hazy IPA</a>. </p>\n    <p>I recently tried a sampler pack of these Minneapolis NA craft beers and would highly recommend it for hosting a party. There is something for everyone!</p>\n    <p>This is a solid light and fresh beer that is sold pretty much everywhere these days. It’s great with food and on a hot summer day.</p>\n    <p>I drink these when I crave sparkling water; they’re so good! I’m not big on sweet drinks, so this earthy, fizzy drink is a real thirst quencher. It also feels special, which is really what I’m looking for when I want a drink. Something that feels like a treat, a little break in the day-to-day.</p>\n    <p>This is the drink I mix up for friends and family who aren’t into beer. It’s also what I make for myself when I want a drink after a long day and an NA beer just isn’t calling to me. I usually have all the ingredients on hand. Simply fill a glass with ice and soda water, add a dash or two of bitters, and squeeze in fresh lime juice to taste.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

    "body": "<p>I’ve shared my desire to <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/11/gift-giving-ideas/\">be a better gift giver</a> over the years, and let me tell you, it’s an ongoing process. Mother’s Day is on Sunday, May 11, and I’ve found that 90% of being a better gift giver is planning well ahead of time. So today I’m reminding you to get those gifts squared away, and offering my personal favorite Mother’s Day gift ideas (including a few that don’t cost a thing).<br/>If you want to get extra personal, ask mom for her own wish list—or ask her best friend to spill the details on what products she’s been talking about lately. You can never go wrong with a personalized gift picked just for her.</p>\n<p>I have a note from Bennett’s preschool teacher I’ve been meaning to frame for five years now! Framing can feel like a chore because of all the decisions that have to be made, from selecting what to frame to figuring out the best way to display it.<br/>Framebridge is my favorite place for creative inspiration, and they can frame just about anything. One way to hit it out of the park with any mom is to frame a memento she’s saved and cherishes but hasn’t done anything with yet.</p>\n<p>I don’t know one mother who isn’t thinking about environmental health these days. Give the gift of safe cookware, especially if mom has a particular pot or pan she’s been wanting to replace. It’s an upgrade she’ll appreciate.</p>\n<p>Putting a Lunya silk sleep mask on signals “off duty” mode. I have one of these masks, and I immediately exhale once it hits my eyes. It’s a hit with Joe too—we often have to trade off who gets to wear it at night.</p>\n<p>Book a sitter (or be the sitter yourself) and block off a day on her calendar to do whatever she wants, wherever she wants. Feel like a hero.</p>\n<p>As my kids get older, I associate their uniqueness with what lights them up. A bracelet with icons and symbols that represent the whole family would be a really special way to celebrate the family you’ve created together. Etsy has a ton of create-your-own options.</p>\n<p>These are such great, high-quality tees—the perfect basic clothing item. They’re structured enough to hold their shape over time but still feel perfectly relaxed. If the mom you are buying for is practical and discerning, Kule will be a hit.</p>\n<p>When I was at Esalen last month, I tried an amazing body oil I can’t stop thinking about. I would rarely treat myself to it, but it would make such a luxurious gift.</p>\n<p>I love the idea of a creative gift that kids and dad can make together. One idea: Have each kid make a portrait of mom to display when she wakes up. Another: Write little messages to mom on colorful paper, roll them into little scrolls, and place them in <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16243285\">a hand-painted wooden chest</a>. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16243974\">Indoor plants</a> are a great gift for anyone who loves to exercise their green thumb. If she loves to garden, get her <a href=\"https://www.greatgardenplants.com/collections/perennials?\">a perennial plant</a>. Even better, make it a ritual that grows over time, each year adding something new to the garden. Don’t be shy in asking her what plants she loves the most. </p>\n<p>Removing some of her mental load is an amazing gift to give mom. I have the Hearth Display—it’s an incredible way to keep track of everything our family has going on, all in one place. If you get a gift like this, be sure to own the initial set-up process too, so it’s not one more thing that has to be on mom’s plate!</p>\n<p>Any luxurious upgrade to an everyday staple will be a winner. Cashmere socks are the ultimate little luxury. You can find a wide range of pricing, from <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16139221\">Comme Si</a> (with amazing colors) to <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16139632\">J.Crew</a>, which has pretty good sale prices on their cashmere-blend socks. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/04/best-mothers-day-gift-ideas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>NEWSFLASH: Dialogue Needs Power &amp; Purpose!</h2>\n<p>The purpose of dialogue is consistently underestimated by writers. This in turn saps its power in many spec screenplays and unpublished novels.</p>\n<p>Yet dialogue is one of the most powerful tools in a writer’s arsenal when done right. But too often it’s done wrong … This means dialogue may end up feeling cheesy, expositional or even downright cringey.</p>\n<p>So, how to avoid this on our novels and screenplays? I’ve dug deep to put dialogue under the microscope … ready? Let’s go!</p>\n<h2>1) Understand The Purpose Of Dialogue</h2>\n<p>Many authors and screenwriters misunderstand the purpose of dialogue. They may believe that good dialogue is about ‘quoteability’ (especially in movies), or that it’s just supposed to make characters ‘sound different’.</p>\n<p>These are a good start, but surface-level. Good dialogue helps tell the story. But what does this mean, especially if we don’t want our scripts and novels to be dialogue-led? Well, we need to realise the purpose of dialogue is four-fold:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>It should help advance the plot.</strong>Many writers are so afraid of #4 on this list they go out of their way NOT to have any plot stuff in dialogue at all. As a result, it’s hard to understand the significance of various moments of dialogue. Oops! Never forget that<a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2014/06/how-does-exposition-work-aka-9-common-exposition-qs-answered.html\"/>. You will need some to tell the story!<strong>exposition is JUST the background information needed to understand what is going on</strong></li>\n      <li><strong>Plus it should reveal character.</strong>There’s nothing wrong with having characters speak in ways unique to them. However, if your supporting characters are speaking too much and taking over, that’s a problem. Equally, if your protagonist or antagonist has nothing ‘about them’, they will fade into the background. Dialogue can be a great tool here.</li>\n      <li><strong>Dialogue should also convey emotion</strong>. Again, emotions are important and there’s nothing wrong with having characters be emotional this way. Plus don’t forget some genres (such as romance) or audiences (such as young adults) will WANT more emotional dialogue.</li>\n      <li><strong>It should deliver the necessary exposition</strong>. This is where many writers fall down. When dialogue becomes too literal, too on-the-nose, or spoon-feeds the audience, it turns into the dreaded ‘expositional dialogue.’</li>\n    </ul>\n<p><strong>B2W TAKEWAY: </strong>Dialogue is never ‘just’ talking. It helps build the characters and tell the story.</p>\n<h2>2) Exposition: Use Sparingly and Strategically!</h2>\n<p>As mentioned above, expositional dialogue isn’t inherently bad. Sometimes it’s necessary, especially for big reveals or clarifying ambiguity. It’s an <i>over-reliance</i> on expositional dialogue in your screenplay or novel that is the red flag!</p>\n<p>Chains of explanatory lines or filler conversations kill momentum. A good way of spotting this in your spec screenplay or novel is when you’re writing very, very little description.</p>\n<p><strong>B2W TAKEAWAY:</strong> If your characters are only talking to inform the audience, you’re doing it wrong. Instead, <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2014/06/how-does-exposition-work-aka-9-common-exposition-qs-answered.html\"> blend information into action, character behaviour or conflict</a>.</p>\n<h2>3) Naturalistic vs Stylised Dialogue</h2>\n<p>This is one predominantly for screenwriters, though novelists may need to make a decision too. While this element may follow ‘fashions’ (we’re currently in a space that values naturalistic dialogue), writers still need to decide where their script or novel sits on the spectrum …</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Naturalistic Dialogue</strong>mimics real-life speech patterns. It’s grounded and often subtle.</li>\n      <li><strong>Stylised Dialogue</strong>is heightened, deliberate, and often reflects the writer’s unique voice. Think Joss Whedon, Stephen King or Diablo Cody here.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p><strong>B2W TAKEAWAY:</strong> Both have their place. The key is consistency and intention. Choose what serves the story, not what sounds cool.</p>\n<h2>4) Subtext and Foreshadowing</h2>\n<p>Great dialogue isn’t just about what’s said … it’s about what’s unsaid. Subtext allows characters to talk about one thing while really addressing something deeper. This adds richness and realism, tying into both plot and character arcs.</p>\n<p>A good example of subtext in a famous movie would be <strong> Miles’ monologue about Pinot in the award-winning drama </strong>. He is not talking about wine at all, but himself and how he is fundamentally misunderstood. </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Sideways</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Similarly, foreshadowing through dialogue hints at what’s to come. When done well, it builds tension and anticipation. Combine this with set up/pay off techniques for maximum narrative impact.</p>\n<p><strong> A good example of foreshadowing in dialogue</strong> happens in </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2025/06/next-level-dialogue-how-to-make-your-characters-speak-with-power-purpose.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

That’s what makes her a standout leader.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://bang2write.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/12.png\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright wp-image-25611 lazyload\" data-src=\"https://bang2write.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/12-150x150.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"129\" height=\"129\" data-srcset=\"https://bang2write.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/12-150x150.png 150w, https://bang2write.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/12-300x300.png 300w, https://bang2write.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/12-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://bang2write.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/12-768x768.png 768w, https://bang2write.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/12-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://bang2write.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/12.png 1654w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 129px) 100vw, 129px\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 129px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 129/129;\"/></a>4) Rosa Diaz, <i>Brooklyn 99</i></h2>\n<p>Rosa Diaz is the precinct’s badass: stoic, sharp, and fiercely private. She’s the detective you want in your corner. Her coming out as bisexual was handled with emotional weight and humour. Loving Rosa isn’t always easy, but it’s definitely inevitable.

Her loyalty lies in platonic bonds and responsibility. Though Katniss ultimately chooses Peeta, love for her is about stability; not passion. She’s never an ‘ice queen’, just focused on survival and what truly matters.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>MORE:  4 Ways The Hunger Games Subverts Expectations </strong>\n    </p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://bang2write.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/11.png\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright wp-image-25610 lazyload\" data-src=\"https://bang2write.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/11-150x150.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"170\" height=\"170\" data-srcset=\"https://bang2write.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/11-150x150.png 150w, https://bang2write.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/11-300x300.png 300w, https://bang2write.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/11-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://bang2write.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/11-768x768.png 768w, https://bang2write.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/11-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://bang2write.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/11.png 1654w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 170px) 100vw, 170px\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 170px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 170/170;\"/></a>6) Karen, <i>Will &amp; Grace</i></h2>\n<p>Karen is a gloriously awful caricature of the rich elite – and she owns it! She’s literally THE WORST, both hilarious and unexpectedly tender. Her relationships with Stan and Rosario hint at a hidden heart.</p>\n<p>In the reboot, Karen somehow gets even worse (and as far as I’m concerned, even better). She’s offensive, outrageous, and endlessly watchable. Throughout the eleven series run, she plays around with her sexuality.

    "body": "<h2>Why Writers Still Need The Traditional Synopsis (Yes, Really!)</h2>\n<p>Let’s get one thing straight upfront, Bang2writers … When it comes to submissions, the traditional synopsis is still very much a thing. It’s true, I’ve advocated for one page pitches A LOT on this site (you can grab a free reference guide, <strong> HERE</strong>) … But  sometimes you just can’t beat a good old-fashioned traditional synopsis.</p>\n<p>I know, I know. You’d rather chew glass than try and summarise your 90,000-word novel or your 120-page screenplay in just one or two pages.</p>\n<p>But here’s the kicker: agents, publishers, and producers EXPECT it. Like it or not, the traditional synopsis is non-negotiable in many parts of the industry.</p>\n<h2>Why Do Industry Pros Want a Synopsis Anyway?</h2>\n<p>It’s not because they want to torture you (though it may feel that way). It’s because they’re overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>Script readers and assistants often use the synopsis as a first sift, deciding whether your project is even worth reading. That means if your synopsis doesn’t land? <i>Your manuscript or script might never get read</i>.</p>\n<p>Let that sink in for a moment. Think of your synopsis as your ticket to getting READ!</p>\n<h2>By the way … script readers also need to write synopses too!</h2>\n<p>If you do (or want to do) this work, chances are you will need to summarise screenplays (or novels, for book coverage) for your boss.</p>\n<p><strong> The script readers who get hired again and again write GREAT synopses</strong>. This is because producers, agents, film financiers and investors etc don’t have time to read every single submission.</p>\n<p>This means industry pros rely on their script readers’ reports. A key element of the report is the synopsis, as it helps them make important decisions. If they can’t make those decisions because your reader’s report synopsis SUCKS? Then guess what, you’re fired. Yikes!</p>\n<h2>What Actually *Is* a Traditional Synopsis?</h2>\n<p>Unlike the newer and often preferred one page pitch, a traditional synopsis does include the entire plot in detail. I frequently call it a ‘blow-by-blow’ account of your story. You’re expected to show the full arc of your story (yes, even the ending!).</p>\n<p>Here’s what a solid synopsis needs to cover:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>The Set Up and Pay Off (aka beginning and ending)</li>\n      <li>Your main character’s arc (especially your protagonist’s, though maybe your antagonist’s too)</li>\n      <li>A sense of <strong>the storyworld</strong></li>\n      <li>A feel for the tone and genre</li>\n      <li>Dynamic language that keeps the reader engaged (never lapse into the dreaded ‘and then… and then …!).</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Sounds simple enough, right? But anyone who’s attempted one knows, it’s NOT. It’s one of the hardest documents to write, even for seasoned pros. My tips on how to do this, after the pic.</p>\n<h2>Enter: The Hamburger Method</h2>\n<p>When I’m working 1:1 with writers, I frequently recommend thinking of your traditional synopsis like a hamburger (or a veggie burger, if you prefer). Here’s what you need:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>BREAD 1 (Top Bun):</strong>This is your Set Up: introduce your protagonist, what they want, and what’s standing in their way. Give a sense of the genre and tone here too, but don’t go wild.</li>\n      <li><strong>MEAT (The Juicy Middle):</strong>This is the main bulk of your story. Pull from your novel or script’s scenes and chapters to summarise the journey. Don’t include every twist and turn, just the key beats and arcs that reveal character and push the story forward.</li>\n      <li><strong>BREAD 2 (Bottom Bun):</strong>The Pay Off. Yes, reveal the ending!!! Holding it back doesn’t make your story more intriguing. In fact, it actively frustrates readers.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Remember, this is NOT a blurb, it’s a tool for industry professionals to assess the shape and execution of your story.</p>\n<h2>But Can’t I Just Write a One Page Pitch?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://bang2write.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-B2W-1-Page-Pitch-Guide1.pdf\"> One page pitches are fantastic</a>. I use and teach them all the time. It’s a great idea to have one pagers ready, especially if you;re a screenwriter. You should be ready to ‘sell the sizzle, not the steak’ on your scripts.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2025/06/how-to-write-a-synopsis-for-your-screenplay-or-novel.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Newsflash: Your Writing SUCKS</h2>\n<p>So, the bad news: your writing sucks and you need to fix it. Every single day Google brings writers to this blog using the search phrase ‘my writing sucks’. Supersadface.</p>\n<p>Look, it’s not unusual to believe your writing sucks. It may even be true. While I am the first one to say <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2021/06/how-to-banish-impostor-syndrome-from-your-writing-life-for-good.html\"> writers need to believe in themselves</a>, it’s also a good idea to be realistic. It’s not possible to write a perfect draft straight out the gate, plus writing craft is HARD. It takes a lot of practice!</p>\n<p>So, here’s the good news: if you think your writing sucks, you’ve come to the right place to fix it. Ready? Let’s go …</p>\n<h2>1) You have a love/hate relationship with your draft<br/> </h2>\n<p>Whether it’s a messy novel or a bloated screenplay, clinging to that first version will kill your story. I get it, you love your story. That’s great! But you also have to temper that with the knowledge your first idea is rarely your best one. You’re unlikely to hit the nail on the head the first time you write something … whether that’s a draft or even a whole project!</p>\n<p>What’s that: you HATE your draft? That’s normal too. Look, writing gets romanticised online and by pro writers. You thought it would be a lot easier than this. But you’re not the worst writer in the universe. Writing is just DIFFICULT.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO FIX IT:</strong> Rewrite with purpose. Cut the filler. No one cares about your clever lines if they’re slowing the pace. And remember to LET GO. You – and your story – will not develop if you are resistant to the process. </p>\n<p><strong>MORE:</strong> <strong>‘I Trust The Process’ – And 9 More Powerful Affirmations For Writers</strong></p>\n<h2>2) You’re playing it safe</h2>\n<p>Writers tell me all the time about their ideas. But so often they will follow it up with …</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <i>‘But am I ALLOWED to tell this story?’</i>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <i>‘Yes, but I could NEVER write XYZ.’</i>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <i>‘But I’m SCARED of writing that.’</i>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<p>This might be <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2025/01/tropes-vs-stereotypes-vs-cliches-why-knowing-the-difference-is-important.html\"> about a particular character or trope</a>; storyworld or genre; tone or style; even something they’ve lived through themselves.</p>\n<p>In other words, absolutely ANYTHING. Writers will find every excuse in the book NOT to write something.  The most common these days is <i>‘Twitter might yell at me.’ </i></p>\n<p>But in fiction or film, safe = forgettable. Your novel ends up reading like everything else on Kindle. Your screenplay feels like a rejected Netflix pitch.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO FIX IT:</strong> Be braver. Go darker, weirder, funnier, messier. Whatever takes it up a notch. I double dare you! </p>\n<h2>3) You’re telling, not showing</h2>\n<p>Visual writing is at a MEGA premium in the spec pile, whether novels or screenplays.</p>\n<p>Unpublished novel manuscripts are awash with non-stop thoughts and feelings.</p>\n<p>Screenplays are chains of dialogue, flashbacks and voice-overs.</p>\n<p>Both will ‘info-dump’, laying out facts and figures believing that’s how exposition works.</p>\n<p>Spoiler: it DOESN’T!</p>\n<p>Whether we’re reading or viewing, never forget: we learn about a character from what they DO.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO FIX IT:</strong> Whether it’s prose or script, DRAMATISE it. Think about the physical realm. Make the reader *see* it. Let action and character behaviour do the heavy lifting. </p>\n<p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2016/02/wed-3rd-feb-writing-adages-explained-show-dont-tell.html\">Writing Adages Explained: ‘Show, Don’t Tell’</a></p>\n<h2>4) Your characters are cardboard <br/> </h2>\n<p>If your protagonist is a cliché or your villain is just “bad,” readers and viewers will check out. Modern readers and audiences LIKE shades of grey.</p>\n<p>Real people are complex. LET your characters make bad decisions. They’re not meant to be perfect. So what if <strong>@internethandle4Millionand1</strong> might have a problem with it in a review?? That hasn’t happened yet. </p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO FIX IT:</strong> Let them surprise you. That’s where the magic is. <strong>And learn about tropes!</strong></p>\n<h2>5) You don’t have the GUTS to finish!</h2>\n<p>This one is frequently connected to 1 and 2 on this list. Writers end up going in circles, making zero progress because they can’t LET GO.</p>\n<p>Half a novel? An act one and a dream? Not enough. Finishing something – however flawed – is the only way to get better. I know it’s scary. No one said it was easy. But it’s gotta be done.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2025/06/5-reasons-your-writing-sucks-yes-novelists-screenwriters.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>If Richard was going to commit suicide—and this time, he really was—he wasn’t about to make some elaborate production of it. He refused to leave behind a situation which needed cleaning up. That meant not hanging himself, not slitting his wrists, and definitely not shooting himself. Sleeping pills were the obvious choice, but Richard’s brother had died of an overdose, and he just couldn’t bring himself to go in a related fashion.</p>\n<p>Which was why, today, he’d decided on carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>\n<p>It’ll be painless, he told himself, flicking the light switch in the garage. Like falling asleep. He got into his ancient Nissan and turned the key for what he planned to be the last time. He hadn’t bothered to write a note; there was nobody to address it to. Breathing his vehicle’s exhaust, he took in his final surroundings. A dim, cluttered room. Stuff in boxes. Stuff in bags. Two fold-up chairs, a lawnmower, a spattering of camping gear, a neglected set of weights. The detritus of a life that filled Richard with dread each time he remembered having lived it.</p>\n<p>He smiled to himself. (Who else would he be smiling for?) How unspectacular, to go out like this. Alone, in an old car he’d never liked, encircled by crap. How fitting. How perfectly Richard.</p>\n<p>The tang of gas riled his nerves. It occurred to him: what if this didn’t work? What if he only succeeded in becoming mush for someone to take care of?</p>\n<p>Detecting a headache—a sign the fumes were working—he turned on the radio. He was encouraged to find himself hallucinating when the radio referred to him by name.</p>\n<p>“Hello? Richard?” An elderly woman’s voice crackled through the car’s antiquated sound-system. “I’m looking for Richard.”</p>\n<p>“This is him,” Richard answered out of habit, immediately feeling ridiculous about it.</p>\n<p>“I have bad news, Richard. You can’t die today.”</p>\n<p>Choosing not to engage with the sputters of his dying brain, Richard didn’t reply.</p>\n<p>“You’re straying from the authorized flow of events,” said the scratchy voice. “Normally I’d allow a deviation, but with the holidays…” A sigh through the speakers; a gust of static. “Richard, we’re simply overcrowded. You think the population crisis is bad on this material plane, where people only exist for the blink of an eye? Imagine eternity. So I’m sorry, I can’t make any exceptions—you’ll have to wait until your time, young man.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not young.”</p>\n<p>“You’re alive. That’s young.”</p>\n<p>Richard shifted in the driver’s seat, unable to get comfortable. A numbness spread through him—a hollow feeling, like hunger cramps. He couldn’t piece together the logic behind what his car was telling him, but he supposed he shouldn’t expect a talking car to make sense. All a dream, anyway.</p>\n<p>Falling asleep, painless…</p>\n<p>“This isn’t a dream,” said the car radio, the old woman, the hallucination. “Snap out of it, sad guy.”</p>\n<p>“Who are you, the grim reaper?”</p>\n<p>“That’s one thing people call me. Listen, you’ll wake up from this. You just have to decide whether massive brain damage sounds appealing.”</p>\n<p>“Because I’m not meant to kill myself?”</p>\n<p>“Very few people are meant to kill themselves. And wouldn’t you know it, the few who are meant to, those are the ones who never get around to it. Anyway, you’re not one of those few.”</p>\n<p>“Go away, Death.” He considered his words, and quickly added, “Just take me with you.”</p>\n<p>“What if I said you had a child you didn’t know about?”</p>\n<p>“I’d say you’re lying.” During those rare periods in Richard’s life when he’d been sexually active, he’d also been obsessively careful. “It’s no use. I don’t care anymore. I just don’t care.”</p>\n<p>“If that were true, you wouldn’t mind making a mess on your way out. You’d just shoot yourself and be done with it, Dick. Is it fine if I call you Dick?”</p>\n<p>Richard sensed, far away, a note of anger inside him. “If you stop me, I’m just going to try again. If not today, tomorrow.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/dick-tries-to-die-jake-stein/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>When I was nine, my dad warned me about the dangers of dreaming.</p>\n<p>“You know, it’s like if you drink too much water, it shuts down the electrical connections and you just keel on over,” he’d said in his woodchip voice as we sat at the kitchen table.</p>\n<p>“Your body forgets how to breathe. Same with dreaming—you get too high in them dreams, there ain’t enough oxygen.”</p>\n<p>I had made the mistake of telling him I wanted to be an explorer that day, after Mrs. Hastings showed us a National Geographic article about the Galapagos Islands. I was too young to know about brain synapses and what electricity had to do with any of it so I’d just nodded. My father had cupped my cheeks in his dry, cracked hands, and left to tend the chickens.</p>\n<p>I didn’t blame him. He’d wanted to be a mechanic as a young boy. But his mom got sick, bills came due, and his dreams lost the oxygen needed to keep on. Perhaps the electricity too.</p>\n<p>Maybe that was why he’d never been able to see the valley of dreams.</p>\n<p>I lay in that valley now, amused by the flowing and frolicking nature of these benign aberrations.</p>\n<p>I’d known it forever, this expanse of long, swaying grass, sprawling for miles until being taken in by the Catskills. It was a sight to behold—nature as it was designed, free from humans save for the touch of a barn and a withering fence in the distance.</p>\n<p>The barn was of course not a barn at all, but a home. It was where I had grown up, except for a short stint at Binghamton University. It was my parent’s farm, but its day to day operations were mine now.</p>\n<p>I could see the dreams drifting along the valley–gusts of green and squalls of scarlet scheming to take me away. If only for just a short while.</p>\n<p>It’s possible I’m crazy. I’ve considered this before.</p>\n<p>I did bring an old girlfriend once—had her sit under the gnarled weeping beech tree with me. But Madeline did not see the colorful clouds that meandered around me with scenes of game-winning shots and yuletide festivities—she saw nothing but a normal field. A beautiful field she had assured me, but nothing strange.</p>\n<p>I had thought she might see her dreams, and I can never be sure she didn’t I suppose, but, like my father, her eyes didn’t seem to light up like you would imagine when witnessing your desires as figments and flashes floating in the air. If she did see anything, she never told me, and then we broke up, and she never told me anything after that.</p>\n<p>But unlike Madeline, I saw the dreams and the dreams seemed to see me.</p>\n<p>Now I was thirty-eight, still single, and I knew the rhythm of a day. It was Wednesday, which meant by sunrise I’d completed all farm tasks in need of my attention.</p>\n<p>Free for a spell, I’d come to the valley where dreams wandered.</p>\n<p>With the wind mellow and lazy, it allowed the dreams that drifted my way to linger, letting me settle into them before they moved on to wherever else they had to be.</p>\n<p>I saw a particularly large one drifting—a cloud the color of an ocean sunset. Pink and puffy, and gliding down a draft of air like a child on a waterslide. It slid along before engulfing me in its mist.</p>\n<p>This was a road-not-traveled dream. Well, they all were really. I witnessed a scene of myself and Ella Feldman, sitting on a couch, watching TV together. It looked vaguely like my parent’s house but with slight alterations—many horse statues abound and lace curtains. This was of course because when I had had a crush on Ella, back in third grade, she had a major obsession with horses. She probably still did, but I wouldn’t know because we had drifted apart freshman year of high school. She’d stuck around the area, but she was married now and had two children.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/where-dreams-wandered-andrew-m-jaromin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>On Friday morning, August 22, illustrator Felipe Galindo Gómez opened his email to find a note from his friend. “Have you seen this?” the message read, and linked to the White House’s bullet-pointed <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036180/trump-targets-lgbtq-history-migrants-and-more-in-chilling-smithsonian-hit-list/\">list targeting Smithsonian artworks and exhibitions</a>. There it was: an image of his 1999 <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2018648700/\">illustration</a> “4th of July from the south border.”</p>\n<p>Since 2022, Galindo’s work had been reproduced on a label about anti-immigrant prejudice as part of<i> </i><a href=\"https://latino.si.edu/exhibitions/presente\"> ¡Presente! A Latino History of the United States</a> in the National Museum of American History’s (NMAH) Molina Family Latino Gallery. Over the last three years, the gallery space has served as the temporary location of the nascent National Museum of the American Latino, which is currently facing an uncertain future under the Trump administration. Now, the Molina gallery has quietly closed for the next nine months, </p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>confirmed.</p>\n<p>After the White House featured his work in its hit list, Galindo, who also goes by the name “Feggo,” said he traveled from New York City to Washington, DC, to see whether it was still up. When he arrived at the museum on Tuesday, he found the exhibition closed. A sign said it would reopen in spring 2026. According to the Smithsonian’s website, <i>¡Presente! </i>was scheduled to close at the end of November, in preparation for <a href=\"https://www.si.edu/250\">programming</a> marking the United States’s 250th birthday. But the exhibition was shuttered on July 20, four months sooner than expected. The decision notably follows Trump’s <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/999509/trump-whitewashes-history-in-new-smithsonian-executive-order/\">March executive order</a> targeting the Smithsonian Institution and the release of his Fiscal Year 2026 budget, which excluded funding for the NMAL.</p>\n<p>The Molina Family Latino Gallery’s early closure means it will remain shuttered throughout Hispanic Heritage Month this fall, and marks a lengthy period of inactivity for the fledgling National Museum of the American Latino’s only current physical gallery, which the museum’s director, Jorge Zamanillo, has <a href=\"https://time.com/6314166/museum-american-latino-controversy/\">referred</a> to as the institution’s “first iteration.” </p>\n<p>Reached by <i>Hyperallergic</i>, a spokesperson for the institution cited preparations for the Smithsonian’s <i>Our Shared Future: 250</i> programming as the reason for the exhibition’s premature closure. </p>\n<p>“The National Museum of the American Latino is participating in the Smithsonian’s celebration of the nation’s 250th anniversary and wanted to meet the spring 2026 deadline for opening the <i>Puro Ritmo</i> exhibition in support of the Smithsonian’s institution-wide plans,” the spokesperson said, referring to the upcoming show <a href=\"https://latino.si.edu/exhibitions\"> ¡Puro Ritmo! The Musical Journey of Salsa</a> at the Molina gallery. “The Molina Family Latino Gallery is closed to visitors because museum staff need the space to safely de-install </p>\n<p><i>Presente</i>and then transition the exhibition space into a staging area to prepare for the renovation and installation of</p>\n<p><i>Puro Ritmo</i>.”</p>\n<p>The institution <a href=\"https://time.com/6314166/museum-american-latino-controversy/\">reportedly</a> adopted the salsa-themed exhibition as a softer alternative to a planned exhibition on Latino youth movements that garnered significant conservative backlash. Before Trump’s crackdown on the Smithsonian began, that exhibition was widely criticized by conservatives who disagreed with its focus on colonization and threatened to <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/835401/republicans-vote-to-block-funding-for-museum-of-american-latino/\">withhold federal funding</a> for the forthcoming museum in 2023.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>The Smithsonian spokesperson did not directly answer a question about whether Trump’s museum reviews or executive action influenced the decision to close the Molina Gallery in July. Trump has<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Letter-Sec.-Bunch-Smithsonian-8.12.2025.pdf\"> repeatedly pushed</a> the Smithsonian to promote “unity, progress, and enduring values” in time for the country’s 250th anniversary next year. Earlier this month, the administration demanded that Smithsonian museums submit their 250th anniversary plans to “<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/08/letter-to-the-smithsonian-internal-review-of-smithsonian-exhibitions-and-materials/\">align messaging</a>” with the White House Salute to America 250 Task Force.</p>\n<p>Three of the works named on last week’s White House list were created by living artists who were born in Mexico, including Galindo, raising questions about how the institution will protect its Latino artists under pressure from the federal government.</p>\n<p>When Galindo learned from a staff member that the museum was “rotating” the exhibition, he told <i>Hyperallergic </i>he remembers thinking, “Is that a new word for censoring?” </p>\n<p>The administration has already launched a review of <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/08/letter-to-the-smithsonian-internal-review-of-smithsonian-exhibitions-and-materials/\">exhibitions</a> planned for the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence as part of its larger probe. Trump’s government referenced the US’s 250th anniversary nine times in its letter to the Smithsonian announcing its review and forthcoming “content corrections.” </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037811/smithsonian-latino-gallery-quietly-closes-for-nine-months/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>SAN MARINO, Calif. — Standing in the gallery of <a href=\"https://www.huntington.org/exhibitions/betye-saar-drifting-toward-twilight\"> Betye Saar: Drifting Toward Twilight</a>, you are bathed in oceanic, cobalt blue light. The buzz of neon lights drones in the background. It’s hard to say if the temperature has truly dropped, or if it’s psychosomatic, that the atmosphere has cooled your skin just by the power of suggestion. You’re floating in space, or suspended underwater — gravity works differently here.</p>\n    <p>The phases of the moon are painted on the wall in a matte metallic silver, and a small poem by Saar is draped across the wall: “The moon keeps vigil as a lone canoe drifts into a sea of tranquility seeking serenity in the twilight.” In the middle of the room, a long canoe, 17 feet across, sits atop a bed of branches, bramble, and sheets of jagged wood. At either tip of the ship is a watchful eye guiding the raft in both directions. Two sentinels — antiques affixed with antlers — keep watch at each end. Saar has crafted a fantastical scene; you can envision the boat careening upriver, striding forth.</p>\n    <p>The vessel is occupied by bird cages confining animal antlers and seated upon miniature chairs fit only for a toddler — or, perhaps, spirits who scarcely need a physical seat, just an invitation to rest. These scavenged items are characteristic of Saar’s found object assemblage; she hunts for her materials, whether in nature or at flea markets.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/cFoCY-1200x900.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>“I like combining manufactured objects with natural objects,” says the 98-year-old artist in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n2Dg3C10Y&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huntington.org%2F&amp;embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huntington.org&amp;source_ve_path=MjM4NTE&amp;themeRefresh=1\">video</a> at the back of the gallery. She started collecting at four or five, she explains, but the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. was a catalyzing moment. She was so overwhelmed with emotion that she could do nothing but create art, leading her to assemble one of her most famed sculptures, “The Liberation of Aunt Jemima” (1972), which empowers and equips a “mammy” figurine with defensive weaponry.</p>\n    <p>Saar is a famed Angeleno, a fixture in the city’s art scene, but she was raised in Pasadena, which neighbors the Huntington Gardens, where this site-specific commission went up in 2023. In the short directed by Kyle Provencio Reingold, the camera follows her through the massive campus, where she first wandered at 12 or 13 alongside her mother and neighbor. We forage the gardens with her as she instructs the Huntington employees of her artistic intentions; you can hear the giddiness in her voice as she remembers her childhood traversing its grounds, selecting fallen branches and trimmings. “Even in death, those things can be really beautiful,” she muses.</p>\n    <p>The gallery lighting shifts from daylight to dusk as time creeps along. <i>Drifting Into Twilight </i>is an encapsulated, self-sustaining environment of its own, like a display exhibit at a natural history museum with a surrealistic twist. The room is as relaxing as it is disorienting; it feels like you’ve been plunged into a misty and peculiar other world. You are sinking, descending, drifting into twilight. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/bcIbO-1200x900.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.huntington.org/exhibitions/betye-saar-drifting-toward-twilight\">Betye Saar: Drifting Toward Twilight</a> <i>continues at Virginia Steele Scott Galleries of American Art at the Huntington (1151 Oxford Road, San Marino, California) through November 30, 2027.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Since 1973, Vincent van Gogh masterpieces including his beloved sunflowers, wistful wheatfields, and self-portraits have been housed in Amsterdam’s Van Gogh Museum. The institution was established via a historic 1962 agreement between the painter’s nephew and the Dutch government to ensure the long-term preservation of hundreds of paintings, drawings, and letters comprising van Gogh’s oeuvre.<br/>Now, the museum says that the collection’s future is uncertain, citing a dispute with the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (OCW) over the funding for costly maintenance repairs and sustainability efforts mandated by the state. In a legal complaint, the institution claims that the Dutch government is violating its decades-old agreement by refusing to provide sufficient subsidies to cover the cost of the three-year, €104 million (~$121 million) project.</p>\n    <p>Under the Dutch Heritage Act, national museums, including the Van Gogh Museum, the Rijksmuseum, and the Kröller-Müller Museum, receive annual housing subsidies to help them maintain and preserve their collections. But the Van Gogh Museum says that this yearly government funding —<a href=\"https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0037533/2025-05-07\"> currently €8,428,300 (~$9.8 million)</a> — falls short of the more than €11 million (~$12.8 million) needed to help it finance much-needed renovations to its fire and security alarms, climate control system, and internal elevators leading to storage facilities, plus the sustainability upgrades required for all Dutch public buildings as of 2024.</p>\n    <p>“So far, the state of the museum has not directly affected the programming and operations,” a Van Gogh Museum spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “But it’s just a matter of time before it will become a major issue.” </p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for OCW said that the ministry “maintains that the allocated housing subsidy is sufficient to cover the necessary maintenance cost.”</p>\n    <p>“This position is based on comprehensive research conducted by independent experts commissioned by the Ministry,” the spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>, noting that the subsidy is a “fixed amount” that is annually adjusted for inflation. </p>\n    <p>The museum did not disclose how the subsidy is calculated, but the OCW representative said that the same methodology is used for other national museums, citing the Rijksmuseum, which receives<a href=\"https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0037533/2025-05-07\"> €37 million (~$43 million)</a>, and the Kröller-Müller Museum, which receives<a href=\"https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0037533/2025-05-07\"> €9.8 (~$11.4 million)</a>.</p>\n    <p>For the past two years, the Van Gogh Museum has been negotiating with the government to increase this annual subsidy by €2.5 million (~$2.9 million) to no avail.</p>\n    <p>If the institution does not come to a resolution soon, the museum says it may need to close its doors. The Van Gogh Foundation, established by the painter’s nephew, has also echoed concerns about the institution’s future and urged the Dutch government to abide by its obligations to protect the artist’s works as stipulated by the founding 1962 agreement.</p>\n    <p>The Van Gogh Museum houses the largest collection of works by the artist in the world, comprising over 200 paintings, 500 drawings, and 900 letters, as well as other works by the Dutch artist’s contemporaries and influences. Over the course of five decades, nearly 57 million people have visited the museum, with annual attendance reaching a peak of 2.6 million in 2017. Last year, the institution hosted five exhibitions, including a <a href=\"https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/visit/whats-on/exhibitions/overview-past-exhibitions/matthew-wong-vincent-van-gogh?_gl=1*hwymjv*_up*MQ..*_gs*MQ..&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw_L_FBhDmARIsAItqgt7ROFc2U8sSxAl_BZzcsB103XGQ8Jw98o63-UmTCCXX4lYhJiRItScaAho5EALw_wcB&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADhviGV-Km3u2LOuKphdQgDUdbYh0\">retrospective</a> exploring van Gogh’s influence on the late Chinese-Canadian artist Matthew Wong and a <a href=\"https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/visit/whats-on/exhibitions/overview-past-exhibitions/vive-limpressionnisme?_gl=1*glzo0v*_up*MQ..&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw_L_FBhDmARIsAItqgt7ROFc2U8sSxAl_BZzcsB103XGQ8Jw98o63-UmTCCXX4lYhJiRItScaAho5EALw_wcB&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADhviGV-Km3u2LOuKphdQgDUdbYh0\">show</a> paying homage to French Impressionism.</p>\n    <p>The case is scheduled to be heard in court on February 19, the OCW spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037500/amsterdam-van-gogh-museum-collection-faces-uncertain-future/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>‣ Design is a minefield of ethical dilemmas, incentivizing companies to work with exploitative clients and making it difficult for employees to say no. Elizabeth Goodspeed spoke with a few designers, writing in <i> It’s Nice That</i>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Questions about client ethics are tricky enough when you know exactly who you’re working for. Things get even murkier when work is licensed, resold, or embedded with no direct link between creator and end user. For type designers, this is the norm. Once a font is released, it can surface almost anywhere, often without warning. Jesse Ragan, cofounder of XYZ Type, says custom projects feel relatively straightforward to assess ideologically: if he doesn’t believe in a client, he can simply turn down the work. Retail fonts are a different story. A typeface is made in isolation long before it’s used, and can be licensed anonymously or simply pulled from Adobe Fonts without the designer’s knowledge. Jesse has seen his work turn up in porn, conservative Christian campaigns, and even materials for a far-right Texas militia. “It’s always a shock to see,” he says, especially given his left-leaning politics. He describes designing a typeface as a slow, intimate process – “every little letterform, it’s like, ‘hello, friend’, when I see them” – which makes it all the more jarring when it gets into the wrong hands. Rutherford Craze, founder of foundry Mass Driver, shares this feeling. “Some type designers feel that once they release a typeface, where it ends up is no longer their concern. I strongly disagree,” he says. “It’s not feasible to make a living and keep a spotless conscience, but it’s our responsibility to find the most equitable balance we can, whether that’s through [dis]incentivising certain usage, or turning down work for clients we disagree with.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>‣ Noguchi Museum Rights, an anonymous group of workers at the New York institution, penned an essay flagging longstanding allegations of racism and artwashing at the museum. They write in <i> Everything is Political</i>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Given that the keffiyeh is a cultural garment, meaning it is protected under city and state laws, and is the only thing ever explicitly targeted by this policy, how does the selective enforcement of this policy not discriminate against individuals who would wear a keffiyeh as a cultural item? What is the distinction between cultural and political in this context, and how is that dealt with by museum leadership?</p>\n      <p>Why were board Co-Chairs Spencer Bailey and Susan Kessler so involved in enforcing the keffiyeh ban, and in what ways does enforcing the ban relate to their responsibilities?</p>\n      <p>The leadership is not for the community, despite running a community museum founded by an activist artist who would be appalled by the current conditions. While people and organizations have stopped partnering with the museum, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaints have been filed, the staff has unionized, and the museum has received terrible press, those in leadership positions have simply crossed their fingers in the hope that the public will forget about it all. The Noguchi Museum is a community non-profit, and as a member of the community, you deserve answers.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>‣ The Moomins exhibition at the Brooklyn Public Library was easily one of the highlights of my summer, and for the <i> New Yorker</i>, Jon Allsop articulates the role these deeply human trolls can play in an age of anxiety and repression:</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037819/required-reading-748/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>SANTA FE — In 1998, science fiction writer Ted Chiang published “Story of Your Life,” in which aliens come to Earth in “looking glasses,” mirrored spaceships that act as communication devices. The central character, linguist Dr. Louise Banks, is tasked with deciphering the aliens’ language. In turn, she begins to see time like they do — as simultaneous events — and ultimately glimpses her own future.</p>\n<p>A reference to “Story of Your Life” is tucked into the exhibition guidebook for <i> Once Within a Time</i>, SITE Santa Fe’s 12th International. Curator Cecilia Alemani identified Chiang as one of the exhibition’s 27 “figures of interest” — catalysts for the 71</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>participating artists and more than two dozen writers. What struck me about Alemani’s inclusion of Chiang’s writing was not the reference to extraterrestrial life (many readers will be familiar with the accounts of UFO sightings in New Mexico), but the surreal, endlessly fascinating phenomenon of the looking glass.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><i>Once Within a Time</i> takes reflection as a major cue. Within each curated theme, such as “The Wheel of Telling” and “The Secret Life of Puppets,” are mirror images, doubles, reversals, and echoes, along with symmetries of place, histories, peoples, and legends — offering exhibition visitors concurrent rather than sequential events, in which multiple perspectives and timelines unfold. Even the treatment of the exhibition title, <a href=\"https://www.sitesantafe.org/en/once-within-a-time/\">in which “Time” is printed upside down</a>, gestures to alternative ways of experiencing the temporal, reflective nature of both art and language. </p>\n<p>Among the many echoing narratives are works by Nora Turato and Will Rawls. Turato’s mural “I WANT OUT!” (2025), a red vinyl triptych with one panel per word, is installed on the exterior of SITE Santa Fe, the main venue; inside the museum, Rawls’s <i>Amphigory </i>(2022), a series of inky, glitchy screen prints, seems to respond to Turato’s plea with the barely legible phrase “U Can’t Escape Alive.” </p>\n<p>In the gallery with Rawls is a suite of 72 computer drawings from 1969 by hard-edge abstract painter Frederick Hammersley, who died in 2009 at age 90. He hit an artistic dry spell in the late ’60s, saying, “I painted myself out,” a condition of exhaustion, liberation, or perhaps both. To shake things up, he enrolled in <a href=\"https://www.santafenewmexican.com/pasatiempo/art/by-design-art1-and-the-early-history-of-computer-art/article_f5239b0a-13d2-11eb-ae6c-378f161fb667.html\">a computer class for artists</a> at the University of New Mexico. He used the program ART 1 to create multiple printouts of the individual “drawings” that comprise the suite on view, visually undulating abstract compositions of gray monochrome letters, numbers, and punctuation marks. With additional presentations of Chester Nez and the “<a href=\"https://guides.loc.gov/navajo-code-talkers/profiles\">Original 29” Navajo Code Talkers</a>, Autumn Chacon’s radio frequency installation, and others, visitors may experience some seriously surreal data-driven reverberations.  </p>\n<p>In SITE’s central gallery space, color-rich reverse paintings on glass — a vase of flowers, a snake, a dreamlike landscape — by Rebecca Salsbury James, born in 1891, were just odd enough to make me linger and consider her time in Taos, New Mexico, with Mabel Dodge Luhan, Georgia O’Keeffe, and other New York-to-Taos transplants. A selection from James’s collection of miniatures, including figurines, mirrors, and devotional objects, is also on view, many of which are in pairs or otherwise doubled. One tells a story, but two hold a conversation.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere in the gallery, I felt like I was in a funhouse or hall of mirrors. Louise Bonnet’s fleshy, misshapen, iridescent-skinned figures had me reflecting on my own pale, bony frame as equally warped and grotesque, alien to New Mexico’s desert environment. Katja Seib’s large-scale portrait paintings present the concept of reflection in literal and metaphysical terms. For example, “Cornucopia” (2025) depicts a fortune teller revealing her cards to the viewer; in the background, a framed image of another woman doing the same creates an infinity mirror effect. Nearby, a travel chest that belonged to <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/money/Gertrudis-Barcelo\">Doña Tules</a>, dubbed the “Queen of Sin” for her business activities (gambling and possibly a brothel), sits in the corner lit by a red light bulb, which I read as a heavy-handed reference to the stigma applied to other fiercely independent women who’ve come to the region. </p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037395/seeing-new-mexico-through-the-looking-glass-site-santa-fe-12th-international/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Hailing from the upper classes of southern England, with regularized, side-parted, tamped-down hair, he spent much of his life in headlong flight from his upbringing.</p>\n    <p>Burra wanted to experience the shock of strangeness, to embrace the allure of the louche, the forbidden, the disapproved of. He sometimes left home for months at a time without even saying goodbye. Where has Edward gone? Nobody knew. Will he ever come back? Perhaps.</p>\n    <p>First it was to Paris, and then to Spain, the United States, and Mexico. As you walk around his carefully curated, chronologically organized <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/edward-burra\">exhibition</a> at Tate Britain of the best of a lifetime’s work, you can hear the drift of music in the air, the music Edward loved, the visceral excitement of jazz and how that excitement fed into the work of the Harlem years. You can even see a row of black vinyl discs along the wall. These were Edward’s records. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3754-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Edward Burra</i>at Tate Britain, London (photo Michael Glover/</p>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>It is riddling, foot-stomping, 1920s stuff, with all its wildness. You may feel an urge to put your arm around someone nearby and swerve them out onto the dance floor. There’s plenty of space in these galleries to make your mark.</p>\n    <p>Burra’s paintings, like him, are motoring away, at speed, from convention or respectability. Most are crowded with figures — you can almost smell the sweet sweat. You can almost feel the heady excitement of all those twists and turns and crazy swerves, the pushes and the pulls.</p>\n    <p>The figures’ limbs are often inclined to bend pneumatically, as if they might be nothing but inflatables. Fingers get stretched and rubberized. Features get squeezed into inhuman, mask-like shapes. Their faces are so clarted with makeup that it’s hard to tell where the fantasy of all this posing and posturing begins or ends.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Burra3-1200x1666.jpg?resize=1200%2C1666&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>These beings, afloat on the fantasies of the Englishman wielding the brush, thrive in sexy, late-night environments where booze often topples from the trays on which it is transported. Who lives inside all these dangerously pouty cravings? This is erotic provocation on speed, surrealism lightly peppered with satire, and Burra records it all, relishing the particularity of his people and scenes. (It is he, of course, who has twisted things so out of shape.) Take a good, hard look at the weird grimaces of “The Two Sisters” (1929) or the parodic mistrust on display in “Balcony Toulon” (1929). In New York, he falls instantly for the appeal of Harlem’s nightlife — such gorgeous clinches to be savored in “Savoy Ballroom, Harlem” (1934)!</p>\n    <p>Then, once in Spain, amid the death and the turmoil and confusion of the Spanish Civil War, the mood and the palette darken, and the human figure begins to incline toward the anonymous and mechanized. War looms over these paintings. We stare into open graves to admire the skeletons.</p>\n    <p>At the end he returns to England and tries to work up some response to the puff-smoke of industry and the grit of working-class street life. Rude boys kick out in unison, like stiff performers on a stage. These paintings don’t quite convince — the old energy has left him. Burra can no longer dig deep enough.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/4.-Edward-Burra-Dancing-Skeletons-1934.-Tate-Purchased-1939-1200x1671.jpg?resize=1200%2C1671&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/13.-Edward-Burra-Simply-Heavenly-Scene-in-Harlem-1957.-Private-Collection-1200x812.jpg?resize=1200%2C812&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/11.-Edward-Burra-Balcony-Toulon-1929.-Private-collection-1200x1551.jpg?resize=1200%2C1551&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/12.-Edward-Burra-John-Deth-Hommage-to-Conrad-Aiken-1931-Whitworth-Art-Gallery-1200x862.jpg?resize=1200%2C862&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/10.-Edward-Burra-Valley-and-River-Northumberland-1972-1200x1799.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1799&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/6.-Edward-Burra-Minuit-Chanson-1931-Private-Collection-1200x901.jpg?resize=1200%2C901&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/15.-Edward-Burra-The-Watcher-1937-Scottish-National-Gallery-of-Modern-Art-1200x1821.jpg?resize=1200%2C1821&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/edward-burra\">Edward Burra</a> <i>continues at Tate Britain (Millbank, London, England) through October 19.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>When it comes to the <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/04/home-organization-systems-april-2023-theme/\">organization systems in my home</a>, no room is more dialed in than my kitchen. This is especially important to me since I love cooking in this space and do it nearly every single day. Over time, I’ve developed a kitchen organization system that isn’t necessarily pretty but that works really well for me.</p>\n    <p>Every single ingredient and piece of cookware in our kitchen has a dedicated place. This includes small appliances, pots and pans, lids, food storage containers, and more. I don’t focus on perfection or making sure every single cabinet and drawer is perfectly organized—I simply make sure everything fits and goes back to its spot once I’m done using it. Things do get a bit unorganized after a couple of months (partially because I’m not the only one using this space), but it takes less than half an hour to fix. In my mind, that means this is a winning organization solution for our family.</p>\n    <p>This rule is most noticeable in our kitchen’s large pantry cabinet. Here, <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/10/pantry-organization-tips/\">I organize every ingredient</a> we have by how I cook. Similar items stay together, such as beans and rice, noodles, cooking oils, and baking ingredients. I also store almost everything in clear containers that allow me to easily see what we have on hand (and know when it’s time to refill ingredients). <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3QCiuoa\">These containers</a> are my favorite! I like to cook through most of what we have in the pantry before restocking, which means every month or two I wipe down the containers, refill them, and clean out whatever has expired. </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Find more details on all of my favorite organization products  in this post.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>We have a baseline level of cleanliness we try to maintain in the kitchen. Even when life is chaotic, it’s very easy to get our kitchen back to a clean and organized state at the end of each day. These are the non-negotiable tasks we do every night (or most nights):</p>\n    <p>We don’t have a perfect track record of completing all of these things every single night—and that’s okay. But I know from experience that if we get at least two or three of them done, it makes a huge difference the next morning when we’re getting out the door for school dropoff.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/04/home-organization-products/\">15 Useful Home Organization Products I Love, Starting at $8</a>\n      <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/03/fridge-organization-system/\">My Fridge Organization System and How It Helps Me Cook Off the Cuff</a>\n      <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/04/best-books-on-organization/\">3 Books That Help Me Better Organize My Home, Time, and Life</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

    "body": "<p>I spent last week in Prince Edward Island with family, and this wasn’t the kind of trip I could have planned on my own. Prince Edward Island has a way of looking simple on the surface (think red roads, green fields, lighthouses), but without insider knowledge, it takes some help to know how to move through it. And for that, I owe a big thank you to my sister (and many of you).<br/>She handled most of the research—digging through maps, blogs, and follower DMs to build out a route that balanced exploration and ease. We traveled with my daughter, tried to avoid overscheduling, and somehow ended up with a weeklong Prince Edward Island itinerary that felt… effortless. I owe that all to my sister!<br/>We stayed in a mix of spots across the island. Charlottetown, Cavendish, and back again, which gave us access to beaches, national parks, and towns without spending hours in the car. Lodging in PEI can be tricky during peak season, but we booked in April/May and stayed flexible. We looked into everything from old inns to seaside cottages to slightly chaotic multi-bedroom Airbnbs.</p>\n<p>I’m sharing what we did, what we loved, and what we’d recommend if you’re planning your own quiet, snack-filled, slow-moving week on the island. You can also reference <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/sYWkvA9AEUbSJYah6\">this map</a> to find the locations and addresses.</p>\n<p><strong>Lodging: </strong><a href=\"https://www.roddvacations.com/hotels/rodd-charlottetown/\">Rodd Charlottetown</a><strong>Location: </strong>Charlottetown<strong>Vibe: </strong>Historic hotel downtown, convenient for walking and adjusting to the slower pace.<br/>We flew in and met up with my sister, who arrived the day before! We stayed downtown for one night to get our bearings and reset before heading toward the coast. This gave us a chance to explore Charlottetown without needing a rental car right away. We did a short walking loop through the city (into some bookstores, of course)—just enough to stretch after travel and see what Charlottetown feels like: a bit coastal, a bit quiet, very charming, and very into lobster.<br/>We tried <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/5YuYyZ8DVoip7wBdA\">The Chip Shack</a> lobster roll, which wasn’t worth writing home about, to be honest. Then we found a table at <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/4P4T7iz9VKkHwLTZ8\">Peakes Quay</a> that had a good kids’ menu, and Bennett ate two plates of chicken strips while we played Sleeping Queens. The area was really fun and full of people on vacation. We stood in a long line to get ice cream at <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/GuABpynAfohPsMox6\">COWS</a> (which was worth it and soon became a nightly ritual for the entirety of the trip). </p>\n<p><strong>Lodging:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vrbo.com/en-ca/cottage-rental/p9951218\">Red Island Getaway VRBO</a><i> </i><strong>Locations: </strong>Charlottetown, Avonlea Village, and Cavendish<strong>Drive Time:</strong> ~45 minutes from Charlottetown to Cavendish<strong>Vibe:</strong> A day of puttering, small finds, and rain that felt kind of cinematic.<br/>We started the day with breakfast at <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/A6VyUrv7Mzn7vXJv8\">The Cork and Cast</a> on Victoria Row, where I had my first of many delicious Caesars (Canada’s version of a Bloody Mary but with a salty, briny twist). Get the breakfast sandwich and the fish cakes.<br/>Then we wandered. The city had a little craft fair set up, so we walked through that, hit a couple of used bookstores, and found one of our favorite trip souvenirs: a hand-carved rabbit driving a carrot-shaped car, handmade by a local brand called Woodypix. My sister got a cat driving a rainbow trout. We were extremely into it. I bought a fish bracelet that I am very into at <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/V8UBqbN6R5y19DU27\">Mrs Peakes Fancy Goods</a>, which was my favorite gift shop in that area. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/08/prince-edward-island-itinerary/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>I’ve long been a lover of thrifting and antiquing—for home decor, furniture, clothing, kids’ toys, and more. While the process may take a little longer, I think it’s well worth the extra time and energy. There are so many high-quality, unique pieces <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2020/12/how-to-seek-out-unique-secondhand-pieces-online/\">to be found secondhand</a>.</p>\n    <p>Over time, I’ve developed a go-to process that helps me navigate the world of thrifting and antiquing with more ease and intention.</p>\n    <p>It’s so helpful to have a list written down before you step foot in a thrift or antique store. This will help you stay focused on the things that will actually add value to your life, and not get distracted by things that will only become extra clutter. In my most recent thrifting trip, I was specifically searching for a new pair of jeans and a white button-up shirt, which helped me hone in my search in the store. I consider a Pinterest board a “list” as well, so if you’re a visual person, that might work for you too.</p>\n    <p>Take a quick lap around the sections where you’re most likely to find what’s on your list. Add things to your cart that catch your attention. Then go back to certain aisles where you think you might find something really specific and want to dig a little deeper. Take a little more time on this second look, because sometimes you might miss things on the first lap.</p>\n    <p>Once you’ve made your way through the store, edit down your cart and return anything to the shelves that you don’t truly need/want. Ask yourself a couple of questions and get specific in your answers.</p>\n    <p>I’ve come across so many great things while thrifting and antiquing, but many of them were items I didn’t actually need at the moment. While the lower price points at many of these stores may be tempting, the reality is that if you don’t edit down what goes in your cart, you’ll probably end up with some things you don’t actually use.</p>\n    <p>The more regularly you go thrifting or antiquing, the better you’ll become at navigating each store and narrowing in on the pieces you really want to bring home. I often like to go to a few stores in one afternoon to make the most of my time. On other occasions, I only have fifteen minutes to spare, so I’ll bop through a store and quickly browse one specific section. Either way, consistency is important when it comes to thrift and antique shopping.</p>\n    <p>Sometimes when I go to a thrift or antique store, I don’t find anything to bring home. That’s okay. You’ll find the items on your list when you find them—you can’t rush the process. Thrifting and antiquing are about the hunt. For me, it’s about finding unique pieces that will bring personality and character to my home or wardrobe. And when I find something I love, it’s well worth the time and effort that may have gone into the search.</p>\n    <p>If you’re going to a thrift store that accepts donations, make the most of your trip and bring something (or a couple of things) to donate when you go.</p>\n    <p>Last but certainly not least: If you can help it, never go thrifting or antiquing on an empty stomach (or thirsty, for that matter). Sifting through aisles and aisles of goods requires energy, and it will be a much more enjoyable experience if you’re satiated beforehand.

I am delighted that my kids love to read too, so we sometimes all sit down and read together at home. It’s become one of those rituals that grounds us. Not without effort, but we’re all more settled into ourselves after we do.<br/>I find a lot of my reading inspiration from people I follow on Instagram, like my sister <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alliearends/\">@alliearends</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/elementstyle/\">@elementstyle</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/brittanychaffee/\">@brittanychaffee</a>. Other recs come from Substacks by great writers (like <a href=\"https://eliseloehnen.substack.com/\">Pulling the Thread</a> by Elise Loehnen) and writers who teach writing (highly recommend <a href=\"https://joshcook.substack.com/\">book(ish)</a> by the brilliant Josh Cook). I look for books that help me see something differently—especially the ones that are quiet, a little strange, or written so beautifully it makes you want to reread a sentence three times.<strong>Today I’m sharing a handful of meaningful reads (around 200 pages or less) that leave you with the quiet sense of,  Oh, this is what life is about. </strong>They’re lovely books to read this summer, or any time of year, for that matter.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>A lyrical meditation on the color blue, grief, desire, and memory.<strong>Why I Love It: </strong>It’s a book you don’t read so much as absorb. Her fragments feel like pieces of a mosaic that, together, make something bigger than the sum of their parts. I return to it when I feel too much or not enough. She says what I am sometimes too afraid to admit to myself.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>Thirty-nine women are imprisoned underground with no explanation. One girl, the youngest of them all, begins to question what else might be possible.<strong>Why I Love It:</strong> It’s eerie and haunting and profound. It made me question everything I thought I knew about identity, freedom, and what it means to be human. I read it twice in one week.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>Set in 1980s Ireland, a coal merchant discovers unsettling truths about a local convent and must decide what kind of man he wants to be.<strong>Why I Love It: </strong>It’s short, sparse, and deeply moving. The kind of book that leaves you with a lump in your throat and a new understanding of quiet courage.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>A raw and intimate diary chronicling the author’s obsessive affair with a younger man.<strong>Why I Love It:</strong> Ernaux doesn’t flinch. The diary is unedited and beautifully written. A portrait of her late 40s, unraveling and itching to self-detonate without apology. She shows you the hunger, the madness, the waiting—and somehow makes it all feel universal.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>A woman refuses to get out of the swimming pool, and in the process, all of the secrets hidden beneath her marriage come out.<strong>Why I Love It: </strong>It’s surreal and sharp, with a thread of humor running through the tension. Reads like a short film. Totally unexpected and totally brilliant.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>A shepherd boy sets out on a journey to find treasure and discovers his personal legend along the way.<strong>Why I Love It:</strong> It’s simple but powerful. A reminder that the answers are often within us—and that the detours are part of the path.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>A dreamlike collection of stories set in a mythical version of the author’s hometown, filled with surreal imagery and poetic prose.<strong>Why I Love It: </strong>Schulz writes like no one else. His stories feel like memories from another life—strange, rich, and a little bit enchanted.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

    "body": "<p>I’ve been thinking about how Joe and I, at our core, share a really deep friendship. Admiration, delight, shorthand jokes, the shebang. But it’s changed over time, as marriages and friendships do. Our kids—whom we love more than words can encapsulate—have become a wedge in some ways. It’s like… we’re co-leads on this high-stakes group project, and we both really don’t want to screw it up. (Spoken as someone with a combined fourteen years of <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2020/10/what-ive-learned-in-10-years-of-therapy/\">therapy</a> under her belt.)<br/>Pressure and structure aren’t ideal conditions for friendship. In this kind of scenario, the sense of lightness, the seeing and being seen, can quietly shrink. We’re in a different phase, one built on resilience, communication, and clarity. But it leaves an opening for closeness that can feel like loss. <strong>We don’t talk about adult friendships like we talk about romantic relationships, but we should. </strong><br/>Because adult friendships can be just as formative and necessary. In many ways, they offer a kind of freedom our romantic or work partnerships can’t. Our friends are not usually directly affected by our decisions, so they can tell us the truth. And if we’re lucky, they delight in us for who we are, not for what we do.</p>\n<p>Lately, I’ve been reaching outside of my marriage for the kinds of friendships that fill in the gaps. I’ve encouraged Joe to do the same. Not in a dramatic or betraying way. We’re just reaching for a connection that nourishes what this busy season of life seems to starve: joy. Spontaneous conversation. Shared curiosity. The kind of love that says, I care about you with no strings attached.<br/>That last part is important.<strong>“No strings attached” means:</strong></p>\n<p>And let’s be honest: A lot of us are so caught up in our own unresolved shit that we’re not even available to be the friend we want.<br/>Friendship, real friendship, is a mirror. But not the shiny kind you hang on the wall. It’s the kind that reflects you back to yourself with love, holding your contradictions without flinching; that reminds you who you are when you forget.<br/>You don’t have to do a lot to keep a friendship alive. You just have to delight in the other person. That’s the key. That’s what we all want. Someone who says, “I see you, and it brings me joy.”<br/>And we can’t just want that—we have to offer it. It doesn’t take big sweeping acts of commitment or even lavish “catch-up” lunches. It takes showing up IN life, rather than sitting on the periphery.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>You don’t have to do a lot to keep a friendship alive. You just have to delight in the other person. That’s the key. That’s what we all want. Someone who says, “I see you, and it brings me joy.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>Cultivating friendships in adulthood doesn’t come naturally to me. It’s something I’ve had to learn slowly, sometimes awkwardly, because it’s also something I’ve deeply longed for. For a lot of my life, I didn’t feel like I had it. Not in the way I craved: mutual, safe, delight-filled. I always felt like I needed to sing and dance my way to connection and safety. <br/>So now, I try to be intentional. I mess up and don’t show up sometimes. But I keep trying. I keep trying to be the friend I want in life. These are a few ways I keep connections alive with friends:</p>\n<p>Sometimes? Friendships change and people drift. Misunderstandings happen. Sometimes things are broken beyond repair. I used to see that as failure. Now I see it as part of being human. When it feels right, I try to repair—reach out, name the hurt, stay open. And when it doesn’t? I let go with love and wish them the best. <strong>Not every friendship lasts forever, but each one teaches you something about who you are and how you love.</strong><br/>You don’t need a big group, perfectly coordinated schedules, or elaborate plans. You just need a few people who make you feel good in your body. Safe in your nervous system. Seen and accepted for who you are.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/06/adult-friendships/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Instead of asking <i>Is this flattering?</i> or <i>Does this go together?</i>, I’ve been asking <i>Do I like how this feels? Do I like how this looks? </i>I’m reaching for baggy pants, oversized button-downs, sneakers, and maxi dresses—clothes I used to avoid because they weren’t “feminine” or “put-together” enough. Now they’re exactly what I want.</p>\n    <p>I wore this on one of those in-between days where it’s hot in the sun but cool in the breeze. This sweater tee reminds me of something I wore on repeat in college. The hat and sunglasses are louder than I usually go, but I love how they shift the whole mood to <i>do not disturb; probably reading.</i></p>\n    <p>This outfit came together in five seconds and felt easy, but totally different in the best way. I threw the button-down over the dress because I saw “the kids” doing it at the last concert I attended. Now I want to wear this combo every day. It’s simple and unfussy.</p>\n    <p>I love this dress because it’s soft and swingy but structured enough to feel up for taking it out to a party. The flip flops make it casual, and the basket bag makes it feel like I could end up at a market in the South of France… or Target. Which is my reality, but I keep dreaming anyway.</p>\n    <p>This is what I wear when I want to feel cool but also like I’m in pajamas. I threw this on after a swim, added some layered necklaces, and suddenly it looked intentional.</p>\n    <p>This outfit just made me happy. I started with the pants (bows!), which felt like an outfit in their own right, and kept the top breezy and the accessories summery.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

    "body": "<p>I used to think training for a marathon was all about control. You hit your miles, you nail your splits, you stack perfect weeks on top of each other until race day finally arrives. A simple equation: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-wake-up-early/\">discipline in</a>, results out. But life has a way of rewriting the plan, and a few months into training for this race, my dad got sick.</p>\n<p>My dad is quiet but determined, someone who has always measured his life in motion. Mountain biking along the rugged trails near his home in Vermont. Playing hockey three nights a week well into his late 60s. Hiking the Long Trail’s 272 miles from Massachusetts to Canada. Moving his body has always been his way of making himself known to others. So it feels like a particular kind of loss that cancer has taken that away.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Featured image from  our interview with Sanne Vloet by Michelle Nash.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>This summer, the one that’s seen him moving through rounds of radiation and chemo, has been heavy with guilt. A constant tug-of-war. When I’m training, I feel like I should be with him. When I’m with him, I feel like I should be training. I’m trapped in this exhausting narrative of <i>shoulds</i>—never fully where I am, never enough of anything. And sometimes, if I’m honest, I feel selfish. Chasing a finish time, a personal best, when his body is fighting for something far more essential.</p>\n<p>Every missed run felt like a strike against me, each skipped workout a reminder that the neat, color-coded plan I’d taped to my fridge was unraveling. I told myself I’d lost my shot at a 3:30 marathon. But somewhere between the late nights at my dad’s house and the early mornings I ran anyway, something shifted. I started to see my training for the Chicago marathon less as a performance and more as a practice—a small act of steadiness I could return to, even when everything else was falling apart. The miles became less about proving myself and more about carrying myself through.</p>\n<h2>Letting Go of Perfect</h2>\n<p>When I first typed my marathon training plan in the Notes app of my phone, I believed in it like scripture. 16 weeks in neat little boxes, promising that if I showed up, I’d get what I wanted: 3 hours and 30 minutes. I loved the clarity. So much of life resists control, but here was something that said: if you just do A, you’ll get to B.</p>\n<p>In the first weeks, I lived inside that plan. Early mornings, long runs that stretched into weekends, little victories when I nailed my paces. I felt like someone who could follow through, who could be counted on. Maybe the rest of my life could feel like that too—organized, predictable, clean.</p>\n<p>Spoiler: nope. The body doesn’t always respond the way you want it to. Neither does life. I missed runs when my dad’s health needed me elsewhere, and when I came back, the training plan no longer looked like a map—it looked like a ledger of failure. I could feel the time slipping, that 3:30 finish pulling further out of reach.</p>\n<p>But even in those messy, uneven weeks, I kept running. Not perfectly, and not according to plan. Just forward.</p>\n<h2>The Quiet Lessons Between the Miles</h2>\n<p>Some runs were little more than a shuffle. After nights in the hospital, my legs felt like lead, my chest tight with worry. Even then, there was relief in the rhythm. The stale hospital air would still cling to me, but the first gulp of fresh air outside felt like oxygen for both of us. I often thought my dad would give anything to trade places—out of the fluorescent rooms, into the cool morning, breathing alongside me.</p>\n<p>Other mornings, the road surprised me with grace. The air cool before dawn, the sky breaking open in pink. Runs like that felt like gifts. My chest loosened, my thoughts slowed. For a little while, I could just breathe.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/marathon-training/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>We may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article.</p>\n<p>I have lived in rented homes all of my adult life. In my early 20s, I didn’t think it was worth the effort to personalize a rental. (This was a temporary space, so why bother?) Over time, however, I realized I didn’t feel relaxed or at ease in my home. The beige walls, overhead lighting and thrown-together <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/furniture-for-small-spaces/\">furniture</a> and decor I had left me feeling unsettled. Learning how to turn my rented apartment into a home was the beginning of my love affair with interior design.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Featured image from  our interview with Radhi Devlukia Shetty by Michelle Nash.</i>\n    </p>\n<h2>10 Interior Design Tips for Renters</h2>\n<p>Through trial and error, I’ve discovered that living in a rental doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice style or a personalized space just because you don’t own your home. There is so much you can do—from <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-2024-paint-color-trends/\">paint</a> and wallpaper to upgrading fixtures and lighting. Ahead, I’ve rounded up the best interior design tips for renters from my personal experience in turning beige boxes into warm and stylish homes. </p>\n<h2>Paint</h2>\n<p>Rental walls usually come in a safe, neutral beige which may appear… well, a bit boring. The best interior design tip for renters I can give is to love up on your walls. Give them a makeover by adding a bit of color or by choosing a neutral that suits you better. Even taking your walls from a beige to a crisp white will brighten up your space significantly. Most landlords have no problem with paint as long as you’re willing to paint the walls back to the original color once you move out, or they may even let you keep it.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite things to paint is the interior of my front door. My current landlord, as well as my previous one, said I can leave it as is when it’s time to move out. I love pink, so my front door is Sherwin-Williams Coral Perfection. It’s a delightful pop of color that makes me smile every time I look at it. Plus, it makes our entryway is cheery and inviting. The whole project was less than $20—proving that paint is an affordable way to make a big impact in your space.</p>\n<h2>Peel-and-Stick Products</h2>\n<p>A round-up of interior design tips for renters wouldn’t be complete without giving peel-and-stick a major shout-out. Peel-and-stick is incredible for renters, since they’re temporary solutions for bigger projects that would normally require renovation. Here are a few of my favorites.</p>\n<h3>Peel-and-stick wallpaper</h3>\n<p>If painting is a no-go, peel-and-stick wallpaper is an excellent option for zhuzhing up your walls. I am a huge fan of adding peel-and-stick wallpaper anywhere your heart desires. Create a statement wall in your <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/cozy-living-room-ideas/\">living room</a> or make your powder room pop with a bold color or pattern. I’ve added peel-and-stick wallpaper to my kitchen, my laundry room, and most recently in my home office.</p>\n<p>Wallpaper has completely transformed these spaces, and I couldn’t be more pleased with how they’ve turned out. Plus, removal is a breeze—I’ve had no wall damage when I’ve removed peel and stick wallpaper. There are tons of installation YouTube videos you can watch, but I will say from personal experience that it’s not <i>quite</i> as easy as it looks. Don’t be afraid to hire a TaskRabbit or wallpaper pro to get the job done!</p>\n<h3>Peel-and-stick floor tile</h3>\n<p>Renter floors can range anywhere from vinyl to tile to even hardwood. Peel-and-stick floor tile now makes it possible for renters to update their floors in a temporary and affordable way. I’ve never tried them myself, but peel-and-stick floor tiles look fantastic in a kitchen or powder room. They can make an outdated floor feel current without costing a ton as well.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/interior-design-tips-for-renters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Unlike my social feeds that seem to be favoring <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/fall-2025-fashion-trends/\">all things fall</a>, I’m still firmly planted in summer. Perhaps it’s all the extra time I’ve spent in Austin these last few weeks where the air is still humid and the sun is shining extra bright, but the last thing I’m thinking about is pumpkins. Instead, I’m fully embracing sweet summer watermelon and juicy tomatoes while drinking crisp iced bevies on the patio. The markets are still brimming with <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/late-summer-recipes/\">summer produce</a>, and I’m determined to enjoy it all while it lasts.</p>\n<p>Two ingredients that I’ve neglected this summer are the humble squash and zucchini. Both staples of summer, I feel like they often get relegated to roasted or grilling as a side to whatever the main course is, but I often forget that they can be eaten fresh as well. The flavor leans somewhere between fresh with a slight bite that I think is the perfect ode to the warmer months. And because they are the perfect blank canvas, they make for a delicious pairing to other summer flavors that I absolutely love. This zucchini ribbon salad is how I’m embracing the last few weeks of summer. Ahead, discover why you should be making it too.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Squash Ribbon Salad&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/food/zucchini-ribbon-salad/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Squash-Ribbon-Salad-865x1271.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Ingredients for Zucchini Ribbon Salad</h2>\n<p><strong>Zucchini.</strong> The star of the show—its mild flavor and tender bite make the perfect base for those pretty, delicate ribbons.</p>\n<p><strong>Squash. </strong>Slightly sweeter than zucchini, it brings balance and color contrast to the salad.</p>\n<p><strong>Cucumber. </strong>Adds a clean, refreshing crunch that keeps every bite feeling light and hydrating.</p>\n<p><strong>Avocado. </strong>Creamy and rich, it gives the salad substance while balancing out all the fresh, crisp textures.</p>\n<p><strong>Goat Cheese. </strong>Tangy and luscious, it melts into the ribbons for just the right hit of indulgence.</p>\n<p><strong>Almonds.</strong> Their toasty crunch adds depth and keeps the salad from feeling too soft.</p>\n<p><strong>Pistachios.</strong> Sweet and nutty with that gorgeous green hue, they double down on both flavor and beauty.</p>\n<p><strong>Fresh Herbs.</strong> A handful of mint, basil, or parsley brightens the whole dish with a garden-fresh lift.</p>\n<p><strong>Olive Oil.</strong> The silky base of the dressing that ties everything together with richness.</p>\n<p><strong>Lemon Juice.</strong> Adds the zingy brightness that wakes up the flavors and keeps the salad vibrant.</p>\n<p><strong>Honey.</strong> Just a drizzle rounds things out with a subtle sweetness that complements the tang and crunch.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Squash Salad&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/food/zucchini-ribbon-salad/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Squash-Salad-865x1271.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>How to Prepare this Zucchini Ribbon Salad</h2>\n<p>If you’re skeptical about fresh zucchini and squash, that’s fine. I totally get it! But I’m also convinced I can make you a convert. There are a few things to keep in mind to make this salad delicious.</p>\n<p>First, use a vegetable peeler for extra-thin ribbons of both zucchini and squash. Not only does this help create those beautiful ribbons, but it also removes some of the thick, chewy texture that you would otherwise deal with if you were just cutting the squash into rounds. When sliced this way, the ribbons are thin with just the slightest crunch that makes it feel closer to a ribboned cucumber.</p>\n<p>If you still don’t want to eat the veggies raw, I would recommend VERY quickly blanching the ribbons in boiling water, then adding to an ice bath. You don’t want to make the ribbons soggy, so a quick dunk and shock will keep that fresh crispness while giving the squash and zucchini a quick cook.</p>\n<p>Balancing textures is what makes this zucchini ribbon salad shine. Creamy avocado and tangy goat cheese contrast the crisp ribbons, while cucumber adds a cool, refreshing bite. Toasted almonds and pistachios bring crunch, fresh herbs infuse brightness, and a lemon-honey dressing ties it all together with sweet, zesty balance.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Ribbon Squash Salad&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/food/zucchini-ribbon-salad/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Ribbon-Squash-Salad-865x1271.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>What to Eat with Zucchini Ribbon Salad</h2>\n<p>This is the perfect side dish to bring to your end-of-summer gatherings, and it pairs perfectly with your favorite dishes. Here’s what I’m serving up for the last few weeks of summer for a complete menu that celebrates the season.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/these-chicken-burger-lettuce-wraps-are-my-new-weeknight-go-to/\">Chicken Burgers</a> (in lettuce or on buns) or <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/grilled-chicken-thighs/\">Grilled Chicken Thighs</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/spring-pasta-salad/\">Bright and Zesty Pasta Salad</a> or this<a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/sun-dried-tomato-caprese-pasta-salad/\"> Caprese Pasta Salad</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/grilled-zucchini-recipe/\">Grilled Zucchini</a> (for the fresh and grilled version side by side) and <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/smashed-grilled-sweet-potatoes-with-chimichurri/\">Grilled Sweet Potatoes</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/easy-grilled-peaches-recipe/\">Grilled Peaches</a> with Ice Cream</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Summer Ribboned Squash Salad&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/food/zucchini-ribbon-salad/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Summer-Ribboned-Squash-Salad-865x1187.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Zucchini Ribbon Salad</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/zucchini-ribbon-salad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s fundamental to our vitality, and our quality of life <i>depends</i> on it. Gut health is a key player in everything from nutrient absorption and mood stability to <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-balance-hormones/\">hormone balance</a> and cognitive function. Without a healthy gut, a slew of chronic illnesses come knocking—<a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-stop-feeling-bloated/\">digestive disorders</a>, weakened immunity, and more. If you want to protect your longevity (and improve all areas of your well-being!), hone in on your gut health. It’s never mattered more than now.</p>\n<h2>Signs of a Healthy Gut</h2>\n<p>So, how can you tell if your gut is in good shape?</p>\n<h3>Regular (and comfortable) digestion</h3>\n<p>One of the most apparent signs of a healthy gut is rhythmic, pleasant digestion. What this means: you’re having <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-often-should-you-poop/\">bowel movements</a> at least once a day <i>without</i> straining or discomfort. Stools should be well-formed and easy to pass, typically resembling the shape and consistency of a smooth, soft log.</p>\n<h3>Minimal gastrointestinal symptoms</h3>\n<p>A healthy gut typically experiences minimal <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/grain-free-diet-gut-health/\">gastrointestinal symptoms</a>. This includes the absence of chronic issues—bloating, gas, abdominal pain, constipation, or diarrhea. Of course, occasional mild symptoms are normal, but frequent or severe discomfort may indicate an imbalance.</p>\n<h3>Good energy levels</h3>\n<p>As mentioned, the gut plays a crucial role in <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/foods-for-gut-health/\">nutrient absorption</a>. When it’s functioning well, your body efficiently absorbs the nutrients it needs, leading to sustained energy levels throughout the day. Chronic fatigue or low energy can sometimes be linked to poor gut health.</p>\n<h3>Strong immune system</h3>\n<p>A significant portion (as in, <a href=\"https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/want-to-boost-immunity-look-to-the-gut#:~:text=70%25%20of%20the%20immune%20system,where%20diverse%20bacteria%20is%20best.&amp;text=You%20likely%20know%20that%20what,energy%20level%20throughout%20the%20day.\">over 70%</a>!) of your immune system is located in the gut. If you rarely get sick and recover quickly when you do, it’s a sign that your gut microbiota is healthy—and for that matter, effectively supporting your immune defenses.</p>\n<h3>Healthy skin</h3>\n<p>Did you know a balanced gut microbiome can help reduce inflammation and improve skin conditions? Clear, healthy skin (without chronic issues like <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/acne-diet-plan/\">acne</a>, eczema, or rosacea) indicate a healthy gut.</p>\n<h3>Stable mood</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4367209/\">Current research</a> highlights the <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/stress-and-gut-health/\">gut-brain axis</a>—the connection between gut health and mental health. In essence, a healthy gut contributes to stable moods and better mental health. If you experience infrequent mood swings, anxiety, or depressive symptoms, it’s a sign that your gut microbiota is balanced.</p>\n<h3>Few food sensitivities</h3>\n<p>A thriving gut often has fewer food sensitivities and intolerances. If you can eat a wide variety of foods without experiencing adverse reactions, it suggests your gut is well-balanced and your digestive system is functioning properly.</p>\n<h2>Symptoms of an Unhealthy Gut</h2>\n<p>On the flip side, do you notice stomach pain after eating, often feel sluggish, and experience acne flare-ups after noshing on <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/low-glycemic-sugar-alternatives/\">sugar</a>? These are all signs of an impaired gut. Once you’re aware of these symptoms, you can take the first step toward better digestive health.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/gut-health/gut-health-habits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>All to often, working in the fashion industry means living in the future. While the world is still <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/hot-weather-outfits/\">sweating through summer</a>, my desk is already filled with knits, fall/winter moodboards, and fabric swatches in next-season tones. We plan collections six (or more) months ahead—doing our best to trend forecast and anticipate what you’ll want in your closet <i>right now</i>. While you were deciding between milk or dark in your Valentine’s Day box of chocolates, we were deciding between cool mocha or rich cocoa for this season’s knits. By the time September arrives, we’ve already lived and breathed the fall 2025 fashion trends for months—and are busy looking ahead to next spring.</p>\n<h2>7 Fall 2025 Fashion Trends to Prep Your Closet</h2>\n<p>Even though the season is just beginning to shift, the style direction has long been set in motion. Here’s what’s been top of mind in the industry—and what you’ll be seeing on shelves (and probably wearing) very soon.</p>\n<h3>Not-Your-Uniform Plaid</h3>\n<p>Fall 2025 fashion trends confirm: plaid is back—but not in the way you remember. This season’s checks and tartans are showing up in unexpected colors, fresh placements, and silhouettes that feel more upstate countryside than prep school hallway. We’ll be seeing oversized flannel shirts styled with clean-lined trousers, tailored plaid pants with slouchy knits, and outerwear that uses plaid as an accent instead of the whole story.</p>\n<h3>Clean-Slate Tailoring</h3>\n<p>Minimalism is having a moment, but with a sharper edge. Think clean-lined sets, strong shoulders, and silhouettes that feel refined but not extra. I’ve noticed brands leaning into elevated basics with just enough structure to make a statement, while still staying polished and pared-back. It’s a quiet confidence brand of appeal—the kind that doesn’t beg for attention but always stands out.</p>\n<p>SIMONMILLER</p>\n<p>EAVES</p>\n<p>Good American</p>\n<h3>Shearling, Everywhere</h3>\n<p>Shearling is stepping into the fall 2025 fashion trends spotlight this season: cropped jackets, oversized collars, lined boots, even handbags. It’s cozy by nature, but this fall’s versions feel more refined than rugged. I’ve seen it styled with clean tailoring and tonal palettes, making the texture stand out without overwhelming the look. Whether real or faux, it’s the kind of detail that makes an outfit feel thoughtful and layered, adding just enough softness to balance fall’s sharper silhouettes.</p>\n<p>Steve Madden</p>\n<p>Velvet by Graham &amp; Spencer</p>\n<p>JW PEI</p>\n<h3>Slip-On Mules</h3>\n<p>Somewhere between a ballet flat and a house shoe, slip-on mules are this season’s answer to effortless dressing. They’re low-maintenance, comfortable from the first wear (no heel=no blisters), and somehow strike the balance between polished and relaxed.

Whether in crisp cotton or soft knit, these shirts offer bold stripes and classic collars that make layering effortless and fresh.

Try stacking two at once for a layered look, or switch things up with a non-leather option to keep it fresh and unexpected.

    "body": "<p>We have most of what we think about creativity wrong. So often, we treat it like something to optimize, monetize, or turn into proof of productivity. We rush to measure the end result instead of noticing what the practice itself gives us.<br/>But the real magic of creativity is quieter than that. It’s in the sketch you never show anyone, the scraps of sentences in your notes app, the watercolor that looks nothing like the photo you were copying. There’s such psychological importance to making things for no reason at all. It’s nonperformative creative work—the kind no one else has to see—that builds a life you actually want to live.<br/>Lately, I’ve been writing pieces that don’t leave my hard drive. They exist only for me, and that has been strangely transformative. Making for the sake of making changes how I see the world, how I see myself, and even how I approach the creative work I share publicly.<br/>If you’re craving a spark for your own practice, these four books have been foundational in reminding me why creativity matters and how to return to it with less pressure and more play.</p>\n<p>This book is both memoir and manual, guiding readers through the process of transforming pain into meaning. Jaouad writes about illness and survival, but more importantly, she writes about what it means to create while living inside uncertainty. Her essays and prompts remind me that creativity is less about self-expression and more about self-connection—a way to turn what’s heavy into something that holds light.</p>\n<p>This is the book every writer I know has underlined to death, and for good reason. Lamott’s advice is practical—write a “shitty first draft,” take things one step at a time—but what really sticks is her humor and humanity. She makes the act of writing feel possible, even when you’re staring down a blank page. For me, it’s a reminder that showing up, imperfectly, is the only path forward. I keep it on my desk because simply looking at the cover reminds me to just get something on the page.</p>\n<p>Part memoir, part art, this book is about writing while not writing about writing. It is immersive and sometimes strange, but ultimately really beautiful. Shapton reminds me that my creative practice doesn’t have to fit a mold. It can spill across mediums and categories, and still be deeply resonant. It made me think about my work in a different way, that I didn’t need to make it make sense for it to be worth creating. I feel more permission to experiment in my own work, to let process matter more than product. It is currently difficult to find, thanks to its recent uptick in popularity, but it’s worth waiting for your reissued copy to arrive.</p>\n<p>Rubin strips creativity back to its essence. His reflections are less about “how to make something” and more about “how to notice what’s already here.” This perspective has helped me see clearly again and again. It’s a meditation on coming back to doing, not critiquing. This book is like a gentle but firm hand on the shoulder, reminding you that creativity is not a scarce resource. It’s always available if you’re willing to pay attention. For me, it’s a grounding practice: Return to awareness, and the work will follow. There is an endless well within. I keep it in my nightstand.</p>\n<p>Each of these books reminds me that creativity doesn’t need an audience to matter. In fact, the most meaningful work often happens offstage. It can be scribbles in a notebook, a sketch that no one sees, a story you write just to find out how it ends. That kind of making isn’t about impressing or proving anything. It’s about remembering that you’re a person who creates, and letting that practice feed you in ways the outside world never could.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

    "body": "<p>When you hear the stats on the new AVA Resort Cancun, a certain kind of skepticism is natural. With over 1,600 rooms, it is, by any definition, a truly massive property. For seasoned travelers, “massive” can often be a code word for long lines, impersonal service, and that dreaded “burn and churn” mentality where you feel more like a number than a guest.</p>\n<p>We at<a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/\"> Travel Off Path</a> have visited our fair share of mega-resorts, so we went to check out the property with a healthy dose of skepticism, fully expecting to experience some of these big-resort growing pains.</p>\n<p><strong>We were wrong.</strong> In fact, we were completely surprised.</p>\n<p>The AVA Resort Cancun is that rare unicorn in the world of hospitality: a mega-resort with the intimate soul and vibrant heartbeat of a boutique hotel. Its ability to deliver on both epic scale and personalized service is nothing short of remarkable, and it has immediately established itself as a top-tier contender in the luxury all-inclusive space.</p>\n<p>The true genius of the AVA and the secret to its unique vibe can be found on its main level. Everything—and we mean <i>everything</i>—is located on one magnificent, air-conditioned indoor promenade that stretches for over half a mile along the entire length of the resort.</p>\n<p>This brilliant design choice solves the single biggest problem that plagues other giant resorts: navigation. Gone are the days of deciphering confusing maps, getting lost on winding outdoor paths, or waiting ten minutes for a golf cart just to get to dinner. At AVA, every restaurant, bar, shop, and activity entrance is right there on the promenade. It’s the central nervous system of the resort, making it unbelievably easy to get your bearings.</p>\n<p>But it’s more than just convenient. This layout creates an incredible, dynamic energy. In the evening, the promenade comes alive. You can stroll from a high-end cocktail bar to a chic boutique, grab a scoop of authentic gelato, listen to the music spilling out of a restaurant, and window-shop, all in climate-controlled bliss. It feels like the vibrant Royal Promenade of a luxury cruise ship, but on a much grander and more luxurious scale. It encourages exploration and allows you to bar-hop and people-watch, creating a sense of community and excitement that is simply missing from other resorts where amenities are scattered across acres of land.</p>\n<p>While the AVA is conveniently located just 10 minutes from the airport, it is not in the bustling Hotel Zone. The trade-off for this relative isolation? An absolutely staggering array of on-site activities that makes it almost impossible to get bored. You could genuinely spend a full week here and not experience everything the resort has to offer. The list is almost overwhelming:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>For the thrill-seeker:</strong>A full-scale laser tag arena, a state-of-the-art arcade with racing simulators, and even a multi-room escape room experience.</li><li><strong>For the family (or kids at heart):</strong>A sleek, modern bowling alley that feels more like a private lounge.</li><li><strong>For the evening:</strong>A stunning, professional-grade theater hosting nightly shows and entertainment.</li><li><strong>For practical needs:</strong>A collection of chic shops, a “tienda” for sundries and snacks, and a well-stocked pharmacy.</li></ul>\n<p>This is all before you even step outside.</p>\n<p>The outdoor space at AVA is just as impressive as the interior. A series of absolutely giant pools stretches across the entire oceanfront length of the property, meaning you are never far from a place to cool off. And for anyone who has experienced the dreaded 6 AM “towel game” at other resorts, you can breathe a sigh of relief. There are literally thousands of comfortable lounge chairs available at all hours of the day. Finding a great spot is never a problem.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/ava-resort-cancun-review-this-massive-new-resort-actually-has-a-heartbeat-vibe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>In 2019, Hugo Crosthwaite became the first Latino artist to win the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery’s (NPG) prestigious triennial Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition. The Tijuana-born and San Diego-based illustrator received the contest’s grand prize: $25,000 and a portrait commission for the museum’s permanent collection. He chose to depict Anthony Fauci, then the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), in a stop-motion format that captures the nuances of his complicated legacy, including his <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/how-dr-fauci-handled-aids-crisis-jexipk/26361/\">criticized and then celebrated</a> oversight of the HIV/AIDs epidemic.</p>\n    <p>Last week, Crosthwaite found his hard-won commission on a list of Smithsonian items that the White House found objectionable. He was one of at least three Mexican-born artists whose work was included on <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036180/trump-targets-lgbtq-history-migrants-and-more-in-chilling-smithsonian-hit-list/\">Trump’s art hit list</a>, along with illustrator <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036180/trump-targets-lgbtq-history-migrants-and-more-in-chilling-smithsonian-hit-list/\">Rigoberto González</a> and painter <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037811/smithsonian-latino-gallery-quietly-closes-for-nine-months/\">Felipe Galindo Gómez</a>.</p>\n    <p>“My first reaction was surprise,” Crosthwaite shared in an interview with <i>Hyperallergic. </i>“But then later on, [I] felt a bit of pride to be included in this list of other wonderful artists and wonderful projects that talk about the diversity of the United States’ history.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Hugo-Foto-1-1200x1485.jpg?resize=1200%2C1485&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>In 2022, after winning the Outwin competition, Crosthwaite and the NPG considered a list of individuals for a portrait. They agreed on Fauci as the commission’s subject. At the time, the infectious disease specialist was a polarized figure: a revered pandemic hero and a detested political opponent of the right.</p>\n    <p>“I jumped at the chance of doing this because it was 2022, we were in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Crosthwaite told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “He became a symbol of this fight between science and truth, against conspiracy theories; Dr. Fauci kind of epitomizes the nation’s current political divide.”</p>\n    <p>The five-minute stop motion animation, “A Portrait of Dr. Anthony Fauci” (2022), begins by portraying him as a young scientist in a lab. Later, a man infected by an unnamed virus becomes emaciated until he disappears into a black hole that morphs into a scene from ACT UP protests. Men carry signs that read “Silence = Death” and “Killed by the System.” Behind them, skeletons look to the sky.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/facui2-1200x904.jpeg?resize=1200%2C904&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The artwork references the AIDs memorial quilt before transitioning into a segment about the COVID-19 pandemic, in which a woman’s lungs explode into tiny bits of paper. Fauci is portrayed next to the White House press briefing room podium, where he often gave virus updates alongside Trump. Crosthwaite included a thumbs-up icon<strong> </strong>moving erratically up and down behind the podium, and Fauci off to the side. He also captured anti-Fauci sentiment and the right-wing rejection of vaccines, at one point portraying the scientist with devil horns. The stop-motion sequence ends with a woman receiving a vaccine, which cuts to a portrait of an aging Fauci.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/fauci3-1200x894.jpeg?resize=1200%2C894&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Crosthwaite told <i>Hyperallergic </i>that he doubts the Trump administration actually watched the video, instead targeted the work because of his identity. He rebuffed the White House’s Smithsonian list as a mediocre attempt to win a culture war, and said being included on the list was a badge of honor.</p>\n    <p>“The portrait was done from the perspective of a Mexican-American artist, someone who’s cognizant of the impact of age and COVID-19 on my community, which is presented in the animation … the diverse people who are being attacked by viruses,” he said.</p>\n    <p>The artworks that Crosthwaite initially submitted to the Outwin competition had nothing to do with Fauci. In fact, the work that secured his national win was a different stop-motion animation, telling the story of a woman he met who had crossed the US-Mexico border illegally.</p>\n    <p>Crosthwaite commended the Outwin prize’s capacity to open doors for artists like himself. Any artist residing in the United States who is at least 18 years old is eligible to submit to the competition. For Crosthwaite, it was life-changing.</p>\n    <p>“Getting the commission to do the portrait of Dr. Fauci is actually a great honor — being part of the Smithsonian,” Crosthwaite told <i>Hyperallergic. </i>“My piece is part of the record of American history.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Screen-Shot-2025-08-29-at-2.58.33-PM-1200x898.jpeg?resize=1200%2C898&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/fauci-1200x904.jpeg?resize=1200%2C904&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038060/hugo-crosthwaite-artist-whose-fauci-portraits-enraged-the-white-house/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>LONDON — Some of the Courtauld’s previous exhibitions have <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1010475/the-cortaulds-impressionism-show-is-a-victim-of-corporate-curating/\">suffered from insufficient curation</a>. <a href=\"https://courtauld.ac.uk/whats-on/exh-abstract-erotic/\"> Abstract Erotic: Louise Bourgeois, Alice Adams, Eva Hesse</a>, on the other hand, strikes the exact right balance. Drawing on scholar Jo Applin’s research, curator Alexandra Gerstein has taken as a starting point the work of feminist curator and critic Lucy Lippard, who coined the titular term to describe this sensuous strand of art emerging in 1960s New York. Making perhaps the best use yet of the Courtauld’s teeny exhibition spaces next to the permanent collection, this small but unstuffed show gives proper breathing space for artistic dialogue and, crucially, for the viewer to engage in exploring differences and similarities between works and practices for themselves. </p>\n    <p>In 1966, Lippard curated the exhibition <i>Eccentric Abstraction</i> to capture a new wave of sculptures created from unusual, pliable materials like wire, plastic mesh, netting, and latex, which evoked tactile organic forms and, by extension, the human body. This is the Courtauld’s first show devoted to standalone sculpture, and the contrast between these blob-like forms and its Impressionist-heavy permanent collection may go some way to recreate just how different — even alarming — these pieces will have appeared to 1960s audiences just getting over the shock of Abstract Expressionism’s  rehauling of formalist painting.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Installation-view-l-r-Bourgeois-_Avenza_-_Lair_-_Fee-Couturiere_-_Hanging-Janus_-1200x880.jpg?resize=1200%2C880&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Abstract Erotic: Louise Bourgeois, Eva Hesse, Alice Adams</i>, featuring works by Eva Hesse and Alice Adams (all photos Olivia McEwan/</p>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>The three artists are each afforded an introductory caption presenting historical context. No direct written comparisons are made between them, nor any attempt to force commonality, for historically, there is none other than their working in generally the same space and time. This is good curating: The show allows viewers to ask and think for themselves. Its skill lies in making suggestions via the pieces selected for display, allowing for robust visual comparison. Viewers won’t be able to ignore the strain of eroticism that stems from their irresistible tactility, which is both alluring and fear-inducing, nor their uncanny resemblance to certain human appendages (<i>ahem</i>).</p>\n    <p>Applin and Gerstein do point out that all three artists’ experimentation with latex marked a turning point in their explorations of eroticism and the unconscious. The exhibition’s most well-known artist, Bourgeois, was born in Paris in 1911 and moved to New York in 1938. Duly included here is her “Filette (Sweeter Version)” (1968–99/ 2006), unmistakably an erect penis (or, more accurately, one yanked upwards by string) in urethane rubber, given the ambiguous French title “Little Girl.” Adams graduated from Columbia University with a degree in Fine Arts in 1953 before becoming an accomplished weaver. Her foray into obscure materials is here represented by such pieces as the nearby “Expanded Cylinder” (1970), in which she allowed latex foam to expand and set into a constricting tube of chain link, producing a regular weave-like texture while maintaining a phallic, slippery form. Finally, Hesse, born in 1936 in Hamburg before settling in New York, made sculptures of forms bound, twisted, and caught in netting. Applin and Gerstein draw out the latex connection again via the caption, which quotes Hesse on the material’s inevitable deterioration: “Art doesn’t last; life doesn’t last.” Fittingly, though unfortunately, there are no latex examples here.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Installation-view-l-r-Hesse-untitled-pieces-and-_No-Title-or-Not-Yet_-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>It is also unfortunate that this small but perfectly formed show was relatively empty on a weekend. The scrappy, experimental mark-making explored by these three pioneering artists is one important strain in the development of feminist art. Their unsettling forms provoke, titillate, and amuse — welcome responses to female voices and artistic expression. Perhaps it is reflective of trends in audience attention that a solid academic show like this should be less visited than the packed-out recent exhibitions on <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/804963/what-does-peter-doig-have-to-do-with-the-impressionists/\">Peter Doig</a> or yet more <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1010475/the-cortaulds-impressionism-show-is-a-victim-of-corporate-curating/\">Impressionism</a>.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>When the United States Department of Agriculture established the Farm Security Administration (FSA) in 1937, hoping to provide aid to rural communities affected by the Great Depression, it also implemented a photography project headed by government official Roy Stryker. The photographs were meant to generate support for the agency, allowing the public to witness the impacts of the Depression for themselves. Made by recruited photographers and then selected by Stryker for inclusion in traveling exhibitions and news outlets, the chosen images overwhelmingly depicted White families — a narrow and literally whitewashed view of rural America.</p>\n    <p><i> Crafting Sanctuaries: Black Spaces of the Black Great Depression South</i>, a new exhibition at the Museum of Art and Light in Manhattan, Kansas, showcases a broader view of FSA imagery, focusing on Black Southerners documented by photographers like Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Russell Lee, Marion Post Wolcott, Arthur Rothstein, Ben Shahn, and Jack Delano across six states: Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Florida, Mississippi, and Missouri. </p>\n    <p>Presented in partnership with Art Bridges Foundation, the photos highlight the intimacy of life among one’s community — private quarters, public gathering spaces — and the care taken to build one together. The exhibition, curator Tamir Williams told <i>Hyperallergic</i>, “is an examination of the significance of Black Southerners investing in their spatial worlds — and more largely in beauty — while living through this intense period of economic hardship and racial violence.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Sr4qw-1200x905.jpeg?resize=1200%2C905&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>During the summer of 2023, Ashley Holland, curator and director of Curatorial Initiatives for the Art Bridges Foundation, approached Williams to curate its first in-house traveling exhibition, drawing from the FSA photography collection. At the time, they’d just begun a job there as a curatorial research assistant.</p>\n    <p>“I came across Nicholas Natanson’s <i> The Black Image in the New Deal: The Politics of FSA Photography</i> (1992) and Sarah Boxer’s ‘</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/12/whitewashing-the-great-depression/616936/\">Whitewashing the Great Depression</a>’ (2020) for</p>\n    <p><i>The Atlantic</i>,” Williams said. “I knew that I wanted to focus on this issue of the absence of Black and other non-White persons from the larger visual memory of the Great Depression — and specifically explore how and why this exclusion happened and how it could be redressed.”</p>\n    <p>Williams spent a week at the Library of Congress poring over the digital FSA collection. They were drawn to images of small homes built by both White and Black laborers, particularly in La Forge, Missouri. Curious about “what home and homemaking might have looked like for other Black persons and families beyond La Forge,” they expanded their research.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/gdoxx-1200x797.jpeg?resize=1200%2C797&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The exhibition’s photographs are reverent, offering glimpses into otherwise unseen instances of Black domesticity and community. “I find Jack Delano’s ‘Negro tenant family near Greensboro, Alabama’ (1941) to be incredibly striking,” shared Javier Rivero Ramos, associate curator at Art Bridges. In the image, a young family poses in their home, the walls and ceilings plastered and reinforced with newspaper clippings, a kitten at their feet. “It seems like every conceivable emotion, thought, and event unfolding through the country is somehow refracted in the image,” Ramos added. Ibby Ouweleen, Art Bridges curatorial associate, said she was “taken by Marion Post Wolcott’s interior scene of three children and a dog in their family home, which feels sort of magical and mundane at once.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/WzRNF-1200x897.jpeg?resize=1200%2C897&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The exhibition is displayed in tandem with <i>Sanctuary in Motion</i>, a companion installation developed in collaboration with the Yuma Street Cultural Center. Kristy Peterson, vice president of Learning, Engagement, and Visitor Experiences at the museum, pointed to the history of the site.</p>\n    <p>“Manhattan, Kansas, has a rich history as a town site established by abolitionist settlers, circa 1855,” Peterson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “<i>Sanctuary in Motion</i> shares information about Manhattan’s history and community, and tells the story of Yuma Street [part of the city’s Historic District] … and its significance as a sanctuary where families made something out of nothing.”</p>\n    <p><i>Crafting Sanctuaries</i>, which runs through next spring, is both a corrective and a meditation. “It is my hope that these photographs allow viewers to see and witness how Black Southerners adopted expansive definitions of beauty to craft personal and communal sanctuaries and spaces of respite,” Williams said.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/y1qCn-1200x893.jpeg?resize=1200%2C893&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038134/reclaiming-a-whitewashed-history-of-the-great-depression-museum-art-light-kansas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Joe Amrhein and Susan Swenson were going to sit out the Armory Show this fall for the first time in a quarter century until they got a call last month from the fair’s director.</p>\n<p>The owners of Pierogi Gallery in Brooklyn’s Williamsburg neighborhood initially did not apply this year due to the show’s rising booth costs, which can exceed tens of thousands of dollars. Pierogi is planning the next phase of its business, which could include <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/970425/a-williamsburg-family-reunion-at-pierogi-gallery-30th-anniversary-opening/\">relocating to Lower Manhattan</a>. </p>\n<p>But Armory executives Kyla McMillan and J. Tyler Woodall appealed to Pierogi and the fair’s shared history — in 2016, Amrhein suggested the Armory use an empty space to display Jonathan Schipper’s <a href=\"https://www.jonathanschipper.com/slow-motion-car-crash\">installation</a> of a Volkswagen Golf crashing into a wall; the presentation of large-scale art has since become a cornerstone of the show. They recently negotiated a smaller exhibition space for Pierogi with a lower rate, enabling the gallery to return.</p>\n<p>“We had been on the fence about it since the economy is very uncertain and it’s a big investment,” Swenson said. “We’re not one of the big box galleries. Some of them have their own economies now.”</p>\n<p>The Armory Show has come a long way from exhibiting several New York gallerists on three floors of the Gramercy Park Hotel in the mid-1990s. Since 2021, the fair has set up camp at the spacious Javits Center near Manhattan’s Hudson Yards, where it will host some 230 galleries from more than 35 countries from September 4 through 7.</p>\n<p>The show also has new owners. Two years after Frieze <a href=\"https://www.frieze.com/article/frieze-acquires-armory-show-and-expo-chicago\">acquired</a> the Armory Show and EXPO Chicago, its parent company, Endeavor Group Holdings, sold its roster of art fairs for <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/biz/news/ari-emanuel-buys-frieze-endeavor-group-1236383561/\">$200 million</a> to Hollywood superagent Ari Emmanuel. The former Endeavor CEO envisions Frieze as a key piece of a new global events company he formed this year, and perhaps one positioned to compete with Art Basel’s dominance in the contemporary art market.</p>\n<p>But with a reported downturn in the market, galleries have been weighing their options.</p>\n<p>Once mainstays at the Armory, blue-chip institutions have instead drifted toward Frieze’s <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1011006/frieze-new-york-is-back-to-its-old-ways/\">spring fair</a>, the Art Dealers Association of America’s (ADAA) Art Show (before it was abruptly <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032202/as-adaas-art-show-changes-course-a-nonprofit-is-left-in-limbo/\">canceled</a> this year), or TEFAF New York — or they are skipping the New York fairs entirely. David Zwirner hasn’t exhibited at the Amory Show since <a href=\"https://www.davidzwirner.com/fairs/2022/the-armory-show\">2022</a>, and chose to show at ADAA several years before that.

    "body": "<p>A round of layoffs at the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) this summer is raising alarms at one of the best-known arts schools in the country as the institution grapples with rising costs.</p>\n<p>The Santa Clarita-based private arts school laid off nine administrative employees in July, including five unionized workers and four non-union workers, claiming in a schoolwide message that CalArts needed to cut expenses in the face of a projected <a href=\"https://calarts.edu/sites/default/files/2025-05/Toward%20a%20Sustainable%20Financial%20Future%20for%20CalArts.pdf\">$15 million deficit</a>.</p>\n<p>“The nine staff positions, as well as about a dozen vacant staff positions, are being eliminated as part of a necessary workforce reduction, which will enable CalArts to address a structural deficit, prioritize student-facing services, and better align our staffing with current and projected enrollments to continue providing exceptional educational opportunities to our students,” a CalArts spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>.</p>\n<p>But faculty and staff members are questioning the administration’s decision, arguing that the layoffs could harm the school’s ability to train and nurture the next generation of artists.</p>\n<p>“Everyone was disappointed in this having to happen at all when we’re working so hard to try to better serve the population,” Emily Lytle-Painter, a web and digital media producer at CalArts and union member, told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “When we were trying to go into discussions with the administration, we felt like there were other avenues.”</p>\n<p>Tensions between CalArts employees and school leadership have been simmering since last fall, when dozens of faculty and staff <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DCikoHURbCM/?hl=en\">decided to form a union</a> after enduring what they described as years of stagnant wages, increased workloads, and minimal benefits. In December, CalArts faculty <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/972509/calarts-staff-and-faculty-move-to-unionize/\">delivered a letter</a> to President Ravi Rajan announcing their intention to organize with United Auto Workers in a unit that would represent approximately 600 workers. They held elections in March and ratified the union a month later.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the school had been struggling with enrollment, which <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/institutions/specialized-colleges/2024/04/08/enrollment-declines-threaten-small-independent#:~:text=Though%20it\"s%20enrollment%20has%20also,creative%20industries%2C%E2%80%9D%20Rajan%20said.\">declined</a> by about 12 percent since the pandemic, from 1,532 students in 2019 to 1,353 students in 2023 (tuition surpassed <a href=\"https://calarts.edu/admissions-aid/tuition/tuition-and-fees/cost-attendance\">$60,000</a> per year in 2025–26). </p>\n<p>In an April 2024 interview, Rajan told <i>Inside Higher Education</i> that CalArts was “<a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/institutions/specialized-colleges/2024/04/08/enrollment-declines-threaten-small-independent#:~:text=Though%20it\"s%20enrollment%20has%20also,creative%20industries%2C%E2%80%9D%20Rajan%20said.\">fiscally sound</a>.” But the school proceeded with several budget cuts to reduce its operating costs, including tighter spending controls, hiring delays and travel limitations, and adjustments to admissions and financial aid packages. These measures, Rajan said in a schoolwide message, saved the school $5.5 million.</p>\n<p>This spring, CalArts sought to reduce its headcount and sent voluntary separation and early retirement notices to between 50 and 60 faculty and staff, union leaders estimated. But only 32 employees, including 22 faculty and 10 staff, took the school’s offer and Rajan moved ahead with layoffs despite vociferous <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DN3-oBcEmIH/?igsh=MXExOWNyY2VhY2J5Yg%3D%3D\">objections</a> from the union. </p>\n<p>“I acknowledge how painful this news is,” Rajan wrote in a July 15 letter to faculty and staff reviewed by <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “These are not just abstract positions—they are roles held by our colleagues, teammates, and friends. I’m immensely grateful for their contributions and mindful of the weight of this moment for our community.” </p>\n<p>When the school announced layoffs, union leaders bargained with the administration for three months of severance, instead of two weeks of pay per year of service; three months of COBRA insurance; and priority rehiring in any vacant positions over the next two years for anyone who was laid off.</p>\n<p>“Everyone is understandably sad and worried, and there’s a general feeling of having to move forward with what we have,” Lytle-Painter said. “I personally was really proud of our bargaining team being able to bargain for increased benefits for those affected by the layoffs. That’s part of why we have a union.”</p>\n<p>Thomas Leeb, an adjunct faculty member in the School of Music and union member, said he is approaching the next academic year that starts on September 8 with mixed emotions.</p>\n<p>“A lot of institutional knowledge has left with the voluntary separation program, and that’s sad and it hurts. At the same time, there’s a bit of optimism,” Leeb said, referencing the newly formed union. “Someone I spoke to who has been at CalArts for 25 years said this is the first time he felt protected.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038229/facing-15m-budget-deficit-calarts-lays-off-workers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s an invitation to take a moment to celebrate the beauty of balance amid a busy season.

Sound familiar? It’s one of the most common things I hear from <a href=\"https://wellnesswithedie.com/\">clients</a>. But here’s what most people don’t realize: cravings are often a clue from your gut, not a reflection of your willpower. In fact, gut health and sugar cravings go hand-in-hand. When your <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/gut-health/how-to-improve-gut-health/\">microbiome</a> is out of sync, it’s your body’s way of sending feedback. Which begs the question: why do we crave sugar at all? Let’s break down what’s really driving your cravings and how your gut plays a starring role.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=chocolate orange loaf cake_gut health sugar cravings&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/gut-health-sugar-cravings/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-865x1286.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake/\">\n        <graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"865\" height=\"1286\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-865x1286.jpg\" alt=\"chocolate orange loaf cake_gut health sugar cravings\" class=\"wp-image-291347\" data-pin-description=\"chocolate orange loaf cake_gut health sugar cravings\" srcset=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-865x1286.jpg 865w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-202x300.jpg 202w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-768x1142.jpg 768w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-1033x1536.jpg 1033w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-1377x2048.jpg 1377w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-150x223.jpg 150w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-scaled.jpg 1722w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Why We Crave Sugar</h2>\n<p>We tend to crave sugar because it’s <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/health/manage-blood-sugar/\">fast fuel</a>—especially when we’re running low on energy, stress is high, or our stomach is empty. But cravings go deeper than that. <a href=\"https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/sugar-disrupts-microbiome-eliminates-protection-against-obesity-and-diabetes\">Research</a> shows certain gut bacteria <i>feed</i> on sugar. When those microbes dominate your gut environment, they can communicate through the <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/gut-health/l-glutamine-and-gut-health/\">gut-brain axis</a> and nudge you toward sweet foods. It sounds wild, but in many ways, your microbiome can talk (and sugar is its language). All that to say, your cravings aren’t a moral failing. They’re a message.</p>\n<h2>The Gut-Sugar Connection</h2>\n<p>So, what’s actually happening inside your gut when sugar cravings strike?</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Microbial imbalance (dysbiosis).</strong>Too many<a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7284805/\">“sugar-loving” bacteria</a>and not enough diverse, beneficial strains can fuel cravings.</li>\n      <li><strong>Blood sugar swings.</strong>When gut health is off, nutrient absorption is compromised, making it harder to keep<a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/meal-plan-to-balance-blood-sugar/\">blood sugar stable</a>. Cue the rollercoaster of highs and lows.</li>\n      <li><strong>Serotonin production.</strong>Nearly 90% of serotonin (your<a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/health/hormones/dopamine-and-hormone-connection/\">feel-good hormone</a>) is made in the gut. If your gut bacteria aren’t thriving, mood dips can sneak in—and sugar often feels like a quick lift.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>In other words, gut health sugar cravings are real, and they’re rooted in both biology and psychology.</p>\n<h2>Wired for Sugar? Here’s What That Really Means</h2>\n<p>Here’s the reframe I wish I’d known sooner: sugar cravings aren’t proof you’re “bad” at healthy eating. They’re not a sign of weakness. They’re a signal. And signals are meant to be understood, not ignored. Instead of beating myself up when I craved something sweet, I started asking: <i>What’s out of balance?</i> Maybe I hadn’t eaten <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/protein/how-much-protein-do-i-need/\">enough protein</a>. Maybe my <a href=\"https://camillestyles.substack.com/p/4-changes-that-healed-my-gut-health\">gut was inflamed</a>. Or maybe I was just <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/morning-routine/how-to-relieve-stress-tips/\">stressed</a>, and my body wanted a quick serotonin hit. That curiosity shifted my relationship with cravings from shame to awareness.</p>\n<h2>Breaking the Sugar-Craving Cycle</h2>\n<p>Inevitably, the more sugar you eat, the more your body (and your gut microbes) want it. Sugar temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals like <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/dopamine-detox/\">dopamine</a>, which is why it can feel so irresistible. The hardest part isn’t just managing cravings once they hit. It’s preventing that first bite from triggering the cycle. The promising news? You don’t have to rely on willpower alone—there are practical, gut-focused strategies that help you reset cravings over time.</p>\n<h2>How to Rebalance Your Gut and Tame Sugar Cravings</h2>\n<p>Extreme measures aren’t required. You don’t need to <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/how-to-curb-sugar-cravings/\">quit sugar</a> altogether. Honestly, that kind of rigidity usually backfires anyway. Instead, supporting gut health naturally reduces the intensity and frequency of sugar cravings. Here’s what’s worked for me—and what the science backs up.</p>\n<h3>1. Prioritize a Protein-Rich Breakfast</h3>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/high-protein-breakfast/\">high-protein breakfast</a> stabilizes blood sugar and sets the tone for fewer cravings later in the day. If you currently start your morning with toast or a pastry, try swapping in Greek yogurt with berries and ground flaxseed, <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/quick-healthy-egg-recipes/\">eggs with veggies</a>, or a <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/high-protein-high-fiber-smoothie/\">protein smoothie</a> instead. You’ll notice more steady energy—and fewer mid-morning sugar urges.</p>\n<h3>2. Feed the Good Bugs</h3>\n<p>Your microbiome thrives on <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/gut-health/foods-for-gut-health/\">fiber-rich, prebiotic foods</a> (think oats, garlic, onions, asparagus, bananas). These help beneficial bacteria crowd out the sugar-lovers. Pair that with probiotic-rich foods like yogurt, sauerkraut, and kimchi to keep your gut ecosystem diverse.</p>\n<h3>3. Crowd Out Processed Sugar</h3>\n<p>Rather than focusing on restriction, start adding<i> in</i> nutrient-dense foods (namely, protein and fiber). You’ll naturally crowd out <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/unhealthy-snacks/\">ultra-processed snacks</a> and sugar-laden treats. <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7019570/\">Data</a> shows that within 2–4 weeks, you’ll likely notice your desire for refined sugar begins to decrease, and by 6–8 weeks, cravings can feel <i>significantly </i>more manageable (as your gut and blood sugar stabilize)!</p>\n<h3>4. Mind Your Stress (and Sleep)</h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/gut-health-sugar-cravings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

For <a href=\"https://westbourne.com/blogs/field-notes/meet-camilla?srsltid=AfmBOoqGmQD9s5g79kGvUh8nYtDP3_L_Hzqq5CiPIJht6uDTvQDDoTVl\">Camilla Marcus</a>, this chocolate bark checks all the boxes. She says:</p>\n    <p>“I grew up with Rocky Mountain Chocolate, as my dad is originally from Denver, Colorado. Especially during the winter, it was our treat and something we patiently looked forward to when we went to his home state and got to savor all of the hand-crafted creations,” Marcus said. “My parents’ particular favorite was the dark chocolate bark, often with almonds but sometimes different combinations with what was in season. At the time, of course, this was too grown-up for me, paling in comparison to chocolate-dipped honeycomb.”</p>\n    <p>This floral, nutrient-packed version is her grown-up ode to those moments—a bark that feels as nostalgic as it does elevated.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=pieces of chocolate bark_chocolate bark recipe&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/food/recipes/chocolate-bark-recipe/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chocolate-bark-recipe-pieces-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chocolate-bark-recipe-pieces-865x1297.jpg\" alt=\"pieces of chocolate bark_chocolate bark recipe\"/>\n    <p>In this recipe, rich dark chocolate meets bee pollen (a superfood packed with serious benefits), rose petals, and flaky Himalayan or Maldon salt for a flavor profile that honors Marcus’ childhood memories. It’s beautiful enough to serve at a gathering and simple enough to whip up for a weeknight treat.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=camille styles and camilla marcus making chocolate bark&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/food/recipes/chocolate-bark-recipe/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/camille-styles-camilla-marcus-chocolate-bark-recipe-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/camille-styles-camilla-marcus-chocolate-bark-recipe-865x1297.jpg\" alt=\"camille styles and camilla marcus making chocolate bark\"/>\n    <h2>Camilla’s Tips for Perfect Chocolate Bark</h2>\n    <p>You can also have some fun with these toppings, using anything that offers some crunch and flavor in a small, sprinkleable size. “I’m a magnet for large format anything, especially dessert, and this is a deceptively simple yet notable centerpiece to a table for gathering that comes with an irresistibly fun activity: instead of breaking bread, you can break bark. Most importantly, invest in a mallet so you can have fun smashing the bark,” Marcus said.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chocolate-bark-recipe-pieces-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"pieces of chocolate bark_chocolate bark recipe\"/>\n    <h2>Dark Chocolate Bark with Bee Pollen, Rose Petals, and Pink Salt</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Yield: 1–1/4 sheet tray 1x</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3>Description</h3>\n    <p>This chocolate bark recipe is an elevated twist on a nostalgic classic.</p>\n    <h3>Ingredients</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li>20 ounces dark chocolate (see tip)</li>\n      <li>3 tablespoons bee pollen</li>\n      <li>2 tablespoons crushed dried rose petals</li>\n      <li>2 tablespoons pink Himalayan salt or Maldon salt</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3>Instructions</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Line a quarter sheet pan with parchment paper and set aside, making sure you have enough room in your freezer to fit the tray later on.</li>\n      <li>Set up a double boiler on your stovetop to melt the chocolate or improvise one by setting a metal mixing bowl over a saucepan containing about 3 inches of water and bring to a boil. Once hot, put the chocolate into the upper pan or bowl and swirl the chocolate with a spatula just until fully melted.</li>\n      <li>Remove from the heat carefully and quickly, pouring onto the parchment-lined pan and gently spreading it evenly with the spatula. The goal is for the bark to be about 1/4 inch thick. Once the chocolate is laid down and still soft, sprinkle the rest of the ingredients evenly and as desired.</li>\n      <li>Place the tray into the freezer for at least an hour, or ideally overnight. When ready to serve, temper the chocolate to about room temperature and serve.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3>Notes</h3>\n    <p>\n      <i>Pro Tip: There has been a strong movement toward reforming chocolate production that better cares for the farming ecosystem with the soil nutrition in mind, as opposed to over-cultivation of this monocrop to address rising demand. For the lowest-impact chocolate, choose Fair Trade, Fair for Life, non-GMO, and organic certifications. Buy from brands that know their suppliers and who are investing in agroforestry and producer communities, and support companies using compostable packaging. Two brands Marcus loves are Alter Eco and Good Sam.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/recipes/chocolate-bark-recipe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>We may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article.</p>\n<p>No matter your hair type, everyone can struggle with thinning hair. As someone with afro-textured hair, the first time I straightened it, I expected it to look as thick and full as it did in its natural curls. Reader, it did not. Since then, I’ve learned all the tricks of the trade to get naturally fuller, thicker hair. From extensions to <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/beauty/hair/best-thickening-hair-serums/\">hair thickening serums</a> to rice water treatments and more, I’ve tried it all. But to truly understand the science behind hair volume and density, I sought expert guidance to help me find the best hair thickening products.</p>\n<p>I spoke with Devin Graciano, hair stylist and Head of Product Development at <a href=\"https://goldielocks.com/\">Goldie Locks</a>. Graciano enlightened me about the difference between hair density and hair thickness. Density is the number of strands on your head, while thickness is the width of each strand. Collectively, both create the appearance of your hair volume. So, to achieve thicker hair, it’s key to understand your hair type, as well as what’s causing your hair’s thinness.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Featured image from  our interview with Babba Rivera by Belathée Photography.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=The Best Hair Thickening Products Worth Your Money, According to a Stylist&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/style/hair/best-hair-thickening-products/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/camille-styles-hair-thickening-products-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>How to Actually Get Thicker Hair, According to an Expert</h2>\n<p>Hair thickness is largely determined by genetics—but that doesn’t mean you can’t give your strands a boost. For naturally thinner hair, nourishing it inside and out is essential to keeping it healthy and full. If your hair is losing density, it could be due to aging (slower growth is normal over time), stress, childbirth, nutritional deficiencies, or genetic conditions like alopecia. Sometimes, a clogged scalp can also be the culprit—in which case, adding a scalp scrub to your routine can help stimulate circulation and encourage growth.</p>\n<p>With all these contributing factors to hair loss or thinning, many of us will likely ask ourselves: can you fake it until you make it? When it comes to creating texture and volume, you’re in luck. Read on for Graciano’s insights on the best hair thickening products to give your tresses a more voluminous look.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>As we get older, slower hair growth is normal and might result in thinning. Some people also experience hair loss from stress, childbirth, or nutritional deficiencies, as well as genetic conditions like alopecia.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<h2>Is there anything proven to thicken hair?</h2>\n<p>Countless studies have explored ways to achieve thicker hair—from boosting density to temporarily plumping each strand. While DIY methods abound, there are also proven ingredients worth seeking out when thicker, fuller hair is the goal.</p>\n<h2>Ingredients That Can Help Thicken Hair</h2>\n<p>Ingredients that show a great improvement in hair thickness include:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Saw palmetto</li>\n      <li>Rosemary</li>\n      <li>Scutellaria baicalensis</li>\n      <li>Soy</li>\n      <li>Wheat</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Boosting hair density involves looking at both internal and external factors. Hair is made of sulfur, iron, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, so getting enough of these key minerals is essential for new growth. Deficiencies, along with factors like <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-reduce-inflammation/\">inflammation</a>, poor diet, sleep, and hydration, can all show up in the health of your hair.</p>\n<h2>Do thickening products damage hair?</h2>\n<p>Generally speaking, no. Hair thickeners typically consist of either hair fibers that attach to the hair or water-soluble polymers that can’t overtake your hair’s overall integrity.</p>\n<h2>How long does it take for a hair thickener to work?</h2>\n<p>For styling products, results can be seen in minutes. These formulas coat the hair shaft, creating the appearance of thicker strands almost instantly. Ingredients like hydroxyethylcellulose can plump each hair fiber within a few minutes.</p>\n<p>When using supplements or treatments that target new growth, allow for a full hair growth cycle (around three months) before expecting visible results.</p>\n<h2>Daily Routines That Can Help Prevent Thinning</h2>\n<p>Consistency is key when it comes to thicker hair. In addition to using hair thickening products, try:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Taking a balanced hair supplement</strong>to support growth from within.</li>\n      <li><strong>Eating a nutrient-rich diet</strong>and staying hydrated.</li>\n      <li><strong>Managing stress</strong>, which can have a direct impact on hair shedding.</li>\n      <li><strong>Doing a daily scalp massage</strong>. Just four minutes can boost circulation and stimulate follicles.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> While genetics play a big role, the right combination of nutrition, lifestyle habits, and hair thickening products can help you achieve fuller, healthier-looking hair.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/hair/best-hair-thickening-products/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>We may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article.</p>\n<p>By mid-August, the pull of fall is impossible to ignore. While the temperatures may still say summer, I’ve learned to embrace what we jokingly call a “fall soft launch”—that sweet spot between seasons where small shifts make our home feel instantly cozier. Think of it as a gentle layering process: swapping breezy summer details for textures, scents, and accents that hint at crisp mornings and golden light.</p>\n<p>If you’re ready to ease into autumn without going full pumpkin patch just yet, we’ve curated simple, design-forward ideas that will carry you seamlessly from summer to fall.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=8 Simple Styling Swaps to Take Your Home from Summer to Fall&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/moody-fall-coffee-table-decor-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Switch Up Your Scents</h2>\n<p>Scent has a remarkable power to set the tone of a season. Begin the transition by tucking away summer’s floral and citrus notes in favor of warm, grounding fragrances—woods, spices, and amber. A candle in the entryway or living room creates an inviting atmosphere, while a subtle diffuser in the bathroom offers a refined touch for guests.</p>\n<h2>Shop Fall Scents</h2>\n<p>Casa Zuma</p>\n<p>P.F. Candle Co.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Camille Styles fall kitchen&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/target-figmint-camille-styles-2-33-1500x2249-ff10621-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Swap Artwork and Framed Photos</h2>\n<p>Think of your walls as part of your seasonal wardrobe. Just like swapping linen for knits, a quick art refresh makes the summer-to-fall transition feel effortless. Frame those vacation photos you’ve been meaning to print, or switch out bright summer art for pieces in moodier tones. It’s an instant vibe shift—and way cheaper than redecorating your whole space.</p>\n<h2>Shop Fall Artwork</h2>\n<p>Hearth &amp; Hand™ with Magnolia</p>\n<p>Threshold™ designed with Studio McGee</p>\n<h2>Prepare Your Kitchen for Cold Weather</h2>\n<p>Nothing says fall like baking pumpkin bread with <i>You’ve Got Mail</i> playing in the background. As the air cools, it’s time to make space for heartier meals and slow-cooked traditions. Bring Dutch ovens and crockpots back into view, refresh dish linens, and tuck away the summer accessories you won’t need until next year. A few small shifts not only prepare your kitchen for cold weather—they set the stage for the comforting rituals of autumn cooking.</p>\n<h2>Shop Fall Kitchen Appliances</h2>\n<p>Crock-Pot</p>\n<p>Le Creuset Signature</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Fall shelf styling in living room.&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/fall-shelf-styling-living-room-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Add Darker-Colored Accents</h2>\n<p>As the days shorten, layering in darker accents creates a home that feels grounded and seasonal. The summer-to-fall transition is the perfect time to rotate in textiles and decor in richer tones—pillows, throws, and candles in palettes of burgundy, mustard, and deep green. A cohesive color story not only enhances the autumn mood but also carries seamlessly into winter, extending the life of your seasonal styling.</p>\n<h2>Shop fall accents</h2>\n<h2>Go Heavy on the Candles</h2>\n<p>Nothing transforms a space faster than candlelight—and fall is the time to go all in. During the summer-to-fall transition, I bring out taper candles in moody shades and scatter them everywhere: mantels, dining tables, coffee tables, you name it. If flames make you nervous, battery-operated candles give the same cozy glow without the worry. Either way, more is more here—lean into the romance of flickering light.</p>\n<h2>Shop Candles</h2>\n<p>SIN</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-23271969\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCharcoal Twisted Taper Candles\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Set of 2</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Fall shelf styling&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/target-shelf-styling-6-1500x2250-ff10621-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Try Moodier Florals</h2>\n<p>Late August is the perfect moment to rethink your floral arrangements. Trade in vibrant summer blossoms for deeper hues, textural grasses, and sculptural branches. Pampas grass, eucalyptus, and faux stems bring both longevity and sophistication, adding a layer of seasonal color to mantels, entryways, or dining tables. These subtle, earthy arrangements set a grounded, autumnal mood throughout your home.</p>\n<h2>Shop fall florals</h2>\n<p>Abigail Ahern</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://rstyle.me/+jFBQ2WEl32CojI8xaqf00w\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t21.25″ Preserved Golden Yarrow Fall Wreath\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Hearth &amp; Hand™ with Magnolia</p>\n<h2>Cozy Throws and Linen Bedding for a Summer-to-Fall Transition</h2>\n<p>One of the easiest fall transition tips is updating your textiles. Swap out lightweight summer throws for chunkier knits, faux fur, or deep-toned blankets to create instant warmth. Style them over couches, chairs, or keep extras in a storage ottoman. In the bedroom, update your look by layering linen bedding with a cozy throw—perfect for chilly fall nights and weekend movie marathons.</p>\n<h2>Shop Cozy Throws &amp; Bedding</h2>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Fall home exterior&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/fall-home-exterior-865x1296.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Tidy Your Home’s Exterior</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

From your <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/morning-routine/morning-routine-ideas/\">morning routine</a> to your evening wind-down, our days flow with more ease when we anchor them with <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/healthy-daily-habits/\">supportive habits</a>. Rituals cut through decision fatigue and help us weave intention into the everyday. By committing to practices that help us feel our best, we strengthen self-trust—and that reliability becomes a fixture of our days. As a writer, that truth shows itself most in my daily writing rituals.</p>\n<p>Writing is a strange career—part craft, part inspiration. On good days, words spill easily. On others, even a single sentence feels impossible. But my writing ritual is what steadies me. It’s the structure I lean on to move past the blank page and into flow.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Featured image from  our interview with Remi Ishizuka by Michelle Nash.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Woman practicing writing rituals at her desk.&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/writing-rituals/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/janessa-leone-writing-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>What are writing rituals?</h2>\n<p>Writing rituals are the consistent set of steps we take to prepare ourselves before putting pen to paper. While they look different for everyone, writing rituals all serve the same purpose: to feel energized, grounded, and inspired before diving into the work. Sometimes they’re simple; sometimes they’re deeply idiosyncratic. What matters most is that they put us in a headspace with greater freedom to create.</p>\n<p>Think of them as a way to bypass hesitation. When you’ve set the stage—your environment, your mindset, your tools—you can step into writing without overthinking. With fewer variables to wrestle with, you open the door for creative flow.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>History is full of proof that rituals work:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong/>wrote standing at his typewriter, believing the posture helped him stay alert.<a href=\"https://www.timesnownews.com/lifestyle/books/features/ernest-hemingways-stand-up-desk-writing-on-his-feet-and-thinking-on-his-toes-article-113062749\">Ernest Hemingway</a></li>\n      <li><strong/>rented a small hotel room for months at a time, bringing only yellow pads, a dictionary, and a Bible. She needed the quiet separation from home to write.<a href=\"https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2279/the-art-of-fiction-no-119-maya-angelou\">Maya Angelou</a></li>\n      <li><strong/>wrote before dawn, explaining she wanted to “get up before the sun” so the world hadn’t yet placed demands on her.<a href=\"https://gwern.net/morning-writing\">Toni Morrison</a></li>\n      <li><strong/>ended her writing days with a ritual glass of scotch, followed by rereading everything she had written so she could step back in the next morning with confidence.<a href=\"https://lithub.com/on-the-daily-rituals-of-joan-didion-patti-smith-and-more/\">Joan Didion</a></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Each practice is unique, but the principle is the same: consistency creates momentum.</p>\n<h3>Reflection Prompt</h3>\n<p>Before you dive into designing your own writing ritual, pause and ask yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <i>When in the day do I feel most energized?</i>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <i>What spaces or environments make me feel most alive?</i>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <i>What small comforts (music, candle, tea, movement) help me focus?</i>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<p>These questions help you design a ritual that feels natural and inspiring—one you’ll actually want to return to.</p>\n<h2>Writing Rituals to Cultivate for Everyday Inspiration</h2>\n<h3>1. Put Yourself in the Path of Inspiration</h3>\n<p>Many call this “pre-writing,” and while <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-be-creative/\">creativity</a> is often thought of as an inherent trait, I believe it’s an orientation and approach to life. It’s a way of looking at the world with hope and optimism, understanding that every day is an opportunity to amplify the inputs you take in. The best writing doesn’t come from staring at the page—it comes from what you notice and absorb before you sit down.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Try experimenting with simple inspiration rituals like:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Carrying a notebook (or using your Notes app) to capture thoughts before they disappear.</li>\n      <li>Beginning each writing session by free-writing for five minutes about anything that’s on your mind.</li>\n      <li>Reading a poem, essay, or a page of a <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/beautifully-written-books/\">favorite book</a>to spark rhythm and language.</li>\n      <li>Taking a short walk to reset your energy and let ideas rise to the surface.</li>\n      <li>Creating an “inspiration box”: a collection of quotes, images, or snippets of writing that fuel you.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h3>Reflection Prompt</h3>\n<p><i>What practices make me feel most energized to create? Am I more inspired after reading, walking, or spending quiet time alone?</i> Experiment with one practice for a week and see how it shifts your writing energy.</p>\n<h3>2. Habit Stack Your Writing</h3>\n<p>It’s no secret—we love <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/habit-stacking/\">habit stacking</a>. By pairing a desired habit with one you already practice, the behavioral technique makes it easier for you to incorporate and build new rituals into your life. And spoiler: writing can be one of them.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/writing-rituals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

And whether it’s film funds, script labs or co-production markets, the same problems show up again and again.</p>\n    <p>Here are 5 red flags that make professionals quietly close your deck before you’ve even got to the good bits. Ready? Let’s go!</p>\n    <h2>1) Opening with a bloody quote</h2>\n    <p>Look, I get it: you love storytelling. You’re deep, poetic, meaningful. Maybe even a bit mystical.</p>\n    <p>But that’s not what your pitch deck is for!! Agents, investors, broadcasters, producers want clarity and story. Don’t open with a quote from Marcus Aurelius, Charlie Kaufmann or Aaron Sorkin.</p>\n    <p>Instead, open with a dilemma. What’s broken in your storyworld? Who’s in pain? What’s the central conflict? What do your characters NEED?</p>\n    <p>Lead with that, not something that sounds like it belongs on a Pinterest board. <strong>MORE:  A Foolproof Guide to Writing A Killer Pitch Deck</strong></p>\n    <h2>2) Your logline is whack</h2>\n    <p>If I have to read your logline twice to figure out what the story is? It’s not ready.</p>\n    <p>You need to be able to say your logline in one breath. It should make people lean in, not zone out.</p>\n    <p>If it starts sounding like a synopsis or makes me ask “Wait, who’s the protagonist again?”, rewrite it.</p>\n    <p><strong>Litmus test:</strong> Ask your mate who’s <strong>not</strong> in film to read or listen to it. If they go, “Oh yeah, I get it,” you’re good.</p>\n    <p>But if they just nod politely? You’re not, you’ve got a pitch deck fail on your hands . Simple as that!</p>\n    <h2>3) Trendy Moodboards (ugh)</h2>\n    <p>NEWSFLASH: Twelve moody stills from <i>Under The Skin</i> and <i>The Lobster</i> do not a moodboard make.</p>\n    <p>Your visuals need to do more than look cool. They need to show us how the film <i>feels</i>. That means atmosphere, emotion, vibe — not just what’s fashionable right now.</p>\n    <p><strong>Try this:</strong> one great image per act that captures your world and tone. That’s more effective than a random collection of screenshots that scream “I watched A24’s or Blumhouse’s entire back catalogue this weekend”.</p>\n    <h2>3) The team is all vibes (nooooo!)</h2>\n    <p>This is when the team section says “emerging” or “passionate” … and nothing else.</p>\n    <p>I see this all the time. “We’re a team of emerging voices.” Cool … emerging from where? Into what? Have you made shorts? Been selected for a lab? Directed community work? Shadowed on a set? Got a mentor? Back it up!</p>\n    <p>If you’re new, that’s fine, but give us something real. Otherwise, it reads like filler.</p>\n    <h2>5) No clue who the audience is — or how the hell they’ll see it</h2>\n    <p>Saying, “This story needs to be told,” is nice. But who’s going to watch it? Where? Why?</p>\n    <p>You need <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2022/12/what-do-i-do-if-my-book-or-script-is-a-hard-sell.html\"> a clear sense of audience, platforms, festivals, partners</a> — whatever route you see this project taking.</p>\n    <p>Even if it’s a best guess, that’s better than a shrug.</p>\n    <p>Remember, this isn’t just about making a beautiful film. It’s about making something that connects AND travels.</p>\n    <h2>BONUS PITCH DECK FAIL!</h2>\n    <h2>\n      <strong>6) Your Director’s Statement sounds like a film studies essay</strong>\n    </h2>\n    <p>Cut the waffle. Start with this: <strong>Why YOU? Why now? Why this story?</strong></p>\n    <p>Then build out from there.</p>\n    <p>No one wants to read 500 words on magical realism unless it tells them who you are and what drives you. Get to the heart of it all and fast!!</p>\n    <h2>TL;DR?</h2>\n    <p>Your pitch deck shouldn’t be mysterious, poetic or vague. Avoid these pitch deck fails by ensuring it is …</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Clear</li>\n      <li>Character-driven</li>\n      <li>Audience-aware</li>\n      <li>Rooted in your voice and experience</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Avoid these pitch deck fails and you’ll be miles ahead of the pack. Seriously.</p>\n    <h2>Have you fallen into any of these mega fails?</h2>\n    <p>Don’t be shy — we all have.
