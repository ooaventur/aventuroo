    "body": "<p>We have most of what we think about creativity wrong. So often, we treat it like something to optimize, monetize, or turn into proof of productivity. We rush to measure the end result instead of noticing what the practice itself gives us.<br/>But the real magic of creativity is quieter than that. It’s in the sketch you never show anyone, the scraps of sentences in your notes app, the watercolor that looks nothing like the photo you were copying. There’s such psychological importance to making things for no reason at all. It’s nonperformative creative work—the kind no one else has to see—that builds a life you actually want to live.<br/>Lately, I’ve been writing pieces that don’t leave my hard drive. They exist only for me, and that has been strangely transformative. Making for the sake of making changes how I see the world, how I see myself, and even how I approach the creative work I share publicly.<br/>If you’re craving a spark for your own practice, these four books have been foundational in reminding me why creativity matters and how to return to it with less pressure and more play.</p>\n<p>This book is both memoir and manual, guiding readers through the process of transforming pain into meaning. Jaouad writes about illness and survival, but more importantly, she writes about what it means to create while living inside uncertainty. Her essays and prompts remind me that creativity is less about self-expression and more about self-connection—a way to turn what’s heavy into something that holds light.</p>\n<p>This is the book every writer I know has underlined to death, and for good reason. Lamott’s advice is practical—write a “shitty first draft,” take things one step at a time—but what really sticks is her humor and humanity. She makes the act of writing feel possible, even when you’re staring down a blank page. For me, it’s a reminder that showing up, imperfectly, is the only path forward. I keep it on my desk because simply looking at the cover reminds me to just get something on the page.</p>\n<p>Part memoir, part art, this book is about writing while not writing about writing. It is immersive and sometimes strange, but ultimately really beautiful. Shapton reminds me that my creative practice doesn’t have to fit a mold. It can spill across mediums and categories, and still be deeply resonant. It made me think about my work in a different way, that I didn’t need to make it make sense for it to be worth creating. I feel more permission to experiment in my own work, to let process matter more than product. It is currently difficult to find, thanks to its recent uptick in popularity, but it’s worth waiting for your reissued copy to arrive.</p>\n<p>Rubin strips creativity back to its essence. His reflections are less about “how to make something” and more about “how to notice what’s already here.” This perspective has helped me see clearly again and again. It’s a meditation on coming back to doing, not critiquing. This book is like a gentle but firm hand on the shoulder, reminding you that creativity is not a scarce resource. It’s always available if you’re willing to pay attention. For me, it’s a grounding practice: Return to awareness, and the work will follow. There is an endless well within. I keep it in my nightstand.</p>\n<p>Each of these books reminds me that creativity doesn’t need an audience to matter. In fact, the most meaningful work often happens offstage. It can be scribbles in a notebook, a sketch that no one sees, a story you write just to find out how it ends. That kind of making isn’t about impressing or proving anything. It’s about remembering that you’re a person who creates, and letting that practice feed you in ways the outside world never could.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

This is especially important to me since I love cooking in this space and do it nearly every single day. Over time, I’ve developed a kitchen organization system that isn’t necessarily pretty but that works really well for me.</p>\n    <p>Every single ingredient and piece of cookware in our kitchen has a dedicated place. This includes small appliances, pots and pans, lids, food storage containers, and more. I don’t focus on perfection or making sure every single cabinet and drawer is perfectly organized—I simply make sure everything fits and goes back to its spot once I’m done using it. Things do get a bit unorganized after a couple of months (partially because I’m not the only one using this space), but it takes less than half an hour to fix. In my mind, that means this is a winning organization solution for our family.</p>\n    <p>This rule is most noticeable in our kitchen’s large pantry cabinet. Here, <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/10/pantry-organization-tips/\">I organize every ingredient</a> we have by how I cook. Similar items stay together, such as beans and rice, noodles, cooking oils, and baking ingredients. I also store almost everything in clear containers that allow me to easily see what we have on hand (and know when it’s time to refill ingredients). <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3QCiuoa\">These containers</a> are my favorite! I like to cook through most of what we have in the pantry before restocking, which means every month or two I wipe down the containers, refill them, and clean out whatever has expired. </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Find more details on all of my favorite organization products  in this post.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>We have a baseline level of cleanliness we try to maintain in the kitchen. Even when life is chaotic, it’s very easy to get our kitchen back to a clean and organized state at the end of each day. These are the non-negotiable tasks we do every night (or most nights):</p>\n    <p>We don’t have a perfect track record of completing all of these things every single night—and that’s okay. But I know from experience that if we get at least two or three of them done, it makes a huge difference the next morning when we’re getting out the door for school dropoff.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/04/home-organization-products/\">15 Useful Home Organization Products I Love, Starting at $8</a>\n      <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/03/fridge-organization-system/\">My Fridge Organization System and How It Helps Me Cook Off the Cuff</a>\n      <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/04/best-books-on-organization/\">3 Books That Help Me Better Organize My Home, Time, and Life</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

    "body": "<p>I spent last week in Prince Edward Island with family, and this wasn’t the kind of trip I could have planned on my own. Prince Edward Island has a way of looking simple on the surface (think red roads, green fields, lighthouses), but without insider knowledge, it takes some help to know how to move through it. And for that, I owe a big thank you to my sister (and many of you).<br/>She handled most of the research—digging through maps, blogs, and follower DMs to build out a route that balanced exploration and ease. We traveled with my daughter, tried to avoid overscheduling, and somehow ended up with a weeklong Prince Edward Island itinerary that felt… effortless. I owe that all to my sister!<br/>We stayed in a mix of spots across the island. Charlottetown, Cavendish, and back again, which gave us access to beaches, national parks, and towns without spending hours in the car. Lodging in PEI can be tricky during peak season, but we booked in April/May and stayed flexible. We looked into everything from old inns to seaside cottages to slightly chaotic multi-bedroom Airbnbs.</p>\n<p>I’m sharing what we did, what we loved, and what we’d recommend if you’re planning your own quiet, snack-filled, slow-moving week on the island. You can also reference <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/sYWkvA9AEUbSJYah6\">this map</a> to find the locations and addresses.</p>\n<p><strong>Lodging: </strong><a href=\"https://www.roddvacations.com/hotels/rodd-charlottetown/\">Rodd Charlottetown</a><strong>Location: </strong>Charlottetown<strong>Vibe: </strong>Historic hotel downtown, convenient for walking and adjusting to the slower pace.<br/>We flew in and met up with my sister, who arrived the day before! We stayed downtown for one night to get our bearings and reset before heading toward the coast. This gave us a chance to explore Charlottetown without needing a rental car right away. We did a short walking loop through the city (into some bookstores, of course)—just enough to stretch after travel and see what Charlottetown feels like: a bit coastal, a bit quiet, very charming, and very into lobster.<br/>We tried <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/5YuYyZ8DVoip7wBdA\">The Chip Shack</a> lobster roll, which wasn’t worth writing home about, to be honest. Then we found a table at <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/4P4T7iz9VKkHwLTZ8\">Peakes Quay</a> that had a good kids’ menu, and Bennett ate two plates of chicken strips while we played Sleeping Queens. The area was really fun and full of people on vacation. We stood in a long line to get ice cream at <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/GuABpynAfohPsMox6\">COWS</a> (which was worth it and soon became a nightly ritual for the entirety of the trip). </p>\n<p><strong>Lodging:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vrbo.com/en-ca/cottage-rental/p9951218\">Red Island Getaway VRBO</a><i> </i><strong>Locations: </strong>Charlottetown, Avonlea Village, and Cavendish<strong>Drive Time:</strong> ~45 minutes from Charlottetown to Cavendish<strong>Vibe:</strong> A day of puttering, small finds, and rain that felt kind of cinematic.<br/>We started the day with breakfast at <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/A6VyUrv7Mzn7vXJv8\">The Cork and Cast</a> on Victoria Row, where I had my first of many delicious Caesars (Canada’s version of a Bloody Mary but with a salty, briny twist). Get the breakfast sandwich and the fish cakes.<br/>Then we wandered. The city had a little craft fair set up, so we walked through that, hit a couple of used bookstores, and found one of our favorite trip souvenirs: a hand-carved rabbit driving a carrot-shaped car, handmade by a local brand called Woodypix. My sister got a cat driving a rainbow trout. We were extremely into it. I bought a fish bracelet that I am very into at <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/V8UBqbN6R5y19DU27\">Mrs Peakes Fancy Goods</a>, which was my favorite gift shop in that area. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/08/prince-edward-island-itinerary/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>I’ve long been a lover of thrifting and antiquing—for home decor, furniture, clothing, kids’ toys, and more. While the process may take a little longer, I think it’s well worth the extra time and energy. There are so many high-quality, unique pieces <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2020/12/how-to-seek-out-unique-secondhand-pieces-online/\">to be found secondhand</a>.</p>\n    <p>Over time, I’ve developed a go-to process that helps me navigate the world of thrifting and antiquing with more ease and intention.</p>\n    <p>It’s so helpful to have a list written down before you step foot in a thrift or antique store. This will help you stay focused on the things that will actually add value to your life, and not get distracted by things that will only become extra clutter. In my most recent thrifting trip, I was specifically searching for a new pair of jeans and a white button-up shirt, which helped me hone in my search in the store. I consider a Pinterest board a “list” as well, so if you’re a visual person, that might work for you too.</p>\n    <p>Take a quick lap around the sections where you’re most likely to find what’s on your list. Add things to your cart that catch your attention. Then go back to certain aisles where you think you might find something really specific and want to dig a little deeper. Take a little more time on this second look, because sometimes you might miss things on the first lap.</p>\n    <p>Once you’ve made your way through the store, edit down your cart and return anything to the shelves that you don’t truly need/want. Ask yourself a couple of questions and get specific in your answers.</p>\n    <p>I’ve come across so many great things while thrifting and antiquing, but many of them were items I didn’t actually need at the moment. While the lower price points at many of these stores may be tempting, the reality is that if you don’t edit down what goes in your cart, you’ll probably end up with some things you don’t actually use.</p>\n    <p>The more regularly you go thrifting or antiquing, the better you’ll become at navigating each store and narrowing in on the pieces you really want to bring home. I often like to go to a few stores in one afternoon to make the most of my time. On other occasions, I only have fifteen minutes to spare, so I’ll bop through a store and quickly browse one specific section. Either way, consistency is important when it comes to thrift and antique shopping.</p>\n    <p>Sometimes when I go to a thrift or antique store, I don’t find anything to bring home. That’s okay. You’ll find the items on your list when you find them—you can’t rush the process. Thrifting and antiquing are about the hunt. For me, it’s about finding unique pieces that will bring personality and character to my home or wardrobe. And when I find something I love, it’s well worth the time and effort that may have gone into the search.</p>\n    <p>If you’re going to a thrift store that accepts donations, make the most of your trip and bring something (or a couple of things) to donate when you go.</p>\n    <p>Last but certainly not least: If you can help it, never go thrifting or antiquing on an empty stomach (or thirsty, for that matter). Sifting through aisles and aisles of goods requires energy, and it will be a much more enjoyable experience if you’re satiated beforehand. Trust me on this.</p>\n    <p>Kate is the founder of Wit &amp; Delight. She is currently learning how to play tennis and is forever testing the boundaries of her creative muscle.

I am delighted that my kids love to read too, so we sometimes all sit down and read together at home. It’s become one of those rituals that grounds us. Not without effort, but we’re all more settled into ourselves after we do.<br/>I find a lot of my reading inspiration from people I follow on Instagram, like my sister <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alliearends/\">@alliearends</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/elementstyle/\">@elementstyle</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/brittanychaffee/\">@brittanychaffee</a>. Other recs come from Substacks by great writers (like <a href=\"https://eliseloehnen.substack.com/\">Pulling the Thread</a> by Elise Loehnen) and writers who teach writing (highly recommend <a href=\"https://joshcook.substack.com/\">book(ish)</a> by the brilliant Josh Cook). I look for books that help me see something differently—especially the ones that are quiet, a little strange, or written so beautifully it makes you want to reread a sentence three times.<strong>Today I’m sharing a handful of meaningful reads (around 200 pages or less) that leave you with the quiet sense of,  Oh, this is what life is about. </strong>They’re lovely books to read this summer, or any time of year, for that matter.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>A lyrical meditation on the color blue, grief, desire, and memory.<strong>Why I Love It: </strong>It’s a book you don’t read so much as absorb. Her fragments feel like pieces of a mosaic that, together, make something bigger than the sum of their parts. I return to it when I feel too much or not enough. She says what I am sometimes too afraid to admit to myself.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>Thirty-nine women are imprisoned underground with no explanation. One girl, the youngest of them all, begins to question what else might be possible.<strong>Why I Love It:</strong> It’s eerie and haunting and profound. It made me question everything I thought I knew about identity, freedom, and what it means to be human. I read it twice in one week.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>Set in 1980s Ireland, a coal merchant discovers unsettling truths about a local convent and must decide what kind of man he wants to be.<strong>Why I Love It: </strong>It’s short, sparse, and deeply moving. The kind of book that leaves you with a lump in your throat and a new understanding of quiet courage.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>A raw and intimate diary chronicling the author’s obsessive affair with a younger man.<strong>Why I Love It:</strong> Ernaux doesn’t flinch. The diary is unedited and beautifully written. A portrait of her late 40s, unraveling and itching to self-detonate without apology. She shows you the hunger, the madness, the waiting—and somehow makes it all feel universal.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>A woman refuses to get out of the swimming pool, and in the process, all of the secrets hidden beneath her marriage come out.<strong>Why I Love It: </strong>It’s surreal and sharp, with a thread of humor running through the tension. Reads like a short film. Totally unexpected and totally brilliant.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>A shepherd boy sets out on a journey to find treasure and discovers his personal legend along the way.<strong>Why I Love It:</strong> It’s simple but powerful. A reminder that the answers are often within us—and that the detours are part of the path.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>A dreamlike collection of stories set in a mythical version of the author’s hometown, filled with surreal imagery and poetic prose.<strong>Why I Love It: </strong>Schulz writes like no one else. His stories feel like memories from another life—strange, rich, and a little bit enchanted.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

    "body": "<p>I’ve been thinking about how Joe and I, at our core, share a really deep friendship. Admiration, delight, shorthand jokes, the shebang. But it’s changed over time, as marriages and friendships do. Our kids—whom we love more than words can encapsulate—have become a wedge in some ways. It’s like… we’re co-leads on this high-stakes group project, and we both really don’t want to screw it up. (Spoken as someone with a combined fourteen years of <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2020/10/what-ive-learned-in-10-years-of-therapy/\">therapy</a> under her belt.)<br/>Pressure and structure aren’t ideal conditions for friendship. In this kind of scenario, the sense of lightness, the seeing and being seen, can quietly shrink. We’re in a different phase, one built on resilience, communication, and clarity. But it leaves an opening for closeness that can feel like loss. <strong>We don’t talk about adult friendships like we talk about romantic relationships, but we should. </strong><br/>Because adult friendships can be just as formative and necessary. In many ways, they offer a kind of freedom our romantic or work partnerships can’t. Our friends are not usually directly affected by our decisions, so they can tell us the truth. And if we’re lucky, they delight in us for who we are, not for what we do.</p>\n<p>Lately, I’ve been reaching outside of my marriage for the kinds of friendships that fill in the gaps. I’ve encouraged Joe to do the same. Not in a dramatic or betraying way. We’re just reaching for a connection that nourishes what this busy season of life seems to starve: joy. Spontaneous conversation. Shared curiosity. The kind of love that says, I care about you with no strings attached.<br/>That last part is important.<strong>“No strings attached” means:</strong></p>\n<p>And let’s be honest: A lot of us are so caught up in our own unresolved shit that we’re not even available to be the friend we want.<br/>Friendship, real friendship, is a mirror. But not the shiny kind you hang on the wall. It’s the kind that reflects you back to yourself with love, holding your contradictions without flinching; that reminds you who you are when you forget.<br/>You don’t have to do a lot to keep a friendship alive. You just have to delight in the other person. That’s the key. That’s what we all want. Someone who says, “I see you, and it brings me joy.”<br/>And we can’t just want that—we have to offer it. It doesn’t take big sweeping acts of commitment or even lavish “catch-up” lunches. It takes showing up IN life, rather than sitting on the periphery.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>You don’t have to do a lot to keep a friendship alive. You just have to delight in the other person. That’s the key. That’s what we all want. Someone who says, “I see you, and it brings me joy.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>Cultivating friendships in adulthood doesn’t come naturally to me. It’s something I’ve had to learn slowly, sometimes awkwardly, because it’s also something I’ve deeply longed for. For a lot of my life, I didn’t feel like I had it. Not in the way I craved: mutual, safe, delight-filled. I always felt like I needed to sing and dance my way to connection and safety. <br/>So now, I try to be intentional. I mess up and don’t show up sometimes. But I keep trying. I keep trying to be the friend I want in life. These are a few ways I keep connections alive with friends:</p>\n<p>Sometimes? Friendships change and people drift. Misunderstandings happen. Sometimes things are broken beyond repair. I used to see that as failure. Now I see it as part of being human. When it feels right, I try to repair—reach out, name the hurt, stay open. And when it doesn’t? I let go with love and wish them the best. <strong>Not every friendship lasts forever, but each one teaches you something about who you are and how you love.</strong><br/>You don’t need a big group, perfectly coordinated schedules, or elaborate plans. You just need a few people who make you feel good in your body. Safe in your nervous system. Seen and accepted for who you are.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/06/adult-friendships/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "author": "AventurOO Editorial",
    "body": "<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>LONDON — The Wallace Collection is famous for its trove of Rococo art, such as <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/tag/jean-honore-fragonard/\">Fragonard</a>’s pastel depiction of indulgent flirtation “The Swing” (1767–68), in which a woman with a voluminous skirt kicks a pink slipper into the air with coquettish abandon, closely watched by two male suitors. In his solo exhibition, Grayson Perry responds to these holdings, offering a fever-dream take on Fragonard’s painting in a tapestry entitled “Fascist Swing” (2024). Here, pastels give way to psychedelically bright colors, while the woman’s smiling expression is contorted into a mask of horror. The laughing suitors are also absent — Perry’s protagonist is alone in her mental disintegration. The work depicts a delusion of excess and grandeur much like Fragonard’s, but with a much darker, more frightening tone.</p>\n<p>“Fascist Swing” depicts Perry’s alter ego Shirley Smith, dreamed up for this exhibition as a way to explore both the Wallace Collection and his ideas around gender, class, and mental illness. Smith, Perry tells us, is a working-class Londoner whose mental illness pushed her into “delusions of grandeur,” as the exhibition’s title puts it, leading to a prolonged psychotic breakdown in which she came to believe she was a member of the aristocracy and the rightful heir to Hertford House, the home of the Collection. Smith is based in part on real-life so-called outsider artists who suffered from mental health challenges and delusions, such as Aloïse Corbaz (1886–1964) and Madge Gill (1882–61) — some of whose fascinating works are included at the beginning of the exhibition.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Grayson Perry: Delusions of Grandeur</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Visitors unprepared for Perry’s <i>gesamtkunstwerk</i> approach to this exhibition may be puzzled by this opening room, where the boundary between truth and fiction is bafflingly but effectively blurred. Fictionalized “archival” photographs of and letters by Smith sit beside real documentation of Gill’s activities at the Wallace Collection in the 1940s, with false dates attributed to the former but not the latter, for instance. Unusually, the audio guide is key to entering Perry/Smith’s world; tracks are alternately narrated by Perry and Smith, making for an immersive experience — although it is a shame that Smith is given a caricatured Cockney accent, which creates a lazily stereotyped image of working-class identity. </p>\n<p>The exhibition loosely follows Smith’s life, ending in a quasi-recreation of the bedroom in which she spent her final days. There are some beautiful objects in here, including a cabinet decorated with portraits of women from the Wallace Collection. There is also a piece called “Hospital Queen” (2024), a hand-beaded self-portrait Smith supposedly made during a stay in a mental hospital. This perhaps alludes to our somewhat morbid fascination with such objects. But even though Perry has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/apr/13/grayson-perry-donates-sketch-to-help-mental-health-support-group\">struggled with issues around mental health</a>, his treatment feels a bit flippant. </p>\n<p>Similarly, in “A Tree in a Landscape” (2024), Perry creates a family tree using portrait miniatures from the museum’s collection, labeling each one with a different mental health diagnosis. The caption notes, “We all exhibit some traits that could be pathologized.” Do we? Perry’s analysis feels glib; here, as in his treatment of Smith’s psychosis, he fails to engage with the realities of serious mental illness.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Grayson Perry: Delusions of Grandeur</i>\n    </p>\n<p>This is but one instance of a recurring lack of nuance in some of Perry’s engagements with complex issues. It is evident that he thinks deeply — but not always about the right things in the right places. For instance, “Man of Stories” (2024), a central piece in the exhibition, is a truly (and deliberately) hideous beaded sculpture of a bard-like figure, inspired by “the expert storytellers of the Luba people in central Africa,” according to Perry’s caption. It is not explained why Perry was inspired by this particular culture, or whether the Luba people have any connection to objects held in the Wallace Collection. The caption continues: “One of my ongoing concerns is over-intellectualism in Western culture, so I was fascinated by the idea of a travelling bard.” Is the implication that he is ascribing a desirable non-intellectualism to central African culture? This speaks to me, at best, of a failure to allow viewers to engage with the figure at an intellectual level, and at worst, of exoticism.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1027871/insider-artist-grayson-perry-outsider-alter-ego-wallace-collection/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><i>Cavalier Perspective: Last Essays, 1952-1966</i>(2025) by André Breton, translated by Austin Carder (image courtesy City Lights Books)</p>\n<p>What does Surrealism, a major art movement in the 20th century, have to do with surrealism, a term often used to describe so many uncanny facets of life in the 21st? The word “surreal” was first used in 1917 to describe a ballet choreographed by Jean Cocteau and composed by Erik Satie, with Cubist costumes by Pablo Picasso. Today, it has been used to describe the “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/12/alligator-alcatraz-trump-cruelty\">Alligator Alcatraz</a>” immigrant detention center and the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-04/-it-s-surreal-trump-s-freeze-on-climate-money-sows-fear-and-confusion\">Trump administration’s climate policy</a>. Does the world today merely resemble dreamlike visions by Leonora Carrington and Salvador Dalí? Or is the American mind reaching for a deeper affinity?</p>\n<p>To answer this question, we must turn to André Breton, the architect and apostle of Surrealism. At just 28 years old, Breton <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1006369/the-small-magazines-that-birthed-surrealism/\">established</a> the movement in a 1924 manifesto, where he defined it as manifesting one’s subconscious “in the absence of any control exercised by reason.” His attempt to exert dictatorial powers over this movement would be his undoing, after a caustic Second Surrealist Manifesto in 1929 largely alienated him from his peers for suggesting that he could excommunicate them. But Breton continued to think, write, and speak about Surrealism until his death at age 70. </p>\n<p>In <i>Cavalier Perspective: Last Essays 1952–1966</i>, translated by Austin Carter, an elder Breton appears for the first time in English — gentler, wiser, and far more adept at analyzing the ideological underpinnings of a movement that had ballooned into an international sensation. It’s in these late writings that his ideas about the surreal begin to mingle with our own. </p>\n<p><i>Médium: Communication Surréaliste</i>, which Breton contributed to (image courtesy City Lights Books)</p>\n<p>While it’s now understood instinctively as shorthand for unreality, one of the ironies of Surrealism is that it has never neatly circumscribed a particular style or technique, the way Fauvism or Impressionism once did. In a 1952 essay titled “Link,” Breton explains that this was by design; Surrealism was never meant to simply define an aesthetic. “When I began searching as early as 1936 for the emotional catalyst for Surrealism,” he wrote, “I discovered it right away in the anxiety inherent to a time when human brotherhood was collapsing more and more each day.” He was referring to the period between World Wars, when the “rational” forces of industrial capitalism, fractious nationalism, and global imperialism continued unabated, with violence looming on the horizon again.</p>\n<p>Breton had spent World War I in a neurological ward in Nantes, treating soldiers suffering from what we now understand as PTSD. As poet Garrett Caples writes in his excellent introduction to <i>Cavalier Perspective</i>, Breton “saw firsthand the effects of technologically advanced weaponry on the human psyche” and responded with a system of thought that was both mystical in power and revolutionary in scope. By the 1950s, Breton’s vision of a liberatory anti-rationalism had become fully postcolonial. He hailed France’s Algerian War as “an orgy of crime,” championed the work of Martinican writer Aimé Césaire and Haitian poet Clément Magloire Saint-Aude, and <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2022/07/andre-breton-haiti-revolution-communists-surrealism\">helped foment a student revolution in Haiti</a>.</p>\n<p>In <i>Cavalier Perspective</i>, Breton explores this anti-rationalism as inherently accessible and corrosive to systems of logic that demand conformity and deride creativity. His many short essays of the period championed astrology, Medieval alchemy, games of automatic word association, and emotionally expressive art forms dismissed by mainstream Western institutions as “primitive,” from Celtic poetry to African masks. I was particularly struck by “The Language of Stones,” which suggests that certain polished rocks draw sensitive seekers toward them and may even be imprinted with divine messages. Today, the theory reads like a startlingly familiar concoction of new-age natural mysticism poisoned by a terminally online paranoia that “it’s all connected” — Make America Healthy Again, <i>avant la lettre</i>.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038721/andre-breton-cavalier-perspective-surrealism/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>What’s the opposite of a white cube exhibition? <i> Touch Jamaica</i>, Rejin Leys’s show of paper sculptures set among the period props of a historic home, feels pretty close. The Queens-based Haitian-American artist creates mixed-media work that meditates on displacement due to the climate crisis, political shifts, and the legacy of colonialism. She is also known for the PulpMobile, a paper-making studio she wheels out to public spaces like parks and street fairs for community art-making. Both strains of her work come together in this exhibition featuring relief sculptures of local landmarks — the oldest tree in Jamaica, Queens, architectural details of defunct libraries and theaters —</p>\n<p>\n      <i>at the King Manor Museum, a historic house built by Rufus King, a United States founding father. Taken in this context, these paper works feel like the surface of the densely layered past that is our collective inheritance.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>The King Manor Museum is currently only accessible via guided tours between noon and 4pm, Tuesdays through Saturdays. This creates a unique dynamic: There is no skimming through didactic information here; rather, a staff member — in my case, Hannah — leads you through, room by room. The house itself has been decorated to reflect various periods within its past — an 18th-century room on the first, 19th- on the second — making you feel that you are moving through time. History feels not only alive but in progress: The very person walking with you is currently researching the objects that surround you. It is their archival research that determined the decoration of the library (jaguar pelts, apparently, were all the rage in the 18th century); the reproductions of paintings on the walls (art history lovers will be excited to learn that John Trumbull and Gilbert Stuart painted family members); and, speaking of the anti-white cube, even the color of the paint (plaster painted to look like wood, an original marigold yellow the museum hopes to restore soon).</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Rejin Leys: Touch Jamaica</i>\n    </p>\n<p>It’s fitting, then, that Leys works in paper, a medium so closely associated with archives and record-keeping. In the servants’ preparation room, beside antique muffin tins, dark glass jars, and a weathered wooden storage box, is a thick, pale blue paper sculpture imprinted with some of those very objects. Similar items are strewn around the gallery and the kitchen next door. Between two windows, in a darker blue paper patchwork set against a white wooden armature, for instance, is the imprint of what looks like an arched window with intricate ironwork. Around the corner, also set on a wooden armature, is a cobalt-blue work seemingly cast from a stone monument engraved with the years “1861” and “1865,” the date range of the Civil War.</p>\n<p>Indeed, in this room, it’s impossible to forget that each of us carries a collective history, that no one exists within a vacuum. Hannah, my tour guide, pointed to reproductions of the food that would’ve been available to the house’s early residents: On one side, local items, such as a turkey and potatoes, and on the other, those produced or transported via the labor of enslaved people, such as sugar and lemons. Whereas a white cube induces you to suspend the broader context in favor of the here and now, Leys’s exhibition demands that you see these objects in relation to yourself and the larger world.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Rejin Leys: Touch Jamaica</i>\n    </p>\n<p>I found myself drawn to the formal beauty of the works: the square dimpling and ripped apertures of one piece, the white spatters that dot another midnight blue sculpture like stars. But I felt that I missed Leys’s intention to make present not just the deep past of the 18th and 19th centuries, as represented by this house, and the contemporary, through her objects, but also the many nested layers of history between them. A link included in the exhibition’s didactics takes a viewer to a map of the sites from which Leys drew these impressions, such as a former Queens Public Library, bank, and theater. This information was intellectually engaging, but didn’t penetrate my felt experience; perhaps a Jamaica local might recognize some of these places and be more deeply moved.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038759/rejin-leys-contemporary-art-exhibition-in-an-18th-century-home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Playing on a continuous loop in the Brooklyn Museum’s fifth-floor Moving Image Gallery, which is appointed with nine backless benches, this 55-minute work shares DNA with the artist’s other film and television montages, including his monumental, 24-hour-long film </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>(2010) and</i>\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/55022/six-things-i-learned-and-one-i-didnt-from-christian-marclays-the-clock/\">The Clock</a>\n    <p>\n      <i>(1995), anchored, respectively, in the evolving technologies of time pieces and communication devices.</i>\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.paulacoopergallery.com/exhibitions/christian-marclay2#tab:slideshow\">Telephones</a>\n    <p>In Marclay’s latest mashup, doorways serve as passageways from one scene to the next: When one shuts, another opens, revealing another character in another room and another era. In one sequence, a lone cowboy struts through a wood-paneled space. He grabs a door handle, and a posse of leather-jacketed men exit into a dim apartment hallway. And so the scenes unfold with an air of a surprise, unknowns lurking and morphing behind every door.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/DIG_E_2025_Christian_Marclay_Doors_07_Paula_Abreu_Pita_PS22-General-Use-JPEG-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Christian Marclay: Doors</i>at the Brooklyn Museum</p>\n    <p>As vexing and disjointed as this premise might sound, the painstaking transitions and match cuts create an internal logic and sense of continuity. Sorrow and searching give way to mischievous escapades, peppered with comedy and crime. Fear simmers. Tension builds. Doors slam and squeak open again, leading into well-to-do homes, modest apartments, workplaces, doctor’s offices, and winding corridors. The result is a labyrinthine, imagined architecture that feels, at turns, like one of M.C. Escher’s <a href=\"https://mcescher.com/gallery/impossible-constructions/\">impossible constructions</a> and the product of the Surrealist parlor game <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/terms/exquisite-corpse\">exquisite corpse</a>, with its neatly matched doorways cobbling together a chimera. Even though the actors, setting, and plot specifics shapeshift every few seconds, as if jumping into a different plane of a multiverse tale, the emotional thrust and action create a propulsive through line that coheres the sea of snippets.</p>\n    <p>In <i>Doors</i>, Marclay makes visible the mindless, forgettable actions of life indoors — turning keys in locks, twisting knobs, entering and exiting spaces — while exploring the ways that doors serve as charged metaphors and well-worn cinematic devices and tropes. This congress of clichés could teeter into tedium. But, with a wink and a nod, the precise editing and absurd juxtapositions between the assembled film excerpts toy with perception, flowing like a dream sequence. Doors double as sites of transformation. Space and time warp. Narratives get remixed and reinvented. Nothing is static, and anything could happen in the next scene. In this art film, as in life, the whole story can change course in an instant.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/DIG_E_2025_Christian_Marclay_Doors_04_Paula_Abreu_Pita_PS22-General-Use-JPEG-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Christian Marclay: Doors</i>at the Brooklyn Museum</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/christian-marclay\">Christian Marclay: Doors</a>\n      <i> continues at the Brooklyn Museum (200 Eastern Parkway, Prospect Heights, Brooklyn) through April 12, 2026.

    "body": "<p>We may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article.</p>\n<p>By mid-August, the pull of fall is impossible to ignore. While the temperatures may still say summer, I’ve learned to embrace what we jokingly call a “fall soft launch”—that sweet spot between seasons where small shifts make our home feel instantly cozier. Think of it as a gentle layering process: swapping breezy summer details for textures, scents, and accents that hint at crisp mornings and golden light.</p>\n<p>If you’re ready to ease into autumn without going full pumpkin patch just yet, we’ve curated simple, design-forward ideas that will carry you seamlessly from summer to fall.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=8 Simple Styling Swaps to Take Your Home from Summer to Fall&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/moody-fall-coffee-table-decor-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Switch Up Your Scents</h2>\n<p>Scent has a remarkable power to set the tone of a season. Begin the transition by tucking away summer’s floral and citrus notes in favor of warm, grounding fragrances—woods, spices, and amber. A candle in the entryway or living room creates an inviting atmosphere, while a subtle diffuser in the bathroom offers a refined touch for guests.</p>\n<h2>Shop Fall Scents</h2>\n<p>Casa Zuma</p>\n<p>P.F.

Just like swapping linen for knits, a quick art refresh makes the summer-to-fall transition feel effortless. Frame those vacation photos you’ve been meaning to print, or switch out bright summer art for pieces in moodier tones. It’s an instant vibe shift—and way cheaper than redecorating your whole space.</p>\n<h2>Shop Fall Artwork</h2>\n<p>Hearth &amp; Hand™ with Magnolia</p>\n<p>Threshold™ designed with Studio McGee</p>\n<h2>Prepare Your Kitchen for Cold Weather</h2>\n<p>Nothing says fall like baking pumpkin bread with <i>You’ve Got Mail</i> playing in the background. As the air cools, it’s time to make space for heartier meals and slow-cooked traditions. Bring Dutch ovens and crockpots back into view, refresh dish linens, and tuck away the summer accessories you won’t need until next year.

The summer-to-fall transition is the perfect time to rotate in textiles and decor in richer tones—pillows, throws, and candles in palettes of burgundy, mustard, and deep green. A cohesive color story not only enhances the autumn mood but also carries seamlessly into winter, extending the life of your seasonal styling.</p>\n<h2>Shop fall accents</h2>\n<h2>Go Heavy on the Candles</h2>\n<p>Nothing transforms a space faster than candlelight—and fall is the time to go all in. During the summer-to-fall transition, I bring out taper candles in moody shades and scatter them everywhere: mantels, dining tables, coffee tables, you name it. If flames make you nervous, battery-operated candles give the same cozy glow without the worry. Either way, more is more here—lean into the romance of flickering light.</p>\n<h2>Shop Candles</h2>\n<p>SIN</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-23271969\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCharcoal Twisted Taper Candles\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Set of 2</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Fall shelf styling&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/target-shelf-styling-6-1500x2250-ff10621-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Try Moodier Florals</h2>\n<p>Late August is the perfect moment to rethink your floral arrangements. Trade in vibrant summer blossoms for deeper hues, textural grasses, and sculptural branches. Pampas grass, eucalyptus, and faux stems bring both longevity and sophistication, adding a layer of seasonal color to mantels, entryways, or dining tables. These subtle, earthy arrangements set a grounded, autumnal mood throughout your home.</p>\n<h2>Shop fall florals</h2>\n<p>Abigail Ahern</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://rstyle.me/+jFBQ2WEl32CojI8xaqf00w\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t21.25″ Preserved Golden Yarrow Fall Wreath\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Hearth &amp; Hand™ with Magnolia</p>\n<h2>Cozy Throws and Linen Bedding for a Summer-to-Fall Transition</h2>\n<p>One of the easiest fall transition tips is updating your textiles.

    "body": "<p>I’ve long believed that a happy, healthy life is built on rituals. From your <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/morning-routine/morning-routine-ideas/\">morning routine</a> to your evening wind-down, our days flow with more ease when we anchor them with <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/healthy-daily-habits/\">supportive habits</a>. Rituals cut through decision fatigue and help us weave intention into the everyday. By committing to practices that help us feel our best, we strengthen self-trust—and that reliability becomes a fixture of our days. As a writer, that truth shows itself most in my daily writing rituals.</p>\n<p>Writing is a strange career—part craft, part inspiration. On good days, words spill easily. On others, even a single sentence feels impossible. But my writing ritual is what steadies me. It’s the structure I lean on to move past the blank page and into flow.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Featured image from  our interview with Remi Ishizuka by Michelle Nash.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Woman practicing writing rituals at her desk.&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/writing-rituals/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/janessa-leone-writing-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>What are writing rituals?</h2>\n<p>Writing rituals are the consistent set of steps we take to prepare ourselves before putting pen to paper. While they look different for everyone, writing rituals all serve the same purpose: to feel energized, grounded, and inspired before diving into the work. Sometimes they’re simple; sometimes they’re deeply idiosyncratic. What matters most is that they put us in a headspace with greater freedom to create.</p>\n<p>Think of them as a way to bypass hesitation. When you’ve set the stage—your environment, your mindset, your tools—you can step into writing without overthinking. With fewer variables to wrestle with, you open the door for creative flow.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>History is full of proof that rituals work:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong/>wrote standing at his typewriter, believing the posture helped him stay alert.<a href=\"https://www.timesnownews.com/lifestyle/books/features/ernest-hemingways-stand-up-desk-writing-on-his-feet-and-thinking-on-his-toes-article-113062749\">Ernest Hemingway</a></li>\n      <li><strong/>rented a small hotel room for months at a time, bringing only yellow pads, a dictionary, and a Bible. She needed the quiet separation from home to write.<a href=\"https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2279/the-art-of-fiction-no-119-maya-angelou\">Maya Angelou</a></li>\n      <li><strong/>wrote before dawn, explaining she wanted to “get up before the sun” so the world hadn’t yet placed demands on her.<a href=\"https://gwern.net/morning-writing\">Toni Morrison</a></li>\n      <li><strong/>ended her writing days with a ritual glass of scotch, followed by rereading everything she had written so she could step back in the next morning with confidence.<a href=\"https://lithub.com/on-the-daily-rituals-of-joan-didion-patti-smith-and-more/\">Joan Didion</a></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Each practice is unique, but the principle is the same: consistency creates momentum.</p>\n<h3>Reflection Prompt</h3>\n<p>Before you dive into designing your own writing ritual, pause and ask yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <i>When in the day do I feel most energized?</i>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <i>What spaces or environments make me feel most alive?</i>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <i>What small comforts (music, candle, tea, movement) help me focus?</i>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<p>These questions help you design a ritual that feels natural and inspiring—one you’ll actually want to return to.</p>\n<h2>Writing Rituals to Cultivate for Everyday Inspiration</h2>\n<h3>1. Put Yourself in the Path of Inspiration</h3>\n<p>Many call this “pre-writing,” and while <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-be-creative/\">creativity</a> is often thought of as an inherent trait, I believe it’s an orientation and approach to life. It’s a way of looking at the world with hope and optimism, understanding that every day is an opportunity to amplify the inputs you take in. The best writing doesn’t come from staring at the page—it comes from what you notice and absorb before you sit down.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Try experimenting with simple inspiration rituals like:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Carrying a notebook (or using your Notes app) to capture thoughts before they disappear.</li>\n      <li>Beginning each writing session by free-writing for five minutes about anything that’s on your mind.</li>\n      <li>Reading a poem, essay, or a page of a <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/beautifully-written-books/\">favorite book</a>to spark rhythm and language.</li>\n      <li>Taking a short walk to reset your energy and let ideas rise to the surface.</li>\n      <li>Creating an “inspiration box”: a collection of quotes, images, or snippets of writing that fuel you.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h3>Reflection Prompt</h3>\n<p><i>What practices make me feel most energized to create? Am I more inspired after reading, walking, or spending quiet time alone?</i> Experiment with one practice for a week and see how it shifts your writing energy.</p>\n<h3>2. Habit Stack Your Writing</h3>\n<p>It’s no secret—we love <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/habit-stacking/\">habit stacking</a>. By pairing a desired habit with one you already practice, the behavioral technique makes it easier for you to incorporate and build new rituals into your life. And spoiler: writing can be one of them.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/writing-rituals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I used to think training for a marathon was all about control. You hit your miles, you nail your splits, you stack perfect weeks on top of each other until race day finally arrives. A simple equation: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-wake-up-early/\">discipline in</a>, results out. But life has a way of rewriting the plan, and a few months into training for this race, my dad got sick.</p>\n<p>My dad is quiet but determined, someone who has always measured his life in motion. Mountain biking along the rugged trails near his home in Vermont. Playing hockey three nights a week well into his late 60s. Hiking the Long Trail’s 272 miles from Massachusetts to Canada. Moving his body has always been his way of making himself known to others. So it feels like a particular kind of loss that cancer has taken that away.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Featured image from  our interview with Sanne Vloet by Michelle Nash.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>This summer, the one that’s seen him moving through rounds of radiation and chemo, has been heavy with guilt. A constant tug-of-war. When I’m training, I feel like I should be with him. When I’m with him, I feel like I should be training. I’m trapped in this exhausting narrative of <i>shoulds</i>—never fully where I am, never enough of anything. And sometimes, if I’m honest, I feel selfish. Chasing a finish time, a personal best, when his body is fighting for something far more essential.</p>\n<p>Every missed run felt like a strike against me, each skipped workout a reminder that the neat, color-coded plan I’d taped to my fridge was unraveling. I told myself I’d lost my shot at a 3:30 marathon. But somewhere between the late nights at my dad’s house and the early mornings I ran anyway, something shifted. I started to see my training for the Chicago marathon less as a performance and more as a practice—a small act of steadiness I could return to, even when everything else was falling apart. The miles became less about proving myself and more about carrying myself through.</p>\n<h2>Letting Go of Perfect</h2>\n<p>When I first typed my marathon training plan in the Notes app of my phone, I believed in it like scripture. 16 weeks in neat little boxes, promising that if I showed up, I’d get what I wanted: 3 hours and 30 minutes. I loved the clarity. So much of life resists control, but here was something that said: if you just do A, you’ll get to B.</p>\n<p>In the first weeks, I lived inside that plan. Early mornings, long runs that stretched into weekends, little victories when I nailed my paces. I felt like someone who could follow through, who could be counted on. Maybe the rest of my life could feel like that too—organized, predictable, clean.</p>\n<p>Spoiler: nope. The body doesn’t always respond the way you want it to. Neither does life. I missed runs when my dad’s health needed me elsewhere, and when I came back, the training plan no longer looked like a map—it looked like a ledger of failure. I could feel the time slipping, that 3:30 finish pulling further out of reach.</p>\n<p>But even in those messy, uneven weeks, I kept running. Not perfectly, and not according to plan. Just forward.</p>\n<h2>The Quiet Lessons Between the Miles</h2>\n<p>Some runs were little more than a shuffle. After nights in the hospital, my legs felt like lead, my chest tight with worry. Even then, there was relief in the rhythm. The stale hospital air would still cling to me, but the first gulp of fresh air outside felt like oxygen for both of us. I often thought my dad would give anything to trade places—out of the fluorescent rooms, into the cool morning, breathing alongside me.</p>\n<p>Other mornings, the road surprised me with grace. The air cool before dawn, the sky breaking open in pink. Runs like that felt like gifts. My chest loosened, my thoughts slowed. For a little while, I could just breathe.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/marathon-training/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>We may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article.</p>\n<p>I have lived in rented homes all of my adult life. In my early 20s, I didn’t think it was worth the effort to personalize a rental. (This was a temporary space, so why bother?) Over time, however, I realized I didn’t feel relaxed or at ease in my home. The beige walls, overhead lighting and thrown-together <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/furniture-for-small-spaces/\">furniture</a> and decor I had left me feeling unsettled. Learning how to turn my rented apartment into a home was the beginning of my love affair with interior design.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Featured image from  our interview with Radhi Devlukia Shetty by Michelle Nash.</i>\n    </p>\n<h2>10 Interior Design Tips for Renters</h2>\n<p>Through trial and error, I’ve discovered that living in a rental doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice style or a personalized space just because you don’t own your home. There is so much you can do—from <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-2024-paint-color-trends/\">paint</a> and wallpaper to upgrading fixtures and lighting. Ahead, I’ve rounded up the best interior design tips for renters from my personal experience in turning beige boxes into warm and stylish homes. </p>\n<h2>Paint</h2>\n<p>Rental walls usually come in a safe, neutral beige which may appear… well, a bit boring. The best interior design tip for renters I can give is to love up on your walls. Give them a makeover by adding a bit of color or by choosing a neutral that suits you better. Even taking your walls from a beige to a crisp white will brighten up your space significantly. Most landlords have no problem with paint as long as you’re willing to paint the walls back to the original color once you move out, or they may even let you keep it.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite things to paint is the interior of my front door. My current landlord, as well as my previous one, said I can leave it as is when it’s time to move out. I love pink, so my front door is Sherwin-Williams Coral Perfection. It’s a delightful pop of color that makes me smile every time I look at it. Plus, it makes our entryway is cheery and inviting. The whole project was less than $20—proving that paint is an affordable way to make a big impact in your space.</p>\n<h2>Peel-and-Stick Products</h2>\n<p>A round-up of interior design tips for renters wouldn’t be complete without giving peel-and-stick a major shout-out. Peel-and-stick is incredible for renters, since they’re temporary solutions for bigger projects that would normally require renovation. Here are a few of my favorites.</p>\n<h3>Peel-and-stick wallpaper</h3>\n<p>If painting is a no-go, peel-and-stick wallpaper is an excellent option for zhuzhing up your walls. I am a huge fan of adding peel-and-stick wallpaper anywhere your heart desires. Create a statement wall in your <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/cozy-living-room-ideas/\">living room</a> or make your powder room pop with a bold color or pattern. I’ve added peel-and-stick wallpaper to my kitchen, my laundry room, and most recently in my home office.</p>\n<p>Wallpaper has completely transformed these spaces, and I couldn’t be more pleased with how they’ve turned out. Plus, removal is a breeze—I’ve had no wall damage when I’ve removed peel and stick wallpaper. There are tons of installation YouTube videos you can watch, but I will say from personal experience that it’s not <i>quite</i> as easy as it looks. Don’t be afraid to hire a TaskRabbit or wallpaper pro to get the job done!</p>\n<h3>Peel-and-stick floor tile</h3>\n<p>Renter floors can range anywhere from vinyl to tile to even hardwood. Peel-and-stick floor tile now makes it possible for renters to update their floors in a temporary and affordable way. I’ve never tried them myself, but peel-and-stick floor tiles look fantastic in a kitchen or powder room. They can make an outdated floor feel current without costing a ton as well.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/interior-design-tips-for-renters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Perhaps it’s all the extra time I’ve spent in Austin these last few weeks where the air is still humid and the sun is shining extra bright, but the last thing I’m thinking about is pumpkins. Instead, I’m fully embracing sweet summer watermelon and juicy tomatoes while drinking crisp iced bevies on the patio. The markets are still brimming with <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/late-summer-recipes/\">summer produce</a>, and I’m determined to enjoy it all while it lasts.</p>\n<p>Two ingredients that I’ve neglected this summer are the humble squash and zucchini. Both staples of summer, I feel like they often get relegated to roasted or grilling as a side to whatever the main course is, but I often forget that they can be eaten fresh as well. The flavor leans somewhere between fresh with a slight bite that I think is the perfect ode to the warmer months. And because they are the perfect blank canvas, they make for a delicious pairing to other summer flavors that I absolutely love. This zucchini ribbon salad is how I’m embracing the last few weeks of summer.

I totally get it! But I’m also convinced I can make you a convert. There are a few things to keep in mind to make this salad delicious.</p>\n<p>First, use a vegetable peeler for extra-thin ribbons of both zucchini and squash. Not only does this help create those beautiful ribbons, but it also removes some of the thick, chewy texture that you would otherwise deal with if you were just cutting the squash into rounds. When sliced this way, the ribbons are thin with just the slightest crunch that makes it feel closer to a ribboned cucumber.</p>\n<p>If you still don’t want to eat the veggies raw, I would recommend VERY quickly blanching the ribbons in boiling water, then adding to an ice bath. You don’t want to make the ribbons soggy, so a quick dunk and shock will keep that fresh crispness while giving the squash and zucchini a quick cook.</p>\n<p>Balancing textures is what makes this zucchini ribbon salad shine.

Before you dismiss this as <i>just your body’s</i> <i>normal behavior</i>, let’s pause. Your gut could be the culprit. This powerful bodily system does more than digest food. It influences your entire well-being. If you’re tired of <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/foods-for-gut-health/\">digestive discomfort</a>, unpredictable energy levels, and unexplained health woes, it’s time to make a change. And good news: drastic measures aren’t the answer—incorporating a few simple gut health habits <i>is</i>. Let’s dive into the daily practices that will keep you (and your gut) thriving.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=The Gut Health Secrets Your Nutritionist Wishes You Knew&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/gut-health/gut-health-habits/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/best-matcha-smoothie-865x1178.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Gut Health: It’s Not Just a Trendy Topic</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/foods-for-gut-health/\">Gut health</a> isn’t just a buzzword. It’s fundamental to our vitality, and our quality of life <i>depends</i> on it. Gut health is a key player in everything from nutrient absorption and mood stability to <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-balance-hormones/\">hormone balance</a> and cognitive function. Without a healthy gut, a slew of chronic illnesses come knocking—<a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-stop-feeling-bloated/\">digestive disorders</a>, weakened immunity, and more. If you want to protect your longevity (and improve all areas of your well-being!), hone in on your gut health. It’s never mattered more than now.</p>\n<h2>Signs of a Healthy Gut</h2>\n<p>So, how can you tell if your gut is in good shape?</p>\n<h3>Regular (and comfortable) digestion</h3>\n<p>One of the most apparent signs of a healthy gut is rhythmic, pleasant digestion. What this means: you’re having <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-often-should-you-poop/\">bowel movements</a> at least once a day <i>without</i> straining or discomfort. Stools should be well-formed and easy to pass, typically resembling the shape and consistency of a smooth, soft log.</p>\n<h3>Minimal gastrointestinal symptoms</h3>\n<p>A healthy gut typically experiences minimal <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/grain-free-diet-gut-health/\">gastrointestinal symptoms</a>. This includes the absence of chronic issues—bloating, gas, abdominal pain, constipation, or diarrhea. Of course, occasional mild symptoms are normal, but frequent or severe discomfort may indicate an imbalance.</p>\n<h3>Good energy levels</h3>\n<p>As mentioned, the gut plays a crucial role in <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/foods-for-gut-health/\">nutrient absorption</a>. When it’s functioning well, your body efficiently absorbs the nutrients it needs, leading to sustained energy levels throughout the day. Chronic fatigue or low energy can sometimes be linked to poor gut health.</p>\n<h3>Strong immune system</h3>\n<p>A significant portion (as in, <a href=\"https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/want-to-boost-immunity-look-to-the-gut#:~:text=70%25%20of%20the%20immune%20system,where%20diverse%20bacteria%20is%20best.&amp;text=You%20likely%20know%20that%20what,energy%20level%20throughout%20the%20day.\">over 70%</a>!) of your immune system is located in the gut. If you rarely get sick and recover quickly when you do, it’s a sign that your gut microbiota is healthy—and for that matter, effectively supporting your immune defenses.</p>\n<h3>Healthy skin</h3>\n<p>Did you know a balanced gut microbiome can help reduce inflammation and improve skin conditions? Clear, healthy skin (without chronic issues like <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/acne-diet-plan/\">acne</a>, eczema, or rosacea) indicate a healthy gut.</p>\n<h3>Stable mood</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4367209/\">Current research</a> highlights the <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/stress-and-gut-health/\">gut-brain axis</a>—the connection between gut health and mental health. In essence, a healthy gut contributes to stable moods and better mental health. If you experience infrequent mood swings, anxiety, or depressive symptoms, it’s a sign that your gut microbiota is balanced.</p>\n<h3>Few food sensitivities</h3>\n<p>A thriving gut often has fewer food sensitivities and intolerances. If you can eat a wide variety of foods without experiencing adverse reactions, it suggests your gut is well-balanced and your digestive system is functioning properly.</p>\n<h2>Symptoms of an Unhealthy Gut</h2>\n<p>On the flip side, do you notice stomach pain after eating, often feel sluggish, and experience acne flare-ups after noshing on <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/low-glycemic-sugar-alternatives/\">sugar</a>? These are all signs of an impaired gut. Once you’re aware of these symptoms, you can take the first step toward better digestive health.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/gut-health/gut-health-habits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>When you hear the stats on the new AVA Resort Cancun, a certain kind of skepticism is natural. With over 1,600 rooms, it is, by any definition, a truly massive property. For seasoned travelers, “massive” can often be a code word for long lines, impersonal service, and that dreaded “burn and churn” mentality where you feel more like a number than a guest.</p>\n<p>We at<a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/\"> Travel Off Path</a> have visited our fair share of mega-resorts, so we went to check out the property with a healthy dose of skepticism, fully expecting to experience some of these big-resort growing pains.</p>\n<p><strong>We were wrong.</strong> In fact, we were completely surprised.</p>\n<p>The AVA Resort Cancun is that rare unicorn in the world of hospitality: a mega-resort with the intimate soul and vibrant heartbeat of a boutique hotel. Its ability to deliver on both epic scale and personalized service is nothing short of remarkable, and it has immediately established itself as a top-tier contender in the luxury all-inclusive space.</p>\n<p>The true genius of the AVA and the secret to its unique vibe can be found on its main level. Everything—and we mean <i>everything</i>—is located on one magnificent, air-conditioned indoor promenade that stretches for over half a mile along the entire length of the resort.</p>\n<p>This brilliant design choice solves the single biggest problem that plagues other giant resorts: navigation. Gone are the days of deciphering confusing maps, getting lost on winding outdoor paths, or waiting ten minutes for a golf cart just to get to dinner. At AVA, every restaurant, bar, shop, and activity entrance is right there on the promenade. It’s the central nervous system of the resort, making it unbelievably easy to get your bearings.</p>\n<p>But it’s more than just convenient. This layout creates an incredible, dynamic energy. In the evening, the promenade comes alive. You can stroll from a high-end cocktail bar to a chic boutique, grab a scoop of authentic gelato, listen to the music spilling out of a restaurant, and window-shop, all in climate-controlled bliss. It feels like the vibrant Royal Promenade of a luxury cruise ship, but on a much grander and more luxurious scale. It encourages exploration and allows you to bar-hop and people-watch, creating a sense of community and excitement that is simply missing from other resorts where amenities are scattered across acres of land.</p>\n<p>While the AVA is conveniently located just 10 minutes from the airport, it is not in the bustling Hotel Zone. The trade-off for this relative isolation? An absolutely staggering array of on-site activities that makes it almost impossible to get bored. You could genuinely spend a full week here and not experience everything the resort has to offer. The list is almost overwhelming:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>For the thrill-seeker:</strong>A full-scale laser tag arena, a state-of-the-art arcade with racing simulators, and even a multi-room escape room experience.</li><li><strong>For the family (or kids at heart):</strong>A sleek, modern bowling alley that feels more like a private lounge.</li><li><strong>For the evening:</strong>A stunning, professional-grade theater hosting nightly shows and entertainment.</li><li><strong>For practical needs:</strong>A collection of chic shops, a “tienda” for sundries and snacks, and a well-stocked pharmacy.</li></ul>\n<p>This is all before you even step outside.</p>\n<p>The outdoor space at AVA is just as impressive as the interior. A series of absolutely giant pools stretches across the entire oceanfront length of the property, meaning you are never far from a place to cool off. And for anyone who has experienced the dreaded 6 AM “towel game” at other resorts, you can breathe a sigh of relief. There are literally thousands of comfortable lounge chairs available at all hours of the day. Finding a great spot is never a problem.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/ava-resort-cancun-review-this-massive-new-resort-actually-has-a-heartbeat-vibe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>\n      <strong>By David Sydney</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>It had to happen some time and some place. Who knew the bizarre quantum entanglement would occur in Mel’s small, disordered bathroom with its cracked mirror and wet towels? Mel reused his towels until they were thoroughly soaked. Only then would he put them in his dryer, which sounded like a threshing machine.</p>\n    <p>All the fundamental particles composing Mel suddenly, almost miraculously, and for reasons unknown, arranged themselves into the form of a Minotaur in the mirror. Entanglement between someone like Mel and a mythological creature will occur ultimately in this universe, given enough throws of the quantum dice. It just so happened to be on that Thursday.</p>\n    <p>So, Mel looked into his mirror and saw, blinking back, a gruesome, enraged bull’s head, salivating onto its massive, human chest.</p>\n    <p>And the Minotaur, from the other side of the mirror, attached to Mel’s inexpensive wallboard, saw something, well, he saw Mel. The creature’s eyes dilated. One moment, it had been in a dark, dank Labyrinth, waiting for its next sacrificial victim. And the next, as it stared into the mirror, it saw an off-kilter face, barely covered with ineffective shaving cream, grimacing from the cuts of a dull disposable razor. Why hadn’t he disposed of it at least a week before? And what kind of torn underwear was Mel wearing?</p>\n    <p>Few things in this universe are as fearsome as a Minotaur. Few, as monstrous or as vicious. Everyone fears the Minotaur. If you were up against a T-Rex or a MInotaur, which would you choose? The T-Rex would be my choice—there’s a much better chance of survival.</p>\n    <p>By nature, the Minotaur is violent. Extremely so. It subsists on victims sacrificed to it. Staring into the mirror—that is, into the labyrinth—Mel saw partially decomposing carcasses and whitening bones. He worked in his Uncle Leo’s coin-operated laundromat. The Labyrinth and the supply room of the laundromat were remarkably similar. Sacrificial bodies are one thing. But how about his Uncle’s mops, leaky buckets, solidified bleach packets, and broken laundry carts?</p>\n    <p>Mel’s shaving cream was as cheap as his razors. His Uncle didn’t pay much. The best way to learn, to get anywhere in this world, Uncle Leo claimed, was to start by working at the bottom for dirt wages. The whole point of a coin-operated laundromat, according to his Uncle, was to get rid of dirt.</p>\n    <p>Even though Mel had rubbed some shaving cream into his eyes— he was that kind of shaver — he could see that the Labyrinth was a dirty place. It’s one thing to nick yourself with a dull blade, to bleed into an inexpensive lather. It’s another thing to come eye to eye with a Minotaur.</p>\n    <p>Yet the Minotaur and the labyrinth seemed a kind of relief from the customers and unwashed laundry at his Uncle’s place. Mel had another day of mopping floors ahead of him. The Labyrinth? He’d dealt with dirt like that plenty of times.</p>\n    <p>And the Minotaur?</p>\n    <p>Well, a lot of coin-operated laundry customers might as well have bull heads. They are pathology attached to their dirty clothes. They are the epitome of tough customers.</p>\n    <p>Had the Minotaur been up against anything like this, however? That is, Mel? And the bathroom? It was shocking to see Mel’s face blinking back at it, squinting to get a better look. And there on the floor, the wet towels.</p>\n    <p>They were quantumly entangled, yet it was the Minotaur that felt like peeing itself.</p>\n    <p>Mel, who often felt like peeing himself at the laundromat, was comfortable gazing about the labyrinth.</p>\n    <p>The Minotaur had never witnessed anything like Mel, lathered up, blinking, shaving so erratically, yet smiling oddly.</p>\n    <p>It was the Minotaur who looked disturbed. The Minotaur who drew back from Mel. The Minotaur who didn’t want to pee itself yet didn’t like the looks of Mel’s toilet either.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://flashfictionmagazine.com/blog/2025/09/03/mels-bathroom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Sadie peered out over the sea, cradling an icy flask between stiff fingers. The dock was fluffy with frost. She sat, settling herself into the frozen crystals. Chipped black nail polish flaked off as she fiddled with the flask’s top. Her dad used to unscrew the lid with one hand, celebrating another successful crab haul as he burst through the front door. Sadie would get an oxygen-depleting bear hug, and her mom, a bristly mustache kiss. He’d tip back a swig of whiskey and do a little dance. Sadie would roll her eyes, but eventually join in, feet jigging and arms swinging.</p>\n<p>She let her snow boots swing, their heavy soles knocking old pavement salt into the shallows below. The sharp smell of brine drifted in as the tides pulled out, the whole wind-bitten inlet stained the dingy gray of late winter.</p>\n<p>When she’d left the house that morning, backpack on, AP English homework unfinished, and mussy clothes thrown together, her mom—disheveled damp hair and trembling hands pawing at one another, jittery from too much coffee—had chased her halfway down the walk with a heavy coat and waterproof pants.</p>\n<p>“Mom, I’m fifteen, not five.”</p>\n<p>“It’s supposed to snow this afternoon,” her mom said, shoving Sadie’s arms into the sleeves.</p>\n<p>Sadie had acquiesced, mostly to avoid her mother’s clingy anxiety, but also to keep hidden the flask she’d stolen from her dad’s office.</p>\n<p>She’d walked right past her high school and toward the marina, where her dad’s ship was notably absent. Today would have been the annual “Sadie picks which crab they eat for dinner” day.</p>\n<p>She adjusted her position on the chilly dock, trying to work a little blood back into her thighs as she unscrewed the flask. Staring at the empty berth that used to house the S. S. Sadie, she took a sip. The liquid was so cold it gnawed at her insides, little permafrost punctures against the esophagus.</p>\n<p>That first winter storm, the one that had swallowed his ship in open water, had brought the bitter scream of winds and a colossal ice storm. Sadie remembered how beautiful it had all been, the whole town encased in a brilliant slick of shimmer. She hadn’t even thought to be scared, to worry Dad would be navigating his crabbing ship in the icy dark. She’d stayed up to watch the stars reflect in the thick glaze.</p>\n<p>The call came in the early hours. Jerked awake by her mom’s anguish—a cry that cracked the ice along the window panes—Sadie shot downstairs to find her crumpled on the ground, phone in her lap, horror etched in every wrinkle that bunched around her eyes.</p>\n<p>“He went down with the ship,” was all Mom could say. Sadie collapsed, folding herself inside her mother’s broken form, trying to burrow her way back to the beginning. Back to a childhood full of morning laughter over buttered toast, and board games that stretched past bedtime.</p>\n<p>Sadie took another sip from the flask. She slid down, lying on her back and staring at the heavy clouds poised to unleash their innumerable flurries. Seagulls spun lazily overhead. Her memories sailed in and out, some from last summer when splinters threatened her bare feet as she and Dad raced to the end of the marina and threw themselves into the bay. She remembered splashing back out with a yelp when he yelled, “Shark!”</p>\n<p>He’d told Mom over dinner how gullible their daughter was, to which Sadie aimed a few peas in his direction.</p>\n<p>Now there were just quiet meals for two, avoiding each other’s eyes, in a house much emptier. Who knew Dad had taken up that much space?</p>\n<p>A pelican joined the seagulls with their endless cow-cow-cow calls. The bigger bird rose and fell in the thermals that edged the ocean. Dad had always loved pelicans.</p>\n<p>Footsteps sounded from the earth-bound portion of the dock, but Sadie didn’t care if one of the crabbers saw her. They’d understand.</p>\n<p>“Your dad tried to get me to call you Pelly, you know.” Her mom’s voice drifted in.</p>\n<p>Sadie launched upright.</p>\n<p>“Can you imagine? Pelly Lacrelly?” She snorted.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://flashfictionmagazine.com/blog/2025/09/02/pelican/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>By Michelle Rogers</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The dragon slayer stood over his kill, breath heaving, the sword’s edge still glowing with heat. The beast lay still, wings half-folded, smoke curling from its nostrils. <i>One more, and it’s done.</i> That’s what the High Mages had told him. One more and the curse would be broken.</p>\n<p>The acrid stench filled Ronan’s lungs, but the fire beneath his skin burned hotter, molten metal coursing through his veins. Once an extension of himself, the sword’s hilt felt strange—too smooth, too light. A shiver ran down his spine despite the warm air. The wind carried distant voices, though no one was there. He flexed his fingers, the skin at his knuckles rougher, darker. His nails—no, claws—caught the firelight. The changes were coming faster now. He had to finish this before—</p>\n<p>“Ronan.”</p>\n<p>Lyra’s voice was quiet, but it anchored him. He turned to her, his guide, the woman who had led him unerringly to every dragon, yet always hesitated at the final strike. She stood motionless, her amber eyes shadowed.</p>\n<p>“We’re close,” he said, sheathing his sword. His armor, crafted to fit perfectly, now pinched against his spine. “One more, and it’s over. The curse will end. I will be human again.”</p>\n<p>“And what then?” Her voice was careful. “What does that mean?”</p>\n<p>“It means I win,” he said firmly. “It means dragons are finally gone.”</p>\n<p>She hesitated, gaze flicking to his hands. “Have you seen what’s happening to you?”</p>\n<p>He scoffed. “Battle scars. Everyone changes in war. It will go away when the curse is lifted.” He forced a grin, reaching for her hand. “You won’t have to worry about this in your future husband. I’ll be just as I was before.”</p>\n<p>She didn’t move. The firelight traced the tension in her shoulders. “The Mages didn’t lie to you.” Her voice softened. “Kill the last dragon, and you will be free of this.”</p>\n<p>Relief flickered in his chest, but something in her tone held him still. “Then why do you look at me like that?”</p>\n<p>She exhaled slowly, her expression shifting from sorrow to resolve. “Because I am the last one.”</p>\n<p>The world lurched beneath him. He took a step back, the ground unsteady. “No. That’s not possible.”</p>\n<p>Lyra closed her eyes, exhaling softly. When she opened them, the illusion fell away. Golden scales shimmered under the moonlight, her pupils narrowing into slits—familiar eyes, ones he’d seen fade into death a dozen times before.</p>\n<p>His sword was in his hands before he could think. “You led me to them? Your own kind?”</p>\n<p>“Some deserved it.” Her voice carried sorrow. “The ones who razed your village—I helped you find justice. But each death changed you. I tried to slow our hunt, to give you time to see it.”</p>\n<p>The sword trembled in his grip. The final dragon, the last one to be slain, stood before him. He clenched his fists, his breath sharp, uneven. His whole life, dragons had been monsters. He had vowed to rid the world of their kind, and now—</p>\n<p>Now she stood before him. Not a beast, not an enemy. The woman he loved. The one who had saved him, guided him, stayed at his side when no one else had.</p>\n<p>He remembered their nights by the fire, her laughter filling the spaces between his grief. The warmth of her voice when she spoke of the stars. The way she was always there to help him chase away the nightmares.</p>\n<p>“If you kill me,” she said, voice steady, “you go back to who you were. A man. A slayer. A hero. If you don’t—”</p>\n<p>“I stay like this,” he finished, throat tight. “I remain trapped between the worlds of man and beast.”</p>\n<p>Silence stretched between them, thick as smoke. His hands trembled. The sword had never felt heavier.</p>\n<p>She exhaled. “No. It will continue. You’re already more dragon than human. You feel it, don’t you? The way fire didn’t burn you. The way your senses sharpened after each hunt. The way you know what I’m thinking before I say it.”</p>\n<p>Ronan swallowed hard. He had ignored it, pushed the thoughts aside like battle fatigue. But the truth settled into his bones now.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://flashfictionmagazine.com/blog/2025/08/31/the-last-hunt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Ranard</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>When I go, he would tell her, I want to go fast, and one sunny fall morning, as he’s jogging around the lake, his wish comes true. He’s gone before he hits the ground.</p>\n    <p>With her daughter’s help, she sells the house and moves into Sunrise. He would have hated everything about the place (beginning with the name: “Sunrise?” she could hear him say. “Give me a break. Call it what it is, for Christ’s sake—Sunset”). But she discovers, to her surprise, that she actually likes it: three meals a day, housekeeping, and, for the first time in years, a social life. It’s like being in a co-ed college dorm (well, a co-ed dorm where the girls outnumber boys three to one).</p>\n    <p>~</p>\n    <p>There are two wings—assisted living and memory care (referred to in hushed tones as “the other place” by assisted-living residents)—and, with her increasingly iffy memory, she is a probational resident of assisted living.<br/>Soon there are serious lapses in memory. One evening her daughter visits to find her more than a little tipsy. “I jush had my usual one glash,” she insists. It takes her daughter a while to figure out what had happened. She’d had her usual one glass of white wine before dinner—four times, going through the whole bottle.</p>\n    <p>After that her daughter makes sure there’s never more than one mini-bottle in the refrigerator.</p>\n    <p>~</p>\n    <p>She weeps when she’s told she has to move to “the other place.” But after a few days there, she seems fine. Or maybe she’s forgotten the previous place.</p>\n    <p>~</p>\n    <p>Most of the time her daughter is her daughter. But sometimes her daughter is her sister—the twin sister who died in a car accident at thirty. And every now and then her daughter is a stranger.</p>\n    <p>The day will come when she’ll wake from a dream and look up at her daughter, sitting in a chair next to the bed, and say, “Mom? Is that you?”</p>\n    <p>~</p>\n    <p>She points at the photo in the silver frame on her bureau and asks who he is. “That’s Daddy,” her daughter says. “Your husband.”</p>\n    <p>It takes her a moment to take in both of these things—Daddy, husband. Then she says, “He’s very handsome. Did l love him? Were we happy?”</p>\n    <p>“You were very happy,” her daughter says. That’s not entirely true, but it’s more true than untrue. She smiles, happy to learn that she was happy.</p>\n    <p>Then, because it’s a nice day, they go outside, where she enjoys, once again for the first time, the beautiful grounds.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://flashfictionmagazine.com/blog/2025/08/29/after-he-goes-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I have found the house to be satisfactory in most ways. It is a gentleman's residence of modest scale but of sound construction, situated upon a rise of land overlooking the vale, with generous southern exposure and a fine if somewhat neglected garden. The walls are of good plaster, and the windows let in a quality of light that flatters the dust. I have lived here since Michaelmas, and although the surrounding village is not known for its society, I have had few complaints. The quietude is welcome. After the tiresome complications of town life, I had longed for silence.\n</p>\n<p>Yet silence is a more demanding companion than one might suppose.\n</p>\n<p>It began, I think, sometime in late April, though I could not name the precise day. A curious sound, faint at first, like the soft scuffle of fingernails behind the mantelpiece in the study. I had recently arranged the furniture there to my liking and taken to spending afternoons reading in the armchair near the hearth. The fire had been let out weeks before; the days had warmed. But the noises persisted... scratching, fluttering, and on occasion, a low chirring, as if something winged and half-dreaming had made a home in the dark hollows of the wall.\n</p>\n<p>I suspected birds.\n</p>\n<p>Indeed, when I climbed the narrow stair to the upper rooms and leaned out the window just above the chimney, I caught sight of a clutch of twigs protruding from the bricks like a dry bouquet. Sparrows, no doubt, or perhaps starlings. I had read that such creatures favored crevices in warm stone during the spring months.\n</p>\n<p>My first instinct was to write to Mr. Chilton, the groundsman, to have him investigate the flue and make the necessary removals. But there was something strangely companionable in the presence of those birds. The sound of their industry was, in its way, a kind of music. It reminded me of childhood mornings in my aunt's country house, where swallows nested in the rafters. Their comings and goings had delighted us then, a token of continuity and season.\n</p>\n<p>I told myself that they would soon be gone. Birds are fickle. The fledglings would fly, the nest would decay, and the house would again be mine.\n</p>\n<p>Yet as days passed, the activity behind the wall only increased. Not merely a pair, but an entire brood had taken residence. I could hear the rustle of wings, the mewling cries of young. At night, they fell silent, but each morning resumed their duties with tireless resolve. They became, in effect, my tenants.\n</p>\n<p>It occurred to me to mention the matter to Miss Wetherall, my housekeeper. She is a thin and precise woman, not given to sentiment. When I described the birds and their dwelling place, she frowned.\n</p>\n<p>\"It is not well, sir, to let such things go. They bring mites. Droppings. And worse, sir, they invite decay. Shall I have Giles come up with a broom and a hook to dislodge them?\"\n</p>\n<p>I demurred. Something about her severity unnerved me.\n</p>\n<p>\"No,\" I said. \"It is not urgent. Let them be.\"\n</p>\n<p>But she looked at me then with a certain hardness. \"As you wish, sir. But such allowances breed disorder.\"\n</p>\n<p>And so, the matter rested... for a time.\n</p>\n<p>That week, a friend visited from Oxford, Mr. Calloway, a botanist of good humor and little concern for propriety. He took one turn about the house, inspected the roses, declared the soil too acidic, and remarked upon the ivy with suspicion. When I told him about the birds, he raised an eyebrow.\n</p>\n<p>\"Charming,\" he said, but without conviction. \"Though if they're in the wall, best not let it stand. They'll ruin your chimney.\n</p>\n<p>\"Still,\" he added after a pause, \"some noise is preferable to none, I suppose.\"\n</p>\n<p>He stayed the night, and in the morning, said nothing more.\n</p>\n<p>But the sound grew louder.\n</p>\n<p>By early May, the fledglings had hatched. I heard them all day now, crying out with ceaseless hunger. Sometimes the wall thudded, faintly but unmistakably. I began to dream of wings, of flutters behind my chair, of shadows shifting behind the fireplace.\n</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/09/a-nesting-above-mantel-by-zary-fekete.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He and Edie had only screwed two and a half times. The number wasn't absurdly overstated. And that</p>\n<p><i>half</i>- what a dramatic hook! It intrigued, forcing the question, the answer to which Jaecar was ready to provide: sex interrupted by the early arrival home of Edie's mother, sending Jaecar out the bedroom window and down a vine-entwined trellis.</p>\n<p>The tenable invention of Edie Thaw was why Coby wanted Jaecar to help him write his story. Coby had the central idea.

It never would be. Cool kids bonded over sports and pop music and whatever else. But it was a deep fanatical love of science fiction that had brought Coby and Jaecar together. They were physically unalike, Jaecar a big uncoordinated Germanic blond, Coby spindly but wiry. Neither excelled academically. Neither, despite the fabled sexual ministrations of Edie Thaw, was romantically or even socially skilled.</p>\n<p>They read the luridly covered \"sci-fic\" paperbacks that people made such fun of. At fourteen years of age they were supposed to have already outgrown this stuff. Coby did his best to ignore the disgusted or pitying looks he got from adults when he was reading on the bus. Some stared like he was playing with a doll.</p>\n<p>There was, maybe, some distant justification for this prejudice. Science fiction, from its early twentieth century outset, had promised a future of technological marvels: flying cars, zap guns, space colonies, and so on. It was well into the twenty-first now, and none of that had materialized, not even the little stuff like personal walkie-talkies and video phone calls.</p>\n<p>Some said it was because America hadn't had to face a rival since the defeat of Russia. Nothing to spur the nation, no urgency to develop scientific miracles. Every president in Coby's lifetime had vowed to land a person on the moon, but nothing ever came of it.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"\">Coby traded novels and issues of sci-fic magazines with Jaecar. But it was more than that. They discussed the stories, in depth and at length. Coby wrote letters to the publications, and got replies sometimes, and had even been printed twice in letters columns. He sent off to the science fiction societies in New York for newsletters. He was a fan. Hardcore. Hooked on the elaborate futures and imaginative alien worlds.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>And when one reached this intensity of devotion, it was evidently not uncommon for a fan to think:</p>\n<p><i>I can do that</i>.</p>\n<p>Part of it was having a favorite author whose work you devoured, read over and over, until his or her style fused with your consciousness. Until you could almost predict the shape and course of a sentence from its initial word. Until you began to believe you could write. Just. Like. Him/Her.</p>\n<p>Jaecar had come over after school, and Coby was nervous. Jaecar at the house wasn't anything unusual. Even what they were doing was what they'd done on uncounted previous afternoons. Jaecar sat in an awkward pile of knees and beefy forearms on a patch of Navajo rug in Coby's bedroom. He was thumbing a yellowed paperback of</p>\n<p><i>The War of the Worlds</i>, the edition with a still from Roger Corman's 1958 movie version for a cover. Even though the film was pre-Liberations, a half-naked Deborah Kerr posed provocatively with Martian tripods marching to war in the background.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/08/alternate-timeline-fanfic-by-eric-del.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Image generated with OpenAI Present Day Michael sat on the green-painted bench at the edge of the small city park fronting the grade school. He was dressed warmly, despite the late spring warmth of the sunny May afternoon. He watched as youngsters played kickball and skipped rope and tossed a rubber ball against the wall of the elementary school. Their presence barely registered with him. His life had become an unchanging cycle of sameness that was stultifying. The playground monitor took notice of Michael and, after a moment's hesitation, made her way in his direction. As Michael watched her approach, he gave nothing away; this, he thought, should at least be interesting, perhaps even entertaining. \"Sir?\" she said, standing beside him. Michael closed and then opened lugubrious eyes. He could barely stay awake. Over the last half year, his inattentiveness had led to his meds going all awry. \"Sir?\" she said again, leaning over and into his personal space. Michael lifted his head, heavy on his shoulders, and focused on her middle-aged face. She was late-30s, the same age as his daughter. \"Um?\" he replied. \"Sir, can I help you?\" she asked. What she meant, Michael thought, was, would you please go away and stop menacing the children? \"What,\" asked Michael, \"did you have in mind?\" He watched her blink in perplexity and try to make some sense of his remark. \"Sir, do you know where you are?\" she asked next. \"Um?\" he repeated. \"Sir,\" said the monitor, \"this is a grade school.\" Michael turned away, determined now to ignore her. After she'd gone, he slipped under and only regained awareness when a baritone voice addressed him. \"Hey, Pops,\" the voice said, \"what're you doin' here?\" Sensing the authority contained in the voice, Michael's attention level ratcheted up a notch. \"What do you want?\" Michael asked abruptly, frowning at the 40-something uniformed police officer who loomed over him. He watched as the short, blond man's pupils dilated. \"I asked why you're here,\" repeated the cop. Aggressive little shit, thought Michael. \"I heard you,\" said Michael in a peevish tone. \"What business is it of yours? Am I breaking a law, contravening an ordinance?\" he asked. This gave the policeman pause. He had expected to roust this likely homeless figure without any problem, but here was the old gent getting back in his face. \"Do you have ID?\" he asked next. \"Why do I need to show you my ID?\" demanded Michael, trying to shake the lethargy from his mind. \"I've committed no crime.\" \"Well,\" said the cop, \"maybe you have and maybe you ain't.\" \"You have no reasonable suspicion,\" said Michael, \"much less probable cause. I'm sitting on a public bench in a public park, not molesting anyone. My tax dollars purchased this bench, and go to pay your salary.\" \"But,\" said the cop, \"why are you here?\" \"I am an old man,\" explained Michael. \"I felt tired, so I took advantage of a public resource - this bench - and sat down. What more do you need to know?\" \"Well, we received some complaints,\" said the policeman. \"From whom?\" asked Michael. \"That's... confidential,\" explained the cop. \"Is that what you're going to say in court?\" asked Michael. \"In court?\" said the cop with a gulp. \"When I sue the city for wrongful prosecution and harassment and elder-abuse,\" said Michael. 'Listen, Mr., go ahead and sit here. You're not hurting anyone. Take it easy. And have a nice day.\" The…</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/08/hairline-fracture-by-bill-tope.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He stole watermelons from an aristocrat's farm, and when the Don announced in town that my father was the thief, the Don was blown away with a shotgun blast to the face. No witnesses came forward, but family smuggled my father out of Italy. He worked on a merchant ship in exchange for passage to New York. The authorities grabbed him on a lower Manhattan street and gave him the alternative of extradition back to Italy, or to enter the service as a World War I Doughboy. Despite being gassed in France, the first thing my father ever unpacked was a grainy black and white picture of himself in uniform. After discharge, he wrote to my mother. Ignoring her parents' pleas, she booked us passage to New York. When I met my father, he peered at me with hands on hips. I thought, who was this stranger? He took my mother into his arms, and when I tugged on her dress, he shoved me away with his leg.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"\">He was a short wiry man with a full head of black swept-back hair; the shape of my father's eyes earned him the nickname Chinaman from his fellow rag pickers. The gang of them acquired their piles of lice-infested clothes from alley refuse dumps or as discards from deceased folks' families who kept anything still wearable. Ragmen would hang their acquired remnants from frayed rope lines for the rain to cleanse and the sun to bleach. My father owned a rickety spoke-wheel pushcart piled over with bloated burlap bags of what he could scavenge. Whenever a landlord grew frustrated with rent delays and threatened to lock us out, we relocated to another tenement in the Italian ghettos around Manhattan's Mulberry Street or Brooklyn's East New York. Constant moves were incompatible with formal education, plus my father saw me as a pair of hands to help his business. I sucked cotton dust into my lungs and retched at the crusted filth and odor of rags often steeped in human waste.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Whenever my father wanted sex with my mother, he'd order me to bed. Although I pressed my ears like a vice, his muffled grunts drove me into a fetal position. Two sisters, Filomena, then Concetta, arrived in the next years. A Brooklyn tenement landlord allowed my mother to earn our rent as a hall cleaner and toilet scrubber, but the bending and kneeling in the years that followed deformed her body into a permanent stoop, and I watched my mother's face grow tired. As soon as my sisters could sew, they earned extra money with piecework. That was their childhood. My mother's affection toward me was limited to when my father wasn't around.</p>\n<p>Lugging loads of refuse strengthened me, and I grew tall for my age. My father and I would push our cart past a boxing gym off Utica Avenue, and I'd sneak a peek inside to watch a match of one man imposing his will on another. One day, I snuck away from my rag duties and walked up to the owner and promoter, Maxie Shapiro. He purchased the club with purses he earned as a featured middleweight. He was a Jew in his mid-forties with curly reddish-brown hair, a cauliflower ear, and a nose nearly flattened on his face. I lied when he asked my age. He gave me a look like he wasn't that stupid but threw some boxing gloves at me and told me to get into the ring. He put me up against a white-as-milk skinny-leg Irish kid, and in one round I turned the Mick into a cowering blob of sobbing flesh. Maxie pulled me off my bloodied opponent, gave me a silver dollar, and told me to come back the next evening ready to box.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/08/the-sour-smell-of-pain-joe-giordano.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It was almost as good.</h3>\n<p><i>We’ve been publishing  the winners of our True Romance Writing Prize collaboration with Belletrist and actress Emma Roberts these past few weeks. So far, we’ve shared the grand prize–winning essay in the shortread category, by Maggie Hart, and the longform winning story, by Olivia Shaffett. We’re elated to be bringing you the first shortread finalist this week, a banger of a piece from Katharine Coldiron. This is what Katharine had to say about how the piece came together: “This was the first piece I’d written on a prompt in years. I read the call for entries and thought immediately of this tale. I worked it through in the shower and put it down in a rush. I polished it a little, et voila.” A great reminder to follow a spark and go for it!</i> </p>\n<p>I was 19 or 20, a smoker, on a plane from New England to New Orleans. Next to me sat a man, around 19 or 20, a smoker. We looked at each other and liked what we saw; we talked to each other and liked what we heard; we, simply, hit it off.</p>\n<p>And not as friends. In that way that enlivens your whole body. Chemistry, pheromones, attraction. Whatever you call that, when the person is someone whose skin you badly want to touch from the first moments of meeting them.</p>\n<p>As we talked, we realized there was no way we’d ever meet again. I was visiting my mother for the summer in a place I would never live permanently. He was laying over in New Orleans on the way back to Wyoming or Oklahoma or North Texas, I don’t remember. I don’t even remember his name. I know he came from a place I’d never been and seemed unlikely to visit: a landlocked place. All my experiences had been coastal, due to my Navy father — I never lived anywhere you couldn’t park a 40,000-ton ship near.</p>\n<p>We told the truth. We made each other laugh.</p>\n<p>There was no social media then, and we both had precisely the quantity of life experience that advised us not to persist or pursue this connection. A little less and our romantic sides would have tried to build faith in a long-distance something; a little more and we would have recognized that such an instant, holistic connection is too rare to waste.</p>\n<p>Instead, we had the plane ride, and that was all.</p>\n<p>How will I remember you? I asked, or something less obvious that posed the same question.</p>\n<p>He dug in his pocket. I just bought this, he said. It was a rectangular Bic lighter with a picture of a cowboy on it, either at dusk or sunrise.</p>\n<p>I unzipped the front pocket of my backpack and pulled out an oval Bic lighter. It was a paisley design with a lot of purple in it. I’d chosen it because it was eye-catching and pretty without any pink.</p>\n<p>We traded.</p>\n<p>As we taxied, he said to me, I wish I could kiss you.</p>\n<p>Silence for a minute.</p>\n<p>Let’s pretend to be together, I said. As we’re getting off the plane, let’s pretend that we’re boyfriend and girlfriend. We’ll hold hands and talk about where to go for dinner. Then you’ll go to your gate and I’ll go to baggage claim.</p>\n<p>Yeah, he said.</p>\n<p>And you could kiss me then, I said. But not, like, really dramatically, like in the movies. Just like you do it all the time.</p>\n<p>He nodded.</p>\n<p>That was right. That was the right thing.</p>\n<p>I tried not to be sad.</p>\n<p>I still have that lighter. I find it in boxes of old stuff I go through from time to time, trying to discard what I no longer need. It’s been 15 years since I smoked, but I will not throw away that lighter.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/well-always-have-the-plane-ride\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

There was just one thing she needed to figure out first.</h3>\n<p>\n      <i>It was such a joy to collaborate with Emma Roberts, Karah Preiss and the whole Belletrist team on the  True Romance Writing Prize this year. After announcing the winners a few weeks ago, we’re excited to finally share the first piece of the bunch, the grand prize–winning essay in the shortread category, which comes to us from Maggie Hart. Maggie opened up a bit about writing this piece and others like it: “After I completed my chemo treatments, I felt awkward and ugly in my baldness, convinced I’d never be able to exist normally again, much less date. But finding small moments of humor and lightness helped me get through. I think lots of people view serious illness as something that only happens later in life, which just isn’t true — so I like sharing my stories about navigating the weirdness of cancer survival and young adulthood all at once.” Congratulations again, Maggie! And readers — you’re in for a treat. </i>\n    </p>\n<p>“I’m sorry,” I said to Nick, who stood staring at me in the dim light, his bare chest rising and falling with quickened breaths, his lips swollen from my kissing them. “It’s just that…well, I’ve been really racking my brain here, and I just don’t think there’s a sexy way to do this.”</p>\n<p>My fingers lingered at my forehead, on my hairline. My wig gripped my scalp like a barnacle on a boat, the scratchy fibers relentlessly digging into my skin, one of many small, manageable pains I had in those days. It had to come off for what was about to happen, I knew that. There was really no way around it. Leaving it on was impossible — I had a profoundly humbling vision of the wig abandoning ship mid-action, slipping loose and tumbling onto the floor in a sad, sweaty heap. It had also been quite an investment — although I still do not understand why a bunch of fake hair costs multiple hundreds of dollars — so I didn’t want it to get hopelessly matted. And what if, in the throes of passion, he forgot that the hair was fake and tried to <i>pull it</i>…</p>\n<p>No. No! Obviously, it had to come off. But <i>how, </i>exactly? I wished he’d look away, spare me, if only partially, from the humiliation of my baldification, the world’s least seductive strip tease.</p>\n<p>Nick smiled at me encouragingly. He was kind and tattooed and had long dark hair that was beginning to streak with gray. I’d never been with a man who had hair longer than mine, although, that winter, any man with any hair at all had hair longer than mine.</p>\n<p>Four months after my last round of chemotherapy, I decided that it was time I put myself out there, that I date. Why not? The chemo had, miraculously, worked. My blood counts were relatively normal, I hadn’t needed a platelet transfusion in weeks and my oncologists gave me the all-clear, so it was time that I shifted my attention away from my no-longer-imminent death to something much more invigorating: the pursuit of reassurance. I needed to know that my body worked, that I still knew how to have a conversation that was not about being sick, that this whole cancer thing had not rendered me sexless and unlovable at just 25 years old. So, I went where every woman in her 20s goes when she needs reassurance: the apps.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/unexpected-challenges-dating-cancer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The chemical, trimethylbenzoyl diphenylphosphine oxide – referred to more commonly as TPO – functions as a so-called photoinitiator in such polishes. In plain English, it’s the component that allows gel nails to harden, providing customers with a stronger, longer-lasting end result.</p>\n    <p>But that durable manicure could come at a cost, EU officials warn – specifically, long-term fertility problems, according to the studies officials cited. (Other research efforts, meanwhile, have indicated <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/beauty/features/gel-manicure-safety?src=RSS_PUBLIC\">negative effects</a> on skin from the UV light used to harden gel polishes.)</p>\n    <p>Here in the U.S., however, the Food and Drug Administration – the governing body <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics\">responsible</a> for monitoring the safety of <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/bigname-cosmetics-gave-woman-entrepreneur-creative-business-idea/\">cosmetics</a> and other items on behalf of American <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/arina-ponomareva-flashee/\">consumers</a> – has put no such ban in place. </p>\n    <p>Perhaps it’s a staffing matter. <a href=\"https://www.skadden.com/insights/publications/2025/04/trump-administrations-first-100-days/mass-layoffs-at-fda\">Roughly 3,500 employees</a> were laid off at the agency in April.  Though <a href=\"https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/07/fda-reinstated-roughly-a-quarter-of-initial-doge-job-cuts-00474273\">about 25%</a> of them have since been reinstated, the FDA’s ability to inspect goods and process reviews has been significantly hamstrung. Regardless of firings or hirings, however, there are numerous products and ingredients available in the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.byrdie.com/banned-ingredients-europe\">that are banned elsewhere</a> – from the formaldehyde found in other types of nail polish, to trace amounts of lead in lipsticks. </p>\n    <p>Some see the logic of the EU ban. Francesca Rapolla, scientific affairs manager at the Cosmetic, Toiletry &amp; Perfumery Association, a trade organization, <a href=\"https://www.scratchmagazine.co.uk/news/what-is-tpo-why-is-it-being-banned-from-nail-products/\">told UK-based Scratch Magazine</a> that while industry heads could lobby for exemptions from rulings like the one handed down this month, “the industry did not, and could not, defend the continued use of [TPO] in nail products, mainly because it could not demonstrate that there are no alternative ingredients.”</p>\n    <p>Others in the beauty industry, however, are speaking out against it. One <a href=\"https://www.asap-nails.be/about-ASAP-Nails-Beauty\">Belgian beauty wholesaler</a> even launched a <a href=\"https://www.tpo-eu.com/en/\">protest website</a> that calls the ban “unjust,” and asserts that it will have “a huge impact on thousands of salons, training centers, distributors and manufacturers.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/eu-bans-gel-nail-polishes-that-the-u-s-continues-to-sell/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It was a boon to the grassroots movement, which started in the 1980s in response to a pattern of permitting landfills and polluting industries in neighborhoods that were disproportionately Black, Brown and low-income.</p>\n<p>In the past four years, advisory councils were created — with many of the positions filled by women of color, who have long been leaders in environmental justice spaces — and offices opened to spearhead the work on the federal level. During that time, the administration also <a href=\"https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USEPAIAQ/bulletins/37c321b\">earmarked billions of dollars</a> to address longstanding environmental issues, and to help these communities adapt to the climate crisis.</p>\n<p>But as President Donald Trump took office for a second time, all that momentum at the federal level disappeared, seemingly overnight. An executive order issued on inauguration day took aim at dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, and environmental justice. As a result, any mention of the work is being scrubbed from government websites and funding has been paused.</p>\n<p>For Jalonne White-Newsome, who led the first ever office on environmental justice in the White House, the shift has been jarring if not unexpected. Still, she’s not undaunted. Through her over three decades of working in environmental justice — starting from her youth in Detroit, Michigan — there is one thing she knows: The movement, at its core, is driven by everyday people who will continue to advocate for their communities.</p>\n<p>“Environmental justice did not start with the federal government,” she said. “Nor will it end with the federal government.”</p>\n<p>The 19th spoke with White-Newsome, formerly the federal environmental justice officer for the White House Council on Environmental Quality, about the Trump administration’s recent attacks on her work and how the movement responds now.</p>\n<p><i>This interview has been edited for length and clarity. </i></p>\n<h3><strong>Jessica Kutz: What is it like to see the new administration issue executive orders aimed at dismantling environmental justice, work that you played a part in implementing?</strong></h3>\n<p>Jalonne White-Newsome: I mean, it’s crushing, right? It is offensive. It’s really hard because we have really tried to work hard over these past four years to create a foundation that our federal family could build on.To see a lot of that dismantled, to see our information wiped off websites, to really try and eliminate the trace of any environmental justice work, it’s very frustrating.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do you think this pull back in funding will affect the momentum of the movement? Is there work that was done under Biden that might be protected from this shift? </strong></h3>\n<p>I’ve had so many community leaders over the past couple years come up to me, folks that have been in the movement for decades and decades, to say there has never been this amount of funding and resources to support environmental justice.</p>\n<p>And so our agency partners worked really, really hard to try and get as much money out as possible [before the Trump administration]. I mean, they were grinding very hard.</p>\n<p>I know there are groups that are positioning to make sure that communities can keep the funds that were obligated to them. So that is happening right now. Where it gets sticky is some of the funds were kind of in that period of not being obligated. [Especially with] the current administration’s review of anything that remotely thinks, talks or looks like equity or environmental justice.</p>\n<p>I’m not a lawyer. Is that legal? Can they actually do that? I don’t know. But it’s a fear tactic, right? And they’re trying to cause fear and confusion, and they have been successful. But we have great partners that have a lot of knowledge and passion that are going to protect our folks that have received these funds to continue to do the great work that they’re doing on the ground.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are your concerns about this political shift away from DEI and environmental justice work? </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/the-environmental-justice-movement-isnt-going-anywhere-even-as-it-faces-attacks-by-trump/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

An Association of American Medical Colleges <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/how-extreme-weather-events-put-women-at-risk/\">analysis</a> in 2024 found that women around the world are more likely to experience injury and death as a result of catastrophic weather events, often in the form of pregnancy complications and sexual violence.

Final picks will be recognized this fall on our site, shared with media partners, and potentially featured in video and podcasts. As an example, please see our <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/as-great-salt-lake-dries-dust-is-new-danger/\">video</a> (below) and <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/how-do-we-deal-with-bad-air-quality/\">podcast</a> on Kerry Kelly, a University of Utah professor of chemical engineering who is an expert on air quality and the founder of Tellus, a maker of air quality sensors.</p>\n    <p>To nominate a candidate, please head to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSclj2iY0OMhGugTA4mIrXx9Dyb_0uIOwGULY-MZPkBUsEa0HA/viewform\">our form</a>. Please note: You cannot nominate yourself. </p>\n    <p>Candidates must be U.S.-based scientists with advanced degrees in the fields of physics, chemistry, engineering, biology, agronomy, environmental science, meteorology or closely related fields; or entrepreneurs with advanced degrees who are creating science-based products and technologies to help mitigate/reduce the impact of climate change through innovative practices.</p>\n    <p>“For many years, we have highlighted the incredible accomplishments of women in science, who are often racing against the clock to adapt our world to the dangers of climate change,” said Victoria Wang, co-founder of The Story Exchange. “At a time when there is little reason to be optimistic about the environment, these women stand out as beacons of hope.” ◼️</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/know-a-trailblazing-woman-scientist-nominate-her-for-our-cutting-edge-women-in-science-list/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

As of publication, two children died – ages 8 and 10 – and 17 people were injured when suspect Robin Westman (who also died, of a self-inflicted gunshot wound) opened fire during a morning mass at the city’s Annunciation Catholic School.</p>\n<p>Of the 17 who were hurt, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy40znde9eko\">14 were kids</a>. Some of them were as young as 6 years old.</p>\n<p>“These were American families,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said during a press briefing. “Don’t just say this is about ‘thoughts and prayers’ right now. These kids were literally praying.”</p>\n<p>Yet that’s largely what conservatives, including President Donald Trump, had to offer in the wake of the attack. “Please join me in praying for everyone involved,” <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/shooting-annunciation-church-minneapolis/\">Trump wrote</a> on Truth Social, with Vice President JD Vance offering a similar call. “My prayers are with everyone involved in this tragedy,” Attorney General Pam Bondi also <a href=\"https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/1960716027131519061\">posted</a>.</p>\n<p>The solution to our <a href=\"https://www.apha.org/topics-and-issues/gun-violence\">gun-violence epidemic</a> should be to pass more stringent gun laws. Experts have found that the <a href=\"https://rockinst.org/blog/more-guns-more-death-the-fundamental-fact-that-supports-a-comprehensive-approach-to-reducing-gun-violence-in-america/\">sheer tonnage</a> of guns available in the U.S., and <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/debunking-the-guns-make-us-safer-myth/\">the ease</a> with which they can be purchased, makes ours a deadlier, more dangerous nation to live in. And <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11381453/\">study</a> after <a href=\"https://everytownresearch.org/rankings/\">study</a> has shown that gun violence could be curbed significantly through policy prescriptions.</p>\n<p>But for this particular shooting, after praying for peace, conservatives found an alternative scapegoat: Transgender people. Despite the fact that the <i>vast</i> majority of mass shootings are <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/fact-check/majority-of-us-mass-shooters-are-cis-men-not-transgender-or-non-binary-people-idUSL1N363273/\">committed by cisgender men</a>, Westman was a trans woman, so some are using this shooting to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/27/us/minneapolis-school-shooting-suspect-gunman.html\">further anti-trans agendas</a>.</p>\n<p>Attacking a community that is <a href=\"https://glaad.org/trump-accountability-tracker/\">already subject</a> to extreme discrimination, while refusing to enact legislation that would see gun violence lessened, and then offering boiler-plate calls for prayer in the aftermath… None of this does anything to actually help the children they claim to want, the children they claim to care about. </p>\n<p>None of this helped 10-year-old Weston Halsne, who survived the Minneapolis shooting because his equally-young friend <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/minneapolis-mass-shooting-catholic-school-survivor-friend/\">shielded him from gunfire</a>, and was injured in the process. “It was like, shots fired, and then we kind of, like, got under pews,” he recalled to members of the press. “They shot through the stained glass windows I think, and it was really scary.”</p>\n<p>Weston added that was praying for his friend’s recovery – because it’s the only recourse he, a traumatized child, has in the U.S., where people with the power to enact laws that would protect children from shootings like this <a href=\"https://www.thetrace.org/2025/06/big-beautiful-bill-atf-silencer-gun-laws/\">fail to do so</a> over and over again. </p>\n<p>Conservative politicians and pundits continue to pressure women to bring more lives like Weston’s into this world, into this country – while at the same time demonstrating a refusal to even<i> try</i> to keep them safe. <a href=\"https://www.security.org/blog/a-timeline-of-school-shootings-since-columbine/\">Over 400 school shootings</a> have taken place in the U.S. since the 1999 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School_massacre\">Columbine High School massacre</a>, with dozens killed, hundreds injured and thousands traumatized by these attacks.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/conservatives-want-more-kids-yet-offer-only-prayers-when-kids-are-gunned-down/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s the only timely source of this demographic-level data.</p>\n<p>Without it, economists and policymakers would have no way of knowing how economic policy is affecting marginalized groups of workers in real time. They’d be flying blind on how to help them.</p>\n<p>But that’s just what President Donald Trump’s nominee to run the bureau is suggesting doing.</p>\n<p>On August 1, Trump fired the head of the bureau, Erika McEntarfer, after BLS published one of the largest revisions to its data in decades. The revision showed that the economy was in fact weaker than previously reported, leading Trump to accuse McEntarfer of tampering with the data to make his administration look bad.</p>\n<p>Revisions of economic data have also always been part of how BLS, an independent and nonpartisan agency, functions. The data is collected from surveys of employers and households, and then published in three waves. The surveys are voluntary, so not all responses come in on time. BLS publishes an initial release and then revises in the subsequent two months as more responses come in. It’s done this way to ensure that markets and economists get real-time data on the economy. Since the pandemic, BLS has been struggling with lagging response rates and a rapidly changing economy that has led to larger revisions.</p>\n<p>The reports are still considered one of the most reliable sources of U.S. economic data in the world.</p>\n<p>McEntarfer, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden and was confirmed in a nearly unanimous Senate vote, is a widely respected economist who had worked in the federal government under multiple administrations. Trump’s nominee to replace her, E.J. Antoni, is an economist at the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation who <a href=\"https://static.heritage.org/project2025/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf\">contributed</a> <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/thebulwark.com/post/3lwen55jkbk25\">to Project 2025</a>. Discussing the employment data <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trumps-bls-pick-could-pause-monthly-jobs-report-over-accuracy-concerns\">earlier this month</a>, Antoni suggested that until the data is “corrected,” “the BLS should suspend issuing the monthly job reports but keep publishing the more accurate, though less timely, quarterly data.” </p>\n<p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier this week that the Trump administration had noted Antoni’s suggestions but intended to continue issuing the monthly reports.</p>\n<p>“I believe that is the plan, and that’s the hope, and that these monthly reports will be data that the American people can trust,” Leavitt said.</p>\n<p>Losing timely economic data, particularly at a time when the economy is showing signs of softening, is bad for every group, economists told The 19th. But it could disproportionately impact women and women of color, who are often the first to feel the impact of weakness in the economy and serve as a bellwether of what is to come.</p>\n<p>“The household survey is really the only source for intersectional employment data on a monthly basis. That means that for groups of women we and others have been watching especially closely during this period — for example, disabled women, Black women, women veterans — timely information about these groups would disappear,” said Katherine Gallagher Robbins, a senior fellow at the National Partnership for Women &amp; Families who routinely analyzes the data.</p>\n<p>The National Women’s Law Center, which also publishes its monthly analysis of women in the workforce using BLS’ data, said in a statement that “losing this impartial data will undermine efforts to improve women’s economic wellbeing, damage the credibility and reliability of data coming from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and hurt overall efforts to objectively assess the health of our economy.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/suspending-monthly-economic-reports-would-be-really-bad-for-women-of-color/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <i>Drink Besa’s fruit punch flavored hard seltzer. (Credit: Courtesy of Drink Besa)</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Summer has arrived. And with it, higher than ever temperatures, thanks to heat waves and rather ominous-sounding weather phenomenons like the <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/heat-dome-100-million-people-27-states-extreme-heat-tornado-warnings-forecasts/story?id=111347390\">heat dome</a>. As temperatures soar from the East Coast to the West Coast, and folks gather for summer BBQs, backyard gatherings, beach trips and pool days – ice cold beverages will be a necessity. <br/>So we’ve compiled a list of summertime drinks from female entrepreneurs whose startup stories we’ve enjoyed – and who we think you should get to know. From rosé, to flavored seltzers, to functional beverages packed with minerals and adaptogens,  there’s something here for everyone at the party to enjoy.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>(All images courtesy of the companies.)</i>\n    </p>\n<h2>Drink Besa</h2>\n<p>Tori Brodsky has been leading the helm of <a href=\"https://drinkbesa.com/\">Drink Besa</a> since 2022. With a background in nutrition science, she became interested in making convenient drinks with quality ingredients, such as canned wine that’s, in fact, pretty darn good (we tried the “sexy and bright” <a href=\"https://drinkbesa.com/product/just-right-white/\">white wine</a>). Drink Besa also offers a line of hard seltzers, which it says are among the first on the market to use organic wine instead of malt liquor or spirits. The 5% ABV drink comes in three flavors – peach, fruit punch, and citrus – and is, according to Brodksy, “the ideal summer beverage: Delicious, premium, and truly unique.”</p>\n<h2>Bow &amp; Arrow Brewing Co.</h2>\n<p>“We didn’t set out to be the first <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/a-native-owned-brewery-inspired-by-the-southwest/\">Native-woman-owned brewery</a> in the United States, but I’m told we are,” says Shyla Sheppard, founder of <a href=\"https://www.bowandarrowbrewing.com/\">Bow &amp; Arrow Brewing Co</a>. She and her partner, Missy Begay, take inspiration from the American Southwest, incorporating traditional Indigenous ingredients into their craft beers. Their beers, like “Dance In and Out of The Beams of a Neon Moon” (a fruity IPA), and “Cactuscolada” (a Pina Colada-inspired sour ale) are available in their Albuquerque, New Mexico, tap room  – where they are served cold straight from the tap – as well as <a href=\"https://www.bowandarrowbrewing.com/find-our-beer\">other locations</a>. </p>\n<h2>Heti</h2>\n<p>Dana Thompson, who built the celebrated <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/owamni-indigenous-cuisine-healing/\">Owamni</a> restaurant, is now turning her attention to the functional beverage space. Her new business, <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/dana-thompson-heti-drinks/\">Heti</a>, is a health-conscious brand selling low-dose THC beverages. The name itself means “home” in Dakota; Thompson is a direct descendant of the tribe through her mother. Evoking a sense of place — and the flavors of home — is intentional. “I wanted something that resonated with what the people I know were asking for,” Thompson told The Story Exchange in a recent interview, especially women who wanted to relax with something other than wine. There is a home-related social-impact component to her business model in the works, as Thompson also plans to create hempcrete housing on tribal lands with some of the profits.</p>\n<h2>Trois Noix</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/jaime-araujo-trois-noix/\">Jaime Araujo</a> says her Napa Valley winery, <a href=\"https://troisnoixwine.com/\">Trois Noix</a>, was born from a lifelong love of wine. She’s not only passionate about what ends up in the bottle, “but also how it got there, what happens when it fills your glass, and how it can bring a table of people together.” And how’s this for a summertime drink: The winery’s Sonoma Valley Rosé, made from pinot noir, contains aromas of papaya, just-ripe strawberry, and crushed rose petals. Reviewers on wine app <a href=\"https://www.vivino.com/US/en/trois-noix-rose-of-pinot-noir/w/9858056?year=2021\">Vivino</a> called it “light-bodied with a tart plum finish” and “very refreshing.” Trois Noix recommends pairing with grilled seafood and summer vegetables … or just sipping on its own, if you don’t have grand cooking plans on the hazy horizon. </p>\n<h2>All Phenoms</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/cristina-kown-all-phenoms/\">Cristina Kown’s</a> sparkling waters, <a href=\"https://allphenoms.com/\">All Phenoms</a>, are packed with organic fruits and filled with vitamins, adaptogens, minerals, prebiotics and probiotics. Her aim? To offer a super healthy alternative to sugary sodas. The Redondo Beach, California-based entrepreneur is a self-proclaimed healthy beverage fan – but was dismayed that most of the drinks on the market contained tons of sugar, or low-quality ingredients. We imagine All Phenoms drinks in flavors like berry hibiscus, citrus ginger and mango lemongrass would do a good job of keeping you sufficiently hydrated at any sweltering gathering. </p>\n<h2>Boyd Cru</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/the-best-summer-beverages-to-beat-the-heat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Asymmetrical ubiquitous surveillance is the problem.” The Liberator was playing Chinese checkers against himself and talking, talking, talking, like always. “Who watches the watchmen, after all?”</p>\n<p>We were superheroes then. Celebrities, back when there were such things. It was a slow night at orbital headquarters, and Eye-Oh was sitting at the big screen, watching a couple of people fuck — consensually, or we would have done something about it — in an alleyway. The screen was green with night-vision enhancements, and Eye-Oh’s strange complicated face was perfectly placid and empty as he observed.</p>\n<p>“The problem is that we can watch ordinary people, and they can’t watch us,” the Liberator went on. He looked at me longingly, searchingly, and I thought it might be nice to tweak the inside of his brain and get rid of his earnestness, give him a little taste of what infamous brain-damage victim Phineas Gage got when that iron bar slammed through his frontal lobe, a total personality turnaround, from nice guy to sociopath. Let the Liberator be selfish and impulsive and violent and mercurial for a while, so he could appreciate the way normal avaricious sneaky hungry desperate needy people felt.</p>\n<p>But that was supervillain thinking, and I’d gone straight and narrow. In those days I cured neurological damage instead of inflicting it. I <i>fixed</i> people. (Except bad people. Those, I was sometimes still allowed to play with with.) I’d refused to give up my supervillain name though. The Liberator had wanted to call me “Dr. Neuro” when I joined his little boys’ club, but I’d insisted on keeping my maiden name, as it were. Doctor. Please. I was a high-school dropout.</p>\n<p>“Do you see?” the Liberator said. “If ordinary people could see <i>us</i>, if everyone could see everyone else, it wouldn’t matter if there were no privacy.”</p>\n<p/><p>“Mmm,” I said, and tried to keep reading my book, a physics textbook. I was deep into a chapter on Heisenberg. His big achievement was the uncertainty principle, which says you can’t know both the position and the momentum of a given particle at the same time. (I know, you know that. But like I said, I didn’t do much school. I had a lot of catching up to do if I was going to hang with the super-science types.) I always thought the uncertainty principle had something to do with observing, how just the act of looking at something changed its nature, but apparently that’s a whole different thing, called the observer effect. That’s the kind of confusion you get when your grasp of physics comes from made-for-TV science fiction movies named after the monster that eats the boyfriend in the second act. I wasn’t too clear on the implications of the uncertainty principle, but I understood the observer effect. Me and the boys observed things all the time — Eye-Oh observed _everything_ all the time — and we sure as hell changed what we saw if we thought it needed changing.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/08/28/escape-pod-1008-observer-effects-flashback-friday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Full of avocados, computer chips, plastic toys, etc. All carefully placed by her rubber-faced grippers into the trucks that darted in and out of the warehouse bays.</p>\n<p>On a good day, Sandra loaded something interesting. A heavy, oddly shaped package, requiring her to adjust her first person view goggles and sit forward in her chair, lips pursed in concentration. Or a tantalizing, vacuum-packed parcel bound for near Earth orbit. Once, an opaque tank, filled with flickering red-black fish. It brought a little variety to a day viewed through the cameras of a four-foot-tall, yellow robot.</p>\n<p>Everyone thought loader drivers were shut-ins who ate frozen pizza three meals a day, but Sandra knew she was plenty hot. In fact, despite spending six days a week working alone, Sandra showered regularly, had nicely combed black hair, and ate fresh greens from her garden. Her FPV goggles left ghost-white rings around her eyes, but no one had ever complained during her periodic forays into picking up people at the bar after work. The bar in Lane’s Creek, that is, not wherever she’d been dispatched today. Sandra couldn’t ask, but from the pine trees and rain that slicked the tops of the trucks, she guessed Washington or Oregon.</p>\n<p>Today, her bot’s grippers were broken, so Sandra was posting cute cats on the drivers’ forum. The bots weren’t wired for sound or video, supposedly as a cost-saving measure. They did, however, have little whiteboards. Sandra had been surprised when a neighboring bot surreptitiously held up its ‘emergency’ whiteboard with a link scrawled on it. But she’d quickly grown to like the forum’s stream of gossip, complaints, and off-topic posts. Sandra wasn’t good at small talk, online or in real life, but she still wanted her people to know she cared about them. So, cat .gifs.</p>\n<p>Finally, a woman wearing a maintenance technician’s overalls walked into her camera’s view. She waved to Sandra. That was rare. The in-person employees were often stuck-up when they weren’t inattentive. Sandra lifted her busted gripper and gingerly waved back.</p>\n<p>“No humans allowed near a robot in motion,” the bot driver pre-employment training had said about a hundred times.</p>\n<p>Lucy, that was what the woman’s name tag said, didn’t seem nervous about the bot. She also sang to herself as she worked, which Sandra liked. Not that Sandra could hear, but she’d gotten good at reading lips in her first year as a bot driver. Right now, Lucy was singing a pop song from last year. It reminded Sandra of her mom working in the kitchen, which was weird, because Lucy was hot. Not like, older lady, mom-core hot, but hot hot, swipe-right hot. Lucy had a nice curve in her nose, and worked quickly and surely, sweat beading her short red hair. She leaned toward the camera to check a gripper and Sandra straightened in her chair, feeling flushed at the sudden intimacy.</p>\n<p>Sandra’s bot was soon working again and Lucy began to pack her tools. Sandra considered giving her a thumbs up, but that didn’t really seem appropriate as a thank you. Or a flirtation. She knew from the forum that a few bot drivers took creepy screenshots of the in-person staff, but she’d never heard of anyone trying to hit on one. Lucy turned to go and Sandra panicked. They were still too close together for her to risk a sudden movement toward her whiteboard. So, instead, Sandra bowed, her bot’s servos humming as it folded gently forward. She wondered if Lucy would assume the bot had suffered another malfunction.</p>\n<p>Instead, Lucy bowed back, winked, and walked off, her bag swinging behind her. And Sandra was in love.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/08/21/escape-pod-1007-35-f-lanes-creek-oklahoma/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 1006: When the Oracle Speaks (Part 2 of 2)</h2>\n<h3>When the Oracle Speaks (Part 2)</h3>\n<p>Outside the warehouse, the rain fell in sheets. It whipped the Azure River into a frenzy, and the waters responded with a hungry roar as they swirled past the dock. It pounded the warehouse’s loading bay, transforming it into a marshy field of shallow ponds and rocky islands. Nobody, not even a dock worker, was about; the only things that moved were the automata. They paced back and forth, their armor caked with rust, and as they splashed through the watery field, droplets running down their limbs, they showed no signs of minding.</p>\n<p>The shadow of a narrow alleyway enveloped me, hiding me from the automata. For a moment, anticipation and fear flickered in my chest, before I exhaled and snuffed them both out. I stepped out of the alleyway, protected by my umbrella. Espionage mission or not, I wasn’t letting my hair get wet.</p>\n<p>Both automata stopped and turned to face me; the rain filled the void of silence left by their stilled feet. I continued walking forwards with purpose.</p>\n<p/><p>One automata raised a hand, its rusted joints creaking as it did. It spoke, in a gravelly, muffled voice: “Halt.”<br/>\nThat was the first layer of defense, meant to deter commoners who’d ignored the posted signs against trespassing and somehow wandered this far into the docks. I didn’t slow. At first, the automata showed no reaction—those machine minds, hidden to me, recalculated and reconsidered. Then, as one, they both shivered. The illusion of rusted armor fell from them like an unclasped cloak, and now their carapaces, comprised of thousands of scales, gleamed in the rainwater.</p>\n<p>“Provide validation.” Its voice was as smooth and bright as a stream of molten metal.</p>\n<p>I spoke the passphrase from memory: “Clouds aflame. Flower verdigris. In a summer field, a single stone.”</p>\n<p>The automata pivoted on their feet away from me, like a door swinging open, and I exhaled. “Validation accepted. Enter.”</p>\n<p>With the rain still pounding my opened umbrella, I walked past the automata’s unblinking stares and entered the warehouse.</p>\n<p>First it was quiet; then, the overhead lighting turned on with a droning buzz. I held one hand to my brow to shield my eyes from the unexpected brightness, while my other hovered by my lightgun. If there was a trap, they’d spring it now. But nothing moved, and slowly, I relaxed.</p>\n<p>I saw what the warehouse concealed, and at first, I didn’t understand.</p>\n<p>It stood in the middle of the stark white floor, its matte black chassis drawing the eye like a dark stone in a field of sand. Six conical thrust nozzles dangled from the underside; now, they all pointed straight down, but I knew from the holovids how, in combat, they could turn and dance to make the craft fly in impossible ways. On either side of the nose, weapons bays brimmed with missiles, hexagonal ports arrayed like the speckles of a cobra, its hood spread, staring back at me.</p>\n<p>A hover-bomber. And as I circled around it, I saw, emblazoned on its side, the emblem of Samandir.</p>\n<p>Pallets of sealed crates lined the warehouse next to the hover-bomber; I pried them open at random and examined their contents. Short-barreled rifles, the same ones brandished by the enemy in both propaganda holovids and classified combat footage. Clean-pressed mustard yellow uniforms, the signature mark of Samandiran shock troopers. All the props needed to stage an attack in the city and have everyone in Artan think Samandir responsible.<br/>\nSuch an attack, ending in the loss of Artani life, would surely cause all-out war to resume. But who could have planned something like this? If I discovered the general or prince responsible for this plot, I could ensure they were executed tomorrow morning.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/08/14/escape-pod-1006-when-the-oracle-speaks-part-2-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 1005: When the Oracle Speaks (Part 1 of 2)</h2>\n<h3>When the Oracle Speaks (Part 1)</h3>\n<p>One year after the war’s end, the royal court welcomed a hundred orphan boys into our ranks. They flew into the city’s spaceport by shuttle and proceeded up the hill on the backs of the court’s own palanquin-bearers; upon entering the palace grounds, they received the speeches and banquets we held in honor of their noble suffering. The boys, hailing from the kingdom’s most war-torn moon, had lost everything, but now their days of hardship were over. They had become esteemed wards of the House of Hassam.</p>\n<p>After a few days, though, people in the court whispered of something else. The cooks and dressing girls repeated the same rumor: <i>Did you hear? One of the new boys can see the future.</i> The ministers and generals, who should have held themselves above idle gossip, indulged in speculation: <i>If this is true, could the boy be of use?</i> And everyone wondered how the king might act. We all knew his strength was the House’s strength. If the boy possessed some special power, my father would take him.</p>\n<p>So I never had any intentions of turning the boy to my side. I was just curious.</p>\n<p/><p>I found him sitting on a bench in the middle of a courtyard, surrounded by onlookers. It was another rainy day, and all the aristocrats had a servant beside them, shielding their heads with an umbrella. Some pretended to write calligraphy or paint—the perfect image of artful nobility, honing their talents as the rain fell around them—while others just stared.</p>\n<p>I took in this scene from the colonnade which circumscribed the courtyard. “Come,” I said, and my servant chaperone opened my umbrella. “I’m going to talk to him.”</p>\n<p>We left the colonnade’s shelter and entered the courtyard. The boy didn’t appear special—he was skinny and looked around the same age as me, and the only thing unusual about him was his uncovered head. Rain plastered his thick, reddish curls to his forehead. They’d be a frizzy mess later; I wrinkled my nose at the thought of it.</p>\n<p>Instead of looking up as we approached, he only stared at the rain hammering the surface of the courtyard pond. He’d been doing that, it seemed, all afternoon long. My servant and I stood there, waiting, until the silent lack of recognition grew irritating. Finally, my servant spoke: “Prince Meira Pashel em-Hassam wishes to speak to you.”</p>\n<p>The boy turned around. His eyes swept over me—my jeweled coat jacket, inlaid with silver; the ceremonial lightgun at my belt; my coiled black locks, cascading to my chest and lustrously shiny. The regalia of a prince was designed for impact. But his face betrayed no emotion—not fear, nor awe, nor muffled resentment—none of the familiar reactions.</p>\n<p>As if he expected it all. My irritation grew.</p>\n<p>The boy didn’t bow, but I refrained from comment; I’d already conceded enough conversational power to this commoner. Instead, I said, “You look wet. Would you like an umbrella? My servant can fetch one.”</p>\n<p>He shook his head. “I like the rain. It’s nice on my head.”</p>\n<p>The word the boy used for ‘rain’ caught my attention—a formal construction, not the colloquialism that everyone in the city used. I remembered why he was here. We were both Artani, but I had been born on this moon, Artan itself, while he, like the rest of the orphans, was from Eshtan. Once the crown jewel and proudest province of the House of Hassam, now a dead moon, bombed to a ruin by the Samandirans.</p>\n<p>The boy lacked etiquette, but not only was he my House’s ward, he’d also lost his parents to the Artani people’s mortal enemy. I could hardly reprimand him. So instead, I said, “Welcome, in the name of the House of Hassam, to your new home. Our hospitality is yours to command.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/08/07/escape-pod-1005-when-the-oracle-speaks-part-1-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

For the most part. It was all I’d wanted for the last year: to hang out with my friends somewhere other than a hospital room and go to school and talk without an oxygen tube in my nose.</p>\n<p>But they weren’t <i>my</i> friends. Not really. They were her friends. The old Sam, the girl my body had been cloned from, the girl whose memories had been printed onto my brain. The girl whose life I was now supposed to live.</p>\n<p>When they revived me, I’d woken up in my hospital bed. <i>Her</i> hospital bed. That was important, because if I had woken up in the technical center where they’d grown my body and imprinted my mind, we’d be too aware I was just a copy of the real Sam. No, they positioned my body in the exact same hospital bed where she’d spent the past fourteen months. That way my parents could come in and pretend their daughter had recovered.</p>\n<p>Nobody ever literally claimed that Sam hadn’t died. If they did that, they’d know they were in denial, and that would ruin the fantasy they could only hold onto so long as they didn’t think about it too much. Yes, technically, that body had died, sent off to be cremated like any other amputated limb, but their daughter wasn’t dead. Not <i>really</i> dead. She’d been revived. Wasn’t it fantastic? We should all be so thankful that Sam had (for all intents and purposes) pulled through after all.</p>\n<p>Sam’s friends ran circles around me, talking over each other, making plans for us together. We were going to do so many things now that I was healthy again. First thing, after band practice, we were going to sneak off to Starbucks even though Tina’s mom didn’t let her have caffeine and we were going to drink Frappuccinos until we got sick.</p>\n<p>This was what I remembered normal feeling like a lifetime ago, the life I’d wished so hard to get back. I’d spent months too weak to move, knowing I’d never step foot outside the hospital again. To be walking around in this body now… I was just playing a virtual reality game called Sam’s Life Before She Got Sick.</p>\n<p>I <i>did</i> want to go to Starbucks with my band nerd friends and get sick on caffeine and talk away the afternoon. But also I didn’t. I wanted to not want these things. If I only liked what Sam had liked, if I only wanted what Sam had wanted, I was nothing but a copy of Sam. Not a real person. Not even a human. Just a very realistic mannequin, my arms and legs animated by what some other girl used to want.</p>\n<p>My mom watched us with tears in her eyes, makeup carefully done up for this special occasion. My nine year-old sister, Vic, had been staring at me with wide eyes all day. She seemed like she wanted to get caught up in my friends’ happiness, but still couldn’t quite believe it was all real. My dad stood behind them, a few steps back. I couldn’t read the expression on his face. Maybe he was thinking the same thing I was: this person, whoever she is, <i>whatever</i> she is, she’s not Sam.</p>\n<p>“Have you played your clarinet, yet?” Janie asked. “You have to make symphonic band next year so we all have practice together, Sam. You <i>have</i> to.”</p>\n<p>“I, uh…” I began. “Could you call me Samantha from now on? Instead of Sam?”</p>\n<p>Janie’s smile grew. “Uh, okay. Why?”</p>\n<p>“Cause Sam is a boy’s name,” I said.</p>\n<p>I didn’t want to tell her the real reason. I didn’t think I could explain it well enough to make anyone understand.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/07/31/escape-pod-1004-the-girl-who-came-before/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 1003: Billionaire’s Tears</h2>\n<h3>Billionaire’s Tears</h3>\n<p>I wake up to the sound of screaming, and know I’m going to die.</p>\n<p>I shoot out of bed, calling for my mother. First thing I’ve spoken clearly in two days.</p>\n<p>“Maria!” My mother bursts into my room. “Baby, what’s wrong?”</p>\n<p>“S-sorry, Mamma,” I whisper, frantically searching for the right syllables so I don’t trip over them and give it all away. I can’t let Mamma suspect I’m dying—or how soon it’ll happen. “Nightmares.”</p>\n<p>Mamma’s smile is sad. The world’s finally getting better, but not for everyone. For us, still struggling, it’s like it’s only getting worse. Everyone in the family has been having nightmares. But when Mamma accepts my explanation and doesn’t seem bothered by the screaming that surrounds us and has not stopped, to me, anyway, that’s when I know. I have a week <i>tops</i> if I’m lucky.</p>\n<p>First symptom is brain fog, but I brushed off the disorientation as being overworked—ha, who isn’t, amirite? When the stuttering started, I was in complete denial. But the screaming. That’s the last symptom before your brain melts out through your eyes. This is it; I’m fucked.</p>\n<p>“Get dressed, baby, you’ll be late for work.”</p>\n<p>I smile, forced and tight and desperate to appear reassuring. Mamma clears out of the room I share with my sister—who’s at school by now—and I collapse back into bed. What am I going to do? How is this possible? There’s no point in going to work. Fuck that. But I need to get out of the house and <i>think</i>. I need Mamma to believe everything’s okay till I figure this out.</p>\n<p>So I throw on some clothes and grab some toast and my bag and head out the door like it’s just another work day. I’m halfway to the bus stop when I realize I forgot my phone and run back for it.</p>\n<p>It’s so hard to concentrate through the screaming. I almost walk into traffic twice, even with my headphones on. The music helps a little.</p>\n<p>I’m no billionaire—ha!—but somehow I’ve caught Billionaire’s Tears. Oh sure, it’s got some proper scientific name but no one calls it that. I’m not the first person with not a penny to her name and more debt than God to get this, but it has been getting rarer.</p>\n<p>There was a UN resolution about it or something. I don’t know. I work three jobs to help Mamma keep the lights on and the younger kids fed. I don’t have time for the news.</p>\n<p>It was kinda hard to ignore when the plague first started. It was all anyone talked about. A plague killing off all the billionaires? Right on! Gates was the first to go, Musk and Bezos not far behind. At first everyone thought it was poisonings or something.</p>\n<p>But then Taylor Swift got to the screaming, gave all her money to her fan club as one last thank you before she died, and then immediately recovered. Next thing you know, tycoons liquidating assets, giving shitloads of money to charity and transferring ownership of factories and whatever to the workers. Real estate robber barons participating in landback. Techbros buying up the student debt Biden didn’t get to, erasing medical debt, funding schools and building roads and museums and holy shit, right? The lotteries started up—Mamma’s been hoping to win one to get us out of poverty.</p>\n<p>Not all of them got rid of their money to save their own ass though. JKR decided it was a liberal conspiracy to make her give her money “to the trans myth” and yeah no one was sad when the plague made her finally eat shit. But it was the Saudis who first weaponized it: transferring their assets to rivals to kill them off. It worked, until everyone caught on. Then it was just rich assholes playing whack-a-mole with each other’s money hoards.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/07/24/escape-pod-1003-billionaires-tears/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I used to treat my life like a spreadsheet—color-coded, optimized, and every hour accounted for. If I could just find the right ratio of work to rest, ambition to stillness, I thought I’d arrive at some mythical version of balance. But the harder I tried to control it, the more elusive it became.</p>\n<p>For years, I believed balance meant perfect proportion: work and rest, ambition and stillness, discipline and ease. But lately, I’ve realized that balance isn’t the tightrope walk we’ve been told it is. It’s more of a softened discipline—an intentional equilibrium that holds space for both structure and surrender. It’s choosing what matters, while letting go of the illusion that everything should weigh the same.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Featured image from  our interview with Claire Zinnecker by Michelle Nash.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Woman lighting palo santo during her soft mornings routine.&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/soft-mornings/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/woman-lighting-palo-santo-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>How 30 Days of Soft Mornings Transformed the Way I View My Routine</h2>\n<p>In practice, that’s looked like aligning my days with my values rather than arbitrary benchmarks. Annie Dillard was right: “How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.” <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/walking-for-mental-health/\">A walk</a> counts as much as an email sent. <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/beautifully-written-books/\">Time with a book</a> matters as much as time in a meeting. </p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>The life I want isn’t built in giant leaps but in the quiet accumulation of these choices—the ones that make my hours feel like my own.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>For years, I bought into the myth that mornings had to be rigid, productive, and relentlessly optimized. But when I gave myself permission to slow down, I discovered something far more nourishing: space to actually feel awake before the world demanded anything of me.</p>\n<p>This story isn’t just about what shifted in my own life—it’s about how you can reshape your mornings, too. Ahead, I’ll share what soft mornings are, why I abandoned my 5 a.m. alarm, and how 30 days of this practice transformed the way I move through my day.</p>\n<h2>What are soft mornings?</h2>\n<p>Soft mornings are about beginning the day with gentleness rather than urgency. They’re not about hitting snooze until noon or tossing discipline out the window, but about creating space to arrive and orient yourself to the day.</p>\n<p>Instead of rushing to check notifications or diving straight into productivity mode, a soft morning prioritizes sensory rituals—the smell of coffee, a few quiet minutes on the porch, or the feel of a blanket pulled around your shoulders. It’s a conscious rejection of control in favor of presence.</p>\n<p>When you let softness lead, your mornings become less about achieving and more about attuning. You move from “How much can I get done before 9 a.m.?” to “What do I need to feel grounded as I begin?” For me, that shift changed everything.</p>\n<h2>Why I Gave Up My 5 A.M. Routine</h2>\n<p>For years, I bought into the idea that the earlier I woke up, the more successful I’d be. The 5 a.m. club promised productivity and a head start on the rest of the world. And while it did give me more hours, those hours often felt hollow—spent checking boxes rather than nourishing myself.</p>\n<p>I began to notice that rigidity was making me brittle. My mornings were efficient, yes, but they left little room for the messiness of being human. A bad night’s sleep meant the entire day felt like a failure. And if I didn’t follow my routine perfectly, the guilt would creep in.</p>\n<p>Instead, soft mornings helped me invite presence into my life. To see my mornings not as a race against the clock but as an invitation to slow down. And in doing so, I discovered that discipline doesn’t always mean pushing harder. Sometimes, it looks like loosening your grip.</p>\n<h2>What Changed</h2>\n<p>After 30 days, the most immediate shift was in my energy. Ironically, when I stopped forcing myself to get up at 5 a.m., I actually felt more awake. Giving myself permission to sleep until my body was ready meant I began my days rested rather than depleted.</p>\n<p>My focus also sharpened. Without the frantic scramble to make mornings “productive,” I entered work with a clearer mind. Those first slow moments—stretching, <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/journaling-tips/\">journaling</a>, sipping tea—acted like a buffer, softening the transition from rest to responsibility.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/soft-mornings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>We may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article.</p>\n<p>Summer has been all about embracing <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-be-more-spontaneous/\">spontaneity</a> and making the most of the long, sun-soaked days. It was filled with unforgettable family trips, time spent at our <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/renovation-diaries/japandi-guest-bedroom/\">Malibu house</a>, and diving deep into projects and passions of all sorts. As these summer days come to an end, there’s a certain bittersweet feeling that sweeps in with the cooler temps. On one hand, I’m saying goodbye to carefree afternoons by the pool. On the other, there’s something so satisfying about getting back into a routine. Autumn is a natural refresh, and it’s one of my favorite times of year to recommit to <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/healthy-daily-habits/\">healthy habits</a>, rituals, and fall routines that help me thrive.</p>\n<p>Back to school (work, social obligations, and the need for structure… ) marks the transition from summer’s ease to a busy season. My answer? <strong>I prioritize simplicity.</strong> Instead of saying yes to everything, paring back is my secret to success. And though it’s been a <i>while</i> since I’ve graduated, I love leaning hard into the back-to-school vibes.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Camille Styles sitting on desk.&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/fall-routines/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/camille-styles-standing-in-office-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Fall Routines to Inspire a Seasonal Refresh</h2>\n<p>I know you can relate when I say I’m craving a reset. Let’s be real: for those of us juggling work, family, and personal aspirations, the lazy days of summer have their charm, but there’s a certain satisfaction in reclaiming our schedules and getting things done.</p>\n<p>That’s where my fall routines come in—and my favorite products that inspire every area of my life. Across work, family, the home, and my personal time, there are endless opportunities to incorporate beautiful, <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/morning-routine/morning-routine-ideas/\">productivity-boosting</a> essentials into my every day. And because I like to pair my favorite products with intention, I’m going to show you how to reap the stress-free, joy-sparking benefits of a total fall refresh. Let’s dive in.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=How I’m Resetting for Fall (and the Small Rituals Making a Big Difference)&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/fall-routines/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/camille-styles-working-at-desk-1-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Getting Organized at Work</h2>\n<p>With the start of fall comes the official goodbye to summer Fridays and an easing back into a more structured work routine. But if you’re like me, the shift from beach vibes to business mode can feel a bit jarring. However, as with all of my fall routines, I like to see this as an opportunity to reset and refocus. Discover my fall routines for work that keep me focused and on-task.</p>\n<h3>Start with a fresh to-do list</h3>\n<p>One of my favorite strategies for boosting productivity is to start with a fresh to-do list, prioritizing tasks that will have the most impact. Think of it as your personal game plan for making the most of your day. And while you’re at it, carve out dedicated blocks of time for deep work, free from the ping of notifications. This has been game-changing for my workflow—your future self will thank you when you’re breezing through projects instead of scrambling at the last minute.</p>\n<h3>Prioritize a clean space</h3>\n<p>Messy space, chaotic mind—or however the saying goes. It’s so true though: how many times have you tried to step into productivity mode only to be distracted by the clutter all around you? While I like to do a deep clean of my office every few weeks, there are days when I just don’t have the time.</p>\n<p>When that’s the case, prioritize getting rid of visual clutter. All those sticky notes with outdated info? Recycle ’em. Is your pen holder filled with useless writing utensils? Get rid of them. Pro tip: I also like to use pretty storage boxes to contain the clutter. From there, keep out only what you need, with one or two beautiful and inspiring things thrown into the mix. (A <a href=\"https://casazuma.com/products/casa-zuma-vision-board-kit\">vision board</a> and vase with fresh blooms are my go-to’s.)</p>\n<h3>Style your office for aesthetic and functional comfort</h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/fall-routines/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Sound familiar? It’s one of the most common things I hear from <a href=\"https://wellnesswithedie.com/\">clients</a>. But here’s what most people don’t realize: cravings are often a clue from your gut, not a reflection of your willpower. In fact, gut health and sugar cravings go hand-in-hand. When your <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/gut-health/how-to-improve-gut-health/\">microbiome</a> is out of sync, it’s your body’s way of sending feedback. Which begs the question: why do we crave sugar at all? Let’s break down what’s really driving your cravings and how your gut plays a starring role.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=chocolate orange loaf cake_gut health sugar cravings&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/gut-health-sugar-cravings/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-865x1286.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake/\">\n        <graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"865\" height=\"1286\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-865x1286.jpg\" alt=\"chocolate orange loaf cake_gut health sugar cravings\" class=\"wp-image-291347\" data-pin-description=\"chocolate orange loaf cake_gut health sugar cravings\" srcset=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-865x1286.jpg 865w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-202x300.jpg 202w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-768x1142.jpg 768w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-1033x1536.jpg 1033w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-1377x2048.jpg 1377w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-150x223.jpg 150w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-scaled.jpg 1722w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Why We Crave Sugar</h2>\n<p>We tend to crave sugar because it’s <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/health/manage-blood-sugar/\">fast fuel</a>—especially when we’re running low on energy, stress is high, or our stomach is empty. But cravings go deeper than that. <a href=\"https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/sugar-disrupts-microbiome-eliminates-protection-against-obesity-and-diabetes\">Research</a> shows certain gut bacteria <i>feed</i> on sugar. When those microbes dominate your gut environment, they can communicate through the <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/gut-health/l-glutamine-and-gut-health/\">gut-brain axis</a> and nudge you toward sweet foods. It sounds wild, but in many ways, your microbiome can talk (and sugar is its language). All that to say, your cravings aren’t a moral failing. They’re a message.</p>\n<h2>The Gut-Sugar Connection</h2>\n<p>So, what’s actually happening inside your gut when sugar cravings strike?</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Microbial imbalance (dysbiosis).</strong>Too many<a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7284805/\">“sugar-loving” bacteria</a>and not enough diverse, beneficial strains can fuel cravings.</li>\n      <li><strong>Blood sugar swings.</strong>When gut health is off, nutrient absorption is compromised, making it harder to keep<a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/meal-plan-to-balance-blood-sugar/\">blood sugar stable</a>. Cue the rollercoaster of highs and lows.</li>\n      <li><strong>Serotonin production.</strong>Nearly 90% of serotonin (your<a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/health/hormones/dopamine-and-hormone-connection/\">feel-good hormone</a>) is made in the gut. If your gut bacteria aren’t thriving, mood dips can sneak in—and sugar often feels like a quick lift.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>In other words, gut health sugar cravings are real, and they’re rooted in both biology and psychology.</p>\n<h2>Wired for Sugar? Here’s What That Really Means</h2>\n<p>Here’s the reframe I wish I’d known sooner: sugar cravings aren’t proof you’re “bad” at healthy eating. They’re not a sign of weakness. They’re a signal. And signals are meant to be understood, not ignored. Instead of beating myself up when I craved something sweet, I started asking: <i>What’s out of balance?</i> Maybe I hadn’t eaten <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/protein/how-much-protein-do-i-need/\">enough protein</a>. Maybe my <a href=\"https://camillestyles.substack.com/p/4-changes-that-healed-my-gut-health\">gut was inflamed</a>. Or maybe I was just <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/morning-routine/how-to-relieve-stress-tips/\">stressed</a>, and my body wanted a quick serotonin hit. That curiosity shifted my relationship with cravings from shame to awareness.</p>\n<h2>Breaking the Sugar-Craving Cycle</h2>\n<p>Inevitably, the more sugar you eat, the more your body (and your gut microbes) want it. Sugar temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals like <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/dopamine-detox/\">dopamine</a>, which is why it can feel so irresistible. The hardest part isn’t just managing cravings once they hit. It’s preventing that first bite from triggering the cycle. The promising news? You don’t have to rely on willpower alone—there are practical, gut-focused strategies that help you reset cravings over time.</p>\n<h2>How to Rebalance Your Gut and Tame Sugar Cravings</h2>\n<p>Extreme measures aren’t required. You don’t need to <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/how-to-curb-sugar-cravings/\">quit sugar</a> altogether. Honestly, that kind of rigidity usually backfires anyway. Instead, supporting gut health naturally reduces the intensity and frequency of sugar cravings. Here’s what’s worked for me—and what the science backs up.</p>\n<h3>1. Prioritize a Protein-Rich Breakfast</h3>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/high-protein-breakfast/\">high-protein breakfast</a> stabilizes blood sugar and sets the tone for fewer cravings later in the day. If you currently start your morning with toast or a pastry, try swapping in Greek yogurt with berries and ground flaxseed, <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/quick-healthy-egg-recipes/\">eggs with veggies</a>, or a <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/high-protein-high-fiber-smoothie/\">protein smoothie</a> instead. You’ll notice more steady energy—and fewer mid-morning sugar urges.</p>\n<h3>2. Feed the Good Bugs</h3>\n<p>Your microbiome thrives on <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/gut-health/foods-for-gut-health/\">fiber-rich, prebiotic foods</a> (think oats, garlic, onions, asparagus, bananas). These help beneficial bacteria crowd out the sugar-lovers. Pair that with probiotic-rich foods like yogurt, sauerkraut, and kimchi to keep your gut ecosystem diverse.</p>\n<h3>3. Crowd Out Processed Sugar</h3>\n<p>Rather than focusing on restriction, start adding<i> in</i> nutrient-dense foods (namely, protein and fiber). You’ll naturally crowd out <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/unhealthy-snacks/\">ultra-processed snacks</a> and sugar-laden treats. <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7019570/\">Data</a> shows that within 2–4 weeks, you’ll likely notice your desire for refined sugar begins to decrease, and by 6–8 weeks, cravings can feel <i>significantly </i>more manageable (as your gut and blood sugar stabilize)!</p>\n<h3>4. Mind Your Stress (and Sleep)</h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/gut-health-sugar-cravings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She says:</p>\n    <p>“I grew up with Rocky Mountain Chocolate, as my dad is originally from Denver, Colorado. Especially during the winter, it was our treat and something we patiently looked forward to when we went to his home state and got to savor all of the hand-crafted creations,” Marcus said. “My parents’ particular favorite was the dark chocolate bark, often with almonds but sometimes different combinations with what was in season. At the time, of course, this was too grown-up for me, paling in comparison to chocolate-dipped honeycomb.”</p>\n    <p>This floral, nutrient-packed version is her grown-up ode to those moments—a bark that feels as nostalgic as it does elevated.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=pieces of chocolate bark_chocolate bark recipe&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/food/recipes/chocolate-bark-recipe/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chocolate-bark-recipe-pieces-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chocolate-bark-recipe-pieces-865x1297.jpg\" alt=\"pieces of chocolate bark_chocolate bark recipe\"/>\n    <p>In this recipe, rich dark chocolate meets bee pollen (a superfood packed with serious benefits), rose petals, and flaky Himalayan or Maldon salt for a flavor profile that honors Marcus’ childhood memories.

Most importantly, invest in a mallet so you can have fun smashing the bark,” Marcus said.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chocolate-bark-recipe-pieces-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"pieces of chocolate bark_chocolate bark recipe\"/>\n    <h2>Dark Chocolate Bark with Bee Pollen, Rose Petals, and Pink Salt</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Yield: 1–1/4 sheet tray 1x</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3>Description</h3>\n    <p>This chocolate bark recipe is an elevated twist on a nostalgic classic.</p>\n    <h3>Ingredients</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li>20 ounces dark chocolate (see tip)</li>\n      <li>3 tablespoons bee pollen</li>\n      <li>2 tablespoons crushed dried rose petals</li>\n      <li>2 tablespoons pink Himalayan salt or Maldon salt</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3>Instructions</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Line a quarter sheet pan with parchment paper and set aside, making sure you have enough room in your freezer to fit the tray later on.</li>\n      <li>Set up a double boiler on your stovetop to melt the chocolate or improvise one by setting a metal mixing bowl over a saucepan containing about 3 inches of water and bring to a boil. Once hot, put the chocolate into the upper pan or bowl and swirl the chocolate with a spatula just until fully melted.</li>\n      <li>Remove from the heat carefully and quickly, pouring onto the parchment-lined pan and gently spreading it evenly with the spatula. The goal is for the bark to be about 1/4 inch thick.

For the lowest-impact chocolate, choose Fair Trade, Fair for Life, non-GMO, and organic certifications. Buy from brands that know their suppliers and who are investing in agroforestry and producer communities, and support companies using compostable packaging. Two brands Marcus loves are Alter Eco and Good Sam.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/recipes/chocolate-bark-recipe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>We may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article.</p>\n<p>No matter your hair type, everyone can struggle with thinning hair. As someone with afro-textured hair, the first time I straightened it, I expected it to look as thick and full as it did in its natural curls. Reader, it did not. Since then, I’ve learned all the tricks of the trade to get naturally fuller, thicker hair. From extensions to <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/beauty/hair/best-thickening-hair-serums/\">hair thickening serums</a> to rice water treatments and more, I’ve tried it all. But to truly understand the science behind hair volume and density, I sought expert guidance to help me find the best hair thickening products.</p>\n<p>I spoke with Devin Graciano, hair stylist and Head of Product Development at <a href=\"https://goldielocks.com/\">Goldie Locks</a>. Graciano enlightened me about the difference between hair density and hair thickness. Density is the number of strands on your head, while thickness is the width of each strand. Collectively, both create the appearance of your hair volume. So, to achieve thicker hair, it’s key to understand your hair type, as well as what’s causing your hair’s thinness.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Featured image from  our interview with Babba Rivera by Belathée Photography.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=The Best Hair Thickening Products Worth Your Money, According to a Stylist&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/style/hair/best-hair-thickening-products/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/camille-styles-hair-thickening-products-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>How to Actually Get Thicker Hair, According to an Expert</h2>\n<p>Hair thickness is largely determined by genetics—but that doesn’t mean you can’t give your strands a boost. For naturally thinner hair, nourishing it inside and out is essential to keeping it healthy and full. If your hair is losing density, it could be due to aging (slower growth is normal over time), stress, childbirth, nutritional deficiencies, or genetic conditions like alopecia. Sometimes, a clogged scalp can also be the culprit—in which case, adding a scalp scrub to your routine can help stimulate circulation and encourage growth.</p>\n<p>With all these contributing factors to hair loss or thinning, many of us will likely ask ourselves: can you fake it until you make it? When it comes to creating texture and volume, you’re in luck. Read on for Graciano’s insights on the best hair thickening products to give your tresses a more voluminous look.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>As we get older, slower hair growth is normal and might result in thinning. Some people also experience hair loss from stress, childbirth, or nutritional deficiencies, as well as genetic conditions like alopecia.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<h2>Is there anything proven to thicken hair?</h2>\n<p>Countless studies have explored ways to achieve thicker hair—from boosting density to temporarily plumping each strand. While DIY methods abound, there are also proven ingredients worth seeking out when thicker, fuller hair is the goal.</p>\n<h2>Ingredients That Can Help Thicken Hair</h2>\n<p>Ingredients that show a great improvement in hair thickness include:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Saw palmetto</li>\n      <li>Rosemary</li>\n      <li>Scutellaria baicalensis</li>\n      <li>Soy</li>\n      <li>Wheat</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Boosting hair density involves looking at both internal and external factors. Hair is made of sulfur, iron, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, so getting enough of these key minerals is essential for new growth. Deficiencies, along with factors like <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-reduce-inflammation/\">inflammation</a>, poor diet, sleep, and hydration, can all show up in the health of your hair.</p>\n<h2>Do thickening products damage hair?</h2>\n<p>Generally speaking, no. Hair thickeners typically consist of either hair fibers that attach to the hair or water-soluble polymers that can’t overtake your hair’s overall integrity.</p>\n<h2>How long does it take for a hair thickener to work?</h2>\n<p>For styling products, results can be seen in minutes. These formulas coat the hair shaft, creating the appearance of thicker strands almost instantly. Ingredients like hydroxyethylcellulose can plump each hair fiber within a few minutes.</p>\n<p>When using supplements or treatments that target new growth, allow for a full hair growth cycle (around three months) before expecting visible results.</p>\n<h2>Daily Routines That Can Help Prevent Thinning</h2>\n<p>Consistency is key when it comes to thicker hair. In addition to using hair thickening products, try:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Taking a balanced hair supplement</strong>to support growth from within.</li>\n      <li><strong>Eating a nutrient-rich diet</strong>and staying hydrated.</li>\n      <li><strong>Managing stress</strong>, which can have a direct impact on hair shedding.</li>\n      <li><strong>Doing a daily scalp massage</strong>. Just four minutes can boost circulation and stimulate follicles.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> While genetics play a big role, the right combination of nutrition, lifestyle habits, and hair thickening products can help you achieve fuller, healthier-looking hair.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/hair/best-hair-thickening-products/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Through this lens, she reflects on our shared presence in the land — not through similarity, but through resonance across time, material, and memory.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/RahelehFilsoofi_2-1200x857.jpg?resize=1200%2C857&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>In her audio and video work, Filsoofi aims to render the land not as a silent backdrop, but as an active, sonic archive alive with the textures of wind, water, and human experience. In this spirit of immersion, Filsoofi created a book of dust poetry, inspired by the exhibition’s location adjacent to the Halsey Institute Library. Books are another vessel of memory, language, and reflection. Through poetry, Filsoofi gives voice to otherwise unspeakable threads of thought. This idea carries through her ceramic vessels, which honor the legacy of David Drake (Dave the Potter), an enslaved African American artisan who lived and worked in Edgefield, South Carolina. Drake inscribed his pots with poems that wove resistance into utility and embodied the radical potential of clay as both record and refusal, objects that speak even under conditions designed to silence. In using clay as legacy, Filsoofi asks the land to tell its story — her story, our story, the stories of all of those who moved across it.</p>\n    <p>Having lived and worked across nine Southern states over the last twenty years, Filsoofi’s experience informs her exploration of geography not only as a physical landscape but as a layered archive of labor, displacement, and survival. This exhibition offers a poetic excavation, a mapping of arrival and absence, a listening for the sounds that persist in soil. It honors the people, plants, and stories rooted in this region, while asking: What connects us across difference? What remains at the edge of arrival?</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>To learn more, visit </strong>\n      <strong>halsey.charleston.edu</strong>\n      <strong>.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/RahelehFilsoofi_3-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/RahelehFilsoofi_4-1200x858.jpg?resize=1200%2C858&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/RahelehFilsoofi_5-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038070/raheleh-filsoofi-at-the-edge-of-arrival/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Drawing from customary Diné practices of silversmithing, beading, and weaving, Riege (born 1994, Na’nízhoozhí [Gallup, New Mexico]) produces monumental mixed-media works that reference Diné mythology, the history of settler trading posts in the Navajo Nation, and “authenticity” as a value marker of Indigenous art and craft.</p>\n    <p>For <i>ojo|-|ólǫ́ ,</i> Riege has produced a new body of sculptures in conversation with Navajo blankets, silver jewelry, and dolls from two anthropological collections: Brown’s Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology, and the University of Washington’s Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture. Comprised of many varied works, from large-scale jewelry and tools to weavings made from unexpected materials, this exhibition embraces infidelity to colonial archives while celebrating ancestral traditions of labor contained within Indigenous-made objects.

    "body": "<p>“Who was Marian Spore Bush?” The question begins an essay by Bob Nickas, who curated the exhibition <a href=\"https://karmakarma.org/exhibitions/marian-spore-bush-2025-188-new-york/works/\"> Marian Spore Bush: Life Afterlife, Works c. 1919–1945</a>, currently at Karma. The artist’s first solo exhibition in almost 80 years, it feels extraordinarily modern in both style and content. Vivid, saturated watercolors of flowers and Christian allegories in the back room flirt with naïveté as much as they nod to art history. In the main space are large depictions of grim scenes (e.g., bodies immersed in water or on a raft, coupled with formidable avian creatures) that draw on the surreal and the grotesque.</p>\n<p>So, who was Spore Bush? She was born in 1878 in Bay City, Michigan. She studied dentistry at the University of Michigan and was among the state’s first woman dentists. After her mother died in 1919, she used a Ouija board to contact her, and began receiving messages from deceased artists urging her to take up painting. The next year, she left her dentistry practice and moved to New York to dedicate herself to art and charity work; while organizing a soup kitchen, she met and eventually married millionaire Irving Bush.</p>\n<p>It’s the kind of compelling narrative the art world — or just about any audience — devours: rags (or middle-class) to riches, spiritualism, obscurity, and rediscovery, all in one fascinating figure. Hilma af Klint’s 2018–19 Guggenheim survey resurfaced the narrative of the self-taught, visionary woman artist, often unknown to or forgotten by the art world until her posthumous or late-life “discovery,” as a popular trope. It’s easy to read Spore Bush’s story and situate her in this lineage, and the exhibition essay does so — along with af Klint, it cites Agnes Pelton, Emma Kunz, <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/661920/paulina-peavy-spiritualist-artist-who-channeled-a-ufo/\">Paulina Peavy</a>, and <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/991689/gertrude-abercrombie-american-surrealism/\">Gertrude Abercrombie</a>, disparate artists whose notable commonalities are their spiritualist leanings and their gender.</p>\n<p>There’s no doubt that Spore Bush and her work deserve recognition. But this framing, particularly when little literature on her exists, should raise some questions. Who acts as the discoverer, who tells the story, how do they tell it, and what are its ripple effects?</p>\n<p>Thematically, her late mostly grisaille paintings bring to mind a different set of artists, including Goya, Otto Dix, and Käthe Kollwitz, whose art addresses violence, struggle, and salvation. Stylized birds occupy the bulk of the composition in multiple pieces from 1933 to ’43. In the United States, those dates span the Great Depression and midway through World War II, a fraught period rich with those same themes.</p>\n<p>In “The Gaunt Bird of Famine” (1933) — a stunning painting, but not the show’s most dramatic — a giant whitish bird, rendered in thin gossamer lines that arc into<strong> </strong>graceful points, looms large against a solid black sky. Below, in the same dirty white, is what looks like a village. Spore Bush articulates it loosely and thickly, but realistically enough that it feels separate from the sky. The divide suggests a symbolic menace sweeping over the real world.</p>\n<p>Two similarly striking birds, rendered in black against a cloudy gray sky, nearly meet at the center of “The Pawn Broker (Three Vultures),” from the following year. Below the rigid horizon line is a body of black water. A face, just above the surface, looks up at the birds, fearfully or dolefully; chains are visible around the person’s neck. The show’s standout is “The Avengers” (1943). Here, a winged figure flies close to a dead tree, from which three bodies hang. The dark, undulating ground resembles both earth and water, a stark contrast with the oceanic turquoise sky.</p>\n<p>Spore Bush herself described her art as prophetic and guided by the spiritual forces she called “They” or “the People.” Edward Alden Jewell’s 1943 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1943/05/19/archives/mrs-irving-t-bush-to-open-exhibition-artist-with-psychic-powers.html\"> New York Times</a> review, for instance, quotes her as saying: “They move my hand up and down and onward across and sideways in all directions.” Though this automatic process might echo that of af Klint, Peavy, and others, defaulting to such comparisons defangs the art and erases its cultural context. A more substantive comparison is the oversized vultures that recur in Goya’s </p>\n<p><i>Disasters of War</i>print cycle (1810–20), in works like “</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://fristartmuseum.org/exhibition/goya-the-disasters-of-war/#lg=1&amp;slide=4\">The Carnivorous Vulture</a>” and “</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038749/marian-spore-bush-was-nobodys-visionary-artist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Four decades after dozens of culturally significant objects were stolen from the Santa Ana Pueblo in New Mexico, a team of Tribal investigators has pledged to bring the missing items back home.</p>\n<p>In August 1984, the Santa Ana Pueblo (Tamaya in the Keresan language) was plagued by a 10-month-long string of burglaries. Thieves looted pottery, war shields, clothing, drums, baskets, and rugs from homes in this Native American community situated on the Rio Grande, about 20 miles north of Albuquerque. The Pueblo, generally closed to the public, opens its doors on rare occasions such as feast days, and the first thefts took place shortly after one such event.</p>\n<p>“This is particularly heartbreaking because these people took ceremonial items actively being used,” Shannon O’Loughlin (Choctaw), chief executive of the Association on American Indian Affairs, told<i> Hyperallergic</i>.</p>\n<p>The robberies continued until a sting operation in May 1985. According to court records obtained by the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/native-american-stolen-artifacts-santa-ana-pueblo-75e8271e9bb7b27778f46eb5fbfca5c8\"> Associated Press</a>, the architect of the plot was an Albuquerque-based dealer of Native American artifacts who recruited members of a nearby pueblo to infiltrate the historic village. Although the perpetrators were caught, little effort was made to recover the stolen artifacts by the FBI and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), the agencies that oversaw the case. (A spokesperson for the FBI Albuquerque Division told </p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>that “attempts to recover stolen items have been made.”</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>submitted a FOIA request for additional details.)</p>\n<p>Last fall, however, a team from the Santa Ana Pueblo took it upon themselves to track down the roughly 150 looted objects, working meticulously to return them to their rightful owners, one by one.</p>\n<p>“Memories of the thefts and the loss of cultural heritage items still weighed heavily on the community,” said Monica Murrell, director of the Santa Ana Pueblo’s Historic Preservation Department. The Pueblo tapped William Woody, a former “top cop” at the Bureau of Land Management, to join the search. Woody’s experience with cases involving the Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA) and Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) was key, and “teaming up created a synergy,” Murrell said. “Woody brings a law enforcement angle, we bring technical expertise as preservation specialists.”</p>\n<p>The task force also includes Pueblo members Jarrett Lujan and Thomas Armijo, grandson of the Pueblo’s governor, Myron Armijo, who told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that their family lost a war shield, ceramics, pottery, and jewelry in the burglaries.</p>\n<p>Working with the often scant descriptions in case files obtained from the FBI and BIA, the team began scouring auction catalogues, gallery websites, and museum databases for similar objects. “We were looking for anything that suspiciously appeared on the market in the mid-1980s, items with no former provenance,” Murrell said. Notably, pottery made on the Santa Ana Pueblo was not commonly sold to outsiders, so the few examples that make it into the hands of dealers fetch relatively high prices.</p>\n<p>The team got a big break when they discovered that several of the stolen artifacts were later sold to Larry Frank, a collector and dealer of Native American art. Frank died in 2006, but his son Ross Frank, now a professor in the Department of Ethnic Studies at the University of California, San Diego, agreed to share his father’s ledgers with investigators, yielding invaluable clues to some of the missing objects’ current whereabouts.</p>\n<p>Their first victory was a bowl that, according to Frank’s records, had been sold to a local gallery. It was illustrated in an old catalogue and matched a case file description of a medium-sized bowl with triangle designs.

Then, you google everyone involved, get excited to chat with anyone who’s seen the movie in question, and find yourself still thinking about it weeks later. Here’s one movie from this year that did it for me…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sorry-baby-movie.jpg\" alt=\"sorry baby\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p><i> Sorry, Baby</i> bowled me over. Eva Victor’s directorial debut, which they also wrote and starred in, follows Agnes through a few years of her life, sequenced out of order. There’s “The Year With The Baby” and “The Year With The Really Good Sandwich,” but also “The Year With The Bad Thing.” When Eva shared the movie poster on Instagram, they confirmed that “nothing bad happens to the cat.”</p>\n    <p>Instead, it is Agnes to whom the bad thing happens. “I wrote this film because there’s a part of my experience of trauma that I haven’t seen on-screen often: the part where you’re confused,” Eva said during a <a href=\"https://www.sundance.org/blogs/give-me-the-backstory-get-to-know-eva-victor-the-writer-director-behind-sorry-baby/#:~:text=When%20awful%20things%20happen%20to,re%20not%20like%20everyone%20else.\">Sundance interview</a>. “I spent years floating, just trying to accept that I went through something bad.” The movie “honors those years lost,” as they put it. To write the script, Eva holed up in Maine one winter with their cat and many cans of split pea soup.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/try-this.gif\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>The warm friendship between Agnes and Lydie (Naomi Ackie) is the central love story animating the movie. But, as Lydie’s life carries her away from the small town where they met during grad school, Agnes feels stuck. Getting an impressive teaching job at the university means staying in a place marred by a devastating experience during her time as a student. “Bad thing” is a euphemism, but also, with its childlike clarity, a perfect description.</p>\n    <p>Offering a really moving portrait of trauma’s reverberations and one person’s recovery, <i>Sorry, Baby </i>is also very funny. In the theater, I laughed a lot and cried a little. I loved Agnes and would’ve been happy to spend a hundred years with her. Of the movie’s reception, Eva recently told the <i> L.A. Times</i>, “I keep hearing, ‘Oh, Agnes is so awkward.’ I’m like, ‘What the hell?’ I’m very humbled by people’s reactions to how bizarre they think that character is because I’m like: ‘Oh, I thought she was acting legitimately normal, but okay.’”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-02-at-4.01.57-PM.png\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>What’s been your favorite movie so far this year?

It was Jimmy’s first time in the U.S., and we were all beyond excited. This morning, Anton and I were reminiscing, and we thought we’d share photos…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/boys-playing.jpeg\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>Jimmy lives in a small seaside town in England, and <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/tag/anton/\">Anton</a> told me: “We were joking around, like, ‘Do you have cars in England? Do you have scooters in England? Do you have light in England? Do you have color in England?’ It was really funny. And sometimes when Jimmy would make a joke, we would be like, ‘Is that funny in England?’ But his jokes were actually really funny.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/louis-vuitton-suitcase-store.jpg\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>Jimmy asked to see a few sights, and we were happy to oblige. “Can we go to the <a href=\"https://40visuals.com/louis-vuittons-nyc-flagship-becomes-a-giant-stack-of-luxury-luggage/\">Louis Vuitton store</a> that looks like suitcases?” he asked. I didn’t even know this existed, but when we headed to 57th Street, there it was!</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/natural-history-museum-north-american-mammals.jpeg\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/natural-history-museum-gems.jpeg\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>We took him to the <a href=\"https://www.amnh.org/\">American Museum of Natural History</a>, one of our long-time favorite places…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/times-square.jpeg\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>…and to see Times Square at night, where Jimmy did a back flip for a crowd. “He taught himself to do flips in his backyard when he was six,” Anton told me. “He just fully went for it because he didn’t know the consequences were that he could get his neck snapped!”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/chelsea-piers-driving-range.png\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>The boys also begged me to take them to the <a href=\"https://sports.chelseapiers.com/new-york/chelsea/sports/golf/driving-range\">Chelsea Piers driving range</a>. They hit balls while I did the New Yorker crossword puzzle. “Jimmy told me he wants to ride in a yellow school bus,” Anton told me. “He’s never done that.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/boys-laughing.jpg\" alt=\"boys laughing\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>We also just mucked around at home…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/citibike-station-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"citibike boys\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>…and in the neighborhood. “When we were walking down the street, Jimmy was like, ‘Look at that, look at that,’ because there were so many different kinds of foods — Japanese, Lebanese, Thai, Italian, Vietnamese, French, Chinese, Indian, Ethiopian…” said Anton. “He also loved <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/04/style/frozen-yogurt-16-handles-ceo.html?unlocked_article_code=1.i08.DAQK.kOAZxI2rKWpo&amp;smid=url-share\">16 Handles</a>.” </p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cafe.jpg\" alt=\"Saturn Road Brooklyn\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>At the end of the week, <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/tag/toby/\">Toby</a> and <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2016/03/29/beauty-uniform-jean-goddard/\">my mom</a> joined us, and we went to a neighborhood café for coffee and magic tricks with cards. Jimmy showed us some cool ones, and I busted out <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2024/04/15/easy-magic-trick-for-kids/\">my old favorite</a>.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/boys.jpeg\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>Finally, on Sunday, my brother and Jimmy headed back to <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/tag/england-vacation/\">England</a>, and, honestly, we all felt really sad. It’s hard to live an ocean away from loved ones, as I’m sure many of you experience, as well. But we’re so lucky to be able to keep in touch. When <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2011/02/14/our-grandparents/\">my maternal grandmother</a> moved from Manchester, England, to Chicago with her new <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2011/02/14/our-grandparents/\">soldier husband</a>, she could only exchange letters with her parents, until they visited many years later. Where do your relatives live? Are you close by? Half a world apart? How do you stay in touch? I’d love to hear. I know there are pros and cons to every arrangement. xoxo</p>\n    <p>P.S. <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2021/10/28/favorite-experiences-nyc/\">Holy smokes, I’ve lived in NYC for 20+ years</a>, and <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2023/03/27/best-kids-activities-nyc/\">six NYC itineraries for kids</a>.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/09/02/nyc-trip-with-preteens-teens-boys/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Tonight my kids piled into our bed to watch family videos from our favorites album on the iPad. I eventually put an end to it, even as they begged for more. I was stressed about bedtime, and tired…oh so tired. Grace, you gave me a bit of perspective I needed tonight. Even in my stress and stupor, I know these are the days I will miss the most.</p>\n<p>The perfect post to come upon, toddler asleep next to me, as I again question when it was that he was no longer a “baby”—knowing that he’ll always be my baby, even when he no longer sleeps beside me, even as we pass other families with baby babies at the grocery store while my baby walks by my side, even when he one day grows taller than me—knowing this day will come sooner than my heart will be ready for, and I’ll reminisce in the grocery aisle, maybe tear up or put my hand over my aching mama heart, then I’ll buy the chips. Thank you, Grace, for the important and meaningful work you do, always.</p>\n<p>I’m not much of a singer, but this makes me glad that I recorded myself reading The Gruffalo for my 4 year old’s Yoto player 🥹</p>\n<p>Love this. Definitely in the interminable bedtime universe and trying to savor it. My three year old calls out a lot and night and requests me to hold her hand. ❤️ but yes, sometimes my sanity is called into question in this season with two littles.</p>\n<p>Sitting here tearing up ( ok sobbing ) in the teriyaki place picking up an order for my daughter’s birthday celebration while she’s at my house with my son in law waiting for me. 37 years ago at this time she was not even a day old yet. Sweet sweet memories. This post by Grace is beautiful. I DID cherish every second, and still do. It was just yesterday, wasn’t it ?</p>\n<p>Sob! Beautiful comment too</p>\n<p>So excited to receive a text from 12yo almost 13, asking if I was going to shops and if I am can I get snacks so we can have snacks and watch a show. Any better Friday night invite?? No way. on the list maltesers, gum and chips. Hooray for chips.</p>\n<p>so fun!!</p>\n<p>My song for my oldest was “Sweet Baby James” and when it comes on we just look at each other and have a sweet moment of connection.</p>\n<p>More chips! So true. Anything salty.</p>\n<p>We’re out of the lullaby phase (I Don’t Want to Live on the Moon from Sesame Street was my go-to) but I did just rock out to Safe &amp; Sound with my 2nd grader. I’ll be sure to cherish it all, even when he’s asked Alexa to play it for the trillionth time.</p>\n<p>I had a song list that I sang to all of my kids when they were small. They fell asleep or calmed down if I started singing the songs. They’re all mostly grown now but they talk abt the songs sometimes. I miss singing to them and also reading to them. I read classic chapter books to them when they were in elementary school and had voices for all the characters. It was so fun. I miss it so much. Rocking them, reading to them, and singing to them…it went by so fast. I’ve had more years not doing those things with them now than doing them.</p>\n<p>In the twinkling of your eye, they are 18, 21,35, 42, now my son is 53….</p>\n<p>Man is this true. There is a card that is often on the rack right by the check out at the grocery store by me – it says “I blinked and you grew up”. I literally start crying in the check out aisle every time. I would give anything for one more little boy bedtime snuggle – mine are 24 and 26 now and well launched.</p>\n<p>My heart!</p>\n<p>This hits home.<br/>\nWe are dripping our daughter at college this weekend and moving her in.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/08/29/a-letter-to-you/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

My go-to store for anything special is <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/vintanthromodern/\">Vintanthro</a> in New Haven. They remember who I am, they know my kids. They’ll be like, tell us about your upcoming event! It’s an old-school shopping experience, where they pull stuff and accessorize, and they’re just so excited for me.”</p>\n<p>“Then there’s Goodwill. You might come away with nothing, and you have to do it regularly. I go at least once a week with my kids. These days I’m into vintage sweatshirts and short-sleeve button downs, so I’ll just head to those sections because otherwise it can get overwhelming. It also depends on where you live — I’m lucky because I live in Connecticut and the Goodwills are super good here.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Tank:  similar. Skirt: similar.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“These days, for my hair, I’m doing the whole shower-then-keep-it-wet-and-don’t-touch-it-and-put-in-<a href=\"https://amzn.to/4mzppyx\">Perfect-Hair-Day-by-Living-Proof-5-in-1-Styling-Treatment</a> thing. It feels like a movement right now.”</p>\n<p>“Being a therapist is SUCH a good job. There’s something about listening to someone’s story for a full hour; I don’t think we get to do that a lot in life. I try to understand exactly what each person is saying. If they say the word ‘weird’ or ‘you know what I mean,’ I’ll push to make sure I’m not making assumptions. I have to be careful with my kids because I don’t want them to feel like they’re always in a therapy session. Sometimes I’ll ask, do you want me to offer therapy advice or do you want me to be a mom right now? If they want me to be a mom, I’ll just say ‘that’s hard’ and validate them.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Tee: thrifted. Overalls: thrifted, “handed down from my son, it’s the best having sons who are into thrifting,”  similar. Sneakers: Converse.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“I have a bee tattoo. First, because my last name is ‘Beesley,” and also because I went through a transition period, where I went from being Mormon to being not-Mormon and from being a stay-at-home mom to attending grad school for therapy. I had a lot of feelings about how Mormon women couldn’t hold higher leadership roles, whereas bee hives are matriarchal. A few days before I started at Columbia, I had a few hours before I needed to pick up my kids from school. There are a million walk-in tattoo places in New York, so I picked one and got it. It was a thrill. The only problem with the tattoo is that it’s on every pillow from T.J. Maxx to Michaels.”</p>\n<p>“As a kid, I was obsessed with gymnastics, and then I didn’t have an obsession for a long time, and now gardening has filled that space. My favorite things are watching gardening shows, reading gardening books, thinking about my garden, planting my garden, and watching my garden grow. My flowers cover the front yard, and I want to give our neighbors an experience — almost like an art installation, mimicking a field of wildflowers in the suburbs! It makes me happy to see people walk or drive more slowly as they pass by. I expect some flowers to get smashed or picked by toddlers — and I want them to. I should put out a sign that says, ‘Please touch.'”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Tank:  Old Navy. Leggings: Old Navy. Sneakers: Nike. Dog: “Pluto, the love of my life.”</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“I have a gap between my front teeth. Over the years, I’ve spent thousands of dollars trying to fix it — Invisalign, braces, porcelain veneers, temporary retainers, a permanent retainer — and finally, I was like, I’m not fighting this anymore. It only took me 40 years to embrace it, but now I love my gap.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/08/28/sharon-beesley-therapist-outfits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Are you the same? It always impresses me, and I love to sit at the counter, do the New Yorker crossword puzzle, and watch him in action.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/freddie.jpg\" alt=\"freddie\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>This summer, one of the meals he whipped up was spaghetti with tomato sauce, a green salad, and baked shrimp. A few readers asked about the shrimp, so I called Freddie this morning, and he told me the steps. Here goes:</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Baked Shrimp\nby Freddie</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>“My dad is a great cook, and one thing I’ve learned from him is how to make multiple courses at home and make it feel special. In our Italian-American family, macaroni is always part of the meal, always with a homemade sauce — that’s a point of pride. (Regardless of what kind of noodle it is — usually penne or ziti — we call it ‘macaroni.’) For this specific dinner, I was trying to make something easy, so I could hang out with my parents and Joanna. Sliding a big tray of shrimp into the oven was a good way to do that.”</p>\n    <p>You’ll need:<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.instacart.com/products/17008043-ahold-cooked-shrimp-jumbo-tail-on-26-30-16-0-oz\">bag of frozen, pre-cooked shrimp</a><br/>\nflour<br/>\nsalt<br/>\npepper<br/>\neggs<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.bjs.com/product/4c-foods-japanese-style-panko-plain-bread-crumbs-2-pk25-oz/3000000000000990662\">panko bread crumbs</a><br/>\nspices, like paprika, garlic powder, onion powder (optional)<br/>\nolive oil<br/>\nlemon</p>\n    <p>Non-recipe recipe:</p>\n    <p>Preheat oven to 350F. Defrost the shrimp. Pull off the tails (if they still have tails) and pat dry.</p>\n    <p>Set out your standard three plates: flour (you can salt and pepper the flour, too, if you’d like; Gordon Ramsay seasons almost every layer with salt and pepper; it seems like such a small thing but it really helps the final product), egg wash, and panko bread crumbs (seasoned, if you’d like, with paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper). Gently coat each shrimp in flour, then egg; then press the shrimp into the bread crumbs.</p>\n    <p>Put tin foil on a baking sheet and spread a thin layer of olive oil on top of the tin foil. Arrange the shrimp in a single layer on the foil. Then drizzle a little oil on top of the shrimp.</p>\n    <p>Bake in oven for 10-15 minutes. Before serving, drizzle lemon juice on top of shrimp.</p>\n    <p>Serve with pasta with tomato sauce and green salad, if you’d like. You can eat the shrimp with the pasta or separately — breaded shrimp and red sauce can be so, so good.

Then, you google everyone involved, get excited to chat with anyone who’s seen the movie in question, and find yourself still thinking about it weeks later. Here’s one movie from this year that did it for me…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sorry-baby-movie.jpg\" alt=\"sorry baby\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p><i> Sorry, Baby</i> bowled me over. Eva Victor’s directorial debut, which they also wrote and starred in, follows Agnes through a few years of her life, sequenced out of order. There’s “The Year With The Baby” and “The Year With The Really Good Sandwich,” but also “The Year With The Bad Thing.” When Eva shared the movie poster on Instagram, they confirmed that “nothing bad happens to the cat.”</p>\n    <p>Instead, it is Agnes to whom the bad thing happens. “I wrote this film because there’s a part of my experience of trauma that I haven’t seen on-screen often: the part where you’re confused,” Eva said during a <a href=\"https://www.sundance.org/blogs/give-me-the-backstory-get-to-know-eva-victor-the-writer-director-behind-sorry-baby/#:~:text=When%20awful%20things%20happen%20to,re%20not%20like%20everyone%20else.\">Sundance interview</a>. “I spent years floating, just trying to accept that I went through something bad.” The movie “honors those years lost,” as they put it. To write the script, Eva holed up in Maine one winter with their cat and many cans of split pea soup.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/try-this.gif\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>The warm friendship between Agnes and Lydie (Naomi Ackie) is the central love story animating the movie. But, as Lydie’s life carries her away from the small town where they met during grad school, Agnes feels stuck. Getting an impressive teaching job at the university means staying in a place marred by a devastating experience during her time as a student. “Bad thing” is a euphemism, but also, with its childlike clarity, a perfect description.</p>\n    <p>Offering a really moving portrait of trauma’s reverberations and one person’s recovery, <i>Sorry, Baby </i>is also very funny. In the theater, I laughed a lot and cried a little. I loved Agnes and would’ve been happy to spend a hundred years with her. Of the movie’s reception, Eva recently told the <i> L.A. Times</i>, “I keep hearing, ‘Oh, Agnes is so awkward.’ I’m like, ‘What the hell?’ I’m very humbled by people’s reactions to how bizarre they think that character is because I’m like: ‘Oh, I thought she was acting legitimately normal, but okay.’”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-02-at-4.01.57-PM.png\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>What’s been your favorite movie so far this year?

It was Jimmy’s first time in the U.S., and we were all beyond excited. This morning, Anton and I were reminiscing, and we thought we’d share photos…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/boys-playing.jpeg\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>Jimmy lives in a small seaside town in England, and <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/tag/anton/\">Anton</a> told me: “We were joking around, like, ‘Do you have cars in England? Do you have scooters in England? Do you have light in England? Do you have color in England?’ It was really funny. And sometimes when Jimmy would make a joke, we would be like, ‘Is that funny in England?’ But his jokes were actually really funny.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/louis-vuitton-suitcase-store.jpg\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>Jimmy asked to see a few sights, and we were happy to oblige. “Can we go to the <a href=\"https://40visuals.com/louis-vuittons-nyc-flagship-becomes-a-giant-stack-of-luxury-luggage/\">Louis Vuitton store</a> that looks like suitcases?” he asked. I didn’t even know this existed, but when we headed to 57th Street, there it was!</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/natural-history-museum-north-american-mammals.jpeg\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/natural-history-museum-gems.jpeg\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>We took him to the <a href=\"https://www.amnh.org/\">American Museum of Natural History</a>, one of our long-time favorite places…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/times-square.jpeg\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>…and to see Times Square at night, where Jimmy did a back flip for a crowd. “He taught himself to do flips in his backyard when he was six,” Anton told me. “He just fully went for it because he didn’t know the consequences were that he could get his neck snapped!”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/chelsea-piers-driving-range.png\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>The boys also begged me to take them to the <a href=\"https://sports.chelseapiers.com/new-york/chelsea/sports/golf/driving-range\">Chelsea Piers driving range</a>. They hit balls while I did the New Yorker crossword puzzle. “Jimmy told me he wants to ride in a yellow school bus,” Anton told me. “He’s never done that.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/boys-laughing.jpg\" alt=\"boys laughing\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>We also just mucked around at home…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/citibike-station-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"citibike boys\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>…and in the neighborhood. “When we were walking down the street, Jimmy was like, ‘Look at that, look at that,’ because there were so many different kinds of foods — Japanese, Lebanese, Thai, Italian, Vietnamese, French, Chinese, Indian, Ethiopian…” said Anton. “He also loved <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/04/style/frozen-yogurt-16-handles-ceo.html?unlocked_article_code=1.i08.DAQK.kOAZxI2rKWpo&amp;smid=url-share\">16 Handles</a>.” </p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cafe.jpg\" alt=\"Saturn Road Brooklyn\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>At the end of the week, <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/tag/toby/\">Toby</a> and <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2016/03/29/beauty-uniform-jean-goddard/\">my mom</a> joined us, and we went to a neighborhood café for coffee and magic tricks with cards.

It’s hard to live an ocean away from loved ones, as I’m sure many of you experience, as well. But we’re so lucky to be able to keep in touch. When <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2011/02/14/our-grandparents/\">my maternal grandmother</a> moved from Manchester, England, to Chicago with her new <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2011/02/14/our-grandparents/\">soldier husband</a>, she could only exchange letters with her parents, until they visited many years later. Where do your relatives live? Are you close by? Half a world apart? How do you stay in touch? I’d love to hear. I know there are pros and cons to every arrangement. xoxo</p>\n    <p>P.S. <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2021/10/28/favorite-experiences-nyc/\">Holy smokes, I’ve lived in NYC for 20+ years</a>, and <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2023/03/27/best-kids-activities-nyc/\">six NYC itineraries for kids</a>.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/09/02/nyc-trip-with-preteens-teens-boys/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Tonight my kids piled into our bed to watch family videos from our favorites album on the iPad. I eventually put an end to it, even as they begged for more. I was stressed about bedtime, and tired…oh so tired. Grace, you gave me a bit of perspective I needed tonight. Even in my stress and stupor, I know these are the days I will miss the most.</p>\n<p>The perfect post to come upon, toddler asleep next to me, as I again question when it was that he was no longer a “baby”—knowing that he’ll always be my baby, even when he no longer sleeps beside me, even as we pass other families with baby babies at the grocery store while my baby walks by my side, even when he one day grows taller than me—knowing this day will come sooner than my heart will be ready for, and I’ll reminisce in the grocery aisle, maybe tear up or put my hand over my aching mama heart, then I’ll buy the chips. Thank you, Grace, for the important and meaningful work you do, always.</p>\n<p>I’m not much of a singer, but this makes me glad that I recorded myself reading The Gruffalo for my 4 year old’s Yoto player 🥹</p>\n<p>Love this. Definitely in the interminable bedtime universe and trying to savor it. My three year old calls out a lot and night and requests me to hold her hand. ❤️ but yes, sometimes my sanity is called into question in this season with two littles.</p>\n<p>Sitting here tearing up ( ok sobbing ) in the teriyaki place picking up an order for my daughter’s birthday celebration while she’s at my house with my son in law waiting for me. 37 years ago at this time she was not even a day old yet. Sweet sweet memories. This post by Grace is beautiful. I DID cherish every second, and still do. It was just yesterday, wasn’t it ?</p>\n<p>Sob! Beautiful comment too</p>\n<p>So excited to receive a text from 12yo almost 13, asking if I was going to shops and if I am can I get snacks so we can have snacks and watch a show. Any better Friday night invite?? No way. on the list maltesers, gum and chips. Hooray for chips.</p>\n<p>so fun!!</p>\n<p>My song for my oldest was “Sweet Baby James” and when it comes on we just look at each other and have a sweet moment of connection.</p>\n<p>More chips! So true. Anything salty.</p>\n<p>We’re out of the lullaby phase (I Don’t Want to Live on the Moon from Sesame Street was my go-to) but I did just rock out to Safe &amp; Sound with my 2nd grader. I’ll be sure to cherish it all, even when he’s asked Alexa to play it for the trillionth time.</p>\n<p>I had a song list that I sang to all of my kids when they were small. They fell asleep or calmed down if I started singing the songs. They’re all mostly grown now but they talk abt the songs sometimes. I miss singing to them and also reading to them. I read classic chapter books to them when they were in elementary school and had voices for all the characters. It was so fun. I miss it so much. Rocking them, reading to them, and singing to them…it went by so fast. I’ve had more years not doing those things with them now than doing them.</p>\n<p>In the twinkling of your eye, they are 18, 21,35, 42, now my son is 53….</p>\n<p>Man is this true. There is a card that is often on the rack right by the check out at the grocery store by me – it says “I blinked and you grew up”. I literally start crying in the check out aisle every time. I would give anything for one more little boy bedtime snuggle – mine are 24 and 26 now and well launched.</p>\n<p>My heart!</p>\n<p>This hits home.<br/>\nWe are dripping our daughter at college this weekend and moving her in.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/08/29/a-letter-to-you/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Here, Sharon shares five outfits she wore in a week, including thrifted dresses, gardening overalls, and her favorite swimsuit…</p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sharon-dress-4.jpg\" alt=\"Sharon Beesley's Week of Outfits\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Dress: thrifted. Hair clips:  French combs. Shoes: Comfortiva.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“I thrift almost all my clothes, including this dress. My go-to store for anything special is <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/vintanthromodern/\">Vintanthro</a> in New Haven. They remember who I am, they know my kids. They’ll be like, tell us about your upcoming event! It’s an old-school shopping experience, where they pull stuff and accessorize, and they’re just so excited for me.”</p>\n<p>“Then there’s Goodwill. You might come away with nothing, and you have to do it regularly. I go at least once a week with my kids. These days I’m into vintage sweatshirts and short-sleeve button downs, so I’ll just head to those sections because otherwise it can get overwhelming. It also depends on where you live — I’m lucky because I live in Connecticut and the Goodwills are super good here.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Tank:  similar. Skirt: similar.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“These days, for my hair, I’m doing the whole shower-then-keep-it-wet-and-don’t-touch-it-and-put-in-<a href=\"https://amzn.to/4mzppyx\">Perfect-Hair-Day-by-Living-Proof-5-in-1-Styling-Treatment</a> thing. It feels like a movement right now.”</p>\n<p>“Being a therapist is SUCH a good job. There’s something about listening to someone’s story for a full hour; I don’t think we get to do that a lot in life. I try to understand exactly what each person is saying. If they say the word ‘weird’ or ‘you know what I mean,’ I’ll push to make sure I’m not making assumptions. I have to be careful with my kids because I don’t want them to feel like they’re always in a therapy session. Sometimes I’ll ask, do you want me to offer therapy advice or do you want me to be a mom right now? If they want me to be a mom, I’ll just say ‘that’s hard’ and validate them.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Tee: thrifted. Overalls: thrifted, “handed down from my son, it’s the best having sons who are into thrifting,”  similar. Sneakers: Converse.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“I have a bee tattoo. First, because my last name is ‘Beesley,” and also because I went through a transition period, where I went from being Mormon to being not-Mormon and from being a stay-at-home mom to attending grad school for therapy. I had a lot of feelings about how Mormon women couldn’t hold higher leadership roles, whereas bee hives are matriarchal. A few days before I started at Columbia, I had a few hours before I needed to pick up my kids from school. There are a million walk-in tattoo places in New York, so I picked one and got it. It was a thrill. The only problem with the tattoo is that it’s on every pillow from T.J. Maxx to Michaels.”</p>\n<p>“As a kid, I was obsessed with gymnastics, and then I didn’t have an obsession for a long time, and now gardening has filled that space. My favorite things are watching gardening shows, reading gardening books, thinking about my garden, planting my garden, and watching my garden grow. My flowers cover the front yard, and I want to give our neighbors an experience — almost like an art installation, mimicking a field of wildflowers in the suburbs! It makes me happy to see people walk or drive more slowly as they pass by. I expect some flowers to get smashed or picked by toddlers — and I want them to. I should put out a sign that says, ‘Please touch.'”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Tank:  Old Navy. Leggings: Old Navy. Sneakers: Nike. Dog: “Pluto, the love of my life.”</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“I have a gap between my front teeth. Over the years, I’ve spent thousands of dollars trying to fix it — Invisalign, braces, porcelain veneers, temporary retainers, a permanent retainer — and finally, I was like, I’m not fighting this anymore. It only took me 40 years to embrace it, but now I love my gap.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/08/28/sharon-beesley-therapist-outfits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Are you the same? It always impresses me, and I love to sit at the counter, do the New Yorker crossword puzzle, and watch him in action.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/freddie.jpg\" alt=\"freddie\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>This summer, one of the meals he whipped up was spaghetti with tomato sauce, a green salad, and baked shrimp. A few readers asked about the shrimp, so I called Freddie this morning, and he told me the steps. Here goes:</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Baked Shrimp\nby Freddie</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>“My dad is a great cook, and one thing I’ve learned from him is how to make multiple courses at home and make it feel special. In our Italian-American family, macaroni is always part of the meal, always with a homemade sauce — that’s a point of pride. (Regardless of what kind of noodle it is — usually penne or ziti — we call it ‘macaroni.’) For this specific dinner, I was trying to make something easy, so I could hang out with my parents and Joanna. Sliding a big tray of shrimp into the oven was a good way to do that.”</p>\n    <p>You’ll need:<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.instacart.com/products/17008043-ahold-cooked-shrimp-jumbo-tail-on-26-30-16-0-oz\">bag of frozen, pre-cooked shrimp</a><br/>\nflour<br/>\nsalt<br/>\npepper<br/>\neggs<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.bjs.com/product/4c-foods-japanese-style-panko-plain-bread-crumbs-2-pk25-oz/3000000000000990662\">panko bread crumbs</a><br/>\nspices, like paprika, garlic powder, onion powder (optional)<br/>\nolive oil<br/>\nlemon</p>\n    <p>Non-recipe recipe:</p>\n    <p>Preheat oven to 350F. Defrost the shrimp. Pull off the tails (if they still have tails) and pat dry.</p>\n    <p>Set out your standard three plates: flour (you can salt and pepper the flour, too, if you’d like; Gordon Ramsay seasons almost every layer with salt and pepper; it seems like such a small thing but it really helps the final product), egg wash, and panko bread crumbs (seasoned, if you’d like, with paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper). Gently coat each shrimp in flour, then egg; then press the shrimp into the bread crumbs.</p>\n    <p>Put tin foil on a baking sheet and spread a thin layer of olive oil on top of the tin foil. Arrange the shrimp in a single layer on the foil. Then drizzle a little oil on top of the shrimp.</p>\n    <p>Bake in oven for 10-15 minutes. Before serving, drizzle lemon juice on top of shrimp.</p>\n    <p>Serve with pasta with tomato sauce and green salad, if you’d like. You can eat the shrimp with the pasta or separately — breaded shrimp and red sauce can be so, so good.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>\n      <strong>By David Sydney</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>It had to happen some time and some place. Who knew the bizarre quantum entanglement would occur in Mel’s small, disordered bathroom with its cracked mirror and wet towels? Mel reused his towels until they were thoroughly soaked. Only then would he put them in his dryer, which sounded like a threshing machine.</p>\n    <p>All the fundamental particles composing Mel suddenly, almost miraculously, and for reasons unknown, arranged themselves into the form of a Minotaur in the mirror. Entanglement between someone like Mel and a mythological creature will occur ultimately in this universe, given enough throws of the quantum dice. It just so happened to be on that Thursday.</p>\n    <p>So, Mel looked into his mirror and saw, blinking back, a gruesome, enraged bull’s head, salivating onto its massive, human chest.</p>\n    <p>And the Minotaur, from the other side of the mirror, attached to Mel’s inexpensive wallboard, saw something, well, he saw Mel. The creature’s eyes dilated. One moment, it had been in a dark, dank Labyrinth, waiting for its next sacrificial victim. And the next, as it stared into the mirror, it saw an off-kilter face, barely covered with ineffective shaving cream, grimacing from the cuts of a dull disposable razor. Why hadn’t he disposed of it at least a week before? And what kind of torn underwear was Mel wearing?</p>\n    <p>Few things in this universe are as fearsome as a Minotaur. Few, as monstrous or as vicious. Everyone fears the Minotaur. If you were up against a T-Rex or a MInotaur, which would you choose? The T-Rex would be my choice—there’s a much better chance of survival.</p>\n    <p>By nature, the Minotaur is violent. Extremely so. It subsists on victims sacrificed to it. Staring into the mirror—that is, into the labyrinth—Mel saw partially decomposing carcasses and whitening bones. He worked in his Uncle Leo’s coin-operated laundromat. The Labyrinth and the supply room of the laundromat were remarkably similar. Sacrificial bodies are one thing. But how about his Uncle’s mops, leaky buckets, solidified bleach packets, and broken laundry carts?</p>\n    <p>Mel’s shaving cream was as cheap as his razors. His Uncle didn’t pay much. The best way to learn, to get anywhere in this world, Uncle Leo claimed, was to start by working at the bottom for dirt wages. The whole point of a coin-operated laundromat, according to his Uncle, was to get rid of dirt.</p>\n    <p>Even though Mel had rubbed some shaving cream into his eyes— he was that kind of shaver — he could see that the Labyrinth was a dirty place. It’s one thing to nick yourself with a dull blade, to bleed into an inexpensive lather. It’s another thing to come eye to eye with a Minotaur.</p>\n    <p>Yet the Minotaur and the labyrinth seemed a kind of relief from the customers and unwashed laundry at his Uncle’s place. Mel had another day of mopping floors ahead of him. The Labyrinth? He’d dealt with dirt like that plenty of times.</p>\n    <p>And the Minotaur?</p>\n    <p>Well, a lot of coin-operated laundry customers might as well have bull heads. They are pathology attached to their dirty clothes. They are the epitome of tough customers.</p>\n    <p>Had the Minotaur been up against anything like this, however? That is, Mel? And the bathroom? It was shocking to see Mel’s face blinking back at it, squinting to get a better look. And there on the floor, the wet towels.</p>\n    <p>They were quantumly entangled, yet it was the Minotaur that felt like peeing itself.</p>\n    <p>Mel, who often felt like peeing himself at the laundromat, was comfortable gazing about the labyrinth.</p>\n    <p>The Minotaur had never witnessed anything like Mel, lathered up, blinking, shaving so erratically, yet smiling oddly.</p>\n    <p>It was the Minotaur who looked disturbed. The Minotaur who drew back from Mel. The Minotaur who didn’t want to pee itself yet didn’t like the looks of Mel’s toilet either.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://flashfictionmagazine.com/blog/2025/09/03/mels-bathroom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Sadie peered out over the sea, cradling an icy flask between stiff fingers. The dock was fluffy with frost. She sat, settling herself into the frozen crystals. Chipped black nail polish flaked off as she fiddled with the flask’s top. Her dad used to unscrew the lid with one hand, celebrating another successful crab haul as he burst through the front door. Sadie would get an oxygen-depleting bear hug, and her mom, a bristly mustache kiss. He’d tip back a swig of whiskey and do a little dance. Sadie would roll her eyes, but eventually join in, feet jigging and arms swinging.</p>\n<p>She let her snow boots swing, their heavy soles knocking old pavement salt into the shallows below. The sharp smell of brine drifted in as the tides pulled out, the whole wind-bitten inlet stained the dingy gray of late winter.</p>\n<p>When she’d left the house that morning, backpack on, AP English homework unfinished, and mussy clothes thrown together, her mom—disheveled damp hair and trembling hands pawing at one another, jittery from too much coffee—had chased her halfway down the walk with a heavy coat and waterproof pants.</p>\n<p>“Mom, I’m fifteen, not five.”</p>\n<p>“It’s supposed to snow this afternoon,” her mom said, shoving Sadie’s arms into the sleeves.</p>\n<p>Sadie had acquiesced, mostly to avoid her mother’s clingy anxiety, but also to keep hidden the flask she’d stolen from her dad’s office.</p>\n<p>She’d walked right past her high school and toward the marina, where her dad’s ship was notably absent. Today would have been the annual “Sadie picks which crab they eat for dinner” day.</p>\n<p>She adjusted her position on the chilly dock, trying to work a little blood back into her thighs as she unscrewed the flask. Staring at the empty berth that used to house the S. S. Sadie, she took a sip. The liquid was so cold it gnawed at her insides, little permafrost punctures against the esophagus.</p>\n<p>That first winter storm, the one that had swallowed his ship in open water, had brought the bitter scream of winds and a colossal ice storm. Sadie remembered how beautiful it had all been, the whole town encased in a brilliant slick of shimmer. She hadn’t even thought to be scared, to worry Dad would be navigating his crabbing ship in the icy dark. She’d stayed up to watch the stars reflect in the thick glaze.</p>\n<p>The call came in the early hours. Jerked awake by her mom’s anguish—a cry that cracked the ice along the window panes—Sadie shot downstairs to find her crumpled on the ground, phone in her lap, horror etched in every wrinkle that bunched around her eyes.</p>\n<p>“He went down with the ship,” was all Mom could say. Sadie collapsed, folding herself inside her mother’s broken form, trying to burrow her way back to the beginning. Back to a childhood full of morning laughter over buttered toast, and board games that stretched past bedtime.</p>\n<p>Sadie took another sip from the flask. She slid down, lying on her back and staring at the heavy clouds poised to unleash their innumerable flurries. Seagulls spun lazily overhead. Her memories sailed in and out, some from last summer when splinters threatened her bare feet as she and Dad raced to the end of the marina and threw themselves into the bay. She remembered splashing back out with a yelp when he yelled, “Shark!”</p>\n<p>He’d told Mom over dinner how gullible their daughter was, to which Sadie aimed a few peas in his direction.</p>\n<p>Now there were just quiet meals for two, avoiding each other’s eyes, in a house much emptier. Who knew Dad had taken up that much space?</p>\n<p>A pelican joined the seagulls with their endless cow-cow-cow calls. The bigger bird rose and fell in the thermals that edged the ocean. Dad had always loved pelicans.</p>\n<p>Footsteps sounded from the earth-bound portion of the dock, but Sadie didn’t care if one of the crabbers saw her. They’d understand.</p>\n<p>“Your dad tried to get me to call you Pelly, you know.” Her mom’s voice drifted in.</p>\n<p>Sadie launched upright.</p>\n<p>“Can you imagine? Pelly Lacrelly?” She snorted.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://flashfictionmagazine.com/blog/2025/09/02/pelican/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>By Michelle Rogers</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The dragon slayer stood over his kill, breath heaving, the sword’s edge still glowing with heat. The beast lay still, wings half-folded, smoke curling from its nostrils. <i>One more, and it’s done.</i> That’s what the High Mages had told him. One more and the curse would be broken.</p>\n<p>The acrid stench filled Ronan’s lungs, but the fire beneath his skin burned hotter, molten metal coursing through his veins. Once an extension of himself, the sword’s hilt felt strange—too smooth, too light. A shiver ran down his spine despite the warm air. The wind carried distant voices, though no one was there. He flexed his fingers, the skin at his knuckles rougher, darker. His nails—no, claws—caught the firelight. The changes were coming faster now. He had to finish this before—</p>\n<p>“Ronan.”</p>\n<p>Lyra’s voice was quiet, but it anchored him. He turned to her, his guide, the woman who had led him unerringly to every dragon, yet always hesitated at the final strike. She stood motionless, her amber eyes shadowed.</p>\n<p>“We’re close,” he said, sheathing his sword. His armor, crafted to fit perfectly, now pinched against his spine. “One more, and it’s over. The curse will end. I will be human again.”</p>\n<p>“And what then?” Her voice was careful. “What does that mean?”</p>\n<p>“It means I win,” he said firmly. “It means dragons are finally gone.”</p>\n<p>She hesitated, gaze flicking to his hands. “Have you seen what’s happening to you?”</p>\n<p>He scoffed. “Battle scars. Everyone changes in war. It will go away when the curse is lifted.” He forced a grin, reaching for her hand. “You won’t have to worry about this in your future husband. I’ll be just as I was before.”</p>\n<p>She didn’t move. The firelight traced the tension in her shoulders. “The Mages didn’t lie to you.” Her voice softened. “Kill the last dragon, and you will be free of this.”</p>\n<p>Relief flickered in his chest, but something in her tone held him still. “Then why do you look at me like that?”</p>\n<p>She exhaled slowly, her expression shifting from sorrow to resolve. “Because I am the last one.”</p>\n<p>The world lurched beneath him. He took a step back, the ground unsteady. “No. That’s not possible.”</p>\n<p>Lyra closed her eyes, exhaling softly. When she opened them, the illusion fell away. Golden scales shimmered under the moonlight, her pupils narrowing into slits—familiar eyes, ones he’d seen fade into death a dozen times before.</p>\n<p>His sword was in his hands before he could think. “You led me to them? Your own kind?”</p>\n<p>“Some deserved it.” Her voice carried sorrow. “The ones who razed your village—I helped you find justice. But each death changed you. I tried to slow our hunt, to give you time to see it.”</p>\n<p>The sword trembled in his grip. The final dragon, the last one to be slain, stood before him. He clenched his fists, his breath sharp, uneven. His whole life, dragons had been monsters. He had vowed to rid the world of their kind, and now—</p>\n<p>Now she stood before him. Not a beast, not an enemy. The woman he loved. The one who had saved him, guided him, stayed at his side when no one else had.</p>\n<p>He remembered their nights by the fire, her laughter filling the spaces between his grief. The warmth of her voice when she spoke of the stars. The way she was always there to help him chase away the nightmares.</p>\n<p>“If you kill me,” she said, voice steady, “you go back to who you were. A man. A slayer. A hero. If you don’t—”</p>\n<p>“I stay like this,” he finished, throat tight. “I remain trapped between the worlds of man and beast.”</p>\n<p>Silence stretched between them, thick as smoke. His hands trembled. The sword had never felt heavier.</p>\n<p>She exhaled. “No. It will continue. You’re already more dragon than human. You feel it, don’t you? The way fire didn’t burn you. The way your senses sharpened after each hunt. The way you know what I’m thinking before I say it.”</p>\n<p>Ronan swallowed hard. He had ignored it, pushed the thoughts aside like battle fatigue. But the truth settled into his bones now.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://flashfictionmagazine.com/blog/2025/08/31/the-last-hunt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Ranard</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>When I go, he would tell her, I want to go fast, and one sunny fall morning, as he’s jogging around the lake, his wish comes true. He’s gone before he hits the ground.</p>\n    <p>With her daughter’s help, she sells the house and moves into Sunrise. He would have hated everything about the place (beginning with the name: “Sunrise?” she could hear him say. “Give me a break. Call it what it is, for Christ’s sake—Sunset”). But she discovers, to her surprise, that she actually likes it: three meals a day, housekeeping, and, for the first time in years, a social life. It’s like being in a co-ed college dorm (well, a co-ed dorm where the girls outnumber boys three to one).</p>\n    <p>~</p>\n    <p>There are two wings—assisted living and memory care (referred to in hushed tones as “the other place” by assisted-living residents)—and, with her increasingly iffy memory, she is a probational resident of assisted living.<br/>Soon there are serious lapses in memory. One evening her daughter visits to find her more than a little tipsy. “I jush had my usual one glash,” she insists. It takes her daughter a while to figure out what had happened. She’d had her usual one glass of white wine before dinner—four times, going through the whole bottle.</p>\n    <p>After that her daughter makes sure there’s never more than one mini-bottle in the refrigerator.</p>\n    <p>~</p>\n    <p>She weeps when she’s told she has to move to “the other place.” But after a few days there, she seems fine. Or maybe she’s forgotten the previous place.</p>\n    <p>~</p>\n    <p>Most of the time her daughter is her daughter. But sometimes her daughter is her sister—the twin sister who died in a car accident at thirty. And every now and then her daughter is a stranger.</p>\n    <p>The day will come when she’ll wake from a dream and look up at her daughter, sitting in a chair next to the bed, and say, “Mom? Is that you?”</p>\n    <p>~</p>\n    <p>She points at the photo in the silver frame on her bureau and asks who he is. “That’s Daddy,” her daughter says. “Your husband.”</p>\n    <p>It takes her a moment to take in both of these things—Daddy, husband. Then she says, “He’s very handsome. Did l love him? Were we happy?”</p>\n    <p>“You were very happy,” her daughter says. That’s not entirely true, but it’s more true than untrue. She smiles, happy to learn that she was happy.</p>\n    <p>Then, because it’s a nice day, they go outside, where she enjoys, once again for the first time, the beautiful grounds.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://flashfictionmagazine.com/blog/2025/08/29/after-he-goes-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He was dressed warmly, despite the late spring warmth of the sunny May afternoon. He watched as youngsters played kickball and skipped rope and tossed a rubber ball against the wall of the elementary school. Their presence barely registered with him. His life had become an unchanging cycle of sameness that was stultifying.</p>\n<p>The playground monitor took notice of Michael and, after a moment's hesitation, made her way in his direction. As Michael watched her approach, he gave nothing away; this, he thought, should at least be interesting, perhaps even entertaining.</p>\n<p>\"Sir?\" she said, standing beside him.</p>\n<p>Michael closed and then opened lugubrious eyes. He could barely stay awake. Over the last half year, his inattentiveness had led to his meds going all awry.</p>\n<p>\"Sir?\" she said again, leaning over and into his personal space.</p>\n<p>Michael lifted his head, heavy on his shoulders, and focused on her middle-aged face. She was late-30s, the same age as his daughter.</p>\n<p>\"Um?\" he replied.</p>\n<p>\"Sir, can I help you?\" she asked. What she meant, Michael thought, was, would you please go away and stop menacing the children?</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"\">\"What,\" asked Michael, \"did you have in mind?\" He watched her blink in perplexity and try to make some sense of his remark.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\"Sir, do you know where you are?\" she asked next.</p>\n<p>\"Um?\" he repeated.</p>\n<p>\"Sir,\" said the monitor, \"this is a grade school.\"</p>\n<p>Michael turned away, determined now to ignore her. After she'd gone, he slipped under and only regained awareness when a baritone voice addressed him.</p>\n<p>\"Hey, Pops,\" the voice said, \"what're you doin' here?\"</p>\n<p>Sensing the authority contained in the voice, Michael's attention level ratcheted up a notch.</p>\n<p>\"What do you want?\" Michael asked abruptly, frowning at the 40-something uniformed police officer who loomed over him. He watched as the short, blond man's pupils dilated.</p>\n<p>\"I asked why you're here,\" repeated the cop. Aggressive little shit, thought Michael.</p>\n<p>\"I heard you,\" said Michael in a peevish tone. \"What business is it of yours? Am I breaking a law, contravening an ordinance?\" he asked.</p>\n<p>This gave the policeman pause. He had expected to roust this likely homeless figure without any problem, but here was the old gent getting back in his face.</p>\n<p>\"Do you have ID?\" he asked next.</p>\n<p>\"Why do I need to show you my ID?\" demanded Michael, trying to shake the lethargy from his mind. \"I've committed no crime.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well,\" said the cop, \"maybe you have and maybe you ain't.\"</p>\n<p>\"You have no reasonable suspicion,\" said Michael, \"much less probable cause. I'm sitting on a public bench in a public park, not molesting anyone. My tax dollars purchased this bench, and go to pay your salary.\"</p>\n<p>\"But,\" said the cop, \"why are you here?\"</p>\n<p>\"I am an old man,\" explained Michael. \"I felt tired, so I took advantage of a public resource - this bench - and sat down. What more do you need to know?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, we received some complaints,\" said the policeman.</p>\n<p>\"From whom?\" asked Michael.</p>\n<p>\"That's... confidential,\" explained the cop.</p>\n<p>\"Is that what you're going to say in court?\" asked Michael.</p>\n<p>\"In court?\" said the cop with a gulp.</p>\n<p>\"When I sue the city for wrongful prosecution and harassment and elder-abuse,\" said Michael.</p>\n<p>'Listen, Mr., go ahead and sit here. You're not hurting anyone. Take it easy. And have a nice day.\" The policeman beat a hasty retreat.</p>\n<p>The brief exchange had fully awakened Michael and he felt newly more alive and motivated to move along. Climbing to his feet with the aid of a ponderous wooden cane. he staggered off, cloaked in a surfeit of loneliness.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Four Years Ago</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/08/hairline-fracture-by-bill-tope.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But none as well as Frédérick, at least according to himself. As for the first requirement, he was nearly a decade younger than the age limit. His English was impeccable. And no one would believe for a moment that he didn't meet or exceed all the other qualifications in Mrs. Tilbury's application.</p>\n<p>Even the last peculiar note, \"a dashing foreigner,\" was in his favor. Although not particularly tall, he was trim and had a lovely countenance with fine features. Men and women alike were inclined to call him \"beautiful,\" for he had an almost feminine appearance and bearing. On account of his mixed heritage, his dark hair had a natural wave that many ladies found appealing. His hazel eyes were nearly golden. The fullness of his lips promised only the finest kisses. His skin tone was ambiguous, allowing him to easily pass for a Spaniard. That was assuming, of course, he did not sit in the sun long enough to reveal his partial African ancestry. He was, in a word, alluring.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"\">When he rang the bell at Mrs. Tilbury's, he was absolutely certain he would succeed where all the other men had failed within two hours at the most. Eccentric widows, after all, were his specialty.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>The woman who answered the door was a good deal taller than he and easily three times his senior. She possessed a becoming, yet formidable, plumpness that bode well with her round, cream white face. Despite her age, her hair was mostly dark and she was relatively free from wrinkles except near the corners of her eyes. She had a stately bearing emphasized by the fineness of her clothes. If Frédérick chose a word to describe her, it would be \"statuesque.\"</p>\n<p>\"Madame Tilbury?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, I am Mrs. Tilbury,\" she said in English. Her voice warbled in a manner that startled him. It was not a terrible voice, but it was odd.</p>\n<p>\"I am Frédérick Caron, madame, from the agency.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, how wonderful!\" She clapped her hands in front of her in a dramatic fashion. It made Frédérick wonder if she was an actress in her younger days. \"Won't you come in, Monsieur Caron?\" She butchered the word \"monsieur\" and mispronounced his surname as \"care-on.\"</p>\n<p>\"Frédérick would be fine, madame,\" he said when he followed her into the house.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, of course. Frédérick.\" At least she pronounced his first name correctly, complete with three syllables. \"What a charming name. It simply rolls off of the tongue.\"</p>\n<p>The first thing he noticed was how the</p>\n<p><i>salon</i>was overwhelmed by the presence of multiple clocks and an array of scientific instruments better suited to a gentleman's study. There were also two gold parallel lines resembling railroad tracks running across the floor.</p>\n<p>\"Won't you sit down, Frédérick?\" She made a grand sweep of her arm toward the sofa. \"Allow me to offer you some tea. I had it imported from Britain.\"</p>\n<p>Mrs. Tilbury sat across from him and twisted a gold knob on the side of her chair. After a few rotations, the tea cart on the other end of the room rattled to life. It rolled along the golden parallel tracks that ran between them as if by magic. When Mrs. Tilbury turned the knob in the opposite direction, the cart stopped.</p>\n<p>\"It's rather clever, don't you think?\" she said while she served the tea. \"Mr. Tilbury had this delightful contraption installed shortly after we moved in. Would you care for some sugar or cream?\"</p>\n<p>\"No, thank you, madame.\"</p>\n<p>Mrs. Tilbury served herself a more than ladylike amount of cream and sugar before returning to her chair. \"Now, then. Tell me a little about yourself.\"</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/08/mrs-tilburys-paramour-by-ej-leroy.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>I met someone mid-flight and we immediately hit it off. Rather than try to keep in touch, we imagined what our lives would have been like if we were together. It was almost as good.</h3>\n<p><i>We’ve been publishing  the winners of our True Romance Writing Prize collaboration with Belletrist and actress Emma Roberts these past few weeks. So far, we’ve shared the grand prize–winning essay in the shortread category, by Maggie Hart, and the longform winning story, by Olivia Shaffett. We’re elated to be bringing you the first shortread finalist this week, a banger of a piece from Katharine Coldiron. This is what Katharine had to say about how the piece came together: “This was the first piece I’d written on a prompt in years. I read the call for entries and thought immediately of this tale. I worked it through in the shower and put it down in a rush. I polished it a little, et voila.” A great reminder to follow a spark and go for it!</i> </p>\n<p>I was 19 or 20, a smoker, on a plane from New England to New Orleans. Next to me sat a man, around 19 or 20, a smoker. We looked at each other and liked what we saw; we talked to each other and liked what we heard; we, simply, hit it off.</p>\n<p>And not as friends. In that way that enlivens your whole body. Chemistry, pheromones, attraction. Whatever you call that, when the person is someone whose skin you badly want to touch from the first moments of meeting them.</p>\n<p>As we talked, we realized there was no way we’d ever meet again. I was visiting my mother for the summer in a place I would never live permanently. He was laying over in New Orleans on the way back to Wyoming or Oklahoma or North Texas, I don’t remember. I don’t even remember his name. I know he came from a place I’d never been and seemed unlikely to visit: a landlocked place. All my experiences had been coastal, due to my Navy father — I never lived anywhere you couldn’t park a 40,000-ton ship near.</p>\n<p>We told the truth. We made each other laugh.</p>\n<p>There was no social media then, and we both had precisely the quantity of life experience that advised us not to persist or pursue this connection. A little less and our romantic sides would have tried to build faith in a long-distance something; a little more and we would have recognized that such an instant, holistic connection is too rare to waste.</p>\n<p>Instead, we had the plane ride, and that was all.</p>\n<p>How will I remember you? I asked, or something less obvious that posed the same question.</p>\n<p>He dug in his pocket. I just bought this, he said. It was a rectangular Bic lighter with a picture of a cowboy on it, either at dusk or sunrise.</p>\n<p>I unzipped the front pocket of my backpack and pulled out an oval Bic lighter. It was a paisley design with a lot of purple in it. I’d chosen it because it was eye-catching and pretty without any pink.</p>\n<p>We traded.</p>\n<p>As we taxied, he said to me, I wish I could kiss you.</p>\n<p>Silence for a minute.</p>\n<p>Let’s pretend to be together, I said. As we’re getting off the plane, let’s pretend that we’re boyfriend and girlfriend. We’ll hold hands and talk about where to go for dinner. Then you’ll go to your gate and I’ll go to baggage claim.</p>\n<p>Yeah, he said.</p>\n<p>And you could kiss me then, I said. But not, like, really dramatically, like in the movies. Just like you do it all the time.</p>\n<p>He nodded.</p>\n<p>That was right. That was the right thing.</p>\n<p>I tried not to be sad.</p>\n<p>I still have that lighter. I find it in boxes of old stuff I go through from time to time, trying to discard what I no longer need. It’s been 15 years since I smoked, but I will not throw away that lighter.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/well-always-have-the-plane-ride\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He’s a husky guy, with sand-colored hair, who can down beer after beer without losing his faculties, a practice that gives him cred with this crowd.

After announcing the winners a few weeks ago, we’re excited to finally share the first piece of the bunch, the grand prize–winning essay in the shortread category, which comes to us from Maggie Hart. Maggie opened up a bit about writing this piece and others like it: “After I completed my chemo treatments, I felt awkward and ugly in my baldness, convinced I’d never be able to exist normally again, much less date. But finding small moments of humor and lightness helped me get through. I think lots of people view serious illness as something that only happens later in life, which just isn’t true — so I like sharing my stories about navigating the weirdness of cancer survival and young adulthood all at once.” Congratulations again, Maggie! And readers — you’re in for a treat. </i>\n    </p>\n<p>“I’m sorry,” I said to Nick, who stood staring at me in the dim light, his bare chest rising and falling with quickened breaths, his lips swollen from my kissing them. “It’s just that…well, I’ve been really racking my brain here, and I just don’t think there’s a sexy way to do this.”</p>\n<p>My fingers lingered at my forehead, on my hairline. My wig gripped my scalp like a barnacle on a boat, the scratchy fibers relentlessly digging into my skin, one of many small, manageable pains I had in those days. It had to come off for what was about to happen, I knew that. There was really no way around it. Leaving it on was impossible — I had a profoundly humbling vision of the wig abandoning ship mid-action, slipping loose and tumbling onto the floor in a sad, sweaty heap. It had also been quite an investment — although I still do not understand why a bunch of fake hair costs multiple hundreds of dollars — so I didn’t want it to get hopelessly matted. And what if, in the throes of passion, he forgot that the hair was fake and tried to <i>pull it</i>…</p>\n<p>No. No! Obviously, it had to come off. But <i>how, </i>exactly? I wished he’d look away, spare me, if only partially, from the humiliation of my baldification, the world’s least seductive strip tease.</p>\n<p>Nick smiled at me encouragingly. He was kind and tattooed and had long dark hair that was beginning to streak with gray. I’d never been with a man who had hair longer than mine, although, that winter, any man with any hair at all had hair longer than mine.</p>\n<p>Four months after my last round of chemotherapy, I decided that it was time I put myself out there, that I date. Why not? The chemo had, miraculously, worked. My blood counts were relatively normal, I hadn’t needed a platelet transfusion in weeks and my oncologists gave me the all-clear, so it was time that I shifted my attention away from my no-longer-imminent death to something much more invigorating: the pursuit of reassurance. I needed to know that my body worked, that I still knew how to have a conversation that was not about being sick, that this whole cancer thing had not rendered me sexless and unlovable at just 25 years old. So, I went where every woman in her 20s goes when she needs reassurance: the apps.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/unexpected-challenges-dating-cancer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It was a boon to the grassroots movement, which started in the 1980s in response to a pattern of permitting landfills and polluting industries in neighborhoods that were disproportionately Black, Brown and low-income.</p>\n<p>In the past four years, advisory councils were created — with many of the positions filled by women of color, who have long been leaders in environmental justice spaces — and offices opened to spearhead the work on the federal level. During that time, the administration also <a href=\"https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USEPAIAQ/bulletins/37c321b\">earmarked billions of dollars</a> to address longstanding environmental issues, and to help these communities adapt to the climate crisis.</p>\n<p>But as President Donald Trump took office for a second time, all that momentum at the federal level disappeared, seemingly overnight. An executive order issued on inauguration day took aim at dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, and environmental justice. As a result, any mention of the work is being scrubbed from government websites and funding has been paused.</p>\n<p>For Jalonne White-Newsome, who led the first ever office on environmental justice in the White House, the shift has been jarring if not unexpected. Still, she’s not undaunted. Through her over three decades of working in environmental justice — starting from her youth in Detroit, Michigan — there is one thing she knows: The movement, at its core, is driven by everyday people who will continue to advocate for their communities.</p>\n<p>“Environmental justice did not start with the federal government,” she said. “Nor will it end with the federal government.”</p>\n<p>The 19th spoke with White-Newsome, formerly the federal environmental justice officer for the White House Council on Environmental Quality, about the Trump administration’s recent attacks on her work and how the movement responds now.</p>\n<p><i>This interview has been edited for length and clarity. </i></p>\n<h3><strong>Jessica Kutz: What is it like to see the new administration issue executive orders aimed at dismantling environmental justice, work that you played a part in implementing?</strong></h3>\n<p>Jalonne White-Newsome: I mean, it’s crushing, right? It is offensive. It’s really hard because we have really tried to work hard over these past four years to create a foundation that our federal family could build on.To see a lot of that dismantled, to see our information wiped off websites, to really try and eliminate the trace of any environmental justice work, it’s very frustrating.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do you think this pull back in funding will affect the momentum of the movement? Is there work that was done under Biden that might be protected from this shift? </strong></h3>\n<p>I’ve had so many community leaders over the past couple years come up to me, folks that have been in the movement for decades and decades, to say there has never been this amount of funding and resources to support environmental justice.</p>\n<p>And so our agency partners worked really, really hard to try and get as much money out as possible [before the Trump administration]. I mean, they were grinding very hard.</p>\n<p>I know there are groups that are positioning to make sure that communities can keep the funds that were obligated to them. So that is happening right now. Where it gets sticky is some of the funds were kind of in that period of not being obligated. [Especially with] the current administration’s review of anything that remotely thinks, talks or looks like equity or environmental justice.</p>\n<p>I’m not a lawyer. Is that legal? Can they actually do that? I don’t know. But it’s a fear tactic, right? And they’re trying to cause fear and confusion, and they have been successful. But we have great partners that have a lot of knowledge and passion that are going to protect our folks that have received these funds to continue to do the great work that they’re doing on the ground.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are your concerns about this political shift away from DEI and environmental justice work? </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/the-environmental-justice-movement-isnt-going-anywhere-even-as-it-faces-attacks-by-trump/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Final picks will be recognized this fall on our site, shared with media partners, and potentially featured in video and podcasts. As an example, please see our <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/as-great-salt-lake-dries-dust-is-new-danger/\">video</a> (below) and <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/how-do-we-deal-with-bad-air-quality/\">podcast</a> on Kerry Kelly, a University of Utah professor of chemical engineering who is an expert on air quality and the founder of Tellus, a maker of air quality sensors.</p>\n    <p>To nominate a candidate, please head to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSclj2iY0OMhGugTA4mIrXx9Dyb_0uIOwGULY-MZPkBUsEa0HA/viewform\">our form</a>. Please note: You cannot nominate yourself. </p>\n    <p>Candidates must be U.S.-based scientists with advanced degrees in the fields of physics, chemistry, engineering, biology, agronomy, environmental science, meteorology or closely related fields; or entrepreneurs with advanced degrees who are creating science-based products and technologies to help mitigate/reduce the impact of climate change through innovative practices.</p>\n    <p>“For many years, we have highlighted the incredible accomplishments of women in science, who are often racing against the clock to adapt our world to the dangers of climate change,” said Victoria Wang, co-founder of The Story Exchange. “At a time when there is little reason to be optimistic about the environment, these women stand out as beacons of hope.” ◼️</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/know-a-trailblazing-woman-scientist-nominate-her-for-our-cutting-edge-women-in-science-list/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

As of publication, two children died – ages 8 and 10 – and 17 people were injured when suspect Robin Westman (who also died, of a self-inflicted gunshot wound) opened fire during a morning mass at the city’s Annunciation Catholic School.</p>\n<p>Of the 17 who were hurt, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy40znde9eko\">14 were kids</a>. Some of them were as young as 6 years old.</p>\n<p>“These were American families,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said during a press briefing. “Don’t just say this is about ‘thoughts and prayers’ right now. These kids were literally praying.”</p>\n<p>Yet that’s largely what conservatives, including President Donald Trump, had to offer in the wake of the attack. “Please join me in praying for everyone involved,” <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/shooting-annunciation-church-minneapolis/\">Trump wrote</a> on Truth Social, with Vice President JD Vance offering a similar call. “My prayers are with everyone involved in this tragedy,” Attorney General Pam Bondi also <a href=\"https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/1960716027131519061\">posted</a>.</p>\n<p>The solution to our <a href=\"https://www.apha.org/topics-and-issues/gun-violence\">gun-violence epidemic</a> should be to pass more stringent gun laws. Experts have found that the <a href=\"https://rockinst.org/blog/more-guns-more-death-the-fundamental-fact-that-supports-a-comprehensive-approach-to-reducing-gun-violence-in-america/\">sheer tonnage</a> of guns available in the U.S., and <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/debunking-the-guns-make-us-safer-myth/\">the ease</a> with which they can be purchased, makes ours a deadlier, more dangerous nation to live in. And <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11381453/\">study</a> after <a href=\"https://everytownresearch.org/rankings/\">study</a> has shown that gun violence could be curbed significantly through policy prescriptions.</p>\n<p>But for this particular shooting, after praying for peace, conservatives found an alternative scapegoat: Transgender people. Despite the fact that the <i>vast</i> majority of mass shootings are <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/fact-check/majority-of-us-mass-shooters-are-cis-men-not-transgender-or-non-binary-people-idUSL1N363273/\">committed by cisgender men</a>, Westman was a trans woman, so some are using this shooting to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/27/us/minneapolis-school-shooting-suspect-gunman.html\">further anti-trans agendas</a>.</p>\n<p>Attacking a community that is <a href=\"https://glaad.org/trump-accountability-tracker/\">already subject</a> to extreme discrimination, while refusing to enact legislation that would see gun violence lessened, and then offering boiler-plate calls for prayer in the aftermath… None of this does anything to actually help the children they claim to want, the children they claim to care about. </p>\n<p>None of this helped 10-year-old Weston Halsne, who survived the Minneapolis shooting because his equally-young friend <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/minneapolis-mass-shooting-catholic-school-survivor-friend/\">shielded him from gunfire</a>, and was injured in the process. “It was like, shots fired, and then we kind of, like, got under pews,” he recalled to members of the press. “They shot through the stained glass windows I think, and it was really scary.”</p>\n<p>Weston added that was praying for his friend’s recovery – because it’s the only recourse he, a traumatized child, has in the U.S., where people with the power to enact laws that would protect children from shootings like this <a href=\"https://www.thetrace.org/2025/06/big-beautiful-bill-atf-silencer-gun-laws/\">fail to do so</a> over and over again. </p>\n<p>Conservative politicians and pundits continue to pressure women to bring more lives like Weston’s into this world, into this country – while at the same time demonstrating a refusal to even<i> try</i> to keep them safe. <a href=\"https://www.security.org/blog/a-timeline-of-school-shootings-since-columbine/\">Over 400 school shootings</a> have taken place in the U.S. since the 1999 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School_massacre\">Columbine High School massacre</a>, with dozens killed, hundreds injured and thousands traumatized by these attacks.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/conservatives-want-more-kids-yet-offer-only-prayers-when-kids-are-gunned-down/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s the only timely source of this demographic-level data.</p>\n<p>Without it, economists and policymakers would have no way of knowing how economic policy is affecting marginalized groups of workers in real time. They’d be flying blind on how to help them.</p>\n<p>But that’s just what President Donald Trump’s nominee to run the bureau is suggesting doing.</p>\n<p>On August 1, Trump fired the head of the bureau, Erika McEntarfer, after BLS published one of the largest revisions to its data in decades. The revision showed that the economy was in fact weaker than previously reported, leading Trump to accuse McEntarfer of tampering with the data to make his administration look bad.</p>\n<p>Revisions of economic data have also always been part of how BLS, an independent and nonpartisan agency, functions. The data is collected from surveys of employers and households, and then published in three waves. The surveys are voluntary, so not all responses come in on time. BLS publishes an initial release and then revises in the subsequent two months as more responses come in. It’s done this way to ensure that markets and economists get real-time data on the economy. Since the pandemic, BLS has been struggling with lagging response rates and a rapidly changing economy that has led to larger revisions.</p>\n<p>The reports are still considered one of the most reliable sources of U.S. economic data in the world.</p>\n<p>McEntarfer, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden and was confirmed in a nearly unanimous Senate vote, is a widely respected economist who had worked in the federal government under multiple administrations. Trump’s nominee to replace her, E.J. Antoni, is an economist at the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation who <a href=\"https://static.heritage.org/project2025/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf\">contributed</a> <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/thebulwark.com/post/3lwen55jkbk25\">to Project 2025</a>. Discussing the employment data <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trumps-bls-pick-could-pause-monthly-jobs-report-over-accuracy-concerns\">earlier this month</a>, Antoni suggested that until the data is “corrected,” “the BLS should suspend issuing the monthly job reports but keep publishing the more accurate, though less timely, quarterly data.” </p>\n<p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier this week that the Trump administration had noted Antoni’s suggestions but intended to continue issuing the monthly reports.</p>\n<p>“I believe that is the plan, and that’s the hope, and that these monthly reports will be data that the American people can trust,” Leavitt said.</p>\n<p>Losing timely economic data, particularly at a time when the economy is showing signs of softening, is bad for every group, economists told The 19th. But it could disproportionately impact women and women of color, who are often the first to feel the impact of weakness in the economy and serve as a bellwether of what is to come.</p>\n<p>“The household survey is really the only source for intersectional employment data on a monthly basis. That means that for groups of women we and others have been watching especially closely during this period — for example, disabled women, Black women, women veterans — timely information about these groups would disappear,” said Katherine Gallagher Robbins, a senior fellow at the National Partnership for Women &amp; Families who routinely analyzes the data.</p>\n<p>The National Women’s Law Center, which also publishes its monthly analysis of women in the workforce using BLS’ data, said in a statement that “losing this impartial data will undermine efforts to improve women’s economic wellbeing, damage the credibility and reliability of data coming from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and hurt overall efforts to objectively assess the health of our economy.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/suspending-monthly-economic-reports-would-be-really-bad-for-women-of-color/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

From rosé, to flavored seltzers, to functional beverages packed with minerals and adaptogens,  there’s something here for everyone at the party to enjoy.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>(All images courtesy of the companies.)</i>\n    </p>\n<h2>Drink Besa</h2>\n<p>Tori Brodsky has been leading the helm of <a href=\"https://drinkbesa.com/\">Drink Besa</a> since 2022. With a background in nutrition science, she became interested in making convenient drinks with quality ingredients, such as canned wine that’s, in fact, pretty darn good (we tried the “sexy and bright” <a href=\"https://drinkbesa.com/product/just-right-white/\">white wine</a>). Drink Besa also offers a line of hard seltzers, which it says are among the first on the market to use organic wine instead of malt liquor or spirits. The 5% ABV drink comes in three flavors – peach, fruit punch, and citrus – and is, according to Brodksy, “the ideal summer beverage: Delicious, premium, and truly unique.”</p>\n<h2>Bow &amp; Arrow Brewing Co.</h2>\n<p>“We didn’t set out to be the first <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/a-native-owned-brewery-inspired-by-the-southwest/\">Native-woman-owned brewery</a> in the United States, but I’m told we are,” says Shyla Sheppard, founder of <a href=\"https://www.bowandarrowbrewing.com/\">Bow &amp; Arrow Brewing Co</a>.

Their beers, like “Dance In and Out of The Beams of a Neon Moon” (a fruity IPA), and “Cactuscolada” (a Pina Colada-inspired sour ale) are available in their Albuquerque, New Mexico, tap room  – where they are served cold straight from the tap – as well as <a href=\"https://www.bowandarrowbrewing.com/find-our-beer\">other locations</a>. </p>\n<h2>Heti</h2>\n<p>Dana Thompson, who built the celebrated <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/owamni-indigenous-cuisine-healing/\">Owamni</a> restaurant, is now turning her attention to the functional beverage space. Her new business, <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/dana-thompson-heti-drinks/\">Heti</a>, is a health-conscious brand selling low-dose THC beverages. The name itself means “home” in Dakota; Thompson is a direct descendant of the tribe through her mother. Evoking a sense of place — and the flavors of home — is intentional. “I wanted something that resonated with what the people I know were asking for,” Thompson told The Story Exchange in a recent interview, especially women who wanted to relax with something other than wine. There is a home-related social-impact component to her business model in the works, as Thompson also plans to create hempcrete housing on tribal lands with some of the profits.</p>\n<h2>Trois Noix</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/jaime-araujo-trois-noix/\">Jaime Araujo</a> says her Napa Valley winery, <a href=\"https://troisnoixwine.com/\">Trois Noix</a>, was born from a lifelong love of wine. She’s not only passionate about what ends up in the bottle, “but also how it got there, what happens when it fills your glass, and how it can bring a table of people together.” And how’s this for a summertime drink: The winery’s Sonoma Valley Rosé, made from pinot noir, contains aromas of papaya, just-ripe strawberry, and crushed rose petals. Reviewers on wine app <a href=\"https://www.vivino.com/US/en/trois-noix-rose-of-pinot-noir/w/9858056?year=2021\">Vivino</a> called it “light-bodied with a tart plum finish” and “very refreshing.” Trois Noix recommends pairing with grilled seafood and summer vegetables … or just sipping on its own, if you don’t have grand cooking plans on the hazy horizon. </p>\n<h2>All Phenoms</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/cristina-kown-all-phenoms/\">Cristina Kown’s</a> sparkling waters, <a href=\"https://allphenoms.com/\">All Phenoms</a>, are packed with organic fruits and filled with vitamins, adaptogens, minerals, prebiotics and probiotics. Her aim? To offer a super healthy alternative to sugary sodas. The Redondo Beach, California-based entrepreneur is a self-proclaimed healthy beverage fan – but was dismayed that most of the drinks on the market contained tons of sugar, or low-quality ingredients. We imagine All Phenoms drinks in flavors like berry hibiscus, citrus ginger and mango lemongrass would do a good job of keeping you sufficiently hydrated at any sweltering gathering. </p>\n<h2>Boyd Cru</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/the-best-summer-beverages-to-beat-the-heat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Charlotte Wissel, founder of Artemis Virtu. (Credit: Courtesy of Artemis Virtu)</p>\n<p>Charlotte Wissel’s design company, Artemis Virtu, collaborates with customers on crafting furniture that’s made to suit their individual tastes.</p>\n<p><strong>For Charlotte Wissel, </strong><strong>furniture</strong><strong> has always been about more than function or necessity – it’s also an alternative form of expression. Wissel told us, “I see each piece as a blank canvas with the potential to become a work of art.” In 2020, the Fort Lauderdale, Florida, designer launched her company, </strong><strong>Artemis Virtu</strong><strong>, through which she aims to combine craftsmanship, storytelling and bold design into something tangible and lasting. Wissel also takes upholstery to another level by integrating custom materials and original artwork into every project. </strong></p>\n<p><i>Here’s our lightly edited Q&amp;A, from</i><i> </i><i>The Story Exchange 1,000+ Stories Project</i><i>.</i></p>\n<h3><strong>How is your business different from others in your industry?</strong></h3>\n<p>We treat upholstery as an art form, not just a service. While many upholstery businesses focus solely on repair or restoration, our work goes far beyond function — we design statement pieces that transform a space. We’re not just reupholstering furniture; we’re creating one-of-a-kind pieces that reflect the client’s vision, style and story.</p>\n<h3><strong>Tell us about your biggest success so far. </strong></h3>\n<p>Seeing my work featured in homes I never imagined I’d have the opportunity to be part of. Over the past year, I’ve had the honor of creating custom pieces for private clients whose taste and stature I deeply admire — individuals I never expected to connect with, let alone have my artwork in their personal spaces.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is your top challenge and how have you addressed it?</strong></h3>\n<p>Like many creatives-turned-entrepreneurs, I quickly learned that talent alone isn’t enough to build a business. One of my first challenges was navigating the startup phase — figuring out pricing, sourcing materials and positioning myself in a niche market. I had to learn how to run a business while still being the creative force behind every piece, which meant wearing many hats and making decisions that didn’t always come naturally at first.</p>\n<p>As the business began to grow, scaling up became the next big hurdle. I found myself reaching capacity quickly, with more requests than I could handle solo. It forced me to evaluate how I could grow without compromising the quality or uniqueness of my work. I’ve since streamlined my process, established stronger boundaries around production timelines, and begun forming partnerships that allow me to take on more without losing the personal touch.</p>\n<h3><strong>Have you experienced any significant personal situations that affected your business decisions? </strong></h3>\n<p>As we began to gain traction, I was thrilled to see demand increase. I hired staff, took on large-scale projects, and worked with designers on high-volume orders. On the surface, it looked like success — but in reality, I found myself drifting further and further from the soul of what I had created.</p>\n<p>Many of the pieces I was producing no longer felt like mine. I was executing someone else’s vision, with little input or creative freedom, simply because they had seen my past work and wanted me to replicate it. It became clear that I was on the verge of turning my studio into a production line, and that was never what I wanted this business to be. So, I made the conscious decision to recalibrate — to scale with intention, not volume.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is your biggest tip for other startup entrepreneurs? </strong></h3>\n<p>Trust your instinct and protect your craft. In the early stages, it’s easy to feel pulled in every direction by trends, advice or what you think people want from you. But your vision is the core of your business – it’s what will set you apart.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do you find inspiration on your darkest days?</strong></h3>\n<p>I’ve learned to take a step back and reconnect with my “why.” I reflect on the pieces I’m most proud of, the clients who trusted me with their vision, and the moments that reminded me that I’m doing what I love.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/charlotte-wissel-artemis-virtu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Asymmetrical ubiquitous surveillance is the problem.” The Liberator was playing Chinese checkers against himself and talking, talking, talking, like always. “Who watches the watchmen, after all?”</p>\n<p>We were superheroes then. Celebrities, back when there were such things. It was a slow night at orbital headquarters, and Eye-Oh was sitting at the big screen, watching a couple of people fuck — consensually, or we would have done something about it — in an alleyway. The screen was green with night-vision enhancements, and Eye-Oh’s strange complicated face was perfectly placid and empty as he observed.</p>\n<p>“The problem is that we can watch ordinary people, and they can’t watch us,” the Liberator went on. He looked at me longingly, searchingly, and I thought it might be nice to tweak the inside of his brain and get rid of his earnestness, give him a little taste of what infamous brain-damage victim Phineas Gage got when that iron bar slammed through his frontal lobe, a total personality turnaround, from nice guy to sociopath. Let the Liberator be selfish and impulsive and violent and mercurial for a while, so he could appreciate the way normal avaricious sneaky hungry desperate needy people felt.</p>\n<p>But that was supervillain thinking, and I’d gone straight and narrow. In those days I cured neurological damage instead of inflicting it. I <i>fixed</i> people. (Except bad people. Those, I was sometimes still allowed to play with with.) I’d refused to give up my supervillain name though. The Liberator had wanted to call me “Dr. Neuro” when I joined his little boys’ club, but I’d insisted on keeping my maiden name, as it were. Doctor. Please. I was a high-school dropout.</p>\n<p>“Do you see?” the Liberator said. “If ordinary people could see <i>us</i>, if everyone could see everyone else, it wouldn’t matter if there were no privacy.”</p>\n<p/><p>“Mmm,” I said, and tried to keep reading my book, a physics textbook. I was deep into a chapter on Heisenberg. His big achievement was the uncertainty principle, which says you can’t know both the position and the momentum of a given particle at the same time. (I know, you know that. But like I said, I didn’t do much school. I had a lot of catching up to do if I was going to hang with the super-science types.) I always thought the uncertainty principle had something to do with observing, how just the act of looking at something changed its nature, but apparently that’s a whole different thing, called the observer effect. That’s the kind of confusion you get when your grasp of physics comes from made-for-TV science fiction movies named after the monster that eats the boyfriend in the second act. I wasn’t too clear on the implications of the uncertainty principle, but I understood the observer effect. Me and the boys observed things all the time — Eye-Oh observed _everything_ all the time — and we sure as hell changed what we saw if we thought it needed changing.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/08/28/escape-pod-1008-observer-effects-flashback-friday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Full of avocados, computer chips, plastic toys, etc. All carefully placed by her rubber-faced grippers into the trucks that darted in and out of the warehouse bays.</p>\n<p>On a good day, Sandra loaded something interesting. A heavy, oddly shaped package, requiring her to adjust her first person view goggles and sit forward in her chair, lips pursed in concentration. Or a tantalizing, vacuum-packed parcel bound for near Earth orbit. Once, an opaque tank, filled with flickering red-black fish. It brought a little variety to a day viewed through the cameras of a four-foot-tall, yellow robot.</p>\n<p>Everyone thought loader drivers were shut-ins who ate frozen pizza three meals a day, but Sandra knew she was plenty hot. In fact, despite spending six days a week working alone, Sandra showered regularly, had nicely combed black hair, and ate fresh greens from her garden. Her FPV goggles left ghost-white rings around her eyes, but no one had ever complained during her periodic forays into picking up people at the bar after work. The bar in Lane’s Creek, that is, not wherever she’d been dispatched today. Sandra couldn’t ask, but from the pine trees and rain that slicked the tops of the trucks, she guessed Washington or Oregon.</p>\n<p>Today, her bot’s grippers were broken, so Sandra was posting cute cats on the drivers’ forum. The bots weren’t wired for sound or video, supposedly as a cost-saving measure. They did, however, have little whiteboards. Sandra had been surprised when a neighboring bot surreptitiously held up its ‘emergency’ whiteboard with a link scrawled on it. But she’d quickly grown to like the forum’s stream of gossip, complaints, and off-topic posts. Sandra wasn’t good at small talk, online or in real life, but she still wanted her people to know she cared about them. So, cat .gifs.</p>\n<p>Finally, a woman wearing a maintenance technician’s overalls walked into her camera’s view. She waved to Sandra. That was rare. The in-person employees were often stuck-up when they weren’t inattentive. Sandra lifted her busted gripper and gingerly waved back.</p>\n<p>“No humans allowed near a robot in motion,” the bot driver pre-employment training had said about a hundred times.</p>\n<p>Lucy, that was what the woman’s name tag said, didn’t seem nervous about the bot. She also sang to herself as she worked, which Sandra liked. Not that Sandra could hear, but she’d gotten good at reading lips in her first year as a bot driver. Right now, Lucy was singing a pop song from last year. It reminded Sandra of her mom working in the kitchen, which was weird, because Lucy was hot. Not like, older lady, mom-core hot, but hot hot, swipe-right hot. Lucy had a nice curve in her nose, and worked quickly and surely, sweat beading her short red hair. She leaned toward the camera to check a gripper and Sandra straightened in her chair, feeling flushed at the sudden intimacy.</p>\n<p>Sandra’s bot was soon working again and Lucy began to pack her tools. Sandra considered giving her a thumbs up, but that didn’t really seem appropriate as a thank you. Or a flirtation. She knew from the forum that a few bot drivers took creepy screenshots of the in-person staff, but she’d never heard of anyone trying to hit on one. Lucy turned to go and Sandra panicked. They were still too close together for her to risk a sudden movement toward her whiteboard. So, instead, Sandra bowed, her bot’s servos humming as it folded gently forward. She wondered if Lucy would assume the bot had suffered another malfunction.</p>\n<p>Instead, Lucy bowed back, winked, and walked off, her bag swinging behind her. And Sandra was in love.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/08/21/escape-pod-1007-35-f-lanes-creek-oklahoma/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It whipped the Azure River into a frenzy, and the waters responded with a hungry roar as they swirled past the dock. It pounded the warehouse’s loading bay, transforming it into a marshy field of shallow ponds and rocky islands. Nobody, not even a dock worker, was about; the only things that moved were the automata. They paced back and forth, their armor caked with rust, and as they splashed through the watery field, droplets running down their limbs, they showed no signs of minding.</p>\n<p>The shadow of a narrow alleyway enveloped me, hiding me from the automata. For a moment, anticipation and fear flickered in my chest, before I exhaled and snuffed them both out. I stepped out of the alleyway, protected by my umbrella. Espionage mission or not, I wasn’t letting my hair get wet.</p>\n<p>Both automata stopped and turned to face me; the rain filled the void of silence left by their stilled feet. I continued walking forwards with purpose.</p>\n<p/><p>One automata raised a hand, its rusted joints creaking as it did. It spoke, in a gravelly, muffled voice: “Halt.”<br/>\nThat was the first layer of defense, meant to deter commoners who’d ignored the posted signs against trespassing and somehow wandered this far into the docks. I didn’t slow. At first, the automata showed no reaction—those machine minds, hidden to me, recalculated and reconsidered. Then, as one, they both shivered. The illusion of rusted armor fell from them like an unclasped cloak, and now their carapaces, comprised of thousands of scales, gleamed in the rainwater.</p>\n<p>“Provide validation.” Its voice was as smooth and bright as a stream of molten metal.</p>\n<p>I spoke the passphrase from memory: “Clouds aflame. Flower verdigris. In a summer field, a single stone.”</p>\n<p>The automata pivoted on their feet away from me, like a door swinging open, and I exhaled. “Validation accepted. Enter.”</p>\n<p>With the rain still pounding my opened umbrella, I walked past the automata’s unblinking stares and entered the warehouse.</p>\n<p>First it was quiet; then, the overhead lighting turned on with a droning buzz. I held one hand to my brow to shield my eyes from the unexpected brightness, while my other hovered by my lightgun. If there was a trap, they’d spring it now. But nothing moved, and slowly, I relaxed.</p>\n<p>I saw what the warehouse concealed, and at first, I didn’t understand.</p>\n<p>It stood in the middle of the stark white floor, its matte black chassis drawing the eye like a dark stone in a field of sand. Six conical thrust nozzles dangled from the underside; now, they all pointed straight down, but I knew from the holovids how, in combat, they could turn and dance to make the craft fly in impossible ways. On either side of the nose, weapons bays brimmed with missiles, hexagonal ports arrayed like the speckles of a cobra, its hood spread, staring back at me.</p>\n<p>A hover-bomber. And as I circled around it, I saw, emblazoned on its side, the emblem of Samandir.</p>\n<p>Pallets of sealed crates lined the warehouse next to the hover-bomber; I pried them open at random and examined their contents. Short-barreled rifles, the same ones brandished by the enemy in both propaganda holovids and classified combat footage. Clean-pressed mustard yellow uniforms, the signature mark of Samandiran shock troopers. All the props needed to stage an attack in the city and have everyone in Artan think Samandir responsible.<br/>\nSuch an attack, ending in the loss of Artani life, would surely cause all-out war to resume. But who could have planned something like this? If I discovered the general or prince responsible for this plot, I could ensure they were executed tomorrow morning.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/08/14/escape-pod-1006-when-the-oracle-speaks-part-2-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

They flew into the city’s spaceport by shuttle and proceeded up the hill on the backs of the court’s own palanquin-bearers; upon entering the palace grounds, they received the speeches and banquets we held in honor of their noble suffering. The boys, hailing from the kingdom’s most war-torn moon, had lost everything, but now their days of hardship were over. They had become esteemed wards of the House of Hassam.</p>\n<p>After a few days, though, people in the court whispered of something else. The cooks and dressing girls repeated the same rumor: <i>Did you hear? One of the new boys can see the future.</i> The ministers and generals, who should have held themselves above idle gossip, indulged in speculation: <i>If this is true, could the boy be of use?</i> And everyone wondered how the king might act. We all knew his strength was the House’s strength. If the boy possessed some special power, my father would take him.</p>\n<p>So I never had any intentions of turning the boy to my side. I was just curious.</p>\n<p/><p>I found him sitting on a bench in the middle of a courtyard, surrounded by onlookers. It was another rainy day, and all the aristocrats had a servant beside them, shielding their heads with an umbrella. Some pretended to write calligraphy or paint—the perfect image of artful nobility, honing their talents as the rain fell around them—while others just stared.</p>\n<p>I took in this scene from the colonnade which circumscribed the courtyard. “Come,” I said, and my servant chaperone opened my umbrella. “I’m going to talk to him.”</p>\n<p>We left the colonnade’s shelter and entered the courtyard. The boy didn’t appear special—he was skinny and looked around the same age as me, and the only thing unusual about him was his uncovered head. Rain plastered his thick, reddish curls to his forehead. They’d be a frizzy mess later; I wrinkled my nose at the thought of it.</p>\n<p>Instead of looking up as we approached, he only stared at the rain hammering the surface of the courtyard pond. He’d been doing that, it seemed, all afternoon long. My servant and I stood there, waiting, until the silent lack of recognition grew irritating. Finally, my servant spoke: “Prince Meira Pashel em-Hassam wishes to speak to you.”</p>\n<p>The boy turned around. His eyes swept over me—my jeweled coat jacket, inlaid with silver; the ceremonial lightgun at my belt; my coiled black locks, cascading to my chest and lustrously shiny. The regalia of a prince was designed for impact. But his face betrayed no emotion—not fear, nor awe, nor muffled resentment—none of the familiar reactions.</p>\n<p>As if he expected it all. My irritation grew.</p>\n<p>The boy didn’t bow, but I refrained from comment; I’d already conceded enough conversational power to this commoner. Instead, I said, “You look wet. Would you like an umbrella? My servant can fetch one.”</p>\n<p>He shook his head. “I like the rain. It’s nice on my head.”</p>\n<p>The word the boy used for ‘rain’ caught my attention—a formal construction, not the colloquialism that everyone in the city used. I remembered why he was here. We were both Artani, but I had been born on this moon, Artan itself, while he, like the rest of the orphans, was from Eshtan. Once the crown jewel and proudest province of the House of Hassam, now a dead moon, bombed to a ruin by the Samandirans.</p>\n<p>The boy lacked etiquette, but not only was he my House’s ward, he’d also lost his parents to the Artani people’s mortal enemy. I could hardly reprimand him. So instead, I said, “Welcome, in the name of the House of Hassam, to your new home. Our hospitality is yours to command.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/08/07/escape-pod-1005-when-the-oracle-speaks-part-1-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The girl whose life I was now supposed to live.</p>\n<p>When they revived me, I’d woken up in my hospital bed. <i>Her</i> hospital bed. That was important, because if I had woken up in the technical center where they’d grown my body and imprinted my mind, we’d be too aware I was just a copy of the real Sam. No, they positioned my body in the exact same hospital bed where she’d spent the past fourteen months. That way my parents could come in and pretend their daughter had recovered.</p>\n<p>Nobody ever literally claimed that Sam hadn’t died. If they did that, they’d know they were in denial, and that would ruin the fantasy they could only hold onto so long as they didn’t think about it too much. Yes, technically, that body had died, sent off to be cremated like any other amputated limb, but their daughter wasn’t dead. Not <i>really</i> dead. She’d been revived. Wasn’t it fantastic? We should all be so thankful that Sam had (for all intents and purposes) pulled through after all.</p>\n<p>Sam’s friends ran circles around me, talking over each other, making plans for us together. We were going to do so many things now that I was healthy again. First thing, after band practice, we were going to sneak off to Starbucks even though Tina’s mom didn’t let her have caffeine and we were going to drink Frappuccinos until we got sick.</p>\n<p>This was what I remembered normal feeling like a lifetime ago, the life I’d wished so hard to get back. I’d spent months too weak to move, knowing I’d never step foot outside the hospital again. To be walking around in this body now… I was just playing a virtual reality game called Sam’s Life Before She Got Sick.</p>\n<p>I <i>did</i> want to go to Starbucks with my band nerd friends and get sick on caffeine and talk away the afternoon. But also I didn’t. I wanted to not want these things. If I only liked what Sam had liked, if I only wanted what Sam had wanted, I was nothing but a copy of Sam. Not a real person. Not even a human. Just a very realistic mannequin, my arms and legs animated by what some other girl used to want.</p>\n<p>My mom watched us with tears in her eyes, makeup carefully done up for this special occasion. My nine year-old sister, Vic, had been staring at me with wide eyes all day. She seemed like she wanted to get caught up in my friends’ happiness, but still couldn’t quite believe it was all real. My dad stood behind them, a few steps back. I couldn’t read the expression on his face. Maybe he was thinking the same thing I was: this person, whoever she is, <i>whatever</i> she is, she’s not Sam.</p>\n<p>“Have you played your clarinet, yet?” Janie asked. “You have to make symphonic band next year so we all have practice together, Sam. You <i>have</i> to.”</p>\n<p>“I, uh…” I began. “Could you call me Samantha from now on? Instead of Sam?”</p>\n<p>Janie’s smile grew. “Uh, okay. Why?”</p>\n<p>“Cause Sam is a boy’s name,” I said.</p>\n<p>I didn’t want to tell her the real reason. I didn’t think I could explain it well enough to make anyone understand.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/07/31/escape-pod-1004-the-girl-who-came-before/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 1003: Billionaire’s Tears</h2>\n<h3>Billionaire’s Tears</h3>\n<p>I wake up to the sound of screaming, and know I’m going to die.</p>\n<p>I shoot out of bed, calling for my mother. First thing I’ve spoken clearly in two days.</p>\n<p>“Maria!” My mother bursts into my room. “Baby, what’s wrong?”</p>\n<p>“S-sorry, Mamma,” I whisper, frantically searching for the right syllables so I don’t trip over them and give it all away. I can’t let Mamma suspect I’m dying—or how soon it’ll happen. “Nightmares.”</p>\n<p>Mamma’s smile is sad. The world’s finally getting better, but not for everyone. For us, still struggling, it’s like it’s only getting worse. Everyone in the family has been having nightmares. But when Mamma accepts my explanation and doesn’t seem bothered by the screaming that surrounds us and has not stopped, to me, anyway, that’s when I know. I have a week <i>tops</i> if I’m lucky.</p>\n<p>First symptom is brain fog, but I brushed off the disorientation as being overworked—ha, who isn’t, amirite? When the stuttering started, I was in complete denial. But the screaming. That’s the last symptom before your brain melts out through your eyes. This is it; I’m fucked.</p>\n<p>“Get dressed, baby, you’ll be late for work.”</p>\n<p>I smile, forced and tight and desperate to appear reassuring. Mamma clears out of the room I share with my sister—who’s at school by now—and I collapse back into bed. What am I going to do? How is this possible? There’s no point in going to work. Fuck that. But I need to get out of the house and <i>think</i>. I need Mamma to believe everything’s okay till I figure this out.</p>\n<p>So I throw on some clothes and grab some toast and my bag and head out the door like it’s just another work day. I’m halfway to the bus stop when I realize I forgot my phone and run back for it.</p>\n<p>It’s so hard to concentrate through the screaming. I almost walk into traffic twice, even with my headphones on. The music helps a little.</p>\n<p>I’m no billionaire—ha!—but somehow I’ve caught Billionaire’s Tears. Oh sure, it’s got some proper scientific name but no one calls it that. I’m not the first person with not a penny to her name and more debt than God to get this, but it has been getting rarer.</p>\n<p>There was a UN resolution about it or something. I don’t know. I work three jobs to help Mamma keep the lights on and the younger kids fed. I don’t have time for the news.</p>\n<p>It was kinda hard to ignore when the plague first started. It was all anyone talked about. A plague killing off all the billionaires? Right on! Gates was the first to go, Musk and Bezos not far behind. At first everyone thought it was poisonings or something.</p>\n<p>But then Taylor Swift got to the screaming, gave all her money to her fan club as one last thank you before she died, and then immediately recovered. Next thing you know, tycoons liquidating assets, giving shitloads of money to charity and transferring ownership of factories and whatever to the workers. Real estate robber barons participating in landback. Techbros buying up the student debt Biden didn’t get to, erasing medical debt, funding schools and building roads and museums and holy shit, right? The lotteries started up—Mamma’s been hoping to win one to get us out of poverty.</p>\n<p>Not all of them got rid of their money to save their own ass though. JKR decided it was a liberal conspiracy to make her give her money “to the trans myth” and yeah no one was sad when the plague made her finally eat shit. But it was the Saudis who first weaponized it: transferring their assets to rivals to kill them off. It worked, until everyone caught on. Then it was just rich assholes playing whack-a-mole with each other’s money hoards.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/07/24/escape-pod-1003-billionaires-tears/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
