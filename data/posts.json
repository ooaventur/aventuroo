On a cold march morning in the Qizilqum, or Red Desert, of Karakalpakstan, an autonomous republic in the far west of Uzbekistan, I woke in darkness to watch the sun rise. It peeked over the horizon just as I was clambering up the sprawling central enclosure of Ayaz Kala 3, an 1,800-year-old mud-brick citadel near the textile-wrapped yurt where I'd spent the night, staining the bastions and battlements a dazzling cadmium red. In the distance irrigation canals cut like razors through the sandy soil. To the south the fluted ramparts of the second fortress in the Ayaz Kala complex ringed a lower bluff. A hard, cold wind blasted in across the desert, sweeping over the salt flat that once protected the armies of the Khorezmian civilization, which flourished along the banks of the Amu Darya river beginning in the third century BCE, from the attacks of nomadic raiders. Each gust seemed to peel away another layer of soil. I felt—not for the first time on my trip through Karakalpakstan—completely alone. I'd come to this remote corner of Central Asia to attend the Aral Culture Summit, a conference in the Karakalpak capital of Nukus that was organized by the Uzbekistan Arts & Culture Development Foundation, or ACDF. There, architects, agronomists, artists, and anthropologists spoke about ways of reviving the desiccated landscape. Since the 1960s the Aral Sea, once the region's lifeblood, has lost 90 percent of its water—the result of ill-planned Soviet irrigation projects. Visitors who come here usually visit the ghostly ship graveyard in the former port of Moynaq, where rusted fishing boats rest on the sand like beached whales, or head farther north to camp near what's left of the Aral Sea. “We are constantly hearing that the Aral Sea is a catastrophe,” Gayane Umerova, the executive director of the ACDF, said during the summit's opening panel. “Catastrophe is all people know.” I'd come to Karakalpakstan looking for something else. Before and after the summit, I traveled the region, passing stark earth-brick fortresses that rose from the desert like sandcastles and villages built from the same elemental material. I visited millennia-old tombs, a marvelous collection of avant-garde paintings, and, in the village of Chimbay, artisan workshops where woodworkers, jewelry-makers, reed-mat weavers, and yurt builders are conserving craft traditions that had nearly disappeared under Soviet rule. Whereas Uzbekistan's dazzling Silk Road cities of Samarkand, Bukhara, and Khiva have, over the past few decades, seen aggressive restoration campaigns and increased tourism, Karakalpakstan remains unknown to most travelers. Instead of devastation, I…",

It’s a widely held belief that the presence of plants and animals can have healing effects on the human psyche. Ask the Japanese, who engage the senses by means of forest bathing, or the Dutch, who hug cows as a form of therapy. Such is the draw of a bucolic farm stay, where you can wake up to sights of flower fields and horse herds without the responsibility of actually having to look after them. As summer nears its end, there’s no better time to make hay while the sun shines and book that rural getaway. From Montana’s Mission Mountains to New York’s Hudson Valley, Airbnb abounds with rustic retreats across the country. Just think: You could stay on a Blue Ridge Mountain farm in Virginia, where you might unwind with a few resident sheep, or spend sunset-lit evenings strolling along olive groves in Joshua Tree. Need something like that in your life? Read on for the best Airbnb farm stays across the US.

A Traveler’s Tale: Fashion designer Haider Ackermann on Churchill, Manitoba— “In November of 2023, I went to Churchill, Manitoba, in the northern reaches of Canada. Canada Goose had approached me to become their creative director, and I wanted to learn more about the company and their partnership with Polar Bears International, a nonprofit conservation organization based in Churchill. I was immediately seduced by the silence and the immense landscape. There's something beautiful about it: You feel like a very small person, you're made vulnerable, and you realize you don't mean that much in the world. It was the start of winter and the temperature was 20 degrees below zero, but I couldn't really feel the cold because I was so excited to be part of this journey that I forgot about everything else. The PBI scientists took me out on drives to see the polar bears several times. They're adorable, yes, but dangerous too, so we rode this thing called a tundra buggy, which was really a giant protective truck. I was excited like a little child, but I was also feeling heartbreak and tenderness. We had the wonder of seeing triplets with their mother. The scientists told me it's very rare nowadays to see triplets, because the ice is melting and babies often die. We sat in the truck for hours, watching the polar bears and talking about the impact of climate change—the disaster we as humans are provoking. We are part of the problem, but we are also part of the solution. It was a really moving education. I literally broke into tears. Previously, this was not the kind of thing I would have done, because I was too busy with my own little life. But now, when I do get into nature, it calms me down and gives me peace of mind. It's a very lonely moment to be confronted with the question of yourself. I look forward to going back this year. In that endless white vastness, the air is so pure that it doesn't smell of anything. It's silent. It's absolutely mind-blowing.” —Haider Ackermann, as told to Matt Ortile Haider Ackermann is the creative director of Canada Goose and Tom Ford. His newest collection for Snow Goose by Canada Goose, the brand's reintroduced heritage label, is now available. This article appeared in the September/October 2025 issue of Condé Nast Traveler.

    "excerpt": "17 Best Restaurants in Vancouver, From Chinatown to Mount Pleasant When most think of Vancouver, the awe inspiring natural landscape that first comes to mind. It certainly is a city with a million dollar view of the Pacific Ocean and surrounding mountains, but it also happens to be much more than that. The best restaurants in Vancouver represent a cultural melting pot where nearly 200 languages are spoken and half of the population has a native language other than English. Its diverse make-up gives a vibrancy and an openness to explore other cultures outside one’s own. One of the most accessible entry points tends to be through food. Vancouver and its surrounding suburbs have been known for quite some time to have some of the best Chinese food outside of China, but the city’s food scene is thriving with types of food that range from classically inspired French to Japanese to Peruvian. With access to the best Pacific Northwestern ingredients, chefs interested in going as local as possible and the interest in drawing across cultural lines, it has one of the most exciting food scenes in Canada. Here are some of the best places to sample everything from Michelin starred regional cuisine to authentic dim sum. Read our complete Vancouver travel guide here, which includes: How we choose the best restaurants in Vancouver Every restaurant on this list has been selected independently by Condé Nast Traveler editors and reviewed by a local contributor who has visited that restaurant.

    "excerpt": "All products and listings featured on Condé Nast Traveler are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. On a recent trip to Cyprus, I had dinner at Rous, in Nicosia, where I noticed a subtle print spanning an entire wall of the foyer. It was a timeline of the Mediterranean island’s history. On one end was the settlement of Cyprus by Paleolithic hunter-gatherers. On the other was Independence Day, August 16, 1960. The dotted line between them was divided between a succession of rulers from elsewhere—Phoenicians, Assyrians, Egyptians, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Franks, Venetians, Ottomans, and Brits. These overlapping and long-lasting influences, and its well-connected position in the crook of the eastern Mediterranean Sea, make Cyprus an island unlike any other. At Rous, head chef Triantafyllos Souliotis translates his country’s singular context deftly in his tasting menu, with reinterpreted ingredients and dishes: tarama compound butter, dolma-like orbs of chard filled with minced octopus and mussels. But this history is also plain to see in the dripping steam of Nicosia’s Ottoman-era hamams, and in the plentiful brandy sours—Cyprus’s iconic cocktail, invented during the period of British colonial rule. In the villages of the Troodos Mountains, women boil Levantine-style spoon sweets and vintners bottle Commandaria, the sweet wine made famous by the Knights Templar. In the city of Paphos, columns still mark the boundaries of a Roman villa; its second-century Christian owner was likely converted by Saint Paul himself. Cyprus is not frequently visited by US travelers, who may know it for its popularity among tourists from the UK or, more likely, for the protracted social conflict that divides it. The island is split by the so-called Green Line, a buffer zone managed by the United Nations that cuts the heart of the capital clean in half. This history is complex. Greek and Turkish Cypriots, the main ethnic groups, encountered gridlock about governing after independence. A Greek-led coup, a Turkish invasion, and a ceasefire declaration later, the conflict is long frozen and Cypriots can move freely. But the larger division remains. The northern third of the island is controlled by a breakaway state recognized only by Turkey, and the rest by an internationally recognized (Greek-aligned) government. Still, many Cypriots refuse the idea that the 50-year-old conflict is insurmountable. There are small biocommunal efforts around the island’s shared heritage, and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has expressed a measured optimism around recent talks—the first substantial negotiations between the two leaders since 2017—with more meetings set for this September. Exciting developments have also enlivened the Cypriot tourism industry in recent years. While the island has its share of large seaside resorts, a…",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Everyone has those clothing items that they take with them wherever they go. For me, nothing works harder in my travel wardrobe than my collection of trench coats (particularly my leather one)—and for good reason. Not only do the sleek silhouettes offer protection from tricky weather conditions—like wind, rain, or a light chill in the air—but they’re also versatile (and practical) enough to be worn while en route, adding a more elevated element to my on-the-go ensembles. From Venice and Dublin to Tokyo and Paris, these seasonal staples have gone with me everywhere in the last few years, maintaining their shape despite constant wear and tear—a true testament to the durability of the style itself. Ahead, our stylish and functional picks of the best trench coats for women to wear this season and beyond. Featured in this article FAQ: What exactly is a trench coat? By definition, a trench coat is a long, usually double-breasted raincoat made from gabardine, a water-resistant material that resembles khaki. Created in Great Britain during the early 1800s, the heritage design was originally made as a polished and uniform way for World War I soldiers to fight against harsh climates, but has evolved into something a lot more common for every day wear, regardless of weather. Famed fashion house Burberry debuted its now iconic version in 1897, and it remains a signature staple in the brand's collection. However, over the last few decades the lines have gotten increasingly blurrier about what actually falls into the category of “trench.” Most styles will have a laundry list of definite features, including a belted waist, back vents, a storm flap to protect against the elements, epaulettes (or buttoned straps on the shoulder––I typically use them to keep my bag straps from slipping down my arm), and a deep pocket for storing your essentials. Functionality aside, the chic, well-tailored silhouette has the power to instantly enhance an outfit, which I’ve found particularly handy while on work trips where I’m traveling with colleagues or meeting a group for dinner as soon as I land. What to look for in a trench coat? Fabrication and construction play a huge role in the longevity of the style and are always two of the first things that I pay close attention to. You’ll want to look for materials that are built to last, like leather, denim, cotton, and corduroy, as well as more modern takes on the traditional gabardine material, such as this highly-technical style from activewear brand Adanola’s new collection for Fall…",

The Tijuana-born and San Diego-based illustrator received the contest’s grand prize: $25,000 and a portrait commission for the museum’s permanent collection. He chose to depict Anthony Fauci, then the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), in a stop-motion format that captures the nuances of his complicated legacy, including his criticized and then celebrated oversight of the HIV/AIDs epidemic. Last week, Crosthwaite found his hard-won commission on a list of Smithsonian items that the White House found objectionable. He was one of at least three Mexican-born artists whose work was included on Trump’s art hit list , along with illustrator Rigoberto González and painter Felipe Galindo Gómez . “My first reaction was surprise,” Crosthwaite shared in an interview with *Hyperallergic. *“But then later on, [I] felt a bit of pride to be included in this list of other wonderful artists and wonderful projects that talk about the diversity of the United States’ history.” ![]( https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Hugo-Foto-1-1200x1485.jpg?resize=1200%2C1485&quality=90&ssl=1 ) In 2022, after winning the Outwin competition, Crosthwaite and the NPG considered a list of individuals for a portrait. They agreed on Fauci as the commission’s subject. At the time, the infectious disease specialist was a polarized figure: a revered pandemic hero and a detested political opponent of the right. “I jumped at the chance of doing this because it was 2022, we were in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Crosthwaite told *Hyperallergic*. “He became a symbol of this fight between science and truth, against conspiracy theories; Dr. Fauci kind of epitomizes the nation’s current political divide.” The five-minute stop motion animation, “A Portrait of Dr. Anthony Fauci” (2022), begins by portraying him as a young scientist in a lab. Later, a man infected by an unnamed virus becomes emaciated until he disappears into a black hole that morphs into a scene from ACT UP protests. Men carry signs that read “Silence = Death” and “Killed by the System.” Behind them, skeletons look to the sky. ![]( https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/facui2-1200x904.jpeg?resize=1200%2C904&quality=90&ssl=1 ) The artwork references the AIDs memorial quilt before transitioning into a segment about the COVID-19 pandemic, in which a woman’s lungs explode into tiny bits of paper. Fauci is portrayed next to the White House press briefing room podium, where he often gave virus updates alongside Trump. Crosthwaite included a thumbs-up icon** **moving erratically up and down behind the podium, and Fauci off to the side. He also captured anti-Fauci sentiment and the right-wing rejection of vaccines, at one point portraying the scientist with devil horns. The stop-motion sequence ends with a woman receiving a vaccine, which cuts to a portrait of an aging Fauci. ![]( https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/fauci3-1200x894.jpeg?resize=1200%2C894&quality=90&ssl=1 ) Crosthwaite told *Hyperallergic *that he doubts the Trump administration actually watched the video, instead targeted the work because of his identity. He rebuffed the White House’s Smithsonian list as a mediocre attempt to win a culture war, and said being included on the list was a badge of honor. “The portrait was done from the perspective of a Mexican-American artist, someone who’s cognizant of the impact of age and COVID-19 on my community, which is presented in the animation … the diverse people who are being attacked by viruses,” he said. The artworks that Crosthwaite initially submitted to the Outwin competition had nothing to do with Fauci. In fact, the work that secured his national win was a different stop-motion animation, telling the story of a woman he met who had crossed the US-Mexico border illegally. Crosthwaite commended the Outwin prize’s capacity to open doors for artists like himself. Any artist residing in the United States who is at least 18 years old is eligible to submit to the competition. For Crosthwaite, it was life-changing. “Getting the commission to do the portrait of Dr. Fauci is actually a great",

He rebuffed the White House’s Smithsonian list as a mediocre attempt to win a culture war, and said being included on the list was a badge of honor.\n“The portrait was done from the perspective of a Mexican-American artist, someone who’s cognizant of the impact of age and COVID-19 on my community, which is presented in the animation … the diverse people who are being attacked by viruses,” he said.\nThe artworks that Crosthwaite initially submitted to the Outwin competition had nothing to do with Fauci. In fact, the work that secured his national win was a different stop-motion animation, telling the story of a woman he met who had crossed the US-Mexico border illegally.\nCrosthwaite commended the Outwin prize’s capacity to open doors for artists like himself. Any artist residing in the United States who is at least 18 years old is eligible to submit to the competition. For Crosthwaite, it was life-changing.\n“Getting the commission to do the portrait of Dr. Fauci is actually a great honor — being part of the Smithsonian,” Crosthwaite told *Hyperallergic. *“My piece is part of the record of American history.”\n![](<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Screen-Shot-2025-08-29-at-2.58.33-PM-1200x898.jpeg?resize=1200%2C898&quality=90&ssl=1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Screen-Shot-2025-08-29-at-2.58.33-PM-1200x898.jpeg?resize=1200%2C898&quality=90&ssl=1</a>)\n![](<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/fauci-1200x904.jpeg?resize=1200%2C904&quality=90&ssl=1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/fauci-1200x904.jpeg?resize=1200%2C904&quality=90&ssl=1</a>)\nSo important.

    "excerptExtended": "LONDON — Some of the Courtauld’s previous exhibitions have suffered from insufficient curation . Abstract Erotic: Louise Bourgeois, Alice Adams, Eva Hesse , on the other hand, strikes the exact right balance. Drawing on scholar Jo Applin’s research, curator Alexandra Gerstein has taken as a starting point the work of feminist curator and critic Lucy Lippard, who coined the titular term to describe this sensuous strand of art emerging in 1960s New York. Making perhaps the best use yet of the Courtauld’s teeny exhibition spaces next to the permanent collection, this small but unstuffed show gives proper breathing space for artistic dialogue and, crucially, for the viewer to engage in exploring differences and similarities between works and practices for themselves. In 1966, Lippard curated the exhibition *Eccentric Abstraction* to capture a new wave of sculptures created from unusual, pliable materials like wire, plastic mesh, netting, and latex, which evoked tactile organic forms and, by extension, the human body. This is the Courtauld’s first show devoted to standalone sculpture, and the contrast between these blob-like forms and its Impressionist-heavy permanent collection may go some way to recreate just how different — even alarming — these pieces will have appeared to 1960s audiences just getting over the shock of Abstract Expressionism’s rehauling of formalist painting. ![]( https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Installation-view-l-r-Bourgeois-_Avenza_-_Lair_-_Fee-Couturiere_-_Hanging-Janus_-1200x880.jpg?resize=1200%2C880&quality=90&ssl=1 ) *Abstract Erotic: Louise Bourgeois, Eva Hesse, Alice Adams*, featuring works by Eva Hesse and Alice Adams (all photos Olivia McEwan/ *Hyperallergic*) The three artists are each afforded an introductory caption presenting historical context. No direct written comparisons are made between them, nor any attempt to force commonality, for historically, there is none other than their working in generally the same space and time. This is good curating: The show allows viewers to ask and think for themselves. Its skill lies in making suggestions via the pieces selected for display, allowing for robust visual comparison. Viewers won’t be able to ignore the strain of eroticism that stems from their irresistible tactility, which is both alluring and fear-inducing, nor their uncanny resemblance to certain human appendages (*ahem*). Applin and Gerstein do point out that all three artists’ experimentation with latex marked a turning point in their explorations of eroticism and the unconscious. The exhibition’s most well-known artist, Bourgeois, was born in Paris in 1911 and moved to New York in 1938. Duly included here is her “Filette (Sweeter Version)” (1968–99/ 2006), unmistakably an erect penis (or, more accurately, one yanked upwards by string) in urethane rubber, given the ambiguous French title “Little Girl.” Adams graduated from Columbia University with a degree in Fine Arts in 1953 before becoming an accomplished weaver. Her foray into obscure materials is here represented by such pieces as the nearby “Expanded Cylinder” (1970), in which she allowed latex foam to expand and set into a constricting tube of chain link, producing a regular weave-like texture while maintaining a phallic, slippery form. Finally, Hesse, born in 1936 in Hamburg before settling in New York, made sculptures of forms bound, twisted, and caught in netting. Applin and Gerstein draw out the latex connection again via the caption, which quotes Hesse on the material’s inevitable deterioration: “Art doesn’t last; life doesn’t last.” Fittingly, though unfortunately, there are no latex examples here. ![]( https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Installation-view-l-r-Hesse-untitled-pieces-and-_No-Title-or-Not-Yet_-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&quality=90&ssl=1 ) It is also unfortunate that this small but perfectly formed show was relatively empty on a weekend. The scrappy, experimental mark-making explored by these three pioneering artists is one important strain in the development of feminist art. Their unsettling forms provoke, titillate, and amuse — welcome responses to female voices and artistic expression. Perhaps it is reflective of trends in audience attention that a solid academic show like this should be less visited than the packed-out recent exhibitions on Peter Doig or yet more Impressionism . We all know sex sells: Does the marketing perhaps need to shout “Eroticism!” or “Rubber penises!” to get punters through the door these days?",

The photographs were meant to generate support for the agency, allowing the public to witness the impacts of the Depression for themselves. Made by recruited photographers and then selected by Stryker for inclusion in traveling exhibitions and news outlets, the chosen images overwhelmingly depicted White families — a narrow and literally whitewashed view of rural America. * Crafting Sanctuaries: Black Spaces of the Black Great Depression South*, a new exhibition at the Museum of Art and Light in Manhattan, Kansas, showcases a broader view of FSA imagery, focusing on Black Southerners documented by photographers like Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Russell Lee, Marion Post Wolcott, Arthur Rothstein, Ben Shahn, and Jack Delano across six states: Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Florida, Mississippi, and Missouri. Presented in partnership with Art Bridges Foundation, the photos highlight the intimacy of life among one’s community — private quarters, public gathering spaces — and the care taken to build one together. The exhibition, curator Tamir Williams told *Hyperallergic*, “is an examination of the significance of Black Southerners investing in their spatial worlds — and more largely in beauty — while living through this intense period of economic hardship and racial violence.” ![]( https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Sr4qw-1200x905.jpeg?resize=1200%2C905&quality=90&ssl=1 ) During the summer of 2023, Ashley Holland, curator and director of Curatorial Initiatives for the Art Bridges Foundation, approached Williams to curate its first in-house traveling exhibition, drawing from the FSA photography collection. At the time, they’d just begun a job there as a curatorial research assistant. “I came across Nicholas Natanson’s * The Black Image in the New Deal: The Politics of FSA Photography* (1992) and Sarah Boxer’s ‘ Whitewashing the Great Depression ’ (2020) for *The Atlantic*,” Williams said. “I knew that I wanted to focus on this issue of the absence of Black and other non-White persons from the larger visual memory of the Great Depression — and specifically explore how and why this exclusion happened and how it could be redressed.” Williams spent a week at the Library of Congress poring over the digital FSA collection. They were drawn to images of small homes built by both White and Black laborers, particularly in La Forge, Missouri. Curious about “what home and homemaking might have looked like for other Black persons and families beyond La Forge,” they expanded their research. ![]( https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/gdoxx-1200x797.jpeg?resize=1200%2C797&quality=90&ssl=1 ) The exhibition’s photographs are reverent, offering glimpses into otherwise unseen instances of Black domesticity and community. “I find Jack Delano’s ‘Negro tenant family near Greensboro, Alabama’ (1941) to be incredibly striking,” shared Javier Rivero Ramos, associate curator at Art Bridges. In the image, a young family poses in their home, the walls and ceilings plastered and reinforced with newspaper clippings, a kitten at their feet. “It seems like every conceivable emotion, thought, and event unfolding through the country is somehow refracted in the image,” Ramos added. Ibby Ouweleen, Art Bridges curatorial associate, said she was “taken by Marion Post Wolcott’s interior scene of three children and a dog in their family home, which feels sort of magical and mundane at once.” ![]( https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/WzRNF-1200x897.jpeg?resize=1200%2C897&quality=90&ssl=1 ) The exhibition is displayed in tandem with *Sanctuary in Motion*, a companion installation developed in collaboration with the Yuma Street Cultural Center.

    "excerptExtended": "Joe Amrhein and Susan Swenson were going to sit out the Armory Show this fall for the first time in a quarter century until they got a call last month from the fair’s director. The owners of Pierogi Gallery in Brooklyn’s Williamsburg neighborhood initially did not apply this year due to the show’s rising booth costs, which can exceed tens of thousands of dollars. Pierogi is planning the next phase of its business, which could include relocating to Lower Manhattan . But Armory executives Kyla McMillan and J. Tyler Woodall appealed to Pierogi and the fair’s shared history — in 2016, Amrhein suggested the Armory use an empty space to display Jonathan Schipper’s installation of a Volkswagen Golf crashing into a wall; the presentation of large-scale art has since become a cornerstone of the show. They recently negotiated a smaller exhibition space for Pierogi with a lower rate, enabling the gallery to return. “We had been on the fence about it since the economy is very uncertain and it’s a big investment,” Swenson said. “We’re not one of the big box galleries. Some of them have their own economies now.” The Armory Show has come a long way from exhibiting several New York gallerists on three floors of the Gramercy Park Hotel in the mid-1990s. Since 2021, the fair has set up camp at the spacious Javits Center near Manhattan’s Hudson Yards, where it will host some 230 galleries from more than 35 countries from September 4 through 7. ![]( https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/JCG18153_view01-1200x896.jpg?resize=1200%2C896&quality=90&ssl=1 ) The show also has new owners. Two years after Frieze acquired the Armory Show and EXPO Chicago, its parent company, Endeavor Group Holdings, sold its roster of art fairs for $200 million to Hollywood superagent Ari Emmanuel. The former Endeavor CEO envisions Frieze as a key piece of a new global events company he formed this year, and perhaps one positioned to compete with Art Basel’s dominance in the contemporary art market. But with a reported downturn in the market, galleries have been weighing their options. Once mainstays at the Armory, blue-chip institutions have instead drifted toward Frieze’s spring fair , the Art Dealers Association of America’s (ADAA) Art Show (before it was abruptly canceled this year), or TEFAF New York — or they are skipping the New York fairs entirely. David Zwirner hasn’t exhibited at the Amory Show since 2022 , and chose to show at ADAA several years before that. Pace Gallery’s last year at the Armory was 2021 . Gagosian hasn’t shown at the Amory since 2020 , back when it was held at Piers 92 and 94. Lisson hasn’t been at the fair since 2019 . Others are busy courting international buyers in Asia and the Middle East, where Art Basel Qatar will launch in Doha in February 2026. It doesn’t help that Frieze is competing against itself: Its three-year-old Frieze Seoul fair overlaps with Armory next week, forcing galleries to choose. “Everybody is asking where we should be investing our energy and time and our focus,” David Norr, partner at James Cohan Gallery, told *Hyperallergic*. “The cost of shipping, travel and built-in expenses in participation in these fairs continues to go up.” ![]( https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/La-Balada-De-Jennie-Ruby-Jane-1200x1642.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1642&quality=90&ssl=1 ) Others are simply skipping the season altogether. Jack Shainman stepped back from showing at New York fairs in recent years to focus on its exhibitions in Chelsea and the newly renovated Clock Tower building in Civic Center. After wildfires ravaged Los Angeles in January, Night Gallery chose a gallery residency at Arsenal Contemporary instead of participating in several international art fairs. “This is both a result of the market and our ability to be in multiple places at once,” Night Gallery spokesperson Shy Watson said. “We are trying to create alternative models of exhibition, promotion, sales, and community.” The Armory is used to a relatively high degree of churn.

    "excerptExtended": "A round of layoffs at the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) this summer is raising alarms at one of the best-known arts schools in the country as the institution grapples with rising costs. The Santa Clarita-based private arts school laid off nine administrative employees in July, including five unionized workers and four non-union workers, claiming in a schoolwide message that CalArts needed to cut expenses in the face of a projected $15 million deficit . “The nine staff positions, as well as about a dozen vacant staff positions, are being eliminated as part of a necessary workforce reduction, which will enable CalArts to address a structural deficit, prioritize student-facing services, and better align our staffing with current and projected enrollments to continue providing exceptional educational opportunities to our students,” a CalArts spokesperson told *Hyperallergic*. But faculty and staff members are questioning the administration’s decision, arguing that the layoffs could harm the school’s ability to train and nurture the next generation of artists. “Everyone was disappointed in this having to happen at all when we’re working so hard to try to better serve the population,” Emily Lytle-Painter, a web and digital media producer at CalArts and union member, told *Hyperallergic*. “When we were trying to go into discussions with the administration, we felt like there were other avenues.” Tensions between CalArts employees and school leadership have been simmering since last fall, when dozens of faculty and staff decided to form a union after enduring what they described as years of stagnant wages, increased workloads, and minimal benefits. In December, CalArts faculty delivered a letter to President Ravi Rajan announcing their intention to organize with United Auto Workers in a unit that would represent approximately 600 workers. They held elections in March and ratified the union a month later. At the same time, the school had been struggling with enrollment, which declined by about 12 percent since the pandemic, from 1,532 students in 2019 to 1,353 students in 2023 (tuition surpassed $60,000 per year in 2025–26). In an April 2024 interview, Rajan told *Inside Higher Education* that CalArts was “ fiscally sound .” But the school proceeded with several budget cuts to reduce its operating costs, including tighter spending controls, hiring delays and travel limitations, and adjustments to admissions and financial aid packages. These measures, Rajan said in a schoolwide message, saved the school $5.5 million. This spring, CalArts sought to reduce its headcount and sent voluntary separation and early retirement notices to between 50 and 60 faculty and staff, union leaders estimated. But only 32 employees, including 22 faculty and 10 staff, took the school’s offer and Rajan moved ahead with layoffs despite vociferous objections from the union. “I acknowledge how painful this news is,” Rajan wrote in a July 15 letter to faculty and staff reviewed by *Hyperallergic*. “These are not just abstract positions—they are roles held by our colleagues, teammates, and friends. I’m immensely grateful for their contributions and mindful of the weight of this moment for our community.” When the school announced layoffs, union leaders bargained with the administration for three months of severance, instead of two weeks of pay per year of service; three months of COBRA insurance; and priority rehiring in any vacant positions over the next two years for anyone who was laid off. “Everyone is understandably sad and worried, and there’s a general feeling of having to move forward with what we have,” Lytle-Painter said. “I personally was really proud of our bargaining team being able to bargain for increased benefits for those affected by the layoffs. That’s part of why we have a union.” Thomas Leeb, an adjunct faculty member in the School of Music and union member, said he is approaching the next academic year that starts on September 8 with mixed emotions. “A lot of institutional knowledge has left with the voluntary separation program, and that’s sad and it hurts.",
