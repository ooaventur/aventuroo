    "excerpt": "Sorry, Nashville. Broadway lights are dimming this fall in favor of another Tennessee city. As leaves begin to shed and temps begin to drop, the astounding Smokies scenery, neon honky-tonks, and ‚Äòsmooooth Tennessee whiskey' are far from the only draw to the ‚ÄúVolunteer State‚Äù. Expected to be the state's trendiest fall destination, largely backed by lively festivals and stunning natural attractions, this city is also deeply rooted in intriguing Civil War history, locomotive heritage resulting in scenic train rides, and ample ways to explore the outdoors in the midst of autumn's luminous colors. Chattanooga may not have been on your Bingo card this year, but it's not too late to swap it out for wherever else you had planned. Don't pass up the opportunity to explore perhaps Tennessee's most underrated getaway that will no doubt be overflowing with fall splendor, quintessential Southern charm, and surprisingly luxe stays for a city that's still clinging on to ‚Äúhidden gem‚Äù status. Whiskey River, Take Your Mind Alright, there's no actual ‚Äúwhiskey river‚Äù per se, but one can dream, right? But in a state steeped in grandpappy's medicine, it goes without saying Chattanooga can go toe-to-toe with the best bars for a night out. Bar-hopping, as fun as it may be, is nowhere near the only fun thing to do here, despite a buzzing downtown with a mix of college crowds and people like me hanging on to their last sliver of youth. One instantly noticeable enticement to the city is the winding Tennessee River, that is still a blast to visit during the fall. Hop aboard the Southern Belle, a popular riverboat cruise for sunset and general sightseeing tours. If it were me, this would be a priority night one, as it's easily accessible from the city center and a great way to get your bearings. Otherwise, wake up and start your day with a coffee in hand and a stroll along the Chattanooga Riverwalk, lined with 16 miles of paved trails. Other fun activities include fishing, kayakin,g and paddle-boarding, all of which equipment can be rented. But the river comes alive more than ever this fall as a base for 3 Sisters Bluegrass Festival for a two-day affair October 3 ‚Äì 4, and the one-of-a-kind Head of the Hooch Regatta, one of the largest rowing events in the world at the turn of November. Travel Tip: If Bluegrass music is your jam, the World of Bluegrass is taking over Chattanooga through 2027, beginning September 16, 2025 ‚Äî Read all about what it entails here!

    "excerpt": "With the close of summer, it means that fall is starting to make its way into the minds of most of us. To many people across the U.S., fall means cozy nights, apple cider, warm sweaters, and, of course, the fall foliage craze that begins to take over the country. Foliage fever is real, and while road trips and national park hikes are great, why not experience America‚Äôs beautiful autumn views by rail this year? Here at Travel Off Path, we‚Äôve seen that train travel is having a major moment. It‚Äôs a chance to sit back, relax, and soak in the stunning views without the stress of driving. Based on the scenic railways travelers were raving about last year, here are 5 U.S. train rides that offer some of the best fall views for 2025. üöÇ Conway Scenic Railroad, New Hampshire The Angle: Classic New England Beauty If you want the quintessential New England fall experience, this is it. While there are many foliage trains in the region, travelers in 2024 consistently gushed that the Mountaineer route on the Conway Scenic Railroad is one of the most spectacular rail journeys in the country. Winding through the heart of the White Mountains and the dramatic Crawford Notch, this trip offers cliffside views, historic trestles, and a sea of vibrant red and orange maple trees. - The Experience: This is a longer, more immersive trip, offering a dining car and a true feeling of golden-era train travel. - Best Time To Go: The first two weeks of October are typically peak season for this part of New Hampshire. üèûÔ∏è Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad, Ohio The Angle: A National Park by Rail There‚Äôs a reason this Ohio favorite remains on the list: it‚Äôs one of the only scenic railways that runs directly through a U.S. National Park. The Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad gives you a front-row seat to the deep forests and rolling hills of the park as they explode into fiery shades of red, orange, and purple. It‚Äôs an incredibly accessible way to experience a national park‚Äôs fall beauty. - The Experience: Look for themed rides like the ‚ÄúAles on Rails‚Äù beer-tasting excursions for a fun, adults-only trip. - Best Time To Go: Mid-to-late October is the sweet spot for peak color in this region. ‚õ∞Ô∏è Cass Scenic Railroad, West Virginia The Angle: Authentic Appalachian Adventure For a truly unique and historic experience, head to the mountains of West Virginia. The Cass Scenic Railroad is not a typical tourist train; it's an authentic, historic logging railroad that uses powerful steam locomotives to chug its way up a mountain. The journey through the rugged Appalachian wilderness is spectacular, culminating in a panoramic view‚Ä¶",

    "excerpt": "Already thinking of your next sun-drenched Caribbean getaway this winter? Before you go ahead and spend hundreds of dollars on those ‚Äòirresistible' round-trip flights that are, in fact, not as cheap as they could be, you'll want to hear this one out: From November 15, Arajet, the Dominican Republic's new budget carrier, will start ultra-affordable direct flights from Chicago to Punta Cana. Home to postcard white-sand beaches hugged by teal seas, world-class resorts, and a lively entertainment district peppered with restaurants and nightclubs, it is one of the trendiest destinations in the Tropics, and it's never been cheaper to get to: At Last‚Ä¶ Arajet Is Coming To Chicago! You might not have come across Arajet in your flight searches before, but that's because they're a new airline launched in 2022, and until recently, they operated to and from select hubs across the Americas. It has grown significantly since its launch, and by 2025, it will already serve destinations such as Miami (MIA), Newark (EWR), and even San Juan (SJU) in Puerto Rico. Arajet isn't exactly known for its top-notch service, comfy flying experience, and wide range of onboard amenities, but what they do excel at is their unbeatable prices. That is, if you're flying at the lowest possible fare, with carry-on only. From Miami, round-trip tickets average only $196 flying to Punta Cana (PUJ), and from Newark (EWR) to Santo Domingo, the culture-loaded capital of the Dominican Republic, you can expect to pay roughly $208 both ways. Given their low-cost appeal, it was about time they finally debuted in the Midwest market: $234 Roundtrip Fares Going To Punta Cana From November 15, Arajet service will begin between Chicago O'Hare (ORD) and Punta Cana, with base round-trip fares currently estimated at $234 (without extras). We're sure this might increase as time goes on, but for now, the predicted frequency is three-times-weekly flights, with the operation days as follows: - From Punta Cana (PUJ): Tuesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays - From Chicago O'Hare (ORD): Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays Outbound flights departing from Chicago have a listed departure of 10:27 A.M. from ORD, arriving to PUJ at 5:12 P.M. for a total flight time of 4h45. Meanwhile, return flights from PUJ are expected to depart at 5:47 A.M. (who here's an early bird?), touching down back in ORD at 8:57 A.M. just in time for breakfast at Berghoff Cafe in Terminal 1. What To Expect Flying Arajet When it comes to Arajet's bag allowance, you should know it uses the common low-cost carrier structure: - ‚ÄòBase' fare: personal item only, with no free carry-on or checked luggage - ‚ÄòComfort': larger carry allowance or one checked baggage, depending on route - ‚ÄòExtra': checked baggage, priority‚Ä¶",

    "excerpt": "PSLs are sure to be tasty, but you don't have to give in to the idea that the only way to enjoy the fall season is by reaching into the back of your closet for your finest checkered flannel to hit up apple orchards and tree-lined mountain roadways. There are still stunning beaches awaiting all across the globe. While some popular U.S. beach towns don't quite have the same appeal as sunny summers, that's what passports are here for. The travel experts at FlightHub have mixed personal insight and data to craft a list of must-visit fall destinations. While icons like New York, LA, and Orlando make the cut time and time again, there were some real surprises for more adventurous travelers seeking to escape axe-throwing at pumpkin patches in favor of paradisal sun-drenched shores. These 3 international paradise islands were named must-visit destinations this fall: 3) San Blas, Panama Panama may not have been on your Bingo card for a Caribbean escape this fall, but as a recent visitor to this highly underrated and diverse utopia of wildlife, pristine beaches, and cultural delights, it earned my stamp of approval right away. While I didn't have the chance to visit the cluster of islands making up San Blas, I did visit another practically untouched seaside oasis (Portobelo) on the other side of the country, and it was definitely worth the adventure. Though San Blas is where locals send tourists for an ideal picture-perfect beach vacation, as it's more suited for flawless getaways, while Portobelo is a small town still making its way onto travelers' itineraries. In San Blas, you'll find immense beauty and a rich indigenous culture. As beautiful as this region may be, don't quite expect Cancun-level resorts. Flying into Panama City is the easy part, then you'll need to tap into your sense of wanderlust as the trek ahead is a doozy, so many hire a professional guide. Upon arrival, expect a rustic, off-grid experience with gleaming white-sand beaches, crystal-clear waters, and a lack of large-scale tourism infrastructure, which is all part of the appeal. From there, island-hop, snorkel, swim, lounge beachside, and learn all about Guna culture at your leisure. 2) Vis, Croatia We at Travel Off Path already recently revealed another awesome Croatian destination (Zagreb) taking this Mediterranean hotspot by storm, so if you thought Dubrovnik was the only way to experience this trendy country, we've got news for you! Honestly, now is a great time to start planning your trip anywhere in Croatia for more elbow room on the beach, but the little island of Vis is a year-round tight-lipped secret. Boasting a Mediterranean climate, you know the weather is just as nice (if not‚Ä¶",

    "excerpt": "Planning a European getaway for the coming year, but you've been waiting for new nonstop routes to open from your favorite hub at Boston Logan International? This time, you're in luck, as Delta is adding not one, but two new European destinations to the Massachusetts capital's network from May 16, 2026: Madrid, Spain's capital and its leading city break, and Nice, the trendiest beach spot in the South of France. Here's everything you need to know about the new flights, and what to expect from Delta's summer 2026 strategy: Boston As Delta's New Gateway To Europe Over the last few years, Delta has ramped up Europe-bound service from its Boston (BOS) base like no other, from boosting frequency to cities like London and Barcelona, to starting new flights to in-demand destinations that previously lacked a connection with Massachusetts. When it comes to Madrid, there are in fact nonstop flights from Boston to the Spanish capital already, except they're operated by Spain's own Iberia, and in the high season, they're joined by low-cost JetBlue. Be that as it may, there has never been a full-service, U.S.-based airline operating in this market. As for Nice, this will be the first time Boston-based travelers enjoy a nonstop connection to the Pearl of the French Riviera, without requiring stopovers in Paris. Previously, Delta only offered nonstop service to Nice from Atlanta, New York (JFK), and Philadelphia. Now that Madrid and Nice are in the cards, Delta will serve at least a dozen European destinations from Boston next summer. Madrid flights will be available daily, while Nice ones will initially run on a three-times-weekly schedule, on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. By the way, in the meantime, Barcelona flights will increase to a daily frequency from May 7, and Milan will see four-times-weekly flights from May 16. What To Expect From Delta's New Europe Flights It's no wonder Delta is investing this heavily in Boston, now that Logan International hosts their Delta One Lounge and a revamped, larger Sky Club Space. In short, they're aiming to become the first choice for travelers heading to Europe. Comfort plays a huge part in it, as well. Both Madrid and Nice routes will be run on a brand new Airbus A330-900neo, with a 281-seat configuration. Out of those, 29 are reserved for Delta One (their business class) seats, 28 are for Premium Select (the equivalent to Premium Economy, 56 are Comfort+ seats (these typically offer extra legroom), and finally, 168 seats in the Main Cabin. As far as competition goes, Madrid is a smart move. Seeing that only JetBlue offered Boston‚ÄìMadrid flights in summer, with their restrictive luggage policies and subpar in-flight services, Delta's addition will lure travelers who‚Ä¶",

    "excerpt": "The kids are back in school, the long, hazy days of summer are in the rearview mirror, and there‚Äôs a new kind of energy in the air. It's that magical time of year when you start thinking about cozy sweaters, crisp autumn air, and that first glorious sip of a pumpkin spice latte. You're holding on to that hope of a perfect weekend fall getaway. Sure, you could book the obvious trip to New York City, but let's be real‚Äîyou'll be fighting for a patch of grass in Central Park with a million other people. What if you could get all the amazing fall vibes without the crowds? Here at Travel Off Path, we believe the best autumn trips are the ones that fly under the radar. We've found 5 incredible, underrated U.S. cities that are perfect for a quick escape this season. üçÇ ‚õ∞Ô∏è Chattanooga, Tennessee The Ultimate Outdoor Adventure Hub While everyone flocks to Nashville or the Smokies, Chattanooga is the smart choice for an active fall weekend. Tucked into the Tennessee River Valley, the city is surrounded by mountains that explode with color in late October. The vibe is laid-back, the hiking is epic, and the views are 10/10. - You Have To: Take the incline railway up Lookout Mountain to visit Rock City and Ruby Falls. The panoramic view of seven states is a classic for a reason. For a more chill experience, walk across the vibrant blue Walnut Street Bridge and explore the cool local shops and cafes in the NorthShore district. üçñ Kansas City, Missouri The Cool & Cultured Midwest Surprise Forget what you think you know about ‚Äúflyover country.‚Äù Kansas City is having a major moment, and fall is the perfect time to visit. This city is a powerhouse of culture, with world-class jazz clubs, a surprisingly hip arts scene, and, of course, the best barbecue on the planet. - You Have To: Make a pilgrimage to an iconic BBQ joint like Joe's Kansas City (yes, the one in the gas station!) or Arthur Bryant's. Then, spend an afternoon at the incredible (and free!) Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art before checking out the galleries and breweries in the trendy Crossroads Arts District. üßÄ Madison, Wisconsin The Perfect College Town Weekend There‚Äôs a special kind of energy in a great college town in the fall, and Madison might just be the best of them all. Situated on a narrow strip of land between two sparkling lakes, this city is pure autumn magic. The air is crisp, the university gives the city a vibrant buzz, and the fall colors are spectacular. - You Have To: Spend Saturday morning at the Dane County Farmers' Market, one of‚Ä¶",

    "date": "2025-09-01",
    "excerpt": "Fall is arguably the best period to visit Cancun if you're hoping for smaller crowds and cheaper prices. After all, the July and August crowds are gone, hotels deliberately lower prices to attract more guests, and there are getaway deals galore‚Ä¶ or are there? For years now, sun-seekers on a budget have waited impatiently for September to book their Cancun vacay, knowing they would get more bang for their buck, but as the experts have told us in 2025, this may no longer be the case. After all, ‚Äòlow' and ‚Äòhigh' seasons are no longer existing concepts in the Caribbean hub. That's one of 4 things the Cancun Sun, the leading independent English-speaking authority on all things Mayan Riviera, has shared as we head into the (supposedly) quieter months: Cancun's ‚ÄòLow Season' Is a Thing of the Past If you're headed for Cancun this upcoming season, the main thing you should know is that those images of a deserted hotel strip, with a wide availability of first-come, first-served restaurants, and open slots on guided tours, may no longer be the case. As they have noted, ‚Äòlow season' now looks more like ‚Äòless busy'. There are lower crowds than in winter, that's for sure, but if you're visiting on the weekend, you should expect a major influx of beach bums at public bathing areas, and partygoers to flock into the entertainment district. Long gone are the days you could just ‚Äòchance it' and book stuff last-minute in the fall. Be it trendy restaurants, popular activities, like visiting cenotes or Mayan ruins, or spa appointments at your resort, you'd be wise to secure spots in advance. Who Will You Be Sharing the Resort With? The Cancun Sun also reiterates that, despite the continuous crowding, the type of crowd changes. After all, schools across the United States and Canada have resumed classes, so you can for sure expect to see fewer families with children and adolescents in resorts. This helps contribute to the overall adult-centered, more laid-back feel. That being said, you can never entirely rule out children running around and splashing around in the pool when all you need is some peace and quiet. Your fellow Americans may be gone, but there will be families from other parts of the world that do not operate under the U.S. school schedule. In those cases, it's best to book an adults-only resort. Here are some options, and their average September nightly rate: - Le Blanc Spa Resort‚Äî$706-a-night - Atelier Playa Mujeres‚Äî$708-a-night - Excellence Playa Mujeres‚Äî$622-a-night - Live Aqua Beach Resort‚Äî$337-a-night - Royalton CHIC Cancun‚Äî$257-a-night Deep Discounts Are Over, But Value Can Be Found As you might have noticed from the averages given above, it's‚Ä¶",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Vancouver is a place of balance, where city meets sea, mountains meet metropolis, and quiet open spaces and colorful communities collide. No matter the season or your reason for visiting, Vancouver has something for everyone. Adventure lovers can cycle the scenic Stanley Park seawall, hike through forested trails, paddle along the coastline, or hit the slopes in the winter. Those looking for a more relaxed pace can browse stylish boutiques, unwind at a spa, or sip cocktails at trendy local hotspots. With a mix of urban delights, natural sites, diverse culture, and world-class cuisine, Vancouver is a choose-your-own-adventure destination, and it all starts with where you stay. If you plan your trip just right, you can enjoy the best of both nature and city‚Äîday or night, rain or shine‚Äîand Vancouver has plenty of places to stay within walking distance from it all. And while the city is known for having a high cost of living, you don‚Äôt need to spend your entire paycheck to find somewhere lovely to rest your head. From Canada‚Äôs first Aboriginal arts hotel to a buzzy beachfront property dating back to 1912, read on for the best affordable hotels in Vancouver that are luxurious and low-key, but won‚Äôt break the bank. FAQ: What's the average price of a hotel in Vancouver? Rivaling the hotel rates of major metropolitan cities like London and New York, Vancouver‚Äôs average nightly prices peak substantially during the summer months (July is busiest). Because Vancouver is facing a hotel shortage, demand exceeds supply, causing the prices to spike. Overall, average nightly rates range from $300-$600 per night for standard rooms, with luxury accommodations reaching closer to $1,000 a night. That being said, when you visit Vancouver during off-peak times (typically November to March), you‚Äôll see much lower rates‚Äîcloser to $200 a night for standard rooms. What part of Vancouver is best to stay in? Vancouver‚Äôs Burrard Inlet is packed with prestigious places to stay, all within walking distance of Stanley Park, downtown shopping, and mini pedestrian ferries that take you to top attractions like Science World and Granville Island from downtown. You‚Äôll find lots of beautiful waterfront parks and beaches here, and some of the city‚Äôs best restaurants are close by. Plus, this area is the departure point for boat tours and whale-watching excursions, great for those looking to hit the water. That being said, this is also the most expensive part of the city to stay in. If hiking, biking, or skiing are your‚Ä¶",

    "excerpt": "While pondering her travel pet peeves, actress Kristin Davis can‚Äôt help but sound precisely like Charlotte York, her character in the Sex and the City universe (for those who have been living under a rock for three decades). ‚ÄúI hope I‚Äôm not going to upset a bunch of people, but it‚Äôs really loud complaining. I understand it‚Äôs hard to travel, but I feel that politeness is something we‚Äôre losing track of in our world. I feel really sad about that,‚Äù says Davis, who recently wrapped the final season of And Just Like That‚Ä¶ When it‚Äôs pointed out that she just expressed a fear of complaining about complaining, she lets out a giant cackling laugh. ‚ÄúThat is so me. That is so me!‚Äù The actress, who shares behind-the-scenes tidbits and recaps Sex and the City on her podcast Are You a Charlotte?, spoke with Cond√© Nast Traveler about her long professional and personal relationship with Kenya, the New York City tourist attractions she loves, and why the rumble of an airport runway sends her straight to sleep. Her go-to flying outfit: Oh, it's always such a dilemma. I really have a uniform. I can't say that it's the most attractive, but it's my super comfortable clothes. It‚Äôs my AG boyfriend jeans that are a little baggy, then my James Perse long-sleeved t-shirt, then my Jenni Kayne v-neck Flynn sweater, and a thin Patagonia [fleece] just in case, because you can ball it up in a bag and get it out if you‚Äôre cold on the plane. Those planes are just too cold! Her priorities when planning a vacation: It depends on whether my children are going or not. If they are, it's all about the kid activities, because I have a super active seven-year-old boy; I need athletics or fancy slides into the pool. Before children, I would go to Bali. If I had just finished work and I wanted to go to an island, I loved the Amanyara in Turks and Caicos. My more adventure-type travels are generally on the African continent, and then it's more animals. I almost never use food as a [motivator]. I'm not a foodie in that way. I like food! I like to taste local food, for sure, but I'm not going to be seeking that out, you know? I‚Äôm thinking about the hotel and safari. Her amazing packing tip: First of all, I love to pack, and I hate to unpack. Right now, I have two unpacked suitcases in my room. It's really bad. But I do love to pack, and I have two methods.

    "excerpt": "We‚Äôd just left port, mainland Scotland fading behind us, and were sailing into soft yellow sunlight. The sea was the dark silvery blue of raw denim, and the wind, for now, seemed settled, unshifting. ‚ÄúHere they come,‚Äù said Mungo Watson, our boat‚Äôs skipper, with deadpan calm, hands on the helm. On deck, the crew and I turned to survey the horizon, then gingerly moved toward the bow of the boat and looked down. ‚ÄúNo, not porpoises‚Äîdolphins,‚Äù Watson continued. ‚ÄúFor some reason, and still nobody really knows why, they absolutely love boats.‚Äù It was the storybook start to our voyage that began only an hour or so earlier at the marina of Mallaig. Eight strangers had climbed aboard Eda Frandsen for a more-or-less unscripted salty-dog sailing adventure around Scotland‚Äôs Inner Hebrides. Our crew were the boat‚Äôs recently wed co-owners, Watson and Stella Marina, experienced sailors who bought the 1938 Danish gaff cutter in 2020 and now run trips out of Cornwall and the west coast of Scotland from April to September. Some, such as the nine-night passage from Falmouth to Oban, probably require more sea grit than, say, a slow long-weekend sail along the Cornish coast. But none of them call for any sailing experience, they reckon. Which is lucky because I had zero. Nothing. We all had different reasons for being there: some to see Scotland in summer without joining the conga line of Glencoe-bound camper vans; others for the heck of it. ‚ÄúI just like old boats,‚Äù said David, my affable bunk buddy. Fair enough. I was there to get into the hard-to-breach orbit of offshore sailing, a world that has stubbornly few points of entry, except for those who know someone with a boat or have pots of cash. Its reputation for exclusivity doesn‚Äôt help either. ‚ÄúThe elitism in sailing is undeniable,‚Äù says Marina. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre absolutely trying to escape that. That‚Äôs one of the reasons we set up Eda Frandsen: to introduce people to the beauty of being at sea. To open sailing to everyone.‚Äù By late afternoon we‚Äôd arrived at Eigg (population: 83), a small, flat, tennis-court-green island with a single peak. The sun was slipping downwards and on the horizon distant mountains turned pale shades of lavender and rose. Small sounds assumed an intense clarity as a deep calm emanated from the nearby land: the lapping of waves and the soft clatter of cutlery. This was the spiritual start of my trip. I was at sea. Life was good. It would get better. Below deck we dined by candlelight in the cozy wood-finished galley on fresh langoustines, mussels, and chilled ros√©. Marina, who spent much of her career as a chef on superyachts, is an immensely‚Ä¶",

As the temperatures begin to cool, the leaves start to change colors, and the smell of crisp apples and pumpkin spice lattes hits the air, New Yorkers begin gearing up for another cozy fall. Every year at the end of summer, I lock in my plans to visit upstate New York to take advantage of all the activities going on there during my favorite season, whether that be day-tripping to Sleepy Hollow, booking tickets to The Great Jack O‚ÄôLantern Blaze, paranormal investigating at the Shanley Hotel in the Catskills, or sipping hot apple cider at the pumpkin patch. As a lover of scary movies, haunted houses, and Halloween activities, this is the season I wait for all year long, and New York State has plenty of incredible activities worth traveling for (many that are even reachable without a car, for my fellow New York City dwellers). Every year, the season seems to get shorter and shorter, so it‚Äôs best to plan your activities far in advance to ensure you can fit everything in. For those determined to hit all the stops before October 31, I‚Äôve compiled a guide to doing Halloween season in upstate New York right. Read on for where to eat, stay, and play in the area for a ghostly good time. FAQ: What areas are classified as upstate New York? As a Manhattanite, and for the purpose of this guide, I‚Äôve classified upstate New York as everything north of the Bronx (although I know this can be a bit contentious among New Yorkers). This includes the Hudson Valley, Capital District, Adirondacks, Catskills, and Finger Lakes. What town in New York is best for Halloween? While there is no one town that takes the crown, Sleepy Hollow is a great option if you‚Äôre willing to brave the crowds. The village is easily accessible to city dwellers via the Metro-North railroad and takes about an hour to arrive at the Tarrytown stop. From there, it‚Äôs a short Uber ride (or under a 30-minute walk) to all the on-theme attractions, like the Headless Horseman Statue and Philipsburg Manor. However, be prepared for throngs of crowds, few places to park, and long lines for restaurants and other attractions during the Halloween season. When is the best time to visit? To really make the most of fall in upstate New York, I suggest visiting in September, before the Halloween crowds start taking over‚Äîthere's normally still a chill in the air and the leaves are beginning to change colors. If you‚Äôre interested in‚Ä¶",

Her company's projects include a community and wellness center at Kenya's Kakuma Refugee Camp; a national memorial in Oslo; and the 2021 Serpentine Pavilion in London. Here, Vally shares her favorite places in Joburg, like hot spots for South African fashion and where to get what she believes are the planet's finest dosas. Bring your appetite Good meals are guaranteed at Yeoville Dinner Club, in the inner suburb of Yeoville. Chef and host Sanza Sandile serves seasonal dishes at a communal table. ‚ÄúThe food is sensational and tells a story of our history, of Yeoville's cosmopolitan past‚Äîand extremely cosmopolitan present,‚Äù Vally says. For grab-and-go fare, she loves the sidewalk markets downtown, where vendors sell fresh vetkoek, or fried dough bread. Dosa Hut in Fordsburg, she says, ‚Äúmakes some of the best dosas I've had in the world.‚Äù Fashion forward In residential Randburg, Vally loves Magugu House, the store run by the fashion designer Thebe Magugu: ‚ÄúEvery new collection reflects the South Africa he grew up in and South Africa now.‚Äù She also recommends the conceptual work of Lezanne Viviers, whose Viviers Studio in tony Parktown welcomes guests by appointment. ‚ÄúIf you have something made to measure, you'll get to meet the collective of women she works with,‚Äù Vally says. ‚ÄúIt's a really special experience.‚Äù Art Adventures To take the city's pulse, Vally visits the Joburg Contemporary Art Foundation in Forest Town. ‚ÄúIt's a research institute, art space, and innovation tech laboratory. I like the themed exhibitions with food and music.‚Äù She also enjoys the Centre for the Less Good Idea in Maboneng, a performance space cofounded by the South African artist William Kentridge, where ‚Äúsome exhibitions are so experimental, you feel like you're part of the testing process.‚Äù At the Cradle of Humankind paleoanthropological site, Vally recommends the Nirox Sculpture Park, which offers more than 50 installations across 75 acres of lawns, wetlands, and the banks of the Blaauwbankspruit River.
