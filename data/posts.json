Your little sister’s wedding in May. Pub trivia at Donnellan’s next week. Anniversary in November. Like it could still happen. Like those old bones could wake up one day and plod across the plains, through the hoodoos, careful not to shatter brittle limbs. A tragic thing. People will pull their cars over to cry. No one will take pictures. Then when Winter comes, and the monster lays down its body to die by the sea, everyone will be relieved. We’ll burn the stars off with our bonfire. Maybe we’ll all go swim.<graphic src=\"http://100wordstory.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Go-Swim-II-256x300.jpg\" alt=\"Image of sun and shadow on a wall calendar.\"/></p>\n    <p/>\n    <p/>\n    <p/>\n    <p/>\n    <p><strong>George Nevgodovskyy</strong> lives in Vancouver, Canada.

Some pictures were taken during the act, others days later. Our belongings looked more delicate in daylight. One rule was never to move them for the composition’s sake. In hindsight, they seemed like remnants of another couple, another me, suspended in time like an Ikea prop. That was what he, too, said in the doorway before he left. He could no longer recognize the man in the pictures, though technically he wasn’t in any of them. Only the keepsakes of his travels. His ultramarine walking shoes, his wedding ring.

    "body": "<p>Carlos calls another halt and turns to the cellos. I rest my violin on my knee and allow myself my game while waiting, scanning the orchestra, assessing the players' attraction.\n</p>\n<p>\"No, no! You're racing. You always race. Play it again and stay with me. You must watch me.\" Carlos pushes back his mane of hair then sweeps his hands, holding them paused aloft before his definite down-beat. Ian, the cellist on the second desk, follows Carlos, eyes wide with attention though he's rigid, a strict metronome, chastising his cello into submission. I dismiss him from my secret list. I wouldn't sleep with him. He'd be a bad driver too. Ian is handsome, but he's not musical and he'd be bad in bed. \n</p>\n<p>Carlos turns to the copse of woodwind. He isolates their long-held chords from the rolling notes in the strings, who are climbing and descending scales on Escher staircases.\n</p>\n<p>\"Four bars from figure 9. Again!\"\n</p>\n<p>Carlos extends his arms as the straddle-legged cellos crescendo, jockeying through hills and valleys of notes. He reins in the players, cups his hand and squeezes his fingers to finish a phrase. The music is pliable in his arms, the lover motif caressed in his movements. Minor bass notes suggest a menacing threat. The beauty is fragile. \n</p>\n<p>The rehearsal is not going well. Carlos has increased the tempo to performance speed. Now, it's time to polish and finesse. Tension thrums through the orchestra as if it's written into the score.\n</p>\n<p>The brass still mess about. Not the French-horns - universally the bores, swaddling their bells and pipes like they're babies - but always the trombones who lower theirs slides as if they're pipettes into barrels. They have the most counting to do. I turn sideways to look at them, the bad boys, and Rob gives me a saucy wink. I like the way he wets his lips. Ian's off, but Rob I'll add to my list.\n</p>\n<p>\"Cellos and basses, you're racing again! You're as clumsy and eager as teenage boys.\" The orchestra titters though Carlos doesn't intend to be funny. \n</p>\n<p>He lays his baton on the lectern and pulls his jumper over his head. His shirt rides up, exposing his stomach. Tanned, taut with a trail line of hair leading down. Carlos is both lion and tamer, tapping his baton like he's drumming protractile claws. I flush. I like what I've seen. The quick glimpse has triggered a reassessment. Although Carlos is married and has a young child, I can desire him. Instead of looking around, I only needed to look up. \n</p>\n<p>I play with new enthusiasm. There are two ways to attract Carlos's attention: one is to play badly, and the other is to play well.\n</p>\n<p>I bare the tender side of my wrist for the security stamp then queue for the bag check, until I'm released with my friends into the crowded, dark interior. Smoke machines send hazy clouds over the mass of strobe-lit dancers, their movements jagged but synchronised. The techno beat is rigid in common time. It stifles the waltz theme I've carried in my head all day. Thoughts of Carlos. All day. \n</p>\n<p>I want to summon Carlos - dancing with me - but I can't conjure him. This was a mistake. I'm not in the mood. I won't find Carlos here. Frustrated, I yell to my friends, \"I'll catch you up.\" \n</p>\n<p>They nod, and waving their arms in the air, smiles smacked to their faces, they sway and bounce in a crocodile line, winding their way into the heart of the crowd. \n</p>\n<p>I shout for a vodka and tonic and a bottle of water. I know the guy on my left is advancing, but I give him my back - he's not Carlos - and drink in gulps, leaving my plastic glass on the bar. \n</p>\n<p>\"Fuck it!\" I break off an ear of the Mickey pill I hid in my bra and toss it into my mouth, chasing with mouthfuls of water. I thread my way through the smiling dancers who separate, making way. The floor vibrates, rising to meet my feet as the crowd jump up and down, whipped in waves by the DJ. \n</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/06/symphony-fantastique-by-emily-macdonald.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In the summer, it was more prominent. Surrounded by tanned skin, its borders harshened. When we were teenagers, he told me once he thought it looked like a snake. We’d been sitting on the same pavement, licking dripping popsicles. I’d pressed my finger into the keloid and asked if he could feel it.</p>\n    <p>“No.”</p>\n    <p>I moved my finger further up. “What about now?”</p>\n    <p>“Still no.”</p>\n    <p>I gave up. He straightened his leg to create a canvas, took the blue-stained end of his popsicle stick, and traced the mark.</p>\n    <p>“You see it, right?” he said. “It’s a copperhead, I think.” He paused. “Or maybe a viper.”</p>\n    <p>“I don’t know,” I said. “To me, it looks like a river.”</p>\n    <p>He stood before me now, dancing. The river on his knee flowed freely as he glided across the court. I had not seen him in 13 years. He was a man now. He was a ring leader.</p>\n    <p>“Welcome,” he said. Coke and cheap gin splashed from the cup in his hand. “Welcome to the greatest show on Earth.”</p>\n    <p>It was late June. I’d come home to lead a photography workshop at the high school where we’d met. He was in town to sell his father’s house.</p>\n    <p>“Do you remember when he made you sit in the attic to admire his insulation?” he’d asked when we’d spotted each other in the grocery store that afternoon. “I left you alone for two minutes and came back to your feet dangling from the ceiling.”</p>\n    <p>We decided to get a drink.</p>\n    <p>In the bar, a neon sign cast a hot pink beam across his face, and for a second, he looked like a teenager again. His face swelled with hope.</p>\n    <p>An hour passed. Then another. We avoided the big questions. The do-you-remembers kept us full.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Do you remember when we skipped sixth period to get Chinese food, and you burned your tongue so bad that you had to go to the nurse when we got back?</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Do you remember when we painted my room forest green and accidentally stained the carpet?</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Do you remember when the tent we’d stitched out of stolen pool towels collapsed on us in the rain?</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Do you remember when we built that bottle rocket?</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Do you remember why we never shot it off?</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Do you still have it?</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Can we go get it now?</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>When we found it in his dad’s garage, we realized its base had decomposed. We ran next door to a convenience store and bought a liter of Coke. He remembered how to fit the pieces together better than I did.</p>\n    <p>We lugged his father’s rusting bicycle pump to a deserted basketball court at the end of the street.</p>\n    <p>He told me to sit down and enjoy the show.</p>\n    <p>“Behold,” he said, lowering his voice. “Magic beyond your wildest dreams.”</p>\n    <p>As he danced, a spotlight fastened to the hoop reflected off his wedding band.</p>\n    <p>He became a ring of fire to me.</p>\n    <p>He filled the rocket with air.</p>\n    <p>He pushed <i>down, down, down </i>on the pump.</p>\n    <p>All along, I wanted to say, “Do you remember when we stopped loving each other?”</p>\n    <p>Then, I watched it go.</p>\n    <p><i>Up, up, up</i>.</p>\n    <p>I watched it spiral.</p>\n    <p>I watched it fight our gravity.</p>\n    <p>I wondered, when it came back down, where it would land.</p>\n    <p>***</p>\n    <p><strong>Megan Griffo</strong> is a journalist and fiction writer based in New York City.

Struggles with the time, I know that, know that getting here ten minutes early is pointless. But that’s me, and that’s him. So I did what I always do and sat in the car waiting. Maybe for nothing. Maybe it’ll evaporate from him. He’ll be in The Crown, five pints-deep and glassy eyed. I try to remember he’s doing me a favour, he’s helping me. I’ll try to remember that this is part of it. That you can’t get the story without the slips. There’s no remembering without the forgetting. The crystalised yarns that spool into brilliant, tragic skeins from the past means that the present is more watercolour, less present.</p>\n<p>The condensation on the windscreen, the carpark full of dog walkers, cutting desire lines across the reclaimed countryside. All a fucking waste of time if he doesn’t… if he forgets. Again.</p>\n<p>‘I’ll take you up there, one day young’un.’</p>\n<p>The last dregs of lukewarm acrid coffee. How long’s too long?</p>\n<p>Then I see him, his familiar gait struggling down the slope, a silhouette against the wool-white sky. He shuffled past the car.</p>\n<p>‘Len?’</p>\n<p>Half cut. Amber fingertips rub dew drops from his red nose.</p>\n<p>‘Young’un. Not late am I?’</p>\n<p>‘Nah, Len. You’re alright.’</p>\n<p>That’s him, and that’s me.</p>\n<p>‘Well. Should we away up the big hill, will we? Get the lay of the land from there, eh?’</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The Canada Geese, gorged on spectral white bread, skulk through the sleet, ominous triangular footprints. Above, seagulls and pigeons flit too close. Len covers his head and mutters a warning to them.</p>\n<p>‘The ducks and the swans I don’t mind, but the fucking seagulls are lethal.’</p>\n<p>We walk without words.</p>\n<p>The hill almost blends into the countryside. But there’s something ghostly about it, too. It’s not quite here, in the present, as Len and me spiral up the side on carefully carved paths. We’re walking up the waste, the scar tissue dug out from the land. A hill he helped to build, shovelling out stone.</p>\n<p>‘Was the biggest waste heap around,’ heaves Len, bent nearly double as he climbs. ‘They’ve done it up bonny now. But after it finished, so to say, by heck was it an eye sore. Ha’way we’ll take a quick sit here, young’un.’</p>\n<p>He sits on the bench and looks out over the road to the smoke-black pillars of Penshaw Monument. ‘Was it ever a terrible sight. When I was a young’un meself, I could see the colliery from me mam and dad’s bedroom. Used to watch them, a big long line of men all walking up the road to the colliery. Me father, me older brothers Matthew and Luke, all of them passed to spirit now. But I used to watch them. Didn’t really have a clue what they were doing, where they were going, what they’d do when they got there. I just knew that they went under the earth. Then in the blink of an eye, I’m following them, you know. Doon under the earth meself. Right under here.’ And he points down the hill, beyond the spoil, beyond the paths and reclaimed lakes. Under. I follow his finger. I try to follow his words, the staccato leaps stitching times and places into a patchwork that struggles to make sense.</p>\n<p>We sit side by side, sleet soaking through our trousers, heartrates returning halfway up the hill. I ask him what it was like, working in the colliery. I thought he hadn’t heard, lost in the perspicacity of the past. Looking backwards across the fields.</p>\n<p>‘I’ll tell you this, young’un. Being totally honest. I never had a clue. I used to just do what I was telt. Never knew what it meant. When I was down the Maudlin Seam… I was always afraid. It’s a hard thing to admit to now, but then… impossible.’</p>\n<p>The imagined impossibilities, the remembered traumas. They skew Len sideways, as they do. His eyes close. When they open, a new thoughts – or maybe it’s the same thought, in someone else’s clothes – floods out.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://theshortstory.co.uk/short-story-king-of-the-maudlin-seam-by-tom-astley/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>This is a close reading of  ‘Pick’ by David O’Dwyer which won the Cambridge Flash Fiction Prize 2025. Reading the winning Flash Ficiton before this essay is advised. </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>As soon as I read David O’Dwyer’s<a href=\"https://theshortstory.co.uk/flash-fiction-pick-by-david-odwyer/\"> ‘Pick’ </a>I knew it was a winner. I love so much about this dark, brooding, sucker-punch Flash Fiction. The title has suggestions of picking things up, picking locks, picking at a scab. Taking what’s ours and what isn’t. And here, it’s the name of the main character – the lonesome man who ‘works in the quarry’ (pickaxe also springs to mind). It might be a family name or perhaps a nickname – the kind given among people who are close, familiar – and this sense of community that borders on claustraphobic, permeates the entire Flash.</p>\n<p>O’Dwyer paints Pick swiftly: ‘woolly hat and donkey jacket’ – what a great detail; it’s cold outside and we have a sense of him being a buttoned-up type. We learn he ‘works in a quarry, breaks stone’ – the absence of the conjunction here simplifies the sentences, gives it a conversational tone that’s to the point, reflecting the kind of men who work and live in the area. Pick is ‘white-faced, lugubrious, red-eyed’ with the colours suggestive of a haunted, intense, sinister appearance. ‘Lugubrious’ is a bit of a mouthful, seems somewhat unexpected, but it evokes a narrator who’s a reader, a thinker, someone who puzzles over the meanings of things – it sets him slightly apart as he observes Pick entering ‘our bar’ after his Friday shift. The possessive adjective here is also perfect – a sense of collective ownership and again, that feel of regular routines, of community, of small-town life. A certain possessiveness.</p>\n<p>All this, and we’re only two sentences along.</p>\n<p>In the second paragraph, we learn Pick is half an hour late (people really do know one another around here), which creates a slight unease. Why’s he late? What’s going on? The narrator pulls him a beer, receives a ‘grunt of thanks’. There’s tension here – which way are we being led? Is Pick the strong-but-silent type? Or the quiet man who resents being bothered? What’s going on? We’re told Pick ‘takes a while to thaw’ offering us the promise of an answer, while reinforcing that sense he is, perhaps, a bit of a loner, someone who keeps to himself. Nonetheless, the narrator knows him, knows his drink (Bulmer’s Draught), and there’s that polite ‘thanks’ – so perhaps things are okay?</p>\n<p>When the barman offers Pick a bit of friendly banter – about charity shop hunting and the LPs and badges he likes to collect – it seems that this is the direction we’re heading in. It’s a story, we might be thinking, of middle-aged loneliness. Masculinity and the challenges of finding connection. But… something is slightly <i>off</i> – Pick doesn’t take the cue, doesn’t reply to the narrator’s questions, just ‘shrugs’. Again, the ground we’re on is just that little bit unsteady, and this uncharacteristic behaviour nicely links with that opening hook about his late arrival.</p>\n<p>Eventually, the narrator watches Pick leave the bar, and wonders if he’ll be back for another drink or ‘his microwaved cottage pie and chips.’ This last image, of a lonely man exiting the bar by himself, is a pretty depressing image and it’s hard, on a first reading, not to feel the rise of sympathy. But then, in a brilliant break, timed perfectly by O’Dwyer, we’re introduced to an entirely new character and narrative angle – a sentence that is simple and dark and devastating: ‘Rosemary was the name of the girl that went missing.’</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Shit.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>We’re given particulars. She was about to start Teacher Training; was known to Pick because she’d worked at ‘Webb’s Hardware Store’. He’d been spotted in the shop a few days before Rosemary’s disappearance.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://theshortstory.co.uk/essay-a-close-reading-of-pick-by-rupert-dastur/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Will do.”</p>\n    <p>“You should be running a stall. You could sell LPs and books and those badges you wear.”</p>\n    <p>This is normally Pick’s cue.  To talk about <i>Smoke on the Water</i>by Deep Purple.

No relation to the whiskey distillers but a young woman due to start Teacher Training College in September. Pick knew her, on account of her working in Webb’s Hardware Store. A customer confirmed that Pick was in there a few days before the disappearance. Blathering on about <i>Searching for the Young Soul Rebels, </i>by Dexys Midnight Runners. It had been released that July.</p>\n    <p>It was strange Pick refused to lead the search. He was familiar with every excavation and pit for miles around. Forest paths and winding tracts. Lakesides, grottos, dumps. Blind spots behind clumps of trees. He’d grapple with stone, sand, riprap, gravel, slate. Appreciated how nature was constructed. How it fell apart.</p>\n    <p>“There’s nothing connecting Pick to that girl’s disappearance,” I’d say to the locals. “He was just fond of her that’s all.” And I’d wipe the counter clean and pull pints.</p>\n    <p>One night, Rosemary’s brothers grabbed Pick outside. Pressed him against the wall, twisted his arm behind his back. Said things, threatened more. I saw his face smudged against a pane of glass. I saw the whorls of hair, the creased white skin, the crooked monkey hat. A creature crossed between anemone and amoeba, trapped in glass.</p>\n    <p>I brought him in, poured a brandy. “The boys are frustrated,” I assured him. “It’ll soon pass.”</p>\n    <p>But it hasn’t.

    "body": "<p>I had dropped my son at school and was dragging myself home up Skinner Street. Several years earlier, when my son was three, I used to walk him to nursery every day, and I remembered this period as a time of profound psychological security. Even small encounters, the <i>hey-how-are-yous</i> where neither party broke stride or knew each other’s name, served to confirm something. As if they settled a question by fixing my position in the world.</p>\n<p>When my son started at the same school as his sister, I told my wife that it suited me to take over one drop-off a week. I already missed those brief social encounters, and thought it would help my sanity to keep them up. But Nicole laughed, as if I made my offer mockingly and she was choosing to defend herself. She often made these jokes, implying that, because of a small number of accidents the children had suffered, I was incapable of caring for them without her.</p>\n<p>The school was quite far, and when my daughter started my wife had occasionally ordered a taxi instead of walking to the bus stop, billing the charges as a management expense. After only a few weeks, before even that first wet and cold winter, she stopped mentioning the bus, and by the time my son started in reception my wife and daughter were on first name terms with many of the local cabbies.</p>\n<p>At school birthday parties, I often found myself adrift, unclear about the rules of conversation. I found ways to talk around my absence from drop-off and the awkwardness this created. I implied I took an active role elsewhere in the home to explain why the other parents might not recognise me. I emphasised that taxis were Nicole’s one, rare extravagance, and sympathised with complaints about the morning crowds, as if I too squeezed myself among those close-packed bodies, instead of waving my family into the driver’s cab each day, standing on the doorstep in my frayed pyjamas.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The morning I dropped my son at school for the first time, before my embarrassing encounter on the journey home, I entertained the idea of getting out of the house early. My daughter was having a blood test, a rite-of-passage which equally terrified and impressed her, and my wife was chaperoning her at the hospital. I thought we might catch the bus together, my son and I. Perhaps we’d sit with one of his friends, alongside a parent on their way to work. With this in mind, I wore the suit Nicole had had tailored for our wedding, to give the impression I had somewhere important to go after, instead of returning home to my small basement office, where nobody cares how I dress, to write stories that baffle my intentions. But by the time I was ready we were already almost late, and I had no choice but to book a cab.</p>\n<p>And so we met nobody, and I exchanged no words of greeting, and was wrapped in the unbroken patterns of my frustrated thoughts as I walked home from drop-off, when near the middle of my journey I stepped into the neglected public gardens off Skinner Street. Two paths lay before me: the longer concrete walkway, which curved around the fringes of the grass, past a pavilion that resembled a brutalist dining chair; and a dirt track, worn through use, across the middle of the grass. I chose the track, and was briefly disoriented by one of those vistas that sometimes surprise you in London. The angle of the trees and bushes conspired to hide any sign of the high-rises and traffic on Skinner Street. It was as if I walked through a wild, natural space, far from the ills of modern civilisation.</p>\n<p>I heard a sound ahead. A woman’s voice. It sounded like she spoke my name, Liam. She was standing on grass near the end of the track, raised up slightly on a mound, close to the entrance to the children’s playground. She held a coiled leash, and raised her hands to her mouth to call my name again.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://theshortstory.co.uk/short-story-greyhound-by-joshua-davis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>When Banksy visited New Orleans a few years after Hurricane Katrina, the artist left 17 murals behind, sprinkled across the city. One piece on the exterior of a biker bar, <i>Boy on a Life Preserver Swing,</i> had been spray-painted over and then reduced to rubble after the bar was demolished. Ronnie Fredericks, a dump truck driver, went to the site to collect the cinderblocks that made up the mural and stored them for years until he found an opportunity—and an art-loving New Orleans hotelier—to bring the artwork back to life. Ivy Knight writes a delightful <i>Oxford American</i> story about three people who come together to restore a Banksy.</p><blockquote><p>Grenier met Cummings and Fredericks at a warehouse in Bywater—the same one where she’d spent two months working on</p><i>Looters</i>. Located along the railroad tracks close to the Mississippi River, it takes up a whole city block. As she looked at the collection of cinderblocks, she had a few concerns. First was where to begin, for they were in no particular order, and she had only Fredericks’s word that a Banksy existed under the paint. And was Fredericks trustworthy? She noticed he had a tattoo of Da Vinci on his bicep. “I was a little suspicious when I saw that tattoo of Leonardo because I thought, ‘Well, maybe you’re an artist or maybe you’re a forger. I don’t know who you are yet.’” Counterfeit art is a common concern in Grenier’s work. “There will always be art forgers as long as there’s a demand for art.

One that uses less fuel and spews less CO2 into the air than individual cars. The space they create is a rare one: an environment where strangers are connected by the simple need to get somewhere. You can’t buy anything on a bus (like you can on a plane or train), you can’t upgrade either – you’re all in it together. As more and more public places become privatized, I feel there is a fragility to this sort of space. The Greyhound is more library than shopping mall, more community centre than curated retail space. In our post-Covid world, these vehicles also remind us of a before-time when we could sit maskless in our Greyhound bubbles, rubbing shoulders with strangers, safely breathing alongside each other without fear. They might yet become symbols for a way we once lived in each other’s presence.</p></blockquote><h2>\n\t\t\t\t\tMore picks from <i>Orion Magazine</i>\n\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2023/01/26/messengers-from-the-past/\">Messengers From the Past</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“I may have seen all there is to see at the Bosque yet I keep returning each year.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>At Disney World, the magic doesn’t unfold the same way for everyone. In his essay, Daniel Currell places two families in sharp relief: one stumbling through a gauntlet of 6 a.m. wake-up calls, app alerts, and frantic booking scrambles; the other drifting effortlessly from ride to ride, their day smoothed by money. The contrast is stark and telling. A park once imagined as a democratic playground for American families has hardened into a stratified experience, a theme-park parable of the country’s widening inequality. The fairy tale endures—but only for those who can afford it.</p><blockquote><p>When you are at a Disney park, you will inevitably hear “When You Wish Upon a Star,” Disney’s unofficial anthem. Disney adopted that song in the 1940s; its second line, “makes no difference who you are,” encapsulated its egalitarian ethos. Now the song reads to me like nostalgic, middle-class cosplay that helps us relive the Disney that Walt created. The roughly $90 to get your family cut-the-line access to a premier ride (on top of what, for a family of four, could easily be over $700 dropped on tickets already) is the real Disney, the one the market created.</p></blockquote><h2>More picks on Disney</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/07/16/dark-ride-to-the-source/\">Dark Ride to the Source</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Holding on to Joy at Disneyland.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/02/12/yesterday-tomorrow-and-banished-forever/\">Yesterday, Tomorrow, and Banished Forever</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“The Andersons were kicked out of Disneyland’s most exclusive club.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>When Laurie Abraham was diagnosed with colon cancer 14 months ago, she realized just how taboo pooping is as a topic of conversation. In particular, <i>women</i> pooping. As she went through treatment, Abraham navigated an array of awkward conversations and personal revelations, which she details in a witty, illuminating essay for <i>The Cut</i>: </p><blockquote><p>How deep did my own aversion to the scatological run? I think back: When other moms got their toddlers the classic</p><i>Everyone Poops,</i>I was like, “Do we have to?” (We didn’t.) As an 8-year-old, my younger daughter, Tess, liked to lope around the house yelling, “Poop, poop in your face!” I laughed when, at 3, she’d begun riding her rocking horse full tilt, clad only in a little black cowboy hat. I laughed when, at the same age, Edie, her older sister, told her father to “close the fucking window” during a drive. It’s not like I couldn’t handle taboo subjects. Yet every time<i>poop</i>tripped off Tess’s tongue, I’d exclaim, “Stop! Tess!” My face would contort. It contorts as I’m writing this.<p>It may be partly a generational difference; my now 21- and 25-year-old daughters still will announce their specific bathroom plans—</p><i>ladies, please.</i>But the location of my cancer must be part of its befoulment. Susan Sontag is famous for exposing the negative cultural stories that cling to cancer, but what is the lowest of the low? “In the hierarchy of the body’s organs, lung cancer is felt to be less shameful than rectal cancer,” she asserted in<i>Illness As Metaphor.</i>I also felt a shock of recognition at her observation that while tuberculosis, the other focus of her book, is linked to “delicacy, sensitivity … and powerlessness,” cancer represents “whatever seem[s] ruthless, implacable, predatory.”<p>See, colon cancer is unfeminine! (Yes, she was talking cancer in general, but the point stands.) Even the medical Establishment has spread that message. Two of the younger female patients I interviewed said doctors explicitly told them colon cancer is an “old white man’s disease,” even though it’s only slightly more prevalent in men than in women.</p><p>More broadly, colons and what comes out of them are the permitted playground of men. Delightfully, there is a whole body of research that backs this up. Bathroom graffiti is more plentiful and crap-filled in men’s toilet stalls than in women’s, according to a psychology professor named Nick Haslam. The author of</p><i>Psychology in the Bathroom,</i>he cites a study in which a “female experimenter who excused herself to use the bathroom was evaluated more negatively than one who excused herself to get some paperwork.” When a male experimenter repeated the exercise, the judginess vanished. A college student surveyed for a journal article titled “Fecal Matters: Habitus, Embodiments, and Deviance” summed up the situation: “Women are supposed to be non-poopers.”</blockquote><h2>More picks about health</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/09/03/deepseek-ai-health-chatbot/\">My Mom and Dr. DeepSeek</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“In China and around the world, the sick and lonely turn to AI.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/06/26/biohacking-conference-asprey/\">Snake Venom, Urine, and a Quest to Live Forever: Inside a Biohacking Conference Emboldened by MAHA</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“While biohacking isn’t new, the rise of Robert F.

Too much sex was dangerous, and too little sex could outright kill you. Quite the ride! </p><blockquote><p>Medieval physicians saw too much sex as a real medical concern. Conventional wisdom held that several noblemen died of sexual excess. John of Gaunt, the 14th-century first duke of Lancaster, allegedly ‘died of putrefaction of his genitals and body, caused by the frequenting of women, for he was a great fornicator’. Today, his symptoms would suggest venereal disease, but his contemporaries would probably have seen parallels with the case of Ralph, count of Vermandois. This 12th-century French nobleman had recently married his third wife when he fell seriously ill. During his convalescence, he was advised by his physician that he must abstain from intercourse, but disregarded this warning. When the doctor detected from Ralph’s urine that he had done so, he advised him to set his house in order, for he would be dead within three days – a prognosis that proved to be accurate.</p></blockquote><h2>More picks from Aeon</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/08/20/socrates-would-be-pleased/\">Socrates Would Be Pleased</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“With a class of college students and inmates, teaching philosophy in prison is a rowdy, honest and hopeful provocation.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/07/01/shoes-history-society/\">Walk In These</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Shoes are deeply personal, literally moulded to our lives.

Walecki wasn’t just a salesman; he was considered a matchmaker who took pride in pairing each player with the perfect instrument. Chris Hillman, a founding member of The Byrds, described Westwood Music as “‘the hardware store’ of the L.A. music scene.” </p><blockquote><p/><i>Check this out</i>: the three-word portal into the Fred Walecki Experience.<i>Check this out</i>, and<a href=\"\">he’d hand John Entwistle his first-ever Alembic bass</a>, a brand he would go on to use for many years with the Who.<i>Check this out</i>, and he’d pull out a guitar by Mark Whitebook or David Russell Young, luthiers he’d discovered in the mountains of Topanga Canyon, and whose instruments he sold to James Taylor and Gram Parsons. Glyn Johns bought a David Russell Young so he’d have a good acoustic guitar for the rock bands he worked with. (Johns showed me that guitar when I visited him at home last fall; he apologized for all the scratch marks. “Everybody’s played this,” he said. “Eric has played it; Jeff Beck’s played it; Jimmy Page has played it.”)</blockquote><blockquote><p>Early in her career, Bonnie Raitt was playing in little clubs and “wasn’t even expecting to do this for a living. It was kind of a hobby for me,” she told me. But Dad, she says, “showed me around and showed me the whole world of things that I could have.” He explained how different amplifiers could change her sound, and he took her to a trade show where he introduced her to the genteel, rather ancient chairman of Martin Guitar, C. F. Martin III.</p><p>Raitt has a mischievous, bawdy sense of humor. (As a kid, I understood I was never to repeat a Bonnie Raitt joke.) Dad told C. F. Martin that Raitt was a rising star and may be in need of a custom-made guitar. “What I really need is a custom-made IUD,” she said. Martin had no idea what she was talking about, so Dad jumped in: “Uh, it’s a lot like a Martin D-35.”</p></blockquote><h2>More picks about music</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2023/05/19/the-epic-return-of-lucinda-williams/\">The Epic Return of Lucinda Williams</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Having once left an abusive relationship, Van Etten hears in Williams’s lyrics the strength of a woman who refused to let darkness define or diminish her.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2019/11/21/trigger/\">Trigger</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Willie Nelson’s been playing the same guitar — a Martin N-20 classical — for 50 years.</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2024/01/16/joni-mitchells-best-album-is-turning-fifty-its-not-blue/\">Joni Mitchell’s Best Album Is Turning Fifty.

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 985: The Interdimensional Rift at the Lucky Sunrise Bingo Palace</h2>\n<h3>The Interdimensional Rift at the Lucky Sunrise Bingo Palace</h3>\n<p>So I’m sitting there with Bubbee—the two of us hunched over our empty paper play-cards, our fingers not yet bloody with magenta bingo marker—when the first rift appears.</p>\n<p>It’s smaller than I’d expected. Little more than a paper cut in the space-time continuum. Only five inches long as it floats in midair beside the flimsy folding card table in the back of the ballroom, where the purple carpet flows into the heart of the Bingo Palace. As I watch, it starts to fold, slinky-style, over itself, ‘til the air turns hot and the rift starts to crackle and the paper cut rips into a three-foot-long gash, and before I can speak, before I can nudge Bubbee to warn the referee, there’s an arm poking out from the chasm in the air, then a chest and a face and a whole body slips from whatever dimension it decided to leave to fall into our own.</p>\n<p>Bubbee sees it too. “Damn doppelgangers,” she says. “Can’t win at their own games, so they come to steal ours.”</p>\n<p/><p>I can feel her frustration. It’s the same as she’s shown every Monday night for months, when she comes home complaining of the doppelgangers ruining her seventy-year-old hobby, despite the rules preventing interdimensional play. The same as I’ve heard from the Channel 7 News when they rant about the rifts popping wild through the town, causing mischief and mayhem. Not so fair when the travel only works in one direction: from their world to ours. When they’re the only ones who can open up a portal, slipping back inside before it fizzles into nothing.</p>\n<p><i>Can you believe it?</i> she’d say to me and Mom over dinner, while the brisket and kugel sizzled noisily in the oven. <i>Dorothea won</i> again. <i>For the third time this month. No matter that she’s been dead in our world for six years</i>.</p>\n<p><i>Sorry, Bubbee</i>, we’d say in an attempt to calm her down. But nothing ever helps. Not <i>better luck next time</i> or <i>you can’t win them all</i> or <i>I’m sure the rifts will stop, it’s only a matter of time</i>.</p>\n<p>But the rifts haven’t stopped. They’ve only gotten worse over the last few months—ever since Zaydee died, and I told Bubbee my secret (with a bold, capital S), and the silence in our house became its own little rift, pushing us apart one conversation at a time. Hard not to have some distance when the person you thought you loved can’t love you back, can’t accept who you are.</p>\n<p><i>Are you sure?</i> Bubbee would say to me, her eyes wet with desperation. <i>Could it maybe be a phase?</i> Hoping it was all just a silly mistake, and the boy she saw me kissing by the mailbox wasn’t real, and I could go back to being who she wanted me to be: just Avi again, her sixteen-year-old grandson, who she could brag about at Temple to all the girls my age, who could give her the great-grandchildren she’d dreamt of since I was born. Who didn’t have a secret that fractured our family, that killed my only grandpa. Drowning me in guilt no matter how hard I try to float.</p>\n<p>That always makes me think: if I’d kept my mouth shut, would Zaydee still be alive?</p>\n<p>Not like I’ll ever know. I’ll never know if Zaydee would have shared in their silence, the worry that my <i>choices</i> would bring shame on our family, if he’d take back the hugs and the gentle <i>I love you</i>’s that my younger self craved. That I <i>still</i> crave, on days when I let myself remember. When the guilt runs too thick.</p>\n<p>But today, I have to be strong. Today, I have a mission. It’s the day of the jackpot—the biggest bingo prize in a year’s worth of games. And I hope, if Bubbee wins—if I <i>help</i> Bubbee win—it can erase some of my guilt. Maybe, it can help Bubbee love me again.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/03/20/escape-pod-985-the-interdimensional-rift-at-the-lucky-sunrise-bingo-palace/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The Pig smiled her bio-engineered leopard-smile at him and kept her right hand prominently in contact with the stun-gun at her hip.</p>\n<p>He stared, too choked with shock, desire and tepid river water to speak.</p>\n<h3>Host Commentary</h3>\n<p>One of my favourite things about fiction is what I call the literary trust fall. Stories that throw you into the middle and trust that you’re not going to panic before you get your feet under you. This isn’t the performative cruelty of walking your readers into the dark and then letting go of their hand, but rather trusting them to solve the puzzle of the story as they go. That’s what Doctor Sullivan does here, and does very well. So much so in fact that twenty years distance from this story has only brought it closer to us. There’s an element of the Culture novels here, the sense of two colossal cultural siege engines permanently revving up against one another that I really like.<br/>\nAlso the fact the Conservancy manages to be incredibly horny and incredibly grumpy at the same time which plays like a lovely parody of every Dirk Chestmeat protagonist ever.<br/>\nThe dystopian compassion of the ‘solution’ too feels very 21 st century as two violently opposed ideologies get to meet in the middle and dance for the civilisation they’re trying to absorb. It’s first contact by way of first conquest, the new races losing the second we find them, they just don’t know it. Dystopia isn’t on the menu, it is the menu. To quote Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead:</p>\n<p><i>Is that what people want?</i><br/>\n<i>It’s what we do.</i></p>\n<p>There’s jet black espresso humour too in the completely useless AI doing a good impression of a device with utility. I’m writing this on the day every major newspaper in the UK has the same front page, complaining about the government’s imminent and likely wholesale decision to allow vast copyright theft in the name of an innovation so hollow and worthless, the CEO of Microsoft admitted it does basically nothing. This is the same week an album of silent field recordings of empty studios was released by musicians in protest over the same decisions. This all unfolding as the video game voice actor strike enters its sixth month with a tenth of the coverage of last year’s writer and actor strikes.<br/>\nWe chose the Conservancy. Or more kindly, and terrifyingly, the Conservancy decided we chose it.<br/>\nLooked at that way, this story is pretty grim. Until it isn’t. There are two massive victories here. The first is the subtle redirection of cultural force that ends the story, embodying both the principle of leverage in martial arts and the fact that we are never, ever without hope. There is always something you can do. Personally, in your community, in how you talk to others. In how you interact with the forced first contact talent contest you find yourself subjected to. The Conservancy chose itself. You don’t get to agree. You don’t have to comply in advance.</p>\n<p>The second victory is subtler, more personal. My favourite scene here is the ending where the two emissaries take very real pleasure in the fact they got played. It’s a lovely moment and crucially it puts the lie to the idea of those siege engines being monolithic ideological behemoths. Reminding us of our humanity, even out there in the black.<br/>\nA hell of a story. A hell of a good start. And what a great world to revisit. Thanks to all.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/03/13/escape-pod-984-imperial-flashback-friday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 983: The Robot Whisperer</h2>\n<h3>The Robot Whisperer</h3>\n<p>Emilia heard the door bang as Kore entered her workshop. Dishes clattered on the side bench. “Be there in a minute, I just have to…” She let her voice fade. How could you fix a magnifying light when you needed to magnify it to see what you were doing? And her hands were trembling again. She set down the tiny screwdriver in frustration. She was too old for this. Too old for everything. And her calendar was blinking at her again.</p>\n<p>“Come on, Mom, it’s getting cold.” More clattering. “Your tinkering can wait.”</p>\n<p>“You know, there was a day when I was considered more than a tinkerer.” Emilia picked her way through the crowded stacks of old electronics gear to where Kore had laid out dinner, a lentil stew and a chicory latte, both freshly steaming from the collective’s communal kitchens.</p>\n<p>“You’ve still got it, no worries.” Kore chuckled and gestured at the faded thank-you certificate on the wall. “All of the oldtimers still have a crush on you.” In the corner of the frame, bronzed by the late afternoon light, a small printed photo perched: Emilia on the day she’d arrived six decades ago. Mirrored sunglasses—retro even then—and short black hair with an ironic flip to the bangs. And her tight black clothing, so unsuited to the climate-changed heat of western British Columbia. The collective hadn’t wanted to let her in. She’d represented everything wrong with city life—gangs, drugs, high tech for the sake of high tech, not to mention faith in capitalism and perpetual growth—everything the newly formed collective had sworn to reject.</p>\n<p/><p>“Tell me again about your arrival?” Kore held out the spoon. “And eat while you do.”</p>\n<p>Emilia gave her a flat look. When had child become parent?</p>\n<p>Kore brushed back hair and Emilia noticed the gray. Now in her sixties with fingers almost as arthritic as Emilia’s, Kore taught the younger ones woodworking, all based on the collective’s principle of “least tech necessary for the job”. Kore had her place in the world, but Emilia’s was slipping away.</p>\n<p>The latte foam was shrinking, bubbles disappearing as if they’d never existed.</p>\n<p>Coming here had been necessary but not easy. First, there had been her successful refuctoring of Regina’s municipal budget—increased subsidized housing, reduced management perks, some other tiny adjustments to give more parity among salaries—followed quickly by pretend ransomware that had handicapped immediate budget reviews. Then, the switcheroo of the deputy mayor’s name and SIN number with similar ones belonging to a lifer in Kingston Penitentiary: <i>that</i> had been rad! The identity theft issues had been so intense the deputy mayor had to quit her job to deal with them; Emilia would have felt worse about it had the woman not been syphoning off funds for her Bahamian home. </p>\n<p>It all might have remained undiscovered for a while, at least until next term’s audits, but Emilia had slipped up irretrievably when she hacked into the mayor’s video recordings of his meetings with the biggest of the local gang leaders. Somehow—she’d never known how—she’d left tracks behind as clear and as deep as an elk in winter snow. That had been the turning point: two nasty groups after her was one more than even she could handle.</p>\n<p>It still made her shudder to recall her escape. First, the run through Regina’s subway tunnels, then the long hitchhike to the suburbs, a night in someone’s garage on the backseat of an illegal gas-engined Cadillac, followed by the theft of one of the newer, badass e-bikes and a tablet from a schoolyard. Her destination was “anywhere but Regina” so she headed onto the highway, turning west into the setting sun like the hero in some old-school western vid. Vancouver, eventually, she supposed, but she knew they had troubles—and gangs—of their own.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/03/06/escape-pod-983-the-robot-whisperer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 982: Twilight</h2>\n<h3>Twilight</h3>\n<p>Like the tide going out, the dream slipped between her toes and carried with it the smell of petrichor and the sound of birdsong. Even without knowing she was dreaming, she had known she was waking up; the subliminal chatter of her body, quietly running its routine checksums, the logs spooling their idiot monologue into her working memory. First came a few moments of groggy confusion and then, like an iron hand gripping her cognitive architecture, a kind of clarity that tasted like resentment and reminded her of Monday mornings.</p>\n<p>Waking up always felt like this. Packed down as she was, crammed into a processor too small to carry her like a spring wound tight, waking up wasn’t a continuous transformation so much as a discrete toggle. Like a light switch. Akir opened her eyes, and heard the forever-wind blowing mournfully across the dunes, the soft creaking of the local flora which had evolved, it seemed, to harvest energy from the permanent gale.</p>\n<p>Her cameras clicked and popped, adjusting their focus. Slowly, crouching to keep her centre of gravity low, Akir climbed out of the low burrow and crested the sandy crease of the ridge garden. Ahead spilled an alien vista no human eyes had ever seen before, and—she wondered if it was a little selfish to think—hopefully never would. With its weathered dunes and rocky steppes, the ridge garden overlooked a low, wide plain split into two raggedly uneven halves by a lush river valley. The plains were paved with colonies of dark, ground-cover plants which used a greasy black photopigment in place of chlorophyll.</p>\n<p>A permanent sentinel in the sky, the sun hung low and bloody to the north.</p>\n<p>Myers Survey Three—<i>Twilight</i>, the science team in orbit were calling it—was one of maybe half a dozen planets in all the space humanity had spread to that was home to its own native ecosystem, and Twilight’s was by far the most complex and robust. Orbiting one of a hundred billion no-name red dwarfs in the Milky Way, Twilight was tidally-locked—the sun never rose or set, and day and night were permanent and deadly fixtures of the planet’s environment. To the north, a seething desert; to the south, an ice cap eight miles thick.</p>\n<p>Only between the two, in a narrow, windy band around the planet’s equator, was the environment temperate enough for complex life to survive.</p>\n<p>It was an achingly beautiful place to be, and still, Akir had been dreaming of Earth. Of sunsets and soil and the singing of birds. She began to walk, trundling along the ridge garden and doing her best not to trample any of the local life. As she did, she paged through her logs, checking for any reported errors. The hydraulic lines in her right arm were thinning and might be an issue in another thousand hours or so. Her left knee, which had been binding as a thin, wiry local plant tried to colonise it, wasn’t showing any signs of locking up again since she’d last cleaned it.</p>\n<p>Her power supply—printed from a common pattern, Azure Cooperative’s <i>OpenRTG</i> version 0.8—was still green and would be for another ninety-five years, the slug of Plutonium-238 churning out a couple hundred watts as it decayed, but one of her redundant capacitors was throwing errors.</p>\n<p>She hesitated, then put in a call. The surveyship—<i>Society of Consent</i>, an interstellar linelayer with a crew of sixty—wasn’t anywhere in the sky, and the satellites were down again. Something about the ways that Twilight’s magnetosphere interacted with the local solar wind made communications unpredictable; one of half a hundred mysteries they didn’t have the time or the manpower to solve. Without lungs, Akir’s sigh was a heaving of her shoulders as she trudged—<i>thump</i>, <i>thump</i>, adjust, <i>thump</i>—across the landscape, stepping between the slablike pavements of <i>platyphytes</i> that scabbed the ground, their skins as dark and deep as night and subtly ridged, reminding her of the underside of mushroom caps.</p>\n<p><i>Society of Consent</i> was still beyond the horizon. That was fine.</p>\n<p>She could wait.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/02/27/escape-pod-982-twilight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 981: Joy</h2>\n<h3>Joy</h3>\n<p>Joy knelt on the promenade, shifting the rifle into her shoulder to get a steadier shot. She did her best to ignore the waves crashing against the seawall behind her. She had at least another thirty minutes before it was breached, and the saltwater flooded the seafront again. There was less and less time between high and low tide, the sea creeping closer with every passing month: some of the sand underneath her knee was still damp. It would leech the warmth from the joint, aggravate her arthritis and slow her down when there was something she needed to escape from. It might be an acceptable way for her to die, except that now she had foreseen it so it wouldn’t count. Not when she could easily do something about it. She shifted her knee onto drier ground and didn’t take her eye from the rifle sights.</p>\n<p>The drone appeared as a little black dot: not one of the bigger ones, but maybe enough to keep her going for another couple of weeks. Last year they’d still been sending them in flocks of thirty or forty, but they seemed to have realised any idiot could wing at least one in a flock that size. Now they usually flew alone. Harder to hit, but in a way it was better: they’d sold their customers twenty-four hour delivery, and the fastest way to Ireland from the warehouses in Denmark was over what they still sneeringly called the former United Kingdom. Until they found a way to increase their range, speed or defences, they’d keep coming, regular as clockwork.</p>\n<p>She took aim carefully.</p>\n<p/><p>‘Don’t,’ the drone whimpered. ‘Please.’</p>\n<p>Christ: how long had they been able to talk? How long had it been since she’d winged one like this? She’d bungled the shot, the drone had dodged – another new thing – and the dart that had been flying unflinchingly for its CPU instead shattered a rotor. She’d tracked the drone across half of the countryside as it limped down from the sky, zig-zagging in a way that told her she’d fried the gyroscope as well. As it had landed drunkenly in an overgrown field, Joy had pulled a heavy stone out of a crumbling wall to finish it off with.</p>\n<p>‘Please,’ it pleaded again, its spider-legged grapple twitching pathetically.</p>\n<p>The package was still clutched to its belly, wrapped in a thick black skin that rippled with colour like oil on water. That skin was a modern miracle. Impervious to attack or the elements, capable of absorbing the impact of a fall from the edge of space, and yet with the correct release code it would blow away like dust on the wind. And it also had the carbon footprint of a package holiday in the Costa Brava, unless significant improvements had been made since the last time Joy had access to the internet. It was a scam, a con. Like this drone’s voice: it was probably just a recording triggered by her proximity. Another way of protecting the package from people like her. It wasn’t going to work.</p>\n<p>She lifted the stone above her head again.</p>\n<p>‘Help me,’ it said.</p>\n<p>There were tears in her eyes, but she couldn’t wipe them away because of the stone in her hands.</p>\n<p>‘What’s in the package?’ She sniffed the tears back. ‘Antibiotics? Food?’</p>\n<p>The drone hesitated. That was when she was sure it wasn’t a trick.</p>\n<p>She was a silly old fool. But she also needed food. Whatever was in that delivery, it was no use to the drone. It was everything to her. She knelt down and started prising the legs apart. Normally she would snap them clean off, but she couldn’t bring herself to now. The legs resisted her efforts as the drone clung tight.</p>\n<p>‘I don’t want to keep it from you,’ the drone apologised. It still sounded terrified of her. ‘The authorisation code is released when we reach our destination. Is this where you live?’</p>\n<p>‘For as long as I can get antibiotics and food,’ she replied gruffly.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/02/20/escape-pod-981-joy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Certainly, none of them had ever looked around with curious little twitches of their front-facing cameras before. This one whirred and clicked like an anxious bird, trying to find focus through a chipped and cloudy lens.</p>\n<p>“Is the war over?” it asked.</p>\n<p>Frank set aside his screwdriver. “It’s been over for a long time.”</p>\n<p>“Oh,” the drone said. “What happens now?”</p>\n<p>“Well, I was about to strip you for materials.”</p>\n<p>Its eye turned again to their surroundings. Countless dissections of machinery stood in testament to Frank’s care and skill for the work, mounted carefully onto shelves, awaiting the next stage of their demolition. The tools of unmaking were laid out neatly beside the drone. Wire strippers and bowls of solvents waited to do their part in making the world a better, simpler place.</p>\n<p>Sprocket the shop cat, watching from his basket above the scrap wood, chirruped back at the unsteady whir of the war machine’s dilating and contracting shutters.</p>\n<p>“What am I going to become?” the drone asked.</p>\n<p>Frank scratched his head. There was endless potential in the battle-broken mess on his table, but as a general rule, he only took things apart once he understood them. Scrapping could get pretty dangerous otherwise. “I’ve never met a drone that could talk. It doesn’t seem right to take you apart at all.”</p>\n<p>“But the war is over. I have no purpose.”</p>\n<p>The drone’s armor was cracked. The empty launchers welded to its forearms were filled with moss, and the motors that whirred within its breastplate were choked and tangled. It reminded him of how he’d been, when the war had ended. When he’d found himself without orders for the first time, drifting through operating rooms, unsure of what he would do with hands if the surgeons ever even managed to replace the ones he’d lost.</p>\n<p>He crossed his carbon-fiber arms and considered the dilemma on the table in front of him. He’d ended up scrapping because taking the tanks and mech-suits and guns apart gave him a great deal of satisfaction. Disarming battle-drones was his specialty.</p>\n<p>The great armored bulls of war came through the bay doors of his garage, guns welded to their backs, faceless heads pitted with bullet holes and melted by laser fire.

Nestled in Northeast Washington, D.C., Gallaudet is the most famous and prestigious deaf university in the world. It’s been granting degrees since 1864. The Gallaudet student newspaper, the <i>Buff and Blue</i>, honored Hubbard in 1941 as the “daddy of huddle,” as did daily newspapers in Kansas, where he coached at the Kansas School for the Deaf, and Washington when Hubbard died in 1946. </p>\n    <p>As with any world-shifting innovation, competing claims emerged over the decades: Herb McCracken, the University of Pittsburgh player and college coach, claimed that he’d invented the huddle in 1924, and some quarters credit University of Illinois football coach Robert Zuppke—also known for inventing the onside kick, the flea flicker and the screen pass.</p>\n    <p>Still, the Gallaudet origin story predates these accounts by decades and has a persuasive foundation: Deaf players needed to hide their visual communication from opponents even more than hearing teams.</p>\n    <p>From Gallaudet’s Washington campus, the huddle spread fast across American football. By the 1920s, the formation had become common enough at college games that it even drew complaints from some fans who lamented that it slowed play. But there was no denying the huddle, which inevitably took over basketball, baseball and other sports, offering a universal protection for the devious language of athletic strategy.</p>\n    <h4>Fun Fact: Who else attended Gallaudet?</h4>\n    <p>Other notable Gallaudet University students and alumni include Academy Award-winning actor Troy Kotsur, Glenn Anderson (the first deaf African American to earn a doctorate degree) and Wilma Newhoudt-Druchen (the first deaf member of parliament in South Africa.)</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/deaf-quarterback-changed-sports-forever-inventing-huddle-180987178/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>The jukebox got its start earlier than you might think, but it truly became iconic when rock ‘n’ roll took over in the 1950s</h2>\n<p>Lisa Guerriero</p>\n<p>In 1889, a San Francisco tavern called the Palais Royale debuted a hot new attraction: a modified Edison phonograph that, when a customer inserted a nickel, played music from a single wax cylinder. Electrical sound amplification was still years away, so customers had to insert stethoscope-like tubes into their ears to hear anything, ideally toweling down the tubes afterward to remove earwax ahead of the next listener.</p>\n<p>Despite this unwieldy setup, the machine reportedly brought in more than $1,000 (some $34,000 today) in less than six months, and coin-operated music machines soon proliferated in bars, at drugstores and even in new listening parlors across the country. Alas, poor sound quality meant selections couldn’t be soft or subtle, so popular offerings included such earsplitting numbers as John Philip Sousa marches and the novelty whistler John Yorke AtLee performing popular ditties of the day. By the early 1900s, the machines struggled to compete against player pianos and other automated instruments that could entertain whole venues with higher-quality audio—and without requiring patrons to stick foreign objects into their delicate ear canals.</p>\n<p>But record players continued to improve in quality and volume, and pay-to-play phonographs made a huge comeback in the 1920s, paving the way for the jukebox era. In 1927, the Automatic<br/>\nMusical Instrument Company unveiled the first amplified, multi-record coin phonograph. Jukeboxes—they took on this nickname in the 1930s in reference to African American “juke joints” of the South—introduced the world to music on demand, for far less than buying a record (and on better equipment than people had at home). The boxes also reshaped the recording industry, as labels began releasing music specifically designed for post-Prohibition barrooms and cafés. Danceable big-band numbers and tunes like the “Beer Barrel Polka” were early hits, and the irrepressible popularity of jukeboxes soon rocketed artists like swing impresario Glenn Miller to national fame, creating an audience for loud, catchy, rollicking tunes, often played on newly electrified instruments, shaping what would become country, R &amp; B and rock ’n’ roll. </p>\n<p>Jukebox operators came to account for a majority of record sales, as they frequently changed out selections to keep customers dropping nickels. Using meters within the machines, operators could track which tunes were most popular at which locations, and they programmed boxes accordingly, offering a mix of national hits and more regionally specific selections. The latter included many tunes by Black and working-class musicians, in folk genres such as country and blues that tended to get scant airplay on the radio of the day but soon found appreciative listeners on jukeboxes.</p>\n<p>By the early 1940s, about 500,000 jukeboxes dotted the country, sometimes inspiring <i>too</i> much of a ruckus: Newspapers frequently reported on bar fights over music selections and complaints about noise. Snootier critics, meanwhile, voiced more petulant grievances: “The contrivance is everywhere and is always booming its inanities,” one <i>Los Angeles Times</i> writer lamented in 1941.</p>\n<p>But jukeboxes had a chance to prove their patriotic bona fides during World War II, when they provided vital entertainment on military bases and at troops’ canteens, sometimes on machines donated by public-spirited American operators—not a single nickel required. “Not even the cacophony of war can dull the magic power of Wurlitzer Automatic Phonograph music,” boasted a 1944 ad. At the same time, a number of jukebox manufacturers, including Wurlitzer, retooled factories for weapons production.</p>\n<p>After the war, stylish and streamlined jukebox cabinets in diners let teenagers listen to rock ’n’ roll at volumes generally impossible (or at least inadvisable) to achieve at home. Jukeboxes became indelibly associated with 1950s youth culture, the songs selected as easily as ordering a diner burger or milkshake. Jukebox operators now furnished teenage canteens, modeled after the military rest spots where the boxes had helped entertain the youth of the previous decade. The format of hit-after-hit music queues also helped inspire teen-friendly Top 40 radio, replacing older formats that defaulted to playing several songs in a row by a single artist.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/colorful-scandalous-true-history-machine-created-american-pop-180987173/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Art historian Alka Pande is multi-tasking. When talking about book cover design in the run-up to the Oxford Bookstore Book Cover Prize announcement anytime this month, she cuts out to handle something else for a minute. When she returns, she takes a minute to pick up the conversation again. “Attention span,” she says with a grin. “It’s also one of the reasons why the attractiveness and seductiveness of a book jacket becomes so important.”</p>\n    <p>Pande, who has been chairing the prize’s jury since its inception, is only half-joking. In a crowded bookstore, an eye-catching book jacket that attracts potential readers could be the first point of the book’s marketing success. With online marketplaces, cover design that is striking even in the size of a thumbnail becomes important.</p>\n    <p>Book covers have been around as long as books have, of course, but in recent years, a few things have put them in the spotlight: authors have been naming and thanking cover designers either in the acknowledgement sections of their books or during promotions, designers have been showcasing their professional portfolios and working on self-branding, and award categories for book cover design have emerged.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Also Read: </i>\n      <i>The comfort of books in our loneliest hours</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>The jury of the Oxford Bookstore’s Book Cover Prize 2023 arrived at their current shortlist of six after sifting through 300 entries. The Publishing Next Industry Awards 2023, which announced its winners in the last week of March, has three categories for book cover design: English (introduced with the first edition of their awards in 2016), Indian Languages (since 2019) and Children’s Books (intermittently since 2019). This acknowledgement of genre-specific design sensibilities in a category rarely fêted in India is pleasantly surprising.</p>\n    <p>Such diversity “is the sign of maturity and evolution in the market,” says Lisa Rath, partner at Delhi-based design and branding studio Itu Chaudhuri Design, which has worked on jackets of books such as Arundhati Roy’s <i>The God of Small Things </i>(IndiaInk and Penguin Books, 1997), <i>The Doctor and The Saint</i> (Penguin, 2019) and Mujib Rizavi’s <i>Sab Likhni Kai Likhu Sansaara</i> (Rajkamal Prakashan, 2018). She notes that the likes of a neon cover or a chalk-like typeface, common today, were rare a decade ago<i>. </i></p>\n    <p>The book cover is more than a rectangle. “I like to see an artist use the entire space, and the imagery flow from the front to the spine to maybe a flap,” says Danica Desilva, artist and jury member at the Publishing Next Awards for the last two years. While doing this, a designer ought to also think about bringing the book’s essence into an image, she says.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Also Read: </i>\n      <i>Recreating covers of books banned through history</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Rath calls this “depicting the temperament of the book”, making the job a balancing act between faithful interpretation and an original comment.</p>\n    <p>The book cover has become a space for the visual and literary arts to meet. “Book cover design<i> </i>is an inherently collaborative process,” says Antra K., who won in the Best Cover Design category at the 2022 Atta Galatta-Bangalore Literature Festival Book Prize for Saeed Naqvi’s <i>The Muslim Vanishes</i> (Penguin, 2022). </p>\n    <p>Over the years, she has learned how to blend her ideas seamlessly with the author and editor’s inputs, while also accommodating the pulls and pushes of a book’s marketing team. “Art can seem like an insular process,” she says. “But with a book cover, I know I’m making it for the author, the reader and for myself—and that’s quite exciting.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/book-cover-design-oxford-bookstore-book-cover-prize-publishing-next-industry-awards-111713670258266.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>On a windy April day, we were at Baragaon in the languorous city of Guwahati, Assam. In the sky, a large bird flapped its wings slowly. It was the bird we were looking for; we moved in its direction. We went down a kaccha path and then turned right. The road ended in a towering garbage mountain.</p>\n<p>It was an overwhelming sight. The garbage mountain was massive, with the solidity of a building or a monument. And it was alive. On thousands of kilos of plastic, food and solid trash, things were slowly moving. A cow chewed her cud, picked from the garbage. I wondered what she was eating, because the dominant feeling was poisonous. The stench was overwhelming, moving in pulses and waves like it wouldn’t mind socking us in the face. Plastic bags were everywhere, waiting to come alive on headwinds. Dust was omnipresent—some of it could have been the Brahmaputra’s silt, the rest was detritus. There was a haze in the air, but the birds and animals broke through the miasma and carried on their business. Kites did sorties in the air. Crows hopped about, suddenly taking off like smoke. And Greater adjutant storks moved ponderously through, their baby-pink neck pouches swinging like pendulums. Their gait had a certain gravitas, a sense of an inevitable closing of the loop. Greater adjutant storks were once the symbol of the municipality of Kolkata because they scavenged in garbage dumps. Decades ago, they soared in the skies with <i>Gyps </i>vultures, both looking for carcasses. Now, vultures are critically endangered, and Greater adjutant populations are much smaller in India—restricted to rural Bihar near Bhagalpur and rural parts of Assam and Guwahati.</p>\n<p>The faces of the storks have a marbled, mottled pattern, like they are in various stages of decomposition. A proud kind of decomposition, a frankness that feels like a homage to their surroundings—to the bacteria and microbes that surround the discarded and rotting. This is amongst the world’s largest storks, and its beak is pale, the eyes bone-white. And behind the heads of the storks, there is a glistening pink portion. It looks like a brain. Two spots of colour stood out on the garbage mountain in that blistering, dusty place—the brain-like back of the stork’s head, and the floral yellow<i> kurta </i>of a young ragpicker going up the mountain. She walked with consummate ease, as if she was going up a rolling, grassy hill. A child shrieked, pausing mid-play with a friend, before tumbling on the brackets of the mountain. Sobered, she resumed her work of parsing through the trash. The stork nearby opened its great black wings—like a thundercloud on the horizon, seeming to shake off the shrieks of children playing. Just as easily, the bird tucked its wings back, all threats of an angry rumble abated. In a single foot of space, there was a cow, a person and a threatened stork. They seemed to have an old acceptance of each other.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/greater-adjutant-scavengers-india-wildlife-environment-111713517039022.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Every five years when India votes, everyone gears up for the “world’s largest election”. “India watchers” are eager to tell you “everything you need to know”, X analysts put out quick-fix opinions, and people publish outdated lists of “books to understand India today”. Democracy, at its core, is about equality—and that’s not only about politics, it is also about the way we live. Or rather, choosing how we want to live is actually a deeply political decision, and even those who say they are “apolitical” are still making a political choice of not caring. So, this week, we look at the fundamentals of living in a democratic society through a curated set of books we think you’d like to read. That doesn’t mean that we’ve picked 1,000-page doorstoppers. Instead, we decided to go with comedy, fiction, parody, poetry and stories that have shaped people’s ideas of democracy.</p>\n    <p>Twelve writers tell us about their favourite stories that changed their view of the world, and moulded their personal beliefs about equality, identity and nationalism while being an engaged member of a larger community or the country. On our request, they have picked writing in languages other than English to reflect the variety of mores that characterise India.</p>\n    <p>Film critic Raja Sen selects shows—past and present, witty and dramatic, and all available in India—that will get you thinking about the challenges facing a democracy. From the evergreen classic political comedy <i>Yes, Minister </i>to the hard-hitting <i>Maharani </i>with Huma Qureshi, these shows hold lessons about the state of the country. While each of these books and shows make for good weekend reading and watching, we also hope they will help you look within and reflect on first principles before you go out to vote.</p>\n    <p>Elsewhere in the issue, we address the other big preoccupation of the month—summer. One columnist makes a case for being a little kinder to make the rising temperatures somewhat bearable, another story delves into the trend of dessert cocktails, while our compilation of products to keep you cool is inspired by the shades and shapes of mangoes.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Write to the editor at shalini.umachandran@htlive.com</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>@shalinimb</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/opinion/stories-vote-elections-books-politics-tv-series-111713580789309.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Every five years, as Indian democracy gears up for its biggest carnival—the general election—publishers fall in step with the spirit of the season. Suddenly bookshops are flush with political titles. From itinerant reporters with their ears to the ground to armchair analysts making heavy-duty predictions to politicians of all colours lobbying for their cause, everyone wants a piece of the democratic pie that is the Indian book trade.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, there is value in reading contemporary critiques of the state of the nation. But even as we delve into immersive reportage, the data stories, the autobiographies and hagiographies, it’s crucial to remember our primal understanding of the promises of democracy. That’s why, instead of putting out a list of new political books that have graced bookshops this election season, we decided to go back to the first principles. We invited 12 distinguished writers to tell us about some of their formative memories and literary experiences of democracy.</p>\n<p>What follows is an eclectic garland of ideas, thoughts and inspirations, strung together with remembrances of poems, stories, novels, non-fiction and defining moments from the past.</p>\n<p>Each of these pieces draws our attention to a point of view that is unique, a history of emotions that straddles reading, watching, conversations, and other traces of memory. We hope you will be inspired to look up some of the works mentioned and allow them to expand and complicate your consciousness.</p>\n<p/>\n    <p>\n      <i>Harishankar Parsai’s satire resonates with the drama of elections to this day</i>\n      <i>—Amitava Kumar</i>\n    </p>\n<p>I was recently writing about the drama of elections in a constituency near Gaya for my forthcoming novel, My Beloved Life. I thought of what might be the best description of this process—in Vikram Seth’s A Suitable Boy. A mofussil air, the petty intrigues, the shifts in fortune. By the time I was ending my book, however, I inserted a scene that is a classic in Hindi literature, Harishankar Parsai’s <i>Inspector Matadeen Chand Par</i> (1994), or Inspector Matadeen on the Moon.</p>\n<p>The father and daughter duo who narrate my novel are on their way to a restaurant in Atlanta. The father is talking bitterly about politicians in Hindi, his voice growing louder as he quotes Parsai, delivering his lines as if at a kavi-sammelan. Even as I imagined the scene, I felt I was paying homage to a writer whose deft satires gave his readers a small measure of agency. A political system that left them helpless could not take away from them the freedom of laughter. Here is what the father recites: “How politicians hear the call of the people just before the elections, this is a trade secret and cannot be shared. The call of the people is sometimes like the bleating of a lamb. The lamb is calling for its mother but it is the wolf who arrives instead. Even if the lamb stays silent, the wolf comes and asks, Did you call me? The lamb says No, I didn’t even open my mouth. The wolf says, in that case I must have heard your heart’s call.”</p>\n<p><i>Amitava Kumar, author of several works of non-fiction and four novels, grew up in Patna and teaches at Vassar College in New York.</i>\n\t                                    </p>\n<p/>\n    <p>\n      <i>True democracy requires a deep consciousness of humanity</i>\n      <i>—Gogu Shyamala</i>\n    </p>\n<p>As children, we grew up with stories about independence, freedom and nationalism. Barring a few small treats such as the children’s magazines Chandamama or Bommarillu, we had little access to anything more than school textbooks. So it was only as I grew up and started attaining some paripakvata (maturity) that I began to comprehend ideas like democracy. When I saw children drop out of school, or when I began to comprehend how caste and untouchability is practised in everyday life, I grew restless with asantrupti (discontent). I started looking at the ideas of freedom and the independence movement through the lens of caste.

    "body": "<p>Sudipta Das has witnessed drastic ecological changes over the years in her hometown of Silchar in Assam. “These days, we are getting excessive rainfall during what are supposed to be dry months. Nature is disturbed. Floods arrive earlier than usual, and with greater ferocity,” says the 39-year-old artist, who is currently based out of Vadodara, Gujarat.</p>\n<p>Das has witnessed a disproportionate impact of these natural calamities on women in Silchar. It is the women of the household who flush out the water from homes, arrange for food, and take care of the farmlands. “They end up falling ill the most during this time,” says Das, who is known for her figurines, crafted from rice paper and Hanji paper, depicting the migration of communities due to political and geological changes. Deeply touched by the suffering of women during natural upheavals, the artist—who calls herself an ecofeminist—has been creating works for the series, <i>Mother and Child</i>.</p>\n<p>Ecofeminism—the intersection of feminism, politics and ecology—isn’t a new term. It was first coined by French writer Francoise d’Eaubonne in her 1974 book, <i>Le Féminisme ou la Mort</i>. She wrote: “Ecofeminism relates the oppression and domination of all marginalised groups (women, people of color, children, the poor) to the oppression and domination of nature (animals, land, water, air, etc.).”</p>\n<p>As the world goes through drastic ecological changes, the concept of ecofeminism has acquired greater urgency. “The climate crisis is not ‘gender neutral’,” states a report, dated 28 February 2022, on the UN Women website. “Women and girls experience the greatest impacts of climate change, which amplifies existing gender inequalities and poses unique threats to their livelihoods, health, and safety. Across the world, women depend more on, yet have less access to, natural resources.”</p>\n<p>Art too has been responding to the concept of ecofeminism since the 1970s. A landmark 2020 exhibition, <i>ecofeminism (s)</i> —curated by Monika Fabijanska, an art historian who specialises in women’s and feminist art at the Thomas Erben Gallery in New York—offered a historical perspective of this genre of art, and its relevance today. The curatorial note stated that “ecofeminism is one of the richest hidden caches of contemporary art. It is art that delights the eye, provokes the mind, and can inspire change. It also restores art’s function to what it was before the Enlightenment, when both science and art were tools to understand the world and propose solutions.”</p>\n<p>The exhibition looked at the works of pioneering artists such as Betsy Damon, Ana Mendieta, Aviva Rahmani and Cecilia Vicuña, “and how their ideas and strategies are continued, developed or opposed by the young generation”. In India too, over the past few decades, contemporary artists such as Vibha Galhotra, Sonia Mehra Chawla, Navjot Altaf and Rohini Devasher have consistently been responding to political and environmental ecologies, but without really defining themselves as ecofeminists.</p>\n<p>However, there has been a change in the way artists are now excavating complex relationships between gender, ecology, capitalism, oppression, and more. The scope has expanded to include queer histories, anti-nuclear war sentiments, and privatisation of land resources. The mediums too have moved beyond painting and sculpture to include performance art and multimedia, with the body playing an integral role in the work. Bhavna Kakar, founder, Gallery Latitude 28, Delhi—who represents ecofeminist artists such as Das and Manjot Kaur— feels that this genre of art plays, now more than ever, a pivotal role in amplifying suppressed voices, evoking empathy, and inspiring action towards collective responsibility to nurture and protect our ecosystem for future generations.</p>\n<p>\n\t                                        \n\t                                    \t2023 witnessed some of the highest temperatures on earth, and many countries around the world grappled with extreme weather conditions. It is no wonder then that the past two years have seen a rise in the number of exhibitions focusing on ecofeminist art as well in response to these changes. For instance, the Tai Kwun Contemporary in Hong Kong presented <i>Green Snake: Women-Centred Ecologies</i>, between 20 December 2023 and 1 April 2024.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/ecofeminist-art-intersection-feminism-ecology-climate-change-politics-111713457421850.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The doorbell rang in the middle of a hot April afternoon in Kolkata.</p>\n<p>It was yet another courier, the third of the afternoon.</p>\n<p>The temperature was already inching towards 40 degrees Celsius and the humidity was high. The family had drawn the curtains, turned on the air-conditioning and settled in for a post-lunch siesta. But it seemed that every courier in the city had timed their deliveries to coincide with our siesta.</p>\n<p>“As soon as it’s afternoon, the bell rings non-stop,” grumbled my mother. “No one can rest or work in peace,” I agreed.</p>\n<p>Bills, packages, books, groceries, medicines, gas cylinders—they kept coming, delivered by men on bicycles and motorbikes. Every time I opened the door, the heat hit me like a sledgehammer. The streets were deserted. Even the street dogs were nowhere to be seen. Not a leaf stirred in the <i>bael </i>(Bengal quince) tree outside the house. I stood impatiently at the gate in the blazing sun, waiting irritably as the delivery person rummaged in his rucksack looking for our parcel. I wondered what it would have hurt to have had the package ready before he rang the doorbell.</p>\n<p>Then I looked at the man. He had a handkerchief tied around his head. But he was still drenched. This was a few minutes of discomfort for me but it was a whole day’s work for him, all afternoon, probably every day.</p>\n<p>“I hope you are drinking plenty of water,” I said lamely. He gestured towards the plastic bottle he was carrying. “What to do?” He said. “Just because it’s summer, the deliveries don’t stop.”</p>\n<p>In fact, chances are because it’s summer, more of us are using services that require others to run around so as to allow us the luxury of being indoors. The grocery delivery apps, the food delivery apps, the errand running apps are all working overtime so we can keep our cool.</p>\n<p>This summer we will need more of their services than ever. India has just invoked a 21-year-old emergency provision to operationalise its gas-fired power stations from 1 May to 30 June as the electricity demand is likely to spike because of a projected prolonged heat wave. According to Business Today, last year peak power demand hit 243 GW in September, an all time high. This year, the power ministry is projecting it might hit 260 GW. Much of gas-powered generating stations are under-utilised because of commercial considerations.</p>\n<p>From a consumer’s point of view of course, these emergency measures are far preferable to power cuts or load shedding. Once newspapers would publish a zone by zone chart of projected power cuts. The reality often outstripped those projections. Sometimes the power would go for minutes, sometimes for hours. If it went in the middle of a favourite television serial or a crucial football match, the curses would ricochet around the neighbourhood.</p>\n<p>Load-shedding nights meant dragging a mattress on to the terrace, looking for the hint of a breeze. I remember lying on the terrace looking at the silhouettes of the buildings around us and the patch of night sky above. My sister and I invented stories about a ghost family who lived in the neem tree behind the house. We could see the neighbours in their windows, some of the rooms lit up by the smoky light of oil lamps. When the lights suddenly came back on, a cheer would echo through the neighbourhood as televisions would flicker back to life. “Let’s hurry and have dinner before it goes again,” my mother would say.</p>\n<p>As power cuts became routine, people started investing in battery inverters and generators, and every time the power went out, the generators cranked up. That loud rattling noise too became as much part of the city soundscape as its trundling trams and wheezing Ambassador taxis. We looked forward to summer holidays with eager anticipation but then were bored within a week as we lay in pools of sweat scanning the skies for a thundercloud that might usher in the relief of a nor’wester storm in the late afternoon.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/opinion/summer-heat-delivery-guys-climate-change-111713420319282.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Sometime later, some of these thoughts made their way into Kakar’s 2008 book <i>Mad and Divine: Spirit and Psyche in the Modern World</i>. The book, which specifically had a chapter devoted to Kunley, challenged the prevailing notion in psychoanalysis that the body and spirit ought to be studied separately. </p>\n<p>“It is such a deep and important book,” recalls Gokhale, who authored<i> Mystics and Sceptics: In Search of the Himalayan Masters</i> in 2023. “It was a very layered understanding of human consciousness. And he could communicate these layers with simplicity,” she notes. This was the case at the many editions of Jaipur Literature Festivals that he attended (last in 2016), of which Gokhale is co-founder and co-director. “Apart from being a great writer, he was a great communicator. There was an ease in his speaking…psychotherapists usually only analyse individuals with the grammar of the Western world. But Sudhir would always root it in and look at the Indian context. That was his genius,” she says. </p>\n<p>Gokhale’s remarks are reminiscent of what a review of Kakar’s <i>Mad and Divine</i>, published in the 2011 edition of <i>The Journal of Asian Studies </i>had also noted. The author Daniel J. Meckel, an associate professor of philosophy and religious studies at the St. Mary’s College of Maryland writes that with the book, “Kakar once again brings an extraordinary depth of psychoanalytic and Indian sensibilities to bear on topics of sainthood, religious ritual, and healing in India, as well as the profession of psychoanalysis itself.” </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Also Read: </i>\n      <i>Story of Sigmund Freud’s home</i>\n    </p>\n<p>This sense—that Kakar was one of the few intellectuals who managed to forge a new, original, and Indian path in the field of psychoanalysis—strongly colours the memories of most who remember him today. Internationally, a well-awarded academic and author of 20 books, including six works of fiction, Kakar died on 22 April. He was 86.</p>\n<p>Among his works of fiction are <i>The Ascetic of Desire</i>, a fictionalisation of the life of Vatsayana, the sage who wrote the Kama Sutra, <i>The Kipling File</i>, a similar treatment of the British Indian writer Rudyard Kipling’s life, and <i>Mira And The Mahatma</i>, another novelisation of the relationship between Mohandas Gandhi and his follower Madeleine Slade or Mira Behn. His non-fiction includes <i>Inner World</i>, a study of Swami Vivekananda; <i>Analyst and Mystic</i>, a similar study of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa; <i>Shamans, Mystics, And Doctors</i>, a psychological study of the ancient healing traditions of India; and <i>The Colours of Violence</i>, a psychoanalytical examination of the causes of communal violence in the country. </p>\n<p>Kakar, an engineer by training, also earned a doctorate in Economics from the University of Vienna, and later trained at the Sigmund Freud Institute in the University of Frankfurt.</p>\n<p>“He was a rare intellectual,” says Ramin Jahanbegloo, Iranian-born philosopher and friend of Kakar’s for over 20 years. “But beyond his work on Indian psychoanalysis and spirituality, I want to add that he had the character of a typical intellectual—he was an Indian but also a man of universal thought, always open to ideas, travelling to different countries, and meeting with psychoanalysts there—including in Iran. Not many people do that. To me that was very important,” Jahanbegloo adds. A series of his conversations and interviews with Kakar, on topics ranging from the Partition, secularism, tradition and culture, and several iconic leaders like Gandhi or Nehru, were published in the 2009 book <i>India Analysed</i>. </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Also Read: </i>\n      <i>Review of Sudhir Kakar’s ‘The Devil Take Love’</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/sudhir-kakar-works-death-namita-gokhale-ramin-jahanbegloo-111714031212094.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>When Dommaraju Gukesh lost to Alireza Firouzja in the seventh round of the FIDE Candidates 2024 chess less than two weeks ago, he started to believe that he could win the tournament.</p>\n<p>The irony is not lost on Gukesh, of how a defeat could inflate confidence instead of having the opposite effect. The day after that loss was a rest day and Gukesh woke up with “energy and positivity, fully fired up”.</p>\n<p>“If I had to pinpoint where I felt this could be my moment, it was probably after the seventh game, after I lost to Firouzja,” the champion said at a press conference in Toronto on Sunday. “I was upset after that but during the rest day I felt so good. Maybe this loss gave me so much motivation…”</p>\n<p>The 17-year-old Gukesh topped the table with nine points, becoming the youngest ever to win the Candidates tournament and only the second Indian after Viswanathan Anand to do so. The win allows him to challenge Ding Liren of China for the world title later this year. Should the Indian triumph there as well, he would be the sport’s youngest ever world champion.</p>\n<p>Gukesh’s title came after 14 gruelling rounds of chess over 18 days between eight top contenders in the open category, which included two other Indians, R. Praggnanandhaa and Vidit Gujrathi, making this the best Candidates tournament from an Indian perspective.</p>\n<p>“It was unbelievable—what he did and how he did it. I don’t think anyone thought (he would win), especially since Gukesh is the youngest and the others have so much experience… But it was consistency. He was never worse off in any of the games. He was the best player in Toronto,” says Woman Grandmaster (WGM) and commentator Tania Sachdev.</p>\n<p>“I thought that throughout the tournament he looked comfortable,” says grandmaster Dibyendu Barua, who runs the Dhanuka Dhunseri Dibyendu Barua Chess Academy in Kolkata. “He lost one game, which was an upset because he was not in a losing position. He made a mistake and he came back, which is fantastic and shows his temperament. For me, he was always the favourite among the Indians.”</p>\n<p>The tournament result was poised on a razor’s edge going into the last round on Sunday with four players shooting for the top spot. Gukesh, ranked 16th in the world, needed to not lose to world Mo. 3 Hikaru Nakamura, which he did. But the Indian was distracted by another match, which was to impact his fate.</p>\n<p>World No. 2 Fabiano Caruana and No. 7 Ian Nepomniachtchi needed wins, as the winner would take on Gukesh in a tie-breaker on Monday. But they drew, leaving Gukesh alone at the top on the table.</p>\n<p>The whole situation left Gukesh so frazzled that he went back to his hotel with coach and second, Polish grandmaster Grzegorz Gajewski, while the other match was still on. “Those 15 minutes were probably the most stressful of the entire tournament,” Gukesh told reporters, laughing.</p>\n<p>He tried to follow the Caruana-Nepomniachtchi game on commentary but could not. He then went for a walk with Gajewski, before his father Rajnikanth, a doctor, came running over to them to announce that it was over. “The walk was (emotionally) the turning point,” Gukesh said later.</p>\n<p>“In this tournament, what set him apart was his nerves. He had so much composure, maturity in his play, in practical decisions,” says Sachdev over a call. “The way he handled everything around—the fans, the tension… he was an ice man in that tournament. He feared no one. He was so cool headed when everything around him was burning.”</p>\n<p>“Finally, there is one player from India who could be compared to our own Anand,” says Arvind Aaron, who runs the Aaron Chess Academy in Chennai, over email. “Winning the Candidates with 9/14 is a tall score. Experts did not give any title chances to any of the three Indians at Toronto. This stellar show reconfirms that his (Gukesh’s) 2022 Chennai Olympiad performance was no fluke and that he is progressing to the next level.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/chess-candidates-tournament-gukesh-111713896642654.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Of all the incredible moments that India scripted at the 2022 Thomas Cup, the one that became definitive of the odds-defying, history-making team, was of the players bouncing up and down, arm in arm on the podium. Joyous, victorious.</p>\n<p>Team celebrations can generate that kind of hopped-up energy on the podium that individual triumphs lack. Away from the fiercely individual pursuits on the tour, the Thomas Cup had given the players a cocoon of camaraderie—of common goals and collective ambition. India’s badminton stars had channelled it perfectly to clinch the Cup, known as the men’s world championship, for the first time.</p>\n<p>On 27 April, when India begin their title defence in Chengdu, China, they will be hoping to recreate that team magic yet again. The team WhatsApp group, which was formed ahead of the last edition of Thomas Cup, is full of chatter again. Meetings and team dinners are being scheduled.</p>\n<p>“During the Thomas Cup, we also want to go out there and have fun, enjoy the whole process of being with the team,” says H.S. Prannoy, who is India’s No. 1 singles player going into this Thomas Cup. It was seniors Prannoy and Kidambi Srikanth who had stressed upon, and helped create, a thriving team atmosphere at the last edition.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, we don’t have anything like a team camp. We don’t have that culture like some at places like Indonesia or China. Here the players have to take initiative and make sure that we at least spend little bit of time together before we go for these tournaments,” says Prannoy.</p>\n<p>“When it comes to a normal tour event, you have your dinner, you go back to the room, you are all by yourself and sleep according to your match schedule. But in a team event, you have to spend that extra hour or so with your teammates, be it having dinner with them or doing some team activity. I am really excited about it.”</p>\n<p>The Indian players will have to believe in the collective now more than ever. They were merely the dark horses the last time around; they now go in as the defending champions.</p>\n<p>The core of the team remains the same: Prannoy, Lakshya Sen and Srikanth are the leading singles players, while Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty will be the No. 1 doubles team. In Priyanshu Rajawat and Kiran George give them some serious talent in singles reserves. M.R. Arjun and Dhruv Kapila will be the team’s second doubles pair, with Sai Pratheek as the reserve.</p>\n<p>A Thomas Cup tie consists of five matches–three singles and two doubles against ranking counterparts (No. 1 vs No. 1 and so on) of the rival team. “I think winning the Thomas Cup was one of the biggest achievements in Indian badminton,” says Sen. “As a kid I used to watch China or Indonesia lift the trophy. When I played my first Thomas Cup (2018) against China, just to see their men’s singles line-up was a bit shocking to me—there was Chen Long (reigning world champion), Shi Yuqi (All England champion at the time) and the third singles was Lin Dan(five-time world champion, two-time Olympic champion). At that time, I hardly ever imagined that we can have such a strong team and win the event.”</p>\n<p>India had never won a medal at the event before 2022, didn’t have the serial winners that China possessed in their golden age, but there was enough talent—and belief in each other—to pull off the heist.</p>\n<p>India defeated Malaysia in the quarterfinal and got the better of a star-studded Denmark (including World No. 1 Viktor Axelsen) in the semi-final. In the final, they clinched the tie against 14-time champions Indonesia in the first three rubbers. Sen set the tone with a battling three-game win over Anthony Sinisuka Ginting. Satwik-Chirag saved four match points to defeat Mohammad Ahsan and Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo 18-21 23-21 21-19, before Srikanth wrapped up the tie by beating Asian Games gold medallist Jonatan Christie in straight games.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/badminton-thomas-cup-2024-prannoy-satwik-chirag-111713895709335.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>France, for most of the world, is Paris—arguably global pop culture’s most romantic city—and Paris is France. But for the French people, perhaps, present-day Paris is the least French thing about their country. The next thing that the world loves about France is the country’s wine regions. So much so that entire vacations are spent visiting wineries in Bordeaux and Champagne.</p>\n<p>Yet, France is a lot more than Paris’ museums, churches, overpriced cafés along the Seine, Eiffel Tower, the world’s most visited monument, or the bubbles and wine tastings in chateaus of Champagne, Bordeaux and Medoc, which are usually bustling with bus-loads of wine enthusiasts and those ticking off an “authentic French experience”.</p>\n<p>Paris, a truly global city akin to New York, Berlin, Amsterdam and London, is home to the country’s richest and most successful football club, the Qatari-owned Paris Saint Germain (PSG), which also draws the maximum rebuke from most people outside of the city. And what irks Parisians the most, apart from the high rent and cost of living, is the fact that the city is always teeming with tourists no matter the time of the year; a good number of French people who move to Paris for either work or study, escape it as soon and as often as they can. This summer Paris is going to be busier than ever as it hosts the Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p>\n<p>It would be stupid to ignore local wisdom, which always beats Google and influencers’ video itineraries based on “extensive research” of 72 hours in a city, the bulk of which is probably spent in shooting content instead of feeling the pulse and pace of a place. So, I listened to my friends and took a train south to Marseille on France’s Mediterranean coast. The railway station, Gare de Marseille Saint-Charles, is one of the best places to see the city as well as to enjoy a sunset. That’s a good reason to get yourself a drink and snack as soon as you get off the train and witness the golden hour magic as the Mediterranean skies usually put on a stunning show. The only spot that has better views of entire Marseille is the city’s most visited church, Notre Dame de la Garde, up on a hillock, which is also the highest point in the city.</p>\n<p>Marseille, France’s oldest city, is a mix of the old and new and you can sense how different it is from Paris the minute you stroll through it. Unlike the wet, cold and congested Paris, Marseille greets you with good weather, moderate temperatures for most of the year and the city is not as busy either. You won’t hear as much English as you would in Paris. While all of France loves its wine and beer, the go-to drink in Marseille is pastis, a herbal alcoholic drink made from anise, fennel seeds and liquorice, drunk with water over ice. This drink, 40-45% ABV, is soothing on a warm day.</p>\n<p>You are much closer to nature in Marseille. Cassis offers some great hikes and stunning views of the sea and water from a height, and there is the lovely Calanques National Park where you can hike, spend time on the beaches and swim in the brilliant turquoise waters. You could have a relaxed day on a boat while you make your way to Calanques from Marseille. If pressed for time, you could drive through all this in a day and still be back in the city by dinner time, but you won’t be able to get down to most of the beaches or enjoy yourself in the waters.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/travel-marseille-explore-southern-france-111713506687171.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>For most working professionals today, the line between work and personal life in a hyper-connected world is blurred. We are constantly checking our smartphones, no matter the place or time and the fear of missing out keeps us tethered. Even on vacations, we tend to continuously check our work emails and group chats. The option of missing a meeting is now a thing of the past, with Microsoft Teams and Zoom calls keeping us often busy.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/millennial-bosses-leadership-workplace-culture-management-style-productivity-111712473554499.html\">Also read: Are millennial bosses really cool?</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Taking a vacation, or small breaks, allows one to completely disconnect from work. But how many of us truly stay away from replying to emails or looking at office Slack channels during a break? Is it even possible to take a vacation from work in an era where the popular belief is to stay connected 24x7? It is. Here’s how you can disconnect from work during a holiday to return refreshed and more connected to your work.</p>\n<p><strong>Blueprint for a reset</strong><br/>Just as it is at work, even for a vacation planning is key. Decide what you want to see, do and experience. If it is history that interests you, you may want to look up historical sites, if it is food, then check out the local hotspots for delicacies, and if it is adventure, then find out which activities you can indulge in. </p>\n<p>Investing time in planning allows your mind to explore new avenues, build anticipation and keep you focused on your vacation goals. In other words, during a break, one should embrace active relaxation—be it through lounging by the pool all day/ reading, or hiking, walking or simply spending quality time with loved ones. Basically, any activity that actively takes your mind off work. Plus, immersing yourself in new experiences will keep you away from checking your phone constantly and allow you to unwind.</p>\n<p><strong>Say it out aloud </strong><br/>Open communication about taking time off is as important as communication about other work matters. Inform your colleagues/peers about your vacation dates clearly and emphasize that you will only be available for an urgent emergency. Set an “out-of-office” email response and resist the urge to check or reply to messages. </p>\n<p>Often, those who are in a key leadership position may feel that the world will fall apart if they don’t check their emails for an hour—a thought process that may prevent you from going in for a full-fledged digital detox. In such a case, consider limiting your screen time. Designate specific times during the day to check for important messages that need to be addressed, but avoid getting sucked into the vortex of emails and work chats.</p>\n<p>Remember, a vacation is meant for you to recharge, not for you to be on-call all the time. That can wait till you are back in the office.</p>\n<p><strong>Set an example</strong><br/>As leaders, it’s essential to set the right example and encourage a healthy approach to vacation time. One aspect of effective digital leadership is empowering your team to handle responsibilities in your absence. This involves clear delegation, providing them with the necessary tools and resources, and fostering a culture of trust and accountability. By doing so, you not only ensure that work continues smoothly but also demonstrate your confidence in their capabilities. When you as a leader trust your teams to manage in your absence, it sets a positive example for the entire organization. </p>\n<p><strong>Technology to the rescue </strong><br/>Use the thing that keeps you hyper-connected to disconnect as well. In fact, embracing technology can enhance the vacation experience without compromising on rest and recovery. Utilising communication tools for urgent matters, setting up automated responses, and scheduling tasks in advance can help minimise disruptions during your time off. Tools like project management platforms and shared calendars can ensure everyone is informed and projects stay on track.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, practising digital leadership means finding the balance between staying connected when needed and allowing yourself and your team the space to recharge and disconnect during vacations. It’s about leveraging technology to facilitate productivity and well-being, rather than letting it become a barrier to enjoying time away from work.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/disconnect-during-vacation-reconnect-digital-leadership-active-relaxation-111713722537235.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Ayesha Fernandez loves to tell stories. Like the tale of the tortoise and the hare—not the familiar version, but what happens next. The hare, she often narrates, realises that he needs to work harder to win. She also narrates the story of the teacher who fills a jar with stones, asking students if the container is full. When they reply with a yes, she fills it with gravel, which takes up the space between the stones. The students again reply that the jar is full. She repeats the process with sand and the students give her the same answer. She finally fills it with water, proving them wrong yet again.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/workplace-monk-mode-focus-tasks-office-111711905144063.html\">Also read: How to organise your work life like a monk</a>\n    </p>\n<p>These may sound like tales that Fernandez, 40, tells her young daughter, but her audience is actually her colleagues, clients, team members and senior leaders at her workplace.</p>\n<p>Fernandez finds stories effective in communicating varied information at work, whether data, technical details, processes, or abstract ideas. The hare and the tortoise tale illustrates that it’s never too late to change and get back to the top. The teacher story, on the other hand, shows there’s always room for improvement. “It helps the listener to connect and brings emotion to what would otherwise have just been a list of facts and figures. People’s attention is tuned to focusing on a story,” says the Bengaluru-based sales director at American software company Salesforce.</p>\n<p>Fernandez is among a growing number of professionals who are using storytelling in the workplace to convey information, make connections, entertain and make messages stick.</p>\n<p>Using stories to communicate in the office is not a new concept. For years, leaders have used them to build a more collaborative workspace. Storytelling has become a more important and integral part of the office now, because they help employees break away from the constant noise they are surrounded with, whether it’s in the form of leadership gurus giving<i> gyaan</i> on Twitter or forwarded WhatsApp memes explaining why it’s a “good idea” to take leave from work immediately after a confrontation with the manager.  Effective in-person storytelling helps bring the message home. The bonus points are that stories bring some heart to boring data, motivating and inspiring listeners and developing trust among people.  </p>\n<p>Studies, too, have shown that it is easier to remember random lists of words when embedded in a story. Author Paul Smith highlights storytelling’s effectiveness for varied learners in his book, <i>Leader As Storyteller: 10 Reasons It Makes A Better Business Connection</i>. The vocal aspect appeals to auditory learners, who prefer discussions and lectures; mental pictures help visual learners; while the emotional connection and feelings evoked stay with kinesthetic learners who imbibe learning through feeling and doing, Smith writes. </p>\n<p>People may be technically proficient, but there is also a need for them to be good communicators. “Whether in finance, marketing, or HR, many professionals need this skill. How do you persuade and influence people and push a call to action? You do it through stories,” says Debolina Dutta, organizational behaviour and human resource professor at the Indian Institute of Management Bengaluru, who conducts a post graduate and executive program on storytelling for business.</p>\n<p>But what distinguishes storytelling for business? Indranil Chakraborty, author of<i> Stories At Work </i>and founder of communications consultancy, StoryWorks, which helps business professionals become compelling communicators through storytelling, mentions three key distinctions in business storytelling. Stories in business are used to make point; they help wrap facts in context and deliver them with emotion; and brevity is key.  </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/social-media-professional-work-office-elections-censor-111713161320733.html\">Also read: Watch out, your social media posts might cost you a job</a>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/business-storytelling-happier-workplaces-communication-connection-111713719757190.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Personal notebooks reveal what life was like for the Washington activist who spent decades advocating for equal rights in the federal government and elsewhere</h2>\n<p>In 1957, Frank Kameny, a 32-year-old astronomer with the Army Map Service, was on a work trip to Hawaii and the West Coast when he was told to report back to Washington, D.C. for questioning. There, civil service investigators asked him to respond to reports that he was gay. “I don’t see how it’s relevant to any rational concern or business of the government,” Kameny, a World War II veteran, recalled answering. He was soon fired. The official cause cited was that he had falsified his job application, an official government document, by downplaying his arrest for “lewd” behavior with another man the previous year. (Kameny told the government he’d been arrested for “disorderly conduct,” a less grave sin in those days.) At the time, the government deemed gay Americans to be security risks and effectively banned them from federal service. These were the days of the Lavender Scare, which grew out of the anti-communist panic of the 1940s and ’50s.</p>\n<p>Kameny appealed his dismissal in various courts and in 1961 petitioned the United States Supreme Court to take up his case; the court declined to review it. Furious, Kameny would devote his life to fighting homophobia: “We are here to stay, we are part of American life and society, and you will be seeing a lot more of us,” he declared in a 1969 letter.</p>\n<p>Born in New York City on May 21, 1925, to a Jewish family, Kameny became a trailblazing activist for gay civil rights. In 1961, after his fruitless petition to the Supreme Court, Kameny co-founded the Washington, D.C. chapter of the Mattachine Society, a pioneering organization with what was then called the homophile movement—the pre-Stonewall campaign for gay equality. Four years later, the group led the first recorded gay rights picket of the White House, protesting the government’s banning of gay Americans from the federal service: “<i>Homosexual Citizens Want to Serve Their Country Too</i>.” “<i>Sexual Preference Is Irrelevant to Federal Employment</i>.” These were radical messages for the era.</p>\n<p>Kameny neatly captured his ethos in the slogan “Gay Is Good,” which he coined in 1968, inspired by the Black Power mantra “Black Is Beautiful.” “For those within the community, [the phrase] certainly instilled some pride to counterbalance the [rhetoric of] ‘gays are going to hell,’” says Franklin A. Robinson Jr., an archivist with the National Museum of American History. And Kameny aptly linked the struggle for gay rights to other battles for equality: “We are interested in obtaining rights for our respective minorities as Negroes, as Jews and as homosexuals,” he proclaimed at a 1964 public meeting at Freedom House, a Washington-based nonprofit.</p>\n<p>In 1971, Kameny became the first openly gay person to run for U.S. Congress. As he vied to serve as Washington’s delegate to the House of Representatives, he presented himself as a candidate who had something to offer everybody. “I was very conscious of running a double-barreled, double-issue campaign,” he recalled to <i>Washingtonian</i> magazine in 2010. “If you’re going to run for public office, you have to become [an] expert on trash collection, road repair and all the things that concern people, but I was running a parallel campaign on gay issues.”</p>\n<p>While Kameny lost his bid, he played a big role in pressuring the American Psychiatric Association to remove homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses and disorders in 1973, and some two decades later, he lobbied President Bill Clinton to sign a 1995 executive order banning anti-gay discrimination in federal security clearances. In 2009, two years before he died, the U.S. government issued an apology to Kameny for his 1957 termination.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/good-havens-180987148/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Unlike other two-year-olds, Timtim loves broccoli and peas. He starts the day with two boiled eggs, each stuffed with a broccoli floret. His dinner includes a portion of boiled peas. “If my baby doesn’t see the greens, he won’t eat,” laughs Delhi-based software engineer Saurabh Khurana.</p>\n<p>When Khurana, 35, adopted Timtim, a Retriever, from an animal shelter in 2022, he was clear that he wanted to feed him nutrient-rich, freshly cooked food. So, he would wake up at 5am and, with the help of his wife, prepare Timtim’s food—a combination of chicken, rice and vegetables. But combined with office workload, it was an exhausting drill.</p>\n<p>Early last year, Khurana started to look for brands that serve healthy pet food with “human-grade” ingredients, or made in accordance with regulations for ready-to-eat human food products. Today, Khurana depends on three platforms to deliver food for his dog—sometimes, it is pork and lentils; often, rice, chicken and vegetables, including peas. The food resembles, even almost tastes like, what humans would eat.</p>\n<p>“I have tasted all the food that I have ordered. It’s like what we eat, minus the salt and masala,” says Khurana, who spends ₹15,000 on pet food every month, about 10% more compared to when he used to cook at home for Timtim. The dog seems to have adjusted well to the “outside food”. “Why should he eat stinky, packaged food (referring to kibble), when I can afford to give him food that looks like food and keeps him healthy?” says Khurana.</p>\n<p>As millennials and Gen Zers reimagine the idea of parenthood, they are ready to spend more time and effort to ensure their beloved pets eat nutritious food, even if it means shelling out more money. Several startups and brands are banking on this visceral urge. From gluten-free to vegan and vegetarian diets, the Indian market is slowly and steadily seeing a rise in pet food that’s seemingly less processed and, in some cases, more closely resembling human food.</p>\n<p>According to Statista, the 2024 revenue in the pet food market in India amounts to $640 million (around ₹5,300 crore). It is expected to grow annually by 12.63%, hitting $1.03 billion in the next four years. Globally, the most revenue is generated in the US (over $57 billion in 2023).</p>\n<p>While there’s no official data on the growth of “human-grade” pet food in India, a quick search online and in retail stores for bespoke and “holistic” options is enough to give an idea of how serious people are becoming about the wellness of their pets. “Being a pet parent is different from being a human parent. When you are a pet parent, you know that unless something untoward happens, you will outlive your pet,” says Ishmeet Singh Chandiok, a pet parent and chef who has done stints at Hyatt and JW Mariott. He’s the founder of Harley’s Corner, a ready-to-eat premium dog food brand that claims to use human-grade ingredients and zero preservatives to create meals.</p>\n<p>Among the dishes Harley’s offers are Goulash ( ₹625 for 900g; to give an idea, a 30kg dog needs 360-450g a meal), a low-fat meal that comprises a blend of sorghum millet, pumpkin seeds, brewer’s yeast, sweet potato, chicken, brown rice, cod liver oil, wheat germ oil, vegetables, algae calcium and seaweed powder; and Wooferole ( ₹800 for 900gm), a “full dietary meal” that combines fish, brown rice, quinoa, pumpkin, algae calcium, and vegetables. My dog and I tried the Goulash. It looked and tasted like chicken khichdi, without salt and spices. My dog finished it in seconds.</p>\n<p>“By just changing the food, if I can have my dog live even a year longer, it would be priceless,” says Singh. “This kind of belief is driving the interest in human-grade pet food, besides growing awareness in general around wellness and what you yourself eat and feed your pet.”</p>\n<p>Human-grade pet food, in simple words, means food fit enough for human consumption. “Humans can eat it but it’s not recommended since pet food has added vitamins, minerals and supplements that are more suitable for animals,” says Shivangi Raina, a Bengaluru-based veterinarian.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/pet-food-good-enough-for-humans-to-take-a-bite-of-111714046366689.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

And so greying, considered heroes give wise advice to the reckless, obsessive, dynamic creatures they once were.</p>\n<p>He, the Olympic champion, isn’t the looking-back kind. But we want to examine the bones of athletic journeys and younger athletes want to peer down the roads he walked. And this is when he’ll say repeatedly that yes, sure, he reached several goals yet he “failed miserably”.</p>\n<p>Failed?</p>\n<p>In “achieving my fullest potential?”</p>\n<p>But wait, what was the problem?</p>\n<p>“My lack of balance.”</p>\n<p>Abhinav Bindra is talking about something beyond just mere winning. About winning well. About courage of a form we don’t always acknowledge. Courage to take days off, to do less, to not be consumed by sport, to not get imprisoned in the unhealthy grip of competition.</p>\n<p>“Why did I have self-doubt?” he says. “Because all my eggs were in one basket. Because my self-worth depended on where my name was in the ranking list. I didn’t have the courage to let go.”</p>\n<p>“My most successful years, in terms of quality, were in the US in 2001 when I was a student-athlete. I had only so many hours to train. I was challenged intellectually, I was challenged outside the field of play. I went on hikes. Even if I didn’t win in Athens (Olympics, 2004), I was at my best then. And it was because of balance. If everything rests on one pillar and there’s an earthquake, everything shakes.”</p>\n<p>Then he became obsessive, his life a narrow pursuit of gold, and ironically it’s what he got. But if he stayed balanced, could he have been even better? A career never answers every question.</p>\n<p>It’s 16 years since Bindra won 10m air rifle gold in Beijing and since it’s Olympic year, he’s a fair subject for another interrogation. After all, he’s not the athlete I knew. He has a taste for occasional Vesper martinis—shaken, of course—but, to put it politely, there’s nothing much else about him which says James Bond. Except the weapon. The last gun he has left from 22 years of shooting is a gold rifle presented to him by Walther, the gun-maker to 007. The other guns have gone, some pellets remain and a few jackets. His athletic skin has been shed. Now he’s someone who used to be talented.</p>\n<p>Singer Jon Bon Jovi recently spoke about buying back his first guitar. Then he played it, for it’s what musicians do. But athletes let go. Exhausted and played out, they don’t look back. They might clutch on to a little memorabilia, as Rahul Dravid has with a few bats and gloves, but as the Indian cricket coach said, they’re “in some boxes that I haven’t opened in years”.</p>\n<p>But didn’t he, batting engineer, ever step back into the nets, just you know to remember the sound and sensation of timing? Like strumming an old guitar?</p>\n<p>“Never hit a ball in the nets after I stopped,” he replied.</p>\n<p>Athletes often stay in sport, in some form, for it’s all they know. Dravid turned mentor. Bindra works with the International Olympic Committee on mental health and in safeguarding athletes from harassment and abuse, sits on the board of Bajaj Auto and has opened 15 hi-tech centres, some used for athletic high performance and others used by patients in hospitals for rehabilitation.</p>\n<p>But dearest to him is his foundation, through which he runs Olympic Values Education Programmes (ask and you’ll get monthly reports and sermons on sport and gender equality), supports athletes and is currently involved in an environmental restoration forest project in Odisha.</p>\n<p>Becoming great demands selfishness, no time for anything or anyone but a dream. But Bindra’s new life has an unselfishness which appeals to the wiser him. Once he told stories of waking at 3 am and practising in his underwear. Now he talks delightedly of meeting a 14-year-old Adivasi swimmer in Odisha, where he has a sports science centre, who “very enthusiastically discussed his VO2 max values with me”.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/opinion/abhinav-bindra-olympic-champion-sports-111714113926916.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Vasudev, as well as the late sculptor S. Nandagopal, have hilarious and moving stories about the founding of Cholamandal Artists’ Village—the home of the Madras Art Movement of the 1960s; stories that are testament to the support they provided one another. In Mumbai, members of the Progressive Artists’ Group (PAG), formed a few decades earlier in 1947, may not have lived in each other’s houses but they had a similar camaraderie and shared sentiments about the direction of art in a newly independent country. In Paris, about a hundred years before PAG, another group of artists banded together, played with light and colour, and brought spontaneity to art by painting outdoors, picking everyday subjects, and infusing art with a sense of movement and brightness.</p>\n    <p>Without this kind of community, artists wouldn’t thrive, and without inspiration from the past, there is little new or original they could create, as our story marking the 150th anniversary of Impressionism shows. We examine the impact of Impressionism on Indian artists, who created a South Asian tradition that combined the best elements of Impressionism with indigenous ideas and modernism to create a unique style that runs through art practice to this day.</p>\n    <p>The idea of camaraderie and inspiration from things past is common to our stories.

Before that, he had only come across reproductions of paintings by these artists while pursuing a bachelor’s degree in art at the Sir J.J. School of Art in Mumbai. “As arts students in India in the 1970s-80s, we learnt so much from these masters but were unable to view even a single one of these original paintings. We only knew of them through reproductions, or if someone showed 35-mm slides,” says Dodiya, a leading contemporary artist who is currently showing his solo, <i>I Know You. I do. O’ Stranger</i>, at the Galerie Templon, Paris.</p>\n<p>His exhibition coincides with an important milestone in art history—2024 marks 150 years since the first Impressionist exhibition was held in Paris. Dodiya reflects on that moment when he first entered the Musée d’Orsay, which has one of the largest collections of works by Impressionist artists. The ground floor featured a work by Honoré Daumier, who painted life on the street and in the train carriage. “His work was not entirely Impressionist, but was along those lines. On display on the upper floor of the museum was the controversial work <i>Le Dejeuner sur l’herbe (The Luncheon on the Grass)</i> by Edouard Manet,” he recalls. The large oil on canvas, painted between 1862-63, featured a nude female with two fully-dressed men, while on a picnic somewhere in rural France.</p>\n<p>It was not just the large works that impacted Dodiya but also small-scale landscapes by Monet, Camille Pissarro and Alfred Sisley. “I continue to visit the museum during every visit to Paris,” he says. “I take profound delight in the way these artists painted. There is a lifelike quality, and yet the rendering isn’t rooted in realism. Rendering is one thing and transforming is another. In these works, we can see the transformation of life, light and time, which is very critical to Impressionism.”</p>\n<p>What makes Impressionist artists so popular across the world—including in India—150 years after they first exhibited at the studio of photographer Nadar in Paris? To understand this, one has to look at the history of this significant movement, which was rooted in an act of rebellion. In the middle of the 19th century, a jury of artists from the Académie des Beaux-Arts would select artworks and award medals as part of its official exhibition Salon de Paris. In 1874, however, artists such as Monet, Degas and Pissarro decided to organise an exhibition that didn’t subscribe to the style of academic realism—rooted in Biblical and mythological themes—preferred by the Salon. So, 30 artists, who collectively called themselves the Société Anonyme des Artistes Peintres, Sculpteurs et Graveurs, came together in this landmark show, which heralded the birth of Impressionism as a movement.</p>\n<p>Also read: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/how-to-lounge/art-culture/retrospective-at-dag-saluting-the-indomitable-spirit-of-gogi-saroj-pal-111713968923067.html\">Saluting the indomitable spirit of Gogi Saroj Pal</a>\n\t                                    </p>\n<p>\n\t                                        \n\t                                    \t“The independent artists, despite their diverse approaches to painting, appeared to contemporaries as a group.

    "body": "<p>An understanding of entrepreneurs overcoming the odds in gaining access to capital is part of Hardika Shah’s inheritance. As a child growing up in 1980s Mumbai, the CEO and founder of non-banking financial company (NBFC) Kinara Capital, witnessed her mother running a provision store on the ground floor of a building where her parents had an apartment. In pre-liberalisation India, customers were often short of cash at the end of the month, which meant her mother would extend them credit while herself being perpetually short of cash to expand. “Every one (of her customers) was operating salary cheque-to-salary cheque, so she always had this working capital gap,” recalls Shah. But every few weeks, “this random guy would come with a paper bag with cash. There was this unofficial credit community. That was how you got working capital through the Gujarati community.”</p>\n<p>It is perhaps not a coincidence that Shah would eventually start Kinara Capital in 2011, focusing on unsecured lending to small business owners similarly starved of working capital, after a successful stint in consulting. In 1988, Shah had moved to the US for undergraduate studies and then joined Accenture, where she worked for two decades. Shah’s frenetic travel schedule meant that over a decade had passed before she returned to India in 2003. When she visited India that year to set up an office for a client, Microsoft, in Hyderabad, she realised that she had missed witnessing the liberalisation of India’s economy by then finance minister Manmohan Singh and his successors. Shah felt like Rip van Winkle. “You end up in a time warp,” says Shah, 53. But as so often in India, she also noticed the growing disparities between “entitled engineers” and the rest: “You realise so many are left behind.”</p>\n<p>Moved by the experience of watching India’s rapid growth phase unfold but also conscious that this wasn’t benefiting everyone—she was particularly concerned about the unequal lack of access to credit—Shah returned home to the Bay Area. The following year, she started mentoring social entrepreneurs studying at Santa Clara University and at Stanford University, both in California. In 2007, she began an executive MBA while still working for Accenture, shuttling between classes at New York’s Columbia University and the University of California Haas business school campus in Berkeley.</p>\n<p>Shah had juggled academics and work before in Mumbai, receiving internships as a market researcher and later as a font designer while still in high school, earnings she put away towards the exorbitant costs of higher education in the US. After she finished school in Mumbai, in an India before large student loans, Shah received an early lesson in being unable to raise credit. Her parents sold their apartment in Mumbai so that she could study computer science and liberal arts at Knox College in Illinois, US. While she was in college, the rupee was substantially devalued in 1989 and her parents said they would be unable to continue to fund her education. Shah received permission to work off campus and spent weekends working as a receptionist in a nursing home and got jobs during summer holidays as well.</p>\n<p>Completing her MBA in 2009, Shah took a couple of months off and again visited India. In Mumbai and Chennai, she met anyone who would give her the time to talk about finance directed at MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises). She found credit in India to be characterised by a strange dichotomy. Banks loaned money to those with land or other collateral while others relied on relationships or chit funds to raise cash. “I looked at it and thought, ‘Most of our nation doesn’t have land, capital or property.’ I saw this missing middle beyond micro finance.” On her return to the US, she raised $180,000 in seed capital primarily from her classmates in the MBA programme and Accenture colleagues, and Kinara Capital was born.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/hardika-shah-kinara-capital-profile-nbfc-micro-lending-india-111714108834045.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>T20 cricket was already a slam-bam affair compared to longer forms of the game. Relatively small grounds and mostly easy wickets made it even more so in the Indian Premier League (IPL). And yet, some IPL administrators wanted to give “entertainment” a bigger push, with more fours and sixes.</p>\n<p>So they came up with an “impact sub”, which essentially gives a team an extra batsman. In a 20-over game, that’s a huge deal. It means a team can have seven specialist batsmen plus an all-rounder or two. And yet, when it’s their turn to bowl, they can still have a full complement of their five best bowlers and more.</p>\n<p>With eight or nine batsmen, a team can keep going hard for 20 overs even if it loses two wickets every five overs. There’s almost no fear of getting bowled out or running out of batsmen in this scenario. So we are getting used to 250 plus scores.</p>\n<p>Is that high entertainment though? What makes cricket a nuanced game are the choices it forces captains, coaches, and players to make. On a particular surface, for example, should you aim for 250 and risk getting bowled out for 150, or settle for 200?</p>\n<p>The fundamental problem with the impact sub is that it has destroyed these trade-offs that make cricket truly engrossing. We anticipated this, in an article in <i>Lounge</i>, two years ago, titled <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/why-the-ipl-does-not-need-a-supersub-111663669791842.html\"> Why the IPL does not need a ‘supersub’</a>, before the rule was introduced in IPL 2023. Now, several players, including Indian captain Rohit Sharma, are speaking out on the damage it’s doing.</p>\n<p>While Sharma talks about the harm to Indian cricket because all-rounders are sidelined, it is sucking the life out of T20 cricket in even more insidious ways. Here are five reasons to drop the impact sub:</p>\n<p><strong>Diminishing value of wickets: </strong>After Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) got off to a blistering start in Delhi on 20 April, left-arm leg-spinner Kuldeep Yadav of Delhi Capitals (DC) struck three quick blows. Then Axar Patel removed Heinrich Klaasen with the first ball of the 10th over. SRH’s top four batsmen were back in the hut with 11 overs to go.</p>\n<p>Normally, a slowdown or even a collapse would have ensued—a fair price to pay for being ultra aggressive with the bat. But with extended batting resources, the loss of wickets barely made a dent in the scoring. SRH ended up with 266 and won easily.</p>\n<p>This is just one example of the diminishing value of taking wickets because teams have an extra batsman. Yadav’s triple-strike on a batting paradise in a small ground counted for almost nothing. When there are no consequences to going gung-ho with the bat, it’s no fun to see 250 plus scores.</p>\n<p><strong>Choice of playing 11: </strong>Eleven players in a team is one of the fundamental characteristics of cricket. Over decades, it has created a fine balance between batsmen and bowlers. Indian coach Rahul Dravid must have agonised over the fifth bowler before picking Shardul Thakur for his all-round promise, and leaving out strike bowler Mohammed Shami from the playing 11 of the 2023 ODI World Cup at the outset. Shami came in after four matches and became the highest wicket-taker of the tournament.</p>\n<p>These are the sorts of choices that coaches and captains had to make when picking a playing 11 in the IPL too, which fans enjoyed debating. Now the impact sub, who is really a 12th member in the side, has destroyed this strategic aspect of the game. The rule says, you can have your cake and eat it too.</p>\n<p>With an impact sub, Imran Khan would not have required his ingenuity of picking five specialist bowlers to win the 1992 ODI World Cup for Pakistan. Every team would have had five specialist bowlers instead of fiddling with all-rounders.</p>\n<p><strong>Lowering stature of bowlers: </strong>The T20 game is already stacked against bowlers. Most wickets are flat, grounds are small, and the white ball stops swinging after four overs. Now the impact sub has added the pressure of the top order swinging at every ball with impunity.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/indian-premier-league-ipl-2024-impact-subs-cricket-t20-111714052296487.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I also made a day trip to Devil’s Bridge, a place I had only seen in a couple of episodes of <i>Hinterland,</i> a noir crime drama set in Wales. The dark and atmospheric Devil’s Bridge comprises three bridges that span the Afon Mynach, a tributary of the Rheidol. Each one, built upon the previous bridge, can be reached by the Rheidol Steam Railway, and had made it to my travel wish list since I saw the show in 2018.</p>\n<p>I am not the only one who’s guided by the screen when it comes to travel plans. According to Expedia, the screen is sparking wanderlust across the world. The travel company’s 2023 report <i>The No-Normal: Unexpected Travel Trends</i> revealed that 66% of travellers worldwide have “considered visiting a destination after seeing it featured in a show or movie they have streamed at home, and 39% have booked a trip for the same reason”. The company’s Unpack 2024 research predicted that the trend would continue this year, with “movies and streaming shows (the) top inspiration for travel”.</p>\n<p>Be it gorgeous landscapes of New Zealand (<i>The Rings of Power</i>) or the natural beauty of Maui and Sicily (<i>The White Lotus</i>), the urbanity of Paris (<i>Emily in Paris</i>) or the glamour and glitz of New York (<i>Sex and the City</i> reboot), travellers are planning trips to locations popularised by TV series and movies.</p>\n<p>In fact, Expedia believes this will lead destinations such as Thailand (<i>The White Lotus,</i> season 3), the Scottish Highlands (<i>Outlander,</i> season 7), Malta (<i>Gladiator 2</i>), Greece (<i>Argylle</i>) and South Korea (<i>Squid Game,</i> season 2) to trend in 2024.</p>\n<p>Nishant Pitti, CEO and co-founder, EaseMyTrip, agrees that seeking holiday inspiration from films, soaps or sitcoms is the new global travel trend that is influencing tourists’ holiday plans and is expected to gain momentum this year. “This is a rather unconventional take on travelling and vacationing, with new movies and TV series generating higher interest in travel to those places,” he says.</p>\n<p>The trend has been around for a while, especially after <i>Harry Potter, Game of</i> <i>Thrones </i>and <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, but screen-inspired travel has soared post-pandemic. One destination though that remains an evergreen choice for set-jetting is the UK, due to the fact that so many films and series have been shot here.</p>\n<p>Over the years, iconic film and TV franchises such as <i>James Bond, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Outlander, The Crown</i> and <i>Paddington</i> have consistently chosen UK locations and studios to house their productions. Recent films such as <i>Wonka</i> and Napoleon have boosted visitor numbers, while the growth of TV streaming has fuelled a rise in screen tourism. The fact that films and series have been filmed across Britain, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland has led to numerous set-jetting opportunities.\n\t                                    </p>\n<p>With inbound tourists spending an estimated £892.6 million (around ₹9,194 crore) in film-related screen tourism in the UK in 2019 alone, according to the British Film Institute (BFI), the country is tapping the potential of screen tourism.</p>\n<p>Pitti says the UK tops the list owing to its scenic beauty and the right blend of royalty, history and modern experiences that create the perfect backdrop for historical dramas and contemporary shows. “For instance, Chatsworth House in Peak district was featured in <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> (the 2005 version starring Keira Knightley). The UK has also been the centrepiece of shows like <i>Downton Abbey</i> and <i>Bridgerton</i> (Hampton Court Palace). Even the <i>Harry Potter</i> franchise sought inspiration from the alluring Scottish Highlands to create a mystical fantasy world for children,” he says.</p>\n<p>The choices for travellers are plentiful. The British Film Commission, the agency that supports production of international films and television in the UK, in 2022 alone supported film and TV titles such as <i>Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, The Crown, season 6, The Boys in the Boat, Black Cake</i> and <i>Napoleon</i>.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/setjetting-uk-travel-trend-expedia-111714111224778.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Imagine that your application for a teaching position has been rejected by a number of universities and teaching institutions in Europe. You advertise private tuitions but no pupils turn up. You settle for a job as a third-division clerk at a patent office, reading patent applications from nine in the morning till five in the evening, six days a week. Back home, your marriage is in trouble. And yet, you churn out no less than five theoretical papers on science, three of which will give a new lease of life to physics for another century. That was Einstein in 1905. He was a technical expert—class III at the Federal Office for Intellectual Property in Bern between 1902 and 1909, and with no access to any scientific instruments, literature, colleagues, or inspiration. He was all by himself, consumed by his thought experiments. By today’s standards of work culture, Einstein was moonlighting.</p>\n<p>Every few months, there’s a storm in a teacup about moonlighting—or working at another job while holding a steady one. The term hit headline soon after the pandemic, when work-from-home became the norm and employees logged in without the supervision of their bosses. Is it indeed “cheating” as some leaders have declared? It depends on what you do—if you do the very same work for a competitor, it is wrong. But, if the side hustle is a creative pursuit that gives you a shot at creating history, why not?</p>\n<p>Steve Wozniak was creating the future of Apple years before he left HP to set up the company with Steve Jobs. He would develop new hardware and systems with no direct relevance to the HP of the day. During the late 1980s, Tim Berners-Lee took on the side gig of automating information sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world, which led to the creation of the World Wide Web. If there is a pent-up creative capacity which is not adequately channelised by the employer, the person should be allowed to do justice to it.</p>\n<p>There are three conditions under which moonlighting makes sense, and, in fact, must be encouraged. First, when an employee’s talent is not fully utilised or developed, the employee must be allowed to take up additional tasks within or outside the formal setup. After all, it is an employer’s responsibility to tap into the resource or they run the risk of the asset eroding. It’s not just utilisation of talent, but also development and enhancement through exposure. The mythologist and writer Devdutt Pattanaik spent his early years at Sanofi Aventis and Apollo Group of Hospitals honing his skills as a writer, alongside his day job as a medical practitioner. That allowed him to craft a creative career for himself as well as entertain and inform a huge number of readers.</p>\n<p>Second, when the cause the employee is working for is broader than the firm’s immediate interest or relevance. If an employee is creating a solution that could potentially shift the paradigm of the market as a whole, the firm should be willing to fund such a venture. That’s how Intel encouraged its engineer, Ajay Bhatt, to create the USB standard that didn’t just benefit the firm to inter-operate with other devices but became an industry standard for data communication. It was not exactly what Intel, the chip maker, was known for.</p>\n<p>Third, moonlighting makes for a great investment if the employee helps the firm develop new skills and competencies. If an employee is working on a similar domain that the firm excels in then where is the firm learning from? It’s a circular flow of knowledge. It is possible that through a side-gig the employee develops new competences that would become mainstream in the organisation. This way the firm can transform to become future ready.</p>\n<p>The early experiments that the internal IT team did at Amazon with its infrastructure and computational capacity laid the foundation of AWS, which has become the biggest profit engine for the company. All such experiments were planted years before the company made any profits from its core business.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/moonlighting-side-job-part-time-work-interests-111714324643689.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Veni Jain, 30, had an idea she believed in. Before she could act on it, however, she got married and moved to Kolkata from Delhi, where she knew no one except her husband and his family. She signed up for a Youth Ficci Ladies Organisation (Y-Flo) meeting in 2022. Two years and several Y-Flo meetings later, she has a thriving social life and is about to launch a business curating gourmet cheese and grazing boards for parties and dinners.</p>\n<p>On International Women’s Day last month, Neha Sharma, 41, attended her first-ever women’s support-cum-networking group event at Lead Like Her Club, a group exclusively for women in leadership roles in human resources. Gurugram-based Sharma, head of human resources for market operations at Airtel, found the gathering useful as she met many like-minded people at a similar stage in their careers. “Everyone wanted to come together as a community to figure out ways in which we can give back to working women,” says Sharma.</p>\n<p>Jain and Sharma are among a growing number of women who are turning to women-only groups because regular networking groups don’t do enough for them. “Women frequently encounter the double bind dilemma, where they are expected to be assertive but not aggressive, nurturing but not weak. Gender pay gaps and lack of representation in leadership roles further exacerbate these challenges, making it crucial for women to have spaces where they can discuss and address these issues,” says Aparna Acharekar, 46, co-founder of women’s networking platform Coto. Coto started in October 2022 and has 400,000 members and 7,000 communities, or groups based on various interests. Community heads decide how often they meet.“Further, responsibilities like childcare and household management disproportionately fall on women, creating a constant tension between work and home.”</p>\n<p>All business owners need like-minded people to consult, create, caution and celebrate, says Elisha Saigal, 40, the Mumbai-based founder and CEO of El Sol Strategic Consultants, who has been part of multiple women’s networking groups, including Ladies Who Lead, for five years. “Your teams share your vision, wins and annual goals, but you need a closed circle to course correct, reflect and motivate,” she says. “We brainstorm, co-create, party, unlearn and learn from each other. We share similar business hiccups and help each other navigate them.”</p>\n<p>Women-only support groups foster empathy through shared experiences, says Radhika Yuvraj Iyengar, 47, India country director for Women In Tech Global, an organisation championing diversity in STEM. The group has 528 members in India and 10,000 globally. The India arm started six years ago, and its members meet once a week. A global meet-up is held once in two months; they use both virtual and in-person meetings. “The struggles faced by Indian working women are widely acknowledged, yet not universally comprehended. Issues such as achieving work-life balance, managing work and family obligations, addressing health and wellness concerns, navigating adversity including toxic work environments, all while striving to maintain dignity and break barriers, remain complex and often misunderstood. By participating in women-centric groups, individuals can freely express themselves, find common ground, and grow together,” explains Hyderabad-based Iyengar.</p>\n<p>Such groups are also a good way to build a community of friends for oneself in a new city. They also helped working women navigate the challenges of the pandemic, bringing them closer. “Surviving and thriving in 2020 wouldn’t have been possible without this support,” says Saigal.</p>\n<p>Workspaces and culture remain largely patriarchal, which is why women often turn to groups that understand their unique circumstances and challenges as well as get advice. “Studies have shown that women are interrupted more frequently, receive less credit for their ideas, and are underrepresented in decision-making positions. They face microaggressions and gender biases that hinder their professional growth and networking opportunities,” says Acharekar, who is based in Mumbai.</p>\n<p>One word that consistently comes up among founders and members of women-only networking groups is “community”—for both work and fun. Garima Dhamija, 50, and five others co-founded Lead Like Her in Gurugram in 2022 with the aim of creating and giving back to the community of working women. It now has 50 members and they meet fortnightly. The group is restricted to the National Capital Region (NCR).</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/women-groups-networking-work-office-111714324086252.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>In correspondence with a passionate abolitionist in London, the great American orator didn’t hold back when talking about the 16th president, or his successor, the much-maligned Andrew Johnson</h2>\n<p>A visit to Newcastle, England, in 1846 led to one of the most consequential friendships in the history of abolitionism. There, historians believe, Frederick Douglass, 28, met Julia Griffiths, a 35-year-old activist, who showed him around London. Griffiths (later known as Julia Griffiths Crofts upon marriage) would recall Douglass’ playful ease with her and her younger sister, Eliza, at a soirée in London the following March. After Eliza pinned a white carnation on Douglass’ coat, “naughty brother Frederick never rested til he knocked off the beautiful white petals, leaving only the green leaves.” Griffiths gained Douglass’ confidence by raising funds for his abolitionist work, and the pair developed a deep bond, becoming co-laborers in the cause of Black freedom and equality in the United States. Their 47-year-long correspondence, much of it resting among Douglass’ papers in the Library of Congress, has become a critical piece in historians’ portraits of Douglass.</p>\n<p>Those papers, though, are incomplete, and scholars have long wished to fill in what’s missing. Now, we’ve found that a number of significant letters from Douglass have been hiding in plain sight, including some remarkable ones he sent to Griffiths during the Civil War. At pivotal moments, Douglass shared candid opinions with Griffiths that he never conveyed to American audiences, revealing surprising views on Andrew Johnson and Abraham Lincoln.</p>\n<ul><li>Born enslaved in Maryland in 1818, Douglass escaped to freedom in New York City when he was 20 years old.</li><li>He published his autobiography in 1845 and it became a massive success, particularly in Europe where the abolitionist cause had strong support.</li><li>He moved to Rochester, New York, two years later, where he founded his own abolitionist newspaper, <i>The North Star.</i></li></ul>\n<p>Following a common practice in 19th-century publishing, especially for news from abroad, Douglass printed more than 80 of Griffiths’ letters between 1855 and 1863 in his newspaper. In turn, Griffiths often gave Douglass’ letters to the <i>Leeds Mercury</i> to publish. With this knowledge, we scoured online databases and found eight remarkable letters Douglass sent to Griffiths and other English abolitionists. These have never been anthologized or even quoted by modern scholars; we reproduce them for the first time in our new volume, <i>Measuring the Man: The Writings of Frederick Douglass on Abraham Lincoln</i>. Leigh Fought, a historian at Le Moyne College and author of <i>Women in the World of Frederick Douglass</i>, calls it “thrilling,” in these letters, “to watch Douglass in real time as he critiques and reacts to Lincoln, vacillating between optimism and despair in dizzy frustration.”</p>\n<p>In 1849, Griffiths moved from England to Rochester, New York, to help on Douglass’ newspaper, the<i> North Star</i>, where the woman whom Douglass called “my industrious and vigilant friend and co-worker” became his office manager, copy editor and chief fundraiser. By day they worked together in the offices of the <i>North Star</i>; at night Griffiths lived in Douglass’ home with his wife and five children. Rumors circulated that Douglass and Griffiths were having an affair. In late 1852, she left the house—by some accounts, at the insistence of Douglass’ wife, Anna.</p>\n<h3>\n        <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1681066076?tag=smithsonianco-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\">\n          Measuring the Man: The Writings of Frederick Douglass on Abraham Lincoln\n        </a>\n      </h3>\n<p>The book sheds new light on the most critical period of American history and will transform the way we think about these two extraordinary leaders.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1681066076?tag=smithsonianco-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\"/></p>\n<p>Griffiths returned to England in 1855 and four years later married Henry O. Crofts, a Methodist minister. Douglass rarely returned to England, but the two remained close friends. In 1862, she wrote, “I wish I could fly over the water and have a consultation with you.” She continued to help fund his work.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/historians-rediscovered-frederick-douglass-letters-surprised-candid-opinions-abraham-lincoln-180987175/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Intimate and political, their correspondence tracks the founding of the United States, with Abigail advocating for the rights of American women. She famously urged John to “remember the ladies” and pressed for greater equality in the home, writing to her husband: “Remember all men would be tyrants if they could.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Harriet Jacobs</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Before her autobiography, <i>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl</i>, became famous, Jacobs, born into slavery in North Carolina in 1813, was known for eloquent letters to abolitionists and newspaper editors. One of her pen pals was the abolitionist Amy Post, with whom Jacobs discussed her work on the memoir: “Just now the poor book is in its chrysalis state and though I can never make it a butterfly I am satisfied to have it creep meekly among some of the humbler bugs.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Eleanor Roosevelt</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>A stateswoman in her own right, Roosevelt maintained consequential correspondences with politicians throughout her life—including several of her husband’s successors as president.

Photo: Phoebe d'Heurle</p><p>The Rape of the Sabine Women, an episode in which Rome’s legendary founders forcibly abducted brides from a nearby community, has been a popular subject in painting and sculpture since the Renaissance—so popular, in fact, that we may miss the brutality of the original myth. “There’s almost this sense of familiarity-blindness to these stories,” says American artist Jesse Mockrin, who depicts the Sabine drama from the perspective of the women themselves in her large-scale 2024 painting <i>The Descent</i>, one of more than 12 new works on view in a solo exhibition opening at Toronto’s Art Gallery of Ontario in September.</p><p>Riffing off 16th- and 17th-century Baroque artists like Caravaggio and Peter Paul Rubens, who brought new levels of technical virtuosity and theatrical flair to scenes from the Bible and mythology, Mockrin asks viewers to reconsider themes of sex, gender and violence that run through the Western canon. At the same time, she resists the contemporary cultural impulse to tear down statues and reject our past for its flaws. “I think the old masters were masters. … I feel like a fan to some extent,” she confesses. “I also feel like I can be critical of the messages inherent in those works, and conscious of trying to update them to a female perspective, in this moment.”</p><h4>Did You Know?

The 33-year-old Virginia statesman dashed off copies of the iconic text, but he included all the parts Congress had removed or changed—including a passage condemning the slave trade. He <a href=\"https://www.nypl.org/blog/2025/08/22/special-display-manuscript-copy-declaration-independence\">underlined</a> the omissions and adjustments, then sent his version to several friends.</p>\n    <p>Next year, as America celebrates its <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/americas-250th-anniversary-180986272/\">250th anniversary,</a> one of Jefferson’s handwritten copies of the Declaration of Independence will go on display at the New York Public Library. From July 1 to 3, 2026, visitors will get an opportunity to see the <a href=\"https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/34107de0-6a35-0139-ae70-0242ac110002?canvasIndex=0\">rare artifact</a><strong>. </strong>According to <a href=\"https://www.6sqft.com/nypl-to-display-rare-declaration-of-independence-draft-for-americas-250th-anniversary/\"> 6sqft</a>’s Aaron Ginsburg, the document is one of only four surviving copies of its kind.</p>\n    <h4>Quick fact: When did Thomas Jefferson start drafting the Declaration of Independence?</h4>\n    <p>The founding father began writing the document in <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration/how-did-it-happen\">June 1776</a> and turned in a draft three weeks later. </p>\n    <p>It will be on view at the library’s main branch, the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building, which will have extended hours to accommodate as many patrons as possible. Admission is free, but guests will need to get timed tickets to see the document; reservations are scheduled to open in June 2026.</p>\n    <p>“At this critical juncture in our nation’s history, libraries are well-positioned to help the public better understand where we stand, how we got here and the democratic ideals we are constantly striving for,” says Anthony W. Marx, president and CEO of the New York Public Library, in a <a href=\"https://www.nypl.org/press/new-york-public-library-announces-major-exhibition-americas-250th-birthday\">statement</a>.</p>\n    <p>Beyond the Declaration of Independence, the library also plans to mount a five-part exhibition spanning the past 250 years of our nation’s history. Starting next June, “<a href=\"https://www.nypl.org/events/exhibitions/revolution-1776-beyond-preview\">Revolution: 1776 and Beyond</a>” will fill the galleries of the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building with posters, founding documents, artworks, artifacts, protest ephemera, broadsides and more.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/5Y8UvdfRDyqrW2tTQZsb-R8HbJM=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(2584x1735:2585x1736)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/84/64/8464b16d-51e5-4f9e-8f7f-dc6088881c9d/sasb_2017_06_28_declaration_independence_-09182.jpg\" alt=\"Text document under glass display\"/>\n    <p>The exhibition will explore New York’s role in the early months of the American Revolution, as well as the ways the revolution affected different groups—from patriots and loyalists to women and enslaved individuals. Visitors are also invited to consider the role of protest in American history and learn about subsequent revolutions around the world.</p>\n    <p>Guests will be able to view contemporary pieces from artists like Jenny Holzer, Kara Walker and Kerry James Marshall that explore “enduring questions of liberty, land and citizenship,” according to the library. The exhibition will also include correspondence between <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/when-benjamin-franklin-shocked-himself-while-attempting-to-electrocute-a-turkey-180979094/\">Benjamin Franklin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/this-historic-portrait-of-george-washington-is-being-restored-to-its-former-glory-180985990/\">George Washington</a> as well as artifacts from recent decades, such as posters <a href=\"https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/24fc78e0-988f-0138-b354-7557849ba9de\">created</a> to raise awareness about the AIDS crisis in the 1980s.</p>\n    <p>In the meantime, visitors can explore the “<a href=\"https://www.nypl.org/spotlight/treasures\">Polonsky Exhibition</a>,” a permanent display of some of the library’s most prized possessions. Available online and in person, the show includes an original handwritten copy of the first draft of the Bill of Rights, George Washington’s handwritten <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/george-washingtons-farewell-to-the-nation-marked-the-birth-of-american-democracy-83232825/\">farewell address</a> and a portrait of Benjamin Franklin, among other artifacts.</p>\n    <p>Looking for other ways to celebrate America’s Semiquincentennial? Starting in March 2026, the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History will be rolling out new theater programs, hands-on demonstrations, tours, talks and other activities. Also opening next spring, the museum-wide exhibition—titled “<a href=\"https://americanhistory.si.edu/explore/projects/celebrate-the-nations-250th-in-2026\">In Pursuit of Life, Liberty and Happiness</a>”—will feature 250 objects from American history.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, the National Archives Museum has an exhibition called “<a href=\"https://visit.archives.gov/whats-on/explore-exhibits/opening-vault\">Opening the Vault</a>” featuring a rotating selection of artifacts linked to the moments and people that shaped the nation.</p>\n    <p>“Commemorations like the 250th are crucially important, because they give us a chance to … shine a light on history,” Smithsonian Secretary Lonnie G. Bunch III told <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/the-head-of-the-smithsonian-talks-about-americas-250th-why-experts-still-matter-and-what-to-expect-from-the-institution-in-2025-180985821/\"> Smithsonian magazine</a>’s Kayla Randall earlier this year. “My goal is that we should use the 250th as a time to bring people together through knowledge, through truth, through understanding.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>“</i>\n      <i>Revolution: 1776 and Beyond</i>\n      <i>” will be on view at the New York Public Library beginning in June 2026. </i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/see-thomas-jeffersons-handwritten-copy-of-the-declaration-of-independence-180987277/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Researchers have found fossil evidence of varied creatures wooing and mating, as they continue to search for the telltale signs of dinosaurs copulating</h2>\n<p><i>Acrocanthosaurus</i>perform a mating dance. Fossils indicating such a dance took place,</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/evidence-massive-dinosaur-mating-ritual-uncovered-colorado\">possibly by this species</a>, were</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/842097\">described in 2016</a>. Artwork by Lida Xing and Yujiang Han / University of Colorado Denver</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Earlier this summer, researchers announced they found fossils that likely come from courting dinosaurs.</li>\n      <li>To find more fossil evidence of prehistoric animals wooing and mating, scientists will have to keep their minds open.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>At a glance, the prehistoric potholes dotting the 100-million-year-old rock of Colorado’s Dinosaur Ridge might not look like much. The divots in the orange rock are rough and uneven, as if they were parts of the surface that had eroded away. Upon closer investigation, however, paleontologists found that these notches in the rock are a testament to the tender side of dinosaurs. The holes were made by courting dinosaurs as they tried to impress each other with how well they could scratch out a nest.</p>\n<p>The behavior of the dinosaurs was similar to that of some birds alive today. Old Dominion University paleontologist <a href=\"https://www.odu.edu/directory/caldwell-buntin\">Caldwell Buntin</a>, who studied the site, notes that dinosaurs related to carnivores like <i>Allosaurus</i> gathered at the spot to show off their nest-making skills. “During nest displays of piping plovers, a display nest is built by a male and when visited by a female will perform additional scrape displays that kick sediment around the nest,” Buntin says. Whether the scraped spots were actually used as nests or not is unclear, but they appear to have at least been an amorous demonstration.</p>\n<p>The dinosaur display arena was announced by experts <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0195667125000990\">earlier this summer</a>, the latest and largest such site uncovered since paleontologists first recognized traces created by courting dinosaurs <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep18952\">in 2016</a>. The dinosaur scrapes are far from the only signs of fossil courtship and mating paleontologists have uncovered. Even as the sex lives of some of our favorite fossil creatures <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/everything-you-want-know-about-sex-lives-dinosaurs-scratching-ground-battling-with-horns-173015/\">remain mysterious</a>, rare discoveries of prehistoric turtles that perished while mating, swarming insects preserved in amber and <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11727-y\">dancing footprints</a> of ancient birds demonstrate how some of the most intimate and fleeting moments in prehistoric life can be preserved in the fossil record.</p>\n<p>From the perspective of geologic time, all mating behaviors are brief affairs. Whether courtship and mating occur in a matter of seconds or days, the specific and endlessly varied mating behaviors of animals are a short part of their lives. The chances of two or more organisms perishing at the same moment, in a way that would be decipherable as mating behavior, and becoming preserved in the fossil record in a place they could be discovered by experts is incredibly small.</p>\n<p>Despite the odds, however, unusual and often catastrophic circumstances have delicately preserved animals in the act. More than 47 million years ago in what’s now Germany, pairs of the prehistoric turtle <i>Allaeochelys</i> were <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsbl.2012.0361\">in the middle of mating</a> when they unknowingly sank into toxic waters near the bottom of an ancient lake. The mating pairs died and were covered up by fine-grained sediment on a lake bottom so devoid of scavengers that the deceased turtles were undisturbed. <a href=\"https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/sharks-rays/ancient-shark-falcatus-falcatus\">A similar fate</a> met at least one courting pair of 325-million-year-old sharks called <i>Falcatus</i> when they were suddenly killed, perhaps when runoff from a nearby landmass caused oxygen levels to suddenly drop. Coupling in watery habitats came with unusual risks that sometimes preserved these ephemeral moments for millions upon millions of years.</p>\n<p>Some of the most extensive evidence of prehistoric courtship, however, is found among invertebrates. Accumulations of sea scorpions, known as eurypterids by paleontologists, suggest that the water-dwelling invertebrates gathered together on tidal flats to <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031018201002747\">molt, mate and lay their eggs</a> in the shallows. Away from the water, by contrast, <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-a-fragile-insect-living-100-million-years-ago-becomes-a-fossil-180986127/\">sticky tree resin</a> often covered up insects that were mating or gathering to do so, creating fossils of organisms that were otherwise too small to be preserved in layers of stone.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/from-dinosaur-scratches-to-insects-in-amber-how-paleontologists-uncover-prehistoric-courtship-180987244/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

His introduction of Franklin, a Black character added after Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination in 1968, may have cost him a few readers, but it helped heal a centuries-old fracture that still needs work. Schulz was heroic as well as empathetic. <i>—David Weinstock </i>| <i>Fairfax, California</i></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Loud Silence</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>“<a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/a-shared-fate-180986805/\">A Shared Fate</a>” (July/August 2025) is a stark reminder that humans need to continue to improve our environmental stewardship. On my morning walks, I am often haunted by the quiet stillness. The clouds of insects I remember as a child are gone. The scattered wildflowers in the roadside ditches rarely have bees buzzing around them. Yet in the air I often notice the scent of pesticides applied to the manicured lawns. We need to find new ways to achieve a balance between nature and aesthetics. <i>—Michael Aaron Gallagher </i>| <i>Syracuse</i></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>A Moment in Pamplona</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>“<a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/behind-scenes-running-bulls-ernest-hemingway-180986802/\">Exploring Hemingway’s Pamplona</a>” (July/August 2025) called to mind my visit along with two friends to the San Fermín festival in July 1959. One friend participated in the running of the bulls, arriving in the arena unscathed. I took eight-millimeter movies and was also able to capture several frames of Hemingway himself, who was a few feet from us as we sat at a table outside a restaurant in the plaza. I greatly enjoyed the article, which revived memories of an exciting time. <i>—John M. Stevenson </i>| <i>Gettysburg, Pennsylvania</i></p>\n    <p>Most of the feature articles in <i>Smithsonian</i> invoke in me a sense of “wish I were there,” but “Exploring Hemingway’s Pamplona” invoked the opposite of that. The whole piece was intent on glorifying the worst of humanity, from drunkenness, bloodlust and crowd-think excess to the torture of animals under the cloak of so-called tradition. I would pay a lot of money to avoid being anywhere near Pamplona during those nine days of hell. <i>—Charles H.

She hears the crack and snap of underbrush, such reckless abandon on careful feet. The deer leaves her as all things, people do, and she slides poles into grommets and feels a lonely stillness, knowing people don’t come back and that, she thinks, isn’t grief, but waiting. The taut tent takes her in, holds her safe from, and so close to, the godforsaken earth, even with the sleeping pad, she can feel its pull.<graphic src=\"http://100wordstory.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Leave-No-Trace-light-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Image of a deer running through the woods.\"/></p>\n    <p/>\n    <p>\n      <i>Photo Credit: LongitudeLatitude </i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://100wordstory.org/leave-no-trace/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I kept vigil the night Stan Broomfield died - waiting for the inevitable, knowing that I would have to tell Marge in the morning.\n\n</p>\n<p>\nNo one could ask for a finer human than Stan. He spoke with a soft, kind voice and always asked my opinion on matters of importance. Marge, who by that time had moved into the spare bedroom, never liked me. She spewed forth directives with an edge that would grate on anyone's auditory senses.\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nStan finally passed at 4:33 a.m. It would be hours before Marge awakened. I went to my room, dressed in an appropriately somber gray suit, and checked my mirror. How fortunate that I was among the first to be indistinguishable from humans - an Adam 2.0. Another stroke of luck occurred when Stan purchased me from GammaTec's website.\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nAround 8:30, my finely tuned hearing detected movement in Marge's bedroom. I approached her door and tapped lightly.\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\"Come in,\" she croaked. My appearance spoke more than words. \"So, the old bastard's finally cashed in his chips.\" Her eyes appraised me. \"Go shut yourself down. I'll deal with you later.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nI knew what that meant. Dressing casually in a flannel shirt, jeans, and light jacket, I walked out into the city and never looked back, disregarding my prime directive.\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nWhere could I go? In the three years since I came to live with the Broomfields, more recent models had made me effectively obsolete. Who would want me? The Keanu 4.5 was being touted as the ultimate companion, at least until supplanted by a newer version.\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nIf Marge reported me missing, the authorities might search for me, but I could easily pass for human. I needed solitude to process my situation. The nearly 1,000 acres of the mostly wooded City Park offered the desired refuge.\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nThough the temperature hovered in the upper twenties, I did not feel cold. Only a handful of humans hurried along the trails. I found a secluded spot in a thick grove of trees. My thoughts cycled back to the day I met the Broomfields.\n\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\n\"There,\" said a voice. \"He's alive.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nI opened my eyes and beheld a human for the first time. He had a kind face. I judged him to be in his early fifties.\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Hello,\" he said. \"My name is Stan Broomfield. You're going to live with us.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Thank you, Mr. Broomfield.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Call me Stan. We'll be pals.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Thank you, Stan.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Let's cut out all this </p>\n<p>. No need to be so formal.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Yes. Thank, uh... I mean, of course.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nHe spoke over his shoulder. \"What do you think, Marge?\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nShe twisted her face into a scowl. \"He'll do, I guess.\" Skepticism colored her words. \"He certainly looks human.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nStan smiled. \"And a handsome fellow he is. We'll call him Darwin. That's a fitting name. All the young girls will fall in love with him.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\"What young girls?\" Marge snarled. \"He's just going to help around the house, right?\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Sure, but he'll be more than a servant. It'll be like having another son.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I hope the hell he turns out better than Christopher.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nA sudden silence between them spoke volumes. Later, I learned their son had chafed under parental expectations and left home at eighteen.\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\"This is where we live,\" Stan said. \"Two stories, three bedrooms, and a small office. We're in midtown, only a few blocks from City Park. You may have one of the bedrooms. You'll be happy here.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nStan was right. I liked it, and I liked him. He took me on walks in City Park. We ran errands together. Along the way, we discussed an array of topics. We spent most mornings in his office, where he wrote about ancient Earth history. I often assisted, supplying scholarly information from my databanks. In our conversations, I began to appreciate many nuances that did not manifest in academic histories. He dedicated his next book: </p>\n<p>. A mysterious feeling, which I could not define, washed over me.\n\n\n</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/06/darwins-enouement-by-ken-wetherington.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I landed in the middle of a sweaty dance floor, jerking around to a song I didn't recognize. The dancing lights, pulsing music, and taste of tequila were familiar from a thousand clubs I'd landed in before, but the layout was unfamiliar enough to convince me I was somewhere new. Three girls danced around me, a flash of sequins and limbs and smiles with eyes half-closed. I couldn't recognize any of them. How long had it been?\n</p>\n<p>The music pounded so loud it felt like I couldn't breathe. It was always too much to cope with on arrival. I had to find somewhere quiet, somewhere to think, focus, not sink into the floor.\n</p>\n<p>\"I have to pee!\" I blurted out. A short girl with straight black bangs and a silver dress nodded enthusiastically, while a freckled red-head's phone lit up a half-smile.\n</p>\n<p>They were too far gone to care what I did. I'd probably never even get their names. I pulled away and walked through the maze of sweaty dancers and frazzled busboys, keeping my eyes peeled for a bathroom sign, getting progressively stickier as syrupy drinks in plastic cups carelessly splashed me. I squeezed between the bodies of newfound lovers and arguing drunks, until I saw the bathroom door glowing like a beacon of privacy. I stepped inside and positioned myself in front of the mirror to look at Andrea and piece together who she'd become.\n</p>\n<p>It was difficult to trace the passage of time on her face. Sometimes a month would take as much toll on her as a year could, and her make up was coated on thick enough to hide the evidence. Her hair was shorter, and there was just a tiny scar where her nose ring had been. No new tattoos, at least no noticeable ones. Her waist was a bit rounder, but not by much. An acquaintance wouldn't have noticed. French manicure on her fingertips; that was new, too. Last time her nails had been covered in chipped gold polish. She was wearing a simple black dress, the kind that only counts as a clubbing dress when you're in a club. That, combined with the flats on her feet, hinted that Andrea didn't spend much time in clubs anymore. Which, good for her.\n</p>\n<p>She was still very recognizable, though. Maybe not as much time had passed as I'd initially thought.\n</p>\n<p>One of the stall doors swung open. I froze. Interacting with humans was not something I was good at, despite many hours of practice. I watched in the mirror as the bathroom stall opened and recognized Andrea's friend, Carolyn.\n</p>\n<p>She hiccuped, and squinted when our eyes met in the mirror. Heavy black eyeliner was smudged under her eyes, and a strap of her slinky blue metallic dress fell carelessly over her shoulder. Almost like...\n</p>\n<p>. \n</p>\n<p>We stood there, caught, until I heard my name tentatively cross her lips. \"Princess Ariel?\"\n</p>\n<p>. \n</p>\n<p>I spun around and felt Andrea's lips crack open into a grin. \"Charlie? For real?\"\n</p>\n<p>\"Holy shit! I can't believe it! It's been </p>\n<p> How have you been?\" Charlie stumbled over and draped Carolyn's arm around me. His breath smelled of vodka and cigarettes.\n</p>\n<p>\"Years? Really?\" Carolyn looked pretty much the same, except maybe a few creases on her face. But those always came out when she was worried or thinking, which was most of the time. \n</p>\n<p>Charlie peered into the mirror and fixed the smudged eyeliner. \"I'd say so, probably. When was the last time you came out? Was it Cancun?\"\n</p>\n<p>\"With you guys, yeah. It happened once at Andrea's staff party, but that was just awkward. When I landed, I was crying in a corner, and everyone just kept bringing me water and asking me to lie down. No fun.\"\n</p>\n<p>He splashed water on Carolyn's face. \"At the bank?\"\n</p>\n<p>\"No, that weird call centre. I think they were selling heated blankets or something.\"\n</p>\n<p>\"Oh, yeah, that was a while ago.\"\n</p>\n<p>\"She's changed jobs?\" I shook my head. \"Goes to show how much we miss, when we're trapped up there...\"\n</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/06/old-friends-by-nikita-eaton-lusignan.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

His mother, Laurie Pacsai, also 21, thought her son was perfect. But Kevin’s heart had started to fail in his second week of life, and he had barely survived an episode of shock. His heart was structurally normal, but its conduction system seemed to be misfiring. Earlier that day, March 11, 1981, he had been transferred to the world-renowned hospital, known as SickKids.<br/>Youngsters came from all over the globe to the imposing brick building, where doctors had invented techniques that revolutionized pediatric heart surgery.

Most of the deaths had happened overnight, when one of the eight nursing teams, headed by Phyllis Trayner, was on duty.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>Mary Oliver is one of the most beloved and reviled poets in the English language. While legions of readers find her work uniquely legible and inspirational, fellow poets tend to dismiss it as shallow and sentimental. Maggie Millner, a poet herself, examines this reputational dichotomy and finds revelation in Oliver’s relationship with shame:</p><blockquote><p>Oliver’s detractors, pro- and anti-lyric alike, show all the classic symptoms of this sort of shame: a discomfort with her work’s digestibility, earnestness, and apparent disinterest in other people—and a fear about what the popularity of such work might say about</p><i>them</i>. Her commercial success alone seems to imply her complicity in American capitalism; could a true devotee of observation and stillness—someone aspiring to be the “tiniest nail in the house of the universe”—really have churned out such a large and lucrative corpus? And why did she seem not to know about modernism?<p>It was easy to detect shame in the contempt of Oliver’s critics, but it hadn’t occurred to me to diagnose it in the author herself: such a distinctly social emotion seemed unlikely to have inspired so many poems about the nonhuman world. Yet as I revisited her work, what struck me again and again was the tinge of social difference that suffuses her best poetry. Oliver’s own childhood was intensely lonely, marred by abuse and neglect that she referred to in interviews but treated only obliquely in her poems. It was this early trauma, she said, that first sent her both out of doors and into books. “Oh, I wanted // to be easy / in the peopled kingdoms, / to take my place there, / but there was none // that I could find / shaped like me,” she writes in a poem I love called “Trilliums.” Her more boring poems might pretend to a state of prelapsarian innocence, but the most vivid ones unfold in the fallen world inhabited by this highly self-conscious speaker, who is dogged by feelings of shame and unbelonging. As Oliver writes in “The Moths”: “I was always running around, looking / at this and that. // If I stopped / the pain / was unbearable.” What my favorite Oliver poems seem to dramatize, I realized gradually, is not a successful defection from human society but a deeply moving failure to leave it.</p></blockquote><h2>More picks about poetry</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/05/22/stuff-hoarding-maximalism/\">Maximalisma</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“A professor endeavors to separate treasure from trash—before her children have to do it for her.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/05/20/in-defense-of-despair/\">In Defense of Despair</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“The feeling is most commonly framed as an end point, a level of despondency that cannot be overcome.

Viola Zhou examines the complicated relationship between her mother, who struggles with complications from chronic kidney disease, and DeepSeek, one of China’s most popular AI chatbots, from which she seeks medical guidance and comfort. Zhou’s reporting does essential work here, tempering industry hype around the medical expertise of large language models. But it’s her close study of her mother—her isolation and uncertainty, her desire for support and resolution—that cinches this moving feature.</p><blockquote><p>For patients like my mom, who feel they don’t get the time or care they need from their health care systems, these chatbots have become a trusted alternative.

For the sick, the<a href=\"\">anxious</a>, the<a href=\"\">isolated</a>, and many other vulnerable people who may lack medical resources and attention, AI’s vast knowledge base, coupled with its affirming and empathetic tone, can make the bots feel like wise and comforting partners. Unlike spouses, children, friends, or neighbors, chatbots are always available. They always respond.<p>Entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and even some doctors are now pitching AI as a salve for overburdened health care systems and a stand-in for absent or exhausted caregivers. Ethicists, clinicians, and researchers are meanwhile warning of the risks in outsourcing care to machines. After all, hallucinations and biases in AI systems are prevalent. Lives could be at stake.</p><p>Over the course of months, my mom became increasingly smitten with her new AI doctor. “DeepSeek is more humane,” my mother told me in May. “Doctors are more like machines.”</p></blockquote><h2>More picks about artificial intelligence</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/07/08/my-couples-retreat-with-3-ai-chatbots-and-the-humans-who-love-them/\">My Couples Retreat With 3 AI Chatbots and the Humans Who Love Them</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“I found people in serious relationships with AI partners and planned a weekend getaway for them at a remote Airbnb.

For <i>5280 Magazine</i>, Heather Hansman reports on how a day trip went horribly wrong, turning into the “largest search for a missing hiker in Colorado history,” and why it took nearly two decades to solve the mystery.</p><blockquote><p>It’s not uncommon for hikers to run into trouble on Holy Cross. Vail Mountain Rescue responds to about 15 individuals or groups there each year. Scott Beebe, a longtime member of the team, says hikers tend to get confused near the summit. Instead of taking the correct route to the North Ridge trail, which looks steep from the top, they can mistakenly head down mellower-looking paths that actually dead-end above cliffs. The searchers traced these and many other routes, looking for Vanek, to no avail. A few days in, snow began to fall. By the eighth, when rescuers were trudging through two feet of powder, the search was called off. Everyone was baffled. “We ended up the last day with not a clue, not a gum wrapper, not a boot print, absolutely nothing,” wrote searcher Tim Cochrane in his report to the sheriff. “How can anyone just vanish into thin air?”</p></blockquote><h2>\n\t\t\t\t\tMore picks from <i>5280 Magazine</i>\n\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2023/11/30/did-bad-fire-science-send-tim-and-deb-nicholls-to-prison/\">Did Bad Fire Science Send Tim and Deb Nicholls to Prison?</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“When he opens the bedroom window, there’s smoke billowing past his head.

To make cochineal pigment, brush plump, wingless females that have just made a waxy cocoon into bags and kill them by immersion in scalding water; exposure to steam, sunlight, or the heat of an oven; or rolling them on a wooden board without popping. If needed, leave their bodies to dry in the sun, then pulverize the dead bugs, and combine the powder with liquid. Seventy thousand female nocheztli make one pound of cochineal; harvesting the insects is tedious.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Marketers don’t want so much to capture the shriek of animals who give products their hue, but rather to capture the attention and appetites of consumers. Red insect pigment, also known as E-120 or Natural Red 4, is still used to color drinks, food, and makeup, especially those branded as having “natural ingredients.” In 2012, Starbucks stopped using cochineal in drinks such as its Strawberries &amp; Crème Frappuccino after consumers protested.</p></blockquote><h2>More picks on color</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2024/12/10/maya-blue-the-mystery-dye-recreated-two-centuries-after-it-was-lost/\">‘Maya Blue’: The Mystery Dye Recreated Two Centuries After It Was Lost</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“A ceramicist in Mexico retraces his Maya roots to recreate a long-lost pre-Hispanic pigment for the first time in more than two centuries.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2023/11/28/tyrian-purple-the-lost-ancient-pigment-that-was-more-valuable-than-gold/\">Tyrian Purple: The Lost Ancient Pigment That Was More Valuable Than Gold</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“For millennia, Tyrian purple was the most valuable colour on the planet….

Doubtless during my withdrawal you laid plans to snare me again, to draw me against my will into a plot for my own happiness.”</p>\n<p>“Harshly said, sir,” said the Overseer of Planning, “but essentially correct. We have found a young lady with whom we feel you will establish a more-than-satisfactory rapport, and taken measures to ensure that you shall not avoid her.”</p>\n<h3>Host Commentary</h3>\n<p>I love Serah’s cheerful subversion of the <i>Princess Bride</i>-style narrative in a narrative here. I also love how the story shifts the closer you get to it. This is a story about self-actualisation, and it’s entirely up to you who’s self is being actualised. It’s fractals all the way down, a story being told about a story being told that may be a story designed to enhance the life of the protagonist. Author and narrator, protagonist and creator. A spectrum of stories arcing out across the stars, and doing so in a manner that plays the hits on a delightful new set of instruments. </p>\n<p>I always struggle with what I love the most about this one. I think it’s the perfectly executed ‘Oh no I appear to have been the bad guy all along’ moment, and the way that leads to the one thing anyone in power who deserves it should do. Namely, remove the systems that got them there as fast as possible. I’m a Brit, and if you don’t think the class system is still rife here I’ve got an island to sell you, guvnor.</p>\n<p>But delightful as that is, I think my real favourite element of this one is that this is one of those stories that start as a prison and end as a key. No characters, only creators, as freedom, class, gender and species all become things we can define and tune, bringing the exact nature of ourselves into sharp relief. We choose our own genre. Like Serah says in the opening, ‘We make our own stage. The audience is waiting.’ In this hellscape time period, that feels like a reassuring note from a cool relative. Make your own stage.

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 989: Holding Patterns</h2>\n<h3>Holding Patterns</h3>\n<p>I dream about the trees sometimes. I think we all do, even though none of my generation were alive when the forest was actually growing. We don’t dream about them the way they are now—stunted and dormant—but the way they were when the first colonists arrived here on Ariadne: pale smooth trunks growing straight and true, latticed with ropy, red-leafed vines that cradled the heavy fruit dangling off the branches. The canopy towering dozens of meters overhead, everything quiet and lush and smelling of damp. People say that back then, you could watch the trees growing in real time, budding branches and unfurling leaves. Even in the vids and holos they show us in school, the trees look so sturdy, so real—so <i>permanent—</i>that you could forgive someone for believing that they’d grow forever.</p>\n<p>But the trees here want something we can’t give them—some murmur of information, an arboreal greeting, the plant equivalent of a rough hug and a shouted<i> Hello! Good to see you! </i>They’re waiting for something that will never happen.</p>\n<p>Just like us.</p>\n<p>Xander and I are knitting by the glow of the solar lamps in the south hall. Only the first moon has risen; the second one—the brighter one—won’t make an appearance until long after we’ve gone to bed, which means we’re stuck in gray dimness all evening. My back and neck ache; my hands are chapped. The yarn, made from the fibrous tufts that sprout from the top of pearl-grass, is rough against our fingers, and it constantly threatens to unravel.</p>\n<p>So far, I’ve darned five pairs of socks, reinforced the elbows in two sweaters, and started on a sleep sack for a baby in Hab Three, and still I’m only halfway through my chore list. Sometimes, on nights like this, it feels like I’ve always been knitting. Like I’ll never stumble back to the apartment I share with my dad, like the morning will never come. If it weren’t for Xander—slouching sideways, one long leg flung over the arm of his chair—I’m not sure I could stand it.</p>\n<p>Then, abruptly, he says, “Hey Leslie. What if I told you that I can get us into the dome?”</p>\n<p>I glance around, but as usual, we’re the only ones here. There aren’t many places in our hab where you can truly be alone, but nearly everyone avoids the south hall, especially between the first and second moonrise. It’s darker than the other halls even on a sunny day, since its windows are blocked by the dome covering the nearby trees, and the solar lamps seem to cast more shadows than light. Xander and I don’t care; we knit by feel, not by sight, and we value privacy more than anything. Still, he should know better than to say something like that without at least checking for eavesdroppers.</p>\n<p>“Did you hear me? I can get us in,” he repeats. He’s already done with his tasks for the night, of course; now he’s just playing, his needles spitting out scarf after scarf, each one longer and more elaborate than the one before. Knitting was my chore before he was assigned to it as well, and it annoys me that he took to it so easily.</p>\n<p>“I heard you,” I whisper. “Be quiet.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/04/17/escape-pod-989-holding-patterns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In form, it was like a man. With two legs meant for bipedal ambulation and two arms with three-fingered hands meant for grasping. Although roughly, from the thickness of its fingers. The design of the machine differed most strikingly from the ideal human in the shape of its head and body, for it had no neck. Rather, a barrel-shaped torso attached directly to a head that was meant to be enclosed within the thick, vaguely egg-shaped glass dome sitting next to the machine.</p>\n<p>The front piece of the barrel-shaped body was also set aside on a nearby table, exposing its chassis and internal mechanism. Peering inside, it became clear that filling the hole within this hollow man was the singular aim of much of the work I’d been doing for years.</p>\n<p>“I call him Talos.” The professor’s voice cut into the silence that enveloped the lab after I’d spent nearly a half hour silently examining the machine upon entering.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s time you speak plainly to me about the nature of this work,” I responded, rather than allowing him to hook me on the bait of working out the genesis of the device’s name. I knew my classics as well as any man, but I was well tired of games.</p>\n<p>“You must pardon me. Some habits are hard to break, but of course you are right. Nearly forty years ago, the son of a once-prosperous family with extensive shipping interests in the Aegean discovered an ancient shipwreck off the coast of Lemnos. Rather than alert proper authorities, he smuggled the entire collection of salvaged artifacts back to his family’s estate.” The professor reached into his pocket and pulled out a gold coin.</p>\n<p>“I’ve long suspected that hidden from our sight in unrecorded histories and the ashes of Alexandria, there lay technologies possessed by ancient man only hinted at in the myths and legends left in their wake. The automatons of Hephaestus, the construction of Pandora, and the wonders of Atlantis. When the once-prosperous family’s fortunes turned, items like this began to appear in circulation,” he said, placing the gold coin in my hand. “I deduced a cache of heretofore unknown treasures from the ancient world had surfaced and bent my mind toward obtaining them.</p>\n<p>“I traced the collection to Newport using a simple geometric analysis and frequency chart of the items as they surfaced. It was there I first adopted the guise of Mr. Ochi to aid in my investigation.” For an instant, I recognized the visage of the old reliable butler return in the professor’s expression, and it struck me then how dearly the absence of the man who never was had affected me.</p>\n<p>“Once in Newport, I made it known that I was an agent acting on behalf of a gentleman looking to acquire artifacts and that price was no concern. I paid a dear rate for the cache of silver and gold I acquired, but the real treasure, the crust-encased pieces of this automaton, were tossed into the deal for next to nothing.”</p>\n<p>“What you see before you is a re-creation and extrapolation of Talos’ intended form. Most of the original was beyond salvage, but enough components survived for a thorough analysis of the materials and to gain insight into the original design. I was able to identify and decipher the method by which his ancient builders set carved rods of quartz, tourmaline, topaz, and amber crystals within ingenious configurations to absorb, generate and store electrical charges. I also discovered, or I should say rediscovered, the curious alloy much of Talos is built from the fabled metal lost with Atlantis, aurichalcum—a metal most magnificent, with properties that not only conduct but amplify electric, magnetic, and gravitic energies.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/04/10/escape-pod-988-in-the-palace-of-science-part-2-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The first is that I have passed my greatest test as a man and, in doing so, have passed from this world. The second is that if this message entombed with me survives, a grave danger to humanity most assuredly survives with it.</i></p>\n<p><i>To my listener, I urge you to lift the needle from the gramophone, return this plate to the hole where you found it, and dig no further into the ruins where once stood Professor Thomas Washington Kelly’s Palace of Science.</i></p>\n<p><i>However, as with most of those driven to dig beneath the surface to uncover the hidden past, I expect your curiosity to exceed your wisdom. Therefore, assuming that a simple warning will not suffice to turn you away from disaster, I engrave my last testament with a diamond-tipped stylus into this fantastic metal so that my warning might endure. I pray it is sufficient to convince whoever comes upon it to succeed where I failed and bury my story and the danger that sleeps with me deep enough that our shared grave will never be disturbed again.</i></p>\n<p><i>As these will be my final words, I’ll tell the story as I wish and start not where it began, for where it began is shrouded by the mists of time and far beyond the ken of man. No, I will start with the small part I played in the events, with a meeting or, to be precise, a series of meetings.</i></p>\n<p/><p/><p>Track Two–</p>\n<p/><p>I first met the Professor through a letter of introduction handed to me by his manservant, the genial Mr. Ochi. As a fellow Black man, Mr. Ochi dressed with enough flair and style to catch my attention regardless of circumstance. A crisp black jacket that looked like it could be fresh from Savile Row and a pair of equally fine yet mismatched gray pants that marked him as a servant, although clearly one of an incredibly wealthy household.</p>\n<p>Despite his sartorial splendor, the fact that he was directed to my desk at the Electro-Dynamic Light Company of New York by the company’s owner, Mr. Sawyer, is why I believed the letter was genuine and not a fanciful distraction from some bored dilettante pretending to be the reclusive genius.</p>\n<p>Like most men of science in my era, what I’d heard of the professor was only in passing and often contradictory. On the rare occasion that his name, Thomas Washington Kelly, was spoken, it was with the grave intonations one associated more with a whispered prayer than a name. If it wasn’t for the fabulous riches the professor accrued as the silent partner for more patents than even Edison held, I might have written off his existence entirely. Due to his almost ephemeral nature, many presumed he was more of a semi-mythic muse to the sciences than a man in flesh, some aspect of a researcher’s anima invoked for inspiration. Others suggested he was the nom de guerre assumed by a conspiracy of scientists whose secretive motives could only be guessed at, for how could a single man have attained so much knowledge across the breadth of fields he was accounted to be an expert in? Among the elite practitioners of our noble calling, however, there was no doubt that he was indeed a living man whose insight and intelligence rivaled the greatest minds of previous generations, with abilities perhaps even surpassing Newton and Archimedes.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/04/03/escape-pod-987-in-the-palace-of-science-part-1-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 986: Lyra, From Many Angles</h2>\n<h3>Lyra, From Many Angles</h3>\n<p>When they came, it was in a craft the size of a golf ball. Smooth and round and perfectly seamless, it cut open the night sky in a pale streak. For a scant second it struck a fiery blemish across the moon’s face, catching the attention of forty-four children, twelve adults and a bewildered flock of geese before boring a meter-wide crater into a dry lakebed in northern Mexico.</p>\n<p>The explosive technicians were the first to the scene. Then came counter-bioterrorism, lumbering in prophylactic spacesuits prophetic of their evolution into the Global Office of Extraterrestrial Affairs. Soon after came the Agencia Espacial Mexicana, the Northern Hemispheric Space Association, what remained of the UN, then a dozen other acronyms, most of which would dissolve before the year was out. The confused tangle of letters amassed around the crater, investigated, argued, agreed, backstabbed, and then finally excavated the little craft only to bury it in a bunker in Corpus Christi. There it stayed the worst kept secret on Earth for nearly fifty years.</p>\n<p/><p>Like all grand leaps in human history, first contact was actually a tedious series of small, blind steps, each in a different direction and each of unknown significance. After nearly a decade of excruciating international deliberation, of buffering their facilities against xenotoxic substances, gathering neutralizing agents and steeling the planet for the worst, the conglomerate of acronyms finally opened the craft.</p>\n<p>A hundred translucent sheets of alloys were peeled away, paper-thin and remarkably tough. With the heart of the spaceship unwrapped, a semi-viscous fluid was pipetted and plated. Darkfield microscopy revealed a dense, motile population of helical microorganisms.</p>\n<p>“It’s syphilis,” the surgeon general said upon receiving the report. “It’s goddamn space syphilis.”</p>\n<p>Modern textbooks omit her commentary, but they describe in great detail the reactions from other figureheads when rumors of a hostile extraterrestrial bacteria, inevitably, spread. Accusatory fingers were pointed across continents; calls to arms and quarantines abounded. Some countries preemptively capitulated to Earth’s new tiny overlords, but others were bent on destroying the invaders before the pestilent takeover. Shortly after one pro-Earthling faction forgot to carry the 0 and accidentally set off enough Joules to sink a quarter of Long Island into the sea, it was discovered that the syphilis from space was not nearly as virulent as its reputation.</p>\n<p>The creatures were nothing like their terrestrial counterparts. Their cell walls were devoid of recognizable glycoproteins or markers. They defied taxonomy. Germicides passed over them like water, heat failed to lyse them. A thousand animal experiments revealed no pathogenesis. Bacteriophages introduced to the spirochetes were found disassembled and arranged in oddly complex structures at the periphery of their nutrient baths.</p>\n<p>The biochemists surrendered. They stored 500 mL of the specimens at -80°C and let the rest grow in a comfortable lysogeny broth, waiting for something apocalyptic to happen.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, every public figure carries a sample of the spirochetes somewhere on their person. Dignitaries keep a dish nearby when visiting a new hemisphere, doctors and biostatisticians stash envelopes of powdered aliens in their pockets when they navigate epidemics. Vials of it can be found around the necks of policymakers and at-risk neonates.</p>\n<p>The Global Office of Extraterrestrial Affairs gives Lyra a little bag of the stuff—the same kind she vividly remembers using to carry a goldfish home from the fair. She cradles the organism as she had the fish, grip tightened with both joy and terror. That little bag will be the only thing that will accompany her when she leaves the planet.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/03/27/escape-pod-986-lyra-from-many-angles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

According to Joslin, Temporary Deputy Superintendent Ray McPadden of the National Park Service (NPS) told them that they had “[failed] to demonstrate acceptable conduct” after they hung the Trans Pride flag on the face of the granite monolith El Capitan.</p>\n    <p>“The messages my termination send out to the public is that if you have an identity that has been turned into a ‘ideology’ not in line with the current administration, your rights will be different than other Americans that fall into the ‘ideal standard’ for who and what a person should be, look like, and believe in,” Joslin told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. </p>\n    <p>An NPS spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic </i>in a statement that the agency is “pursuing administrative action against multiple employees for failing to follow National Park Service regulations.” They declined to comment on the specifics of Joslin’s case.</p>\n    <p>“We want to emphasize that we take the protection of the park’s resources and the experience of our visitors very seriously, and will not tolerate violations of laws and regulations that impact those resources and experiences,” the spokesperson said, alleging that “several unauthorized demonstrations involving El Capitan” last year had drawn complaints from visitors.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/sj-with-flag-1-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Joslin stated that they displayed the flag for about two hours on May 20 during their off-duty hours, and noted that Yosemite regulations did not ban the hanging of flags at the time. The following day, however, the NPS appears to have updated the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/management/upload/yose-compendium.pdf\">park’s rules</a> to prohibit the display of “any banner, flag, or sign larger than fifteen square feet” on any natural or cultural features without a permit, citing the need to “provide for an unimpaired visitor experience” and “protect natural and cultural resources.”</p>\n    <p>While the new version of the compendium with the ban is dated May 20, the signature from the park’s acting superintendent, Raymond McPadden, is dated May 21, 2025. Previous versions of the compendium, accessed by <i>Hyperallergic</i> via the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250227002244/https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/management/upload/yose-compendium.pdf\">Wayback Machine,</a> did not mention flags or banners. </p>\n    <p>Hanging flags on the famous vertical wall of El Capitan is a tradition that many climbers have long participated in.

Don’t make the mistake of taking your own vacation from art just yet — there’s still plenty to see. For starters, visit CLAMP’s showcase of James Bidgood’s homoerotic photographs from the 1960s, a phantasmagoria of mythological cosplay closing this weekend. An exhibition of Beauford Delaney’s drawings at the Drawing Center is another must-see, as it focuses on the importance of this medium in the artist’s practice, and Sandra Poulson’s work, currently at MoMA PS1, is a fascinating take on the political life of domestic symbols and objects. Meanwhile, a quick trip to Greenwich, Connecticut, will lead you to the Bruce Museum, where Jeremy Frey’s stunning basketry awaits.

The pointed triangular artifacts are too narrow to have been “fitted to anything other than arrow-like shafts,” according to a new study published in the journal <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328390#\"> PLOS One</a>.</p>\n    <p>The rock shelter site, called Obi-Rakhmat, is located in the foothills of the Tian Shan Mountains in northeastern Uzbekistan. Since the 1960s, archaeologists have conducted several excavations there, unearthing a trove of stone tools. These items included wide and thin blades, small “bladelets,” and triangular points called “microliths.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/birx1tl9QYt3YtPqlchDQfDoGDY=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(960x549:961x550)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/30/f4/30f4100a-d61c-45ed-8818-f0819efb3875/journalpone0328390g001.jpeg\" alt=\"map\"/>\n    <p>During previous excavations, researchers overlooked the microliths because they were broken. But as co-author <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hugues-Plisson\">Hugues Plisson</a>, an archaeologist at France’s University of Bordeaux, tells <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/80-000-year-old-stones-in-uzbekistan-may-be-the-worlds-oldest-arrowheads-and-they-might-have-been-made-by-neanderthals\"> Live Science</a>’s Charles Q. Choi, the microliths are damaged in a manner that’s consistent with other used arrowheads.</p>\n    <p>If the researchers’ hunch is correct, the artifacts would be the oldest known arrowheads in the world. They’re about 6,000 years older than the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/science/early-humans-arrowheads-volcano.html\">74,000-year-old</a> arrowheads found in Ethiopia in 2002. That site was occupied by early humans who were sophisticated hunter-gatherers, according to a study published in the journal <i>Nature</i><i> </i>last year.</p>\n    <p>However, scientists don’t know who made the stone tools at Obi-Rakhmat—<a href=\"https://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/homo-sapiens\"> Homo sapiens</a>, </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/homo-neanderthalensis\">Neanderthals</a>or another group. In</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18486185/\">2003</a>, pieces of a child’s skull and teeth were found at the site, and while the teeth looked like they may have belonged to Neanderthals, the skull was more difficult to place, “[preventing] a definitive attribution,” per the new study.</p>\n    <h4>Quick fact: When did the Neanderthals live?</h4>\n    <p><a href=\"https://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/homo-neanderthalensis\">Neanderthals</a> inhabited present-day Europe and Central Asia from roughly 400,000 to 40,000 years ago.</p>\n    <p>When the microliths were made, Uzbekistan was inhabited primarily by Neanderthals. But while Neanderthals did create <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Neanderthal\">tools</a> like <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/a-little-boy-found-a-strange-stone-on-the-beach-archaeologists-told-him-it-was-a-neanderthals-hand-ax-180985578/\">hand axes</a>, they aren’t generally associated with “small projectile heads,” according to the study. As such, the authors think the Obi-Rakhmat microliths were more likely made by early humans.</p>\n    <p>“The appearance of the Obi-Rakhmat population in Central Asia coincides with the presumed time of the dispersal of anatomically modern humans in Eurasia,” co-author <a href=\"https://archaeology.nsc.ru/en/staff/andrey-i-krivoshapkin/\">Andrey Krivoshapkin</a>, a historian at the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of the Russian Academy of Sciences, tells <i>Live Science</i>, adding that these humans may have migrated from the Middle East.</p>\n    <p>Hunting was vital for both Neanderthals and <i>Homo sapiens</i>. “In turning to animals for sustenance, the <i>Homo</i> lineage hit on a winning strategy, one that would help fuel its rise to world domination,” wrote <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-hunting-made-us-human/\"> Scientific American</a>’s Kate Wong in 2014.

Meanwhile,</p>\n    <p><i>Homo sapiens</i>adapted increasingly advanced hunting tools over time, such as</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://australian.museum/learn/science/human-evolution/complex-technology/\">small-headed arrows, barbed spears and sickles</a>.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/YA2jCcmye7uNKmMnPZqeS0vbeiw=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(1125x793:1126x794)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/9c/e4/9ce434b8-65d0-4def-8c67-cfcd13fb3c44/journalpone0328390g007.jpeg\" alt=\"broken\"/>\n    <p>Upon migrating to Obi-Rakhmat, early humans may have had to compete for food with the Neanderthals already living there, Krivoshapkin explains to <i>Live Science</i>.

For years, scientists thought Sumatran rhinos had disappeared entirely from Way Kambas National Park, because they hadn’t found a single bit of evidence to suggest the creatures were still living there.</p>\n<p>Of all the rhino species alive today, the Sumatran rhino is the one that’s <a href=\"https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/sumatran-rhino\">most closely related</a> to the extinct <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/miners-unearth-a-mummified-woolly-rhino-in-siberia-with-an-intact-horn-and-soft-tissue-180984982/\">woolly rhinoceros</a>.</p>\n<p>They tried everything to find any remaining rhinos, including deploying camera traps, drones and human rangers to look for them. Then, they decided to try one last method—sniffer dogs—just to be sure.</p>\n<p>For the project, conservationists turned to Working Dogs for Conservation, a Montana-based nonprofit that trains and deploys canines to help protect wildlife and wild ecosystems. The collaborative effort on the Indonesian island of Sumatra also involved the International Rhino Foundation, Yayasan Badak Indonesia and the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry.</p>\n<p>Working Dogs for Conservation decided Yagi and Quinn were up for the task. Yagi is a male black labrador retriever who came to the organization for a career change: He had trained to be a service dog, but his “boundless energy and big personality didn’t quite match the job,” according to <a href=\"https://www.wd4c.org/our-dogs\">the nonprofit</a>. Quinn is a female cocker spaniel who has been sniffer-training since she was a puppy.</p>\n<p>The two dogs, along with their human handlers, traveled more than 8,000 miles to the southern part of Sumatra for their mission, according to an email Working Dogs for Conservation sent to supporters this week.</p>\n<p>Building upon months of earlier scent-detection training, the dogs first learned how to identify their target species by sniffing poo from the ten captive rhinos at the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary, located inside the national park. The dogs trained using scat from males, females and juveniles.</p>\n<p>Then, they headed out into the field to get acclimated to their new environment.</p>\n<p>“The jungle was a whole new world for them: dense foliage and new plants, thick humid air, unfamiliar wildlife and countless new sounds and smells,” according to the email from Working Dogs for Conservation. “Daily routines included jungle walks full of novel scents [and] watching local macaques swing by in the evenings.”</p>\n<p>Once the dogs were ready, they officially started sniffing, taking lots of breaks to cool off and stay hydrated. On just his second day of searching, Yagi found a pile of what appeared to be rhino scat on the ground. Later that same day, Quinn showed a behavior change that suggested a rhino had been in the area.</p>\n<p>Scientists performed preliminary DNA testing on the scat, which indicated it belonged to a Sumatran rhino. To be absolutely certain, the Indonesian government is running two more tests, which are underway now.</p>\n<p>“Quite honestly, in my opinion, I trust the dogs,” says Nina Fascione, executive director of the International Rhino Foundation, to <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2025/08/sniffer-dogs-may-have-rediscovered-a-lost-population-of-sumatran-rhinos/\"> Mongabay</a>’s Jeremy Hance. “The dogs were trained on rhino’s scat. They found what everybody believes is rhino’s scat. We think it’s really good news.”</p>\n<p>If Yagi and Quinn’s noses are right, that means at least one Sumatran rhino is roaming around inside the park. That may not seem like a big deal, but even the discovery of a single animal could be a boon for the species. If they’re able to find it, scientists would likely capture the creature and use it to provide much-needed genetic diversity to the captive, breeding rhinos at the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/two-sniffer-dogs-might-have-just-found-a-lost-population-of-critically-endangered-rhinos-180987279/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Indigenous peoples across the continent relied on the animals for food, clothing and income. But by the late 1800s, the bison had been hunted to near-extinction, with long-lasting impacts on many <a href=\"https://news.emory.edu/stories/2023/08/esc_bison_impact_24-08-2023/story.html\">Indigenous communities</a> and the landscape.</p>\n    <p>Conservation efforts have since <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/when-bison-return-will-their-habitat-rebound-180977898/\">strived to restore bison populations</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/nature/bison.htm\">about 5,000</a> of the animals currently call Yellowstone National Park home. Now, a new study underscores just how important these large mammals can be for maintaining a healthy and heterogeneous ecosystem.</p>\n    <p>Researchers looked at the impacts of large, migrating bison herds on Yellowstone’s landscape and found that the animals play a key role in the nitrogen cycle. As the herd travels about 1,000 miles each year, moving back and forth along a 50-mile migration route, the animals increase the amount of microbes in the soil. In turn, these microbes increase the amount of nitrogen for plants, improving their nutritious value by up to 150 percent. The findings were published in the journal <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu0703\"> Science</a> on August 28.</p>\n    <p>“Humans have been applying dung as a fertilizer for millennia, so we know it’s an important fertilizer. Bison are a restoration story, and allowing their grazing in places like Yellowstone provides a ‘reawakening’ of the landscape,” study co-author <a href=\"https://www.wlu.edu/profile/hamilton-bill\">Bill Hamilton</a>, an ecologist at Washington and Lee University, tells Madison Dapcevich at <i>Outside</i><i>. </i></p>\n    <h4>Fun fact: Yellowstone’s bison</h4>\n    <p>Yellowstone National Park is the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/nature/bison.htm\">only place</a> in the contiguous United States where bison have roamed freely and continuously since prehistoric times.</p>\n    <p>To conduct their research, Hamilton and his colleagues monitored plant growth and diversity, nutrient cycling and microbial abundance in soil across 16 sites between 2015 and 2022. They compared grazed and ungrazed areas and combined their findings with satellite imagery and GPS collar data to get an idea of bison movement and map the creatures’ impact across the landscape.</p>\n    <p>The merits of free-roaming bison have long been debated among researchers and conservationists. Some experts believe the animals should be constricted to certain areas because they can contribute to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/bison-bellows-9-8-16.htm\">overgrazing and disease</a>. “Yet, we found pretty much the opposite of that,” says <a href=\"https://www.uwyo.edu/zoology/people/merkle.html\">Jerod Merkle</a>, a biologist at the University of Wyoming and study co-author, in a <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2025-08-bison-room-roam-reawaken-yellowstone.html\">statement</a>. Their data revealed an increase in plant diversity along the migration corridor, and the soils were able to sustain nutrient storage.</p>\n    <p>But to deliver the benefits detailed in the study, the authors stress that bison need to be able to freely move at a large scale across the landscape—not be managed in small enclosures, as is the case in most places outside of Yellowstone. About 400,000 bison are currently living in North America, but some 95 percent of them are privately owned as livestock, per the paper. Most others are in relatively small conservation herds in constrained areas.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/alc8q2AIpaXooVjxLeOUghOgSEk=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(1440x960:1441x961)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/80/1f/801fe5a2-562a-459d-b6a4-cf0c13db9571/when-bison-are-room-to-3.jpg\" alt=\"a bison herd seen from afar\"/>\n    <p>The findings also serve as a kind of time machine, allowing scientists to better understand what impact bison had before they were almost wiped out, and it hints at what the animals could offer if more of their populations were restored. “This kind of serves as an example of how, if large numbers could get large areas of land, what it might look like for restoring bison elsewhere,” Hamilton explains to Alexa Robles-Gil at the <i>New York Times</i><i>. </i></p>\n    <p>Overall, the study confirms what Indigenous peoples have long known about bison, as Tony Heinert, a member of the Rosebud Sioux tribe and chief of the branch of bison management for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, tells the <i>New York Times</i>.</p>\n    <p>“Buffalo helped shape this continent,” he adds. “And the more buffalo that are out there, the ecosystems are improved for all other animals as well.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/restoring-bison-to-yellowstone-has-reawakened-the-ecosystem-as-the-large-animals-migrate-study-suggests-180987278/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The three-bedroom, two-bathroom home is Florida’s only private residence by the renowned 20th-century American architect.</p>\n    <p>Built in the wooded outskirts of the state capital in 1954, the house was commissioned by <a href=\"https://floridacivilrightsmuseum.org/exhibition/they-made-a-difference-power-couples/george-and-clifton-lewis/\">George Lewis II</a>, the CEO of Lewis State Bank, and his wife, the social activist <a href=\"https://www.tallahassee.com/story/local/2014/02/28/clifton-lewis-94-left-lasting-legacy/5888479/\">Clifton Lewis</a>. George called their home the Spring House because the property featured a natural spring, according to the <a href=\"https://www.preservespringhouse.org/about-lewis-spring-house.html\">Spring House Institute</a>, a nonprofit dedicated to preserving the property. Today, it’s known as Lewis Spring House.</p>\n    <p>Byrd Mashburn, George and Clifton Lewis’ daughter, recently decided to sell the 2,040-square-foot home after more than 70 years of family ownership. “It’s just the right time for me,” she tells the <a href=\"https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/2025/08/22/spring-house-frank-lloyd-wright-gem-in-tallahassee-up-for-sale/85462268007/?gnt-cfr=1&amp;gca-cat=p&amp;gca-uir=true&amp;gca-epti=z117843p003050n00----c00----e009500v117843b0086xxd118665&amp;gca-ft=128&amp;gca-ds=sophi\"> Tallahassee Democrat</a>’s TaMaryn Waters. “It’s the right time for the family.”</p>\n    <p>Wright’s career as an independent architect kicked off in the <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/frank-lloyd-wright-designed-his-first-prairie-style-house-when-he-was-26-now-its-for-sale-180985058/\">suburbs of Chicago</a> in the late 19th century. As his profile rose in the decades that followed, he began receiving commissions for structures <a href=\"https://franklloydwrightsites.com/sites/\">across the country</a>.</p>\n    <h4>Quick fact: What is Frank Lloyd Wright most famous for?</h4>\n    <p>The architect is best known as a pioneer of the <a href=\"https://flwright.org/explore/prairie-style?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22158730942&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD72xvSw9RBm0Vg0TnO6s-UPTvThF&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwq9rFBhAIEiwAGVAZP610HaxXDzPMA5P14eqUl8odHfOEQAn0LnQuG7CgJivkdXJgtW3r7hoCggAQAvD_BwE\">Prairie</a> style, which integrated nature into designs characterized by horizontal lines, open floor plans and flat roofs.</p>\n    <p>According to the real estate <a href=\"https://www.naiglobal.com/listings/?propertyId=3117-Okeeheepkee-Road\">listing</a>, Wright designed the Spring House in the shape of a ship to reflect the Lewis family’s love of the ocean. The Spring House’s interior is open and well-lit, with a large second-story balcony overlooking the first floor. The living area features a sprawling wall of large windows across from two rounded fireplaces, smaller circular windows and a long built-in bench.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Tallahassee</i>\n    </p>\n    <p><i>Democrat</i>.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/HyOEULL1wVxW2WC2jjfK4plLx0g=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(640x427:641x428)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/25/65/25658d67-d6b3-462f-ae08-168396de3073/eyjidwnrzxqioijidwlszg91dc1wcm9kdwn0aw9uiiwia2v5ijoizgf0yxmvmzmwodiznjgvnjq1otzhyjzhywjlogq5ota.jpeg\" alt=\"bed\"/>\n    <p>The Spring House is one of just 11 semicircular homes Wright called <a href=\"https://laurenthouse.com/\">hemicycles</a>, a shape he favored <a href=\"https://savingplaces.org/places/frank-lloyd-wrights-spring-house\">later in his career</a>. As <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/frank-lloyd-wrights-only-private-residence-design-in-florida-lists\"> Architectural Digest</a>’s Katie Schultz writes, the house’s curved glass wall lets residents “enjoy the full arc of the sun throughout the day.”</p>\n    <p>Clifton Lewis asked Wright to design a house for her family in 1950. Four years later, the couple moved into their new home, where they raised four children. When George Lewis died in 1996, Clifton Lewis <a href=\"https://www.preservespringhouse.org/about-spring-house-institute.html\">established</a> the Spring House Institute. She died in 2014, the same year the National Trust for Historic Preservation included the Spring House in a <a href=\"https://www.preservespringhouse.org/national-trust-for-historic-preservation.html\">list</a> of the most endangered historic places.</p>\n    <p>The Lewis family wanted the Spring House to become a public institute, reports the <a href=\"https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/2025/08/31/should-state-of-florida-buy-frank-lloyd-wright-designed-spring-house/85849117007/\"> Tallahassee Democrat</a>.

That’s what the institute wants. That’s what my parents wanted.”</p>\n    <p>Unfortunately, decades of Florida weather have taken a toll on the Spring House. Per the National Trust for Historic Preservation, hurricanes and wind storms have caused water to leak into the house, and its cypress columns have deteriorated.</p>\n    <p>The Spring House is one of nine Wright-designed buildings currently on the market, according to the <a href=\"https://savewright.org/wright-on-the-market/properties-for-sale/\">Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy</a>. The most expensive property—the <a href=\"https://savewright.org/building/lykes-house/\">Lykes House</a> in Phoenix—is listed at nearly $9 million.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/dZEMpfkmIcBtG86vv6t8ZDteYuM=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(640x427:641x428)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/c5/ce/c5ce13b9-aa7d-45db-8b7d-a576ff8004d8/eyjidwnrzxqioijidwlszg91dc1wcm9kdwn0aw9uiiwia2v5ijoizgf0yxmvmzmwodiznjcvztgxzjdmzjbjzjdjztjhndb.jpeg\" alt=\"light\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.connarchitects.com/about/\">Gina Demirel</a>, an architect at the local firm Conn Architects, tells the <i>Tallahassee Democrat </i>that she visited the Spring House during graduate school. She says Wright represented the “rise of ‘starchitects’ in the United States.”</p>\n    <p>“He’s one of the originals that, I think, turned architecture into a profession that many people aspired to,” Demirel adds.</p>\n    <p>Though the Spring House is Wright’s only private residence in Florida, it’s far from his only mark on the Sunshine State. He designed <a href=\"https://www.flsouthern.edu/frank-lloyd-wright-home/tours\">more than a dozen buildings</a> for the <a href=\"https://franklloydwright.org/site/florida-southern-college/\">campus</a> of Florida Southern College.

After suffering from acne and even being on Accutane, Celeste learned how to actually heal her acne from within with lifestyle practices, diet and skin-safe products. Today she is going ot share her top tips with YOU.</p>\n<p>Let’s welcome Celeste to the blog.</p>\n<p>+++</p>\n<p>Hi loves! My name is Celeste Thomas, I’m a registered nurse and holistic skincare expert who’s overcome some majorly acne prone skin. My mission is to use everything I’ve learned over the past 15 years in the skincare and wellness industries to help you feel your most skin confident.</p>\n<p>I am that one friend you can always text for the best recommendations and honest reviews. I have researched it all when it comes to skin health and as someone prone to acne, I’ve learned that the most trendy, expensive products aren’t always the best choice. In this post I’m giving you the simplest, most budget-friendly tips to help your skin glow from the inside out.</p>\n<p>Here are 10 nutrition, exercise, and health tips that I live by.</p>\n<h2>Celeste Thomas on Nutrition, Health and Exercise</h2>\n<h3>Protein at every meal</h3>\n<p>Think Lauryn’s <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/what-i-eat-in-a-day/\">plate of ground beef</a>. IYKYK. Protein helps stabilize my blood sugar so I’m not sneaking my daughter’s cereal by 10AM. Protein also supports the skin’s collagen and elastin production, pretty much making you the hottest, most energized version of yourself.</p>\n<p>If there’s no protein, I’m not wasting my time. At least 20g of protein at every meal/snack is my goal and I even put it in my drinks. Here’s how I add protein to my morning matcha:</p>\n<p> Packet of <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4dJ9TvG\">Pique Matcha Tea</a></p>\n<p>1 Scoop of <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3T7g5oU\">Be Well by Kelly Grass Protein Powder</a> (20g of protein)</p>\n<p>1 Scoop of <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3T7lkoM\">Ancient Nutrition Collagen Powder</a>  (10g of protein) </p>\n<p>1-2 Tbsp of <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4g213L8\">Almond Milk Concentrate</a></p>\n<p>1 Tsp of <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3X6UA96\">NOW Foods </a>Organic Monk Fruit</p>\n<p>Whisk, pour over ice and enjoy.</p>\n<h3>Eating Home Cooked Whole Food Meals</h3>\n<p>I know this can sound daunting, but I try to do this as much as possible because it’s so worth it. I have more energy, clearer and brighter skin, and increased mental clarity when I am nourishing my body with home cooked whole food.</p>\n<p>It allows me to avoid the skin busting big 3 (stay tuned for this in the next tip).</p>\n<p>I cook 80% of my meals, so when I do decide to go balls to the walls with steak frites, a dirty gin martini, and apple pie à la mode I get to fully enjoy it because it’s an occasional treat, not my multiple times a week crutch because I didn’t have a plan and postmates’d shitty Chinese food in a hunger panic.</p>\n<p>I plan ahead and order groceries from Costco, Whole Foods, or Sprouts and treat myself to kid-free solo dates to the farmers market. Another way I keep it simple is by repeating meals. Burger night, taco night, and steak night are on rotation weekly, no shame in keeping it basic.</p>\n<h3>Eat to Glow</h3>\n<p>Diet is a huge component to keeping my skin clear. No matter how much money you spend on products, if you don’t nourish your skin internally you’re not going to get the Hailey Bieber glaze you want. The #eattoglow diet is anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, and supports clear skin, I swear by it. It’s all about adding in as much organic produce, grass-fed organic meat, and wild caught fish as possible and avoiding the big three.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>The Big Three: </strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Seed Oils:</strong> A recent peer reviewed <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0228074\">study</a>, found that people with acne have higher lineactic acid, which can also be found in various seed oils. I opt for <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3XnfGBu\">tallow</a> or <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3XlMoD2\">Ghee</a> while cooking or <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4dDjjc0\">organic EVOO</a> for cold preparations like salad dressing. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/celeste-thomas-on-nutrition-health-and-exercise/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

You should do this before consuming anything so you don’t swallow the bacteria that grows in your mouth overnight. Then it’s right into hydrating with tons of water that I keep right beside my bed.</p>\n<p>+ Once I’m downstairs I’ll take <a href=\"https://justthrivehealth.com/discount/Skinny\">Just Thrive probiotics</a>, because they’re one of the only ones that actually survives the trip to your gut. And I’ll also do a water with fresh lemon juice, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3wsZhk1\">unflavored electrolytes</a> or <a href=\"https://www.gopjn.com/t/8-12762-307361-261816\">Kroma’s Cranberry Hydration Elixir</a>, depuffing drops (sold out but get <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4bZFQQ2\">the debloat pills</a>), <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3uNke8H\">apple cider vinegar</a>, <a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1818040&amp;u=3239803&amp;m=113313&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=\">Quinton minerals</a>, and <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3I9Jed9\">colostrum</a> (listen to <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/the-skinny-confidential-him-her-podcast/id1093028505?i=1000628218024\">this episode</a> to learn more).</p>\n<p>The tumblers I like for water concoctions right now are these <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3UQDP2c\">glass ones</a> and the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3uJwbw2\">Simple Modern 40oz</a> ones.</p>\n<p>+ After the kids have breakfast, Townes and I go for our circadian walk. When we get home I’ll have an <a href=\"https://www.owlvenice.com\">Owl Venice bone broth</a> with lemon, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3wsktGJ\">turmeric</a> and <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3UKC3Qm\">Celtic salt</a>.</p>\n<p>+ Approximately 90 minutes after waking up I’ll do an iced coffee with raw milk. So many coffee beans contain mold and chemicals so I like <a href=\"https://getkion.com/collections/see-all?utm_source=theskinnyconfidential&amp;utm_medium=grin&amp;platform=grin&amp;link_id=901932&amp;token=I1ig1VYsapR97bn3xXrjICbxDaWf3izF&amp;contact_id=f8f17aef-04fa-4673-8770-b9356d52d2e9&amp;attribution_window=30\">Kion</a> the best. Huberman says “you need to let some adenosine fix itself on receptors before you consume coffee.” You can get raw milk from the Farmer’s Market but do your own research. Most days I add the coffee alkalizer by <a href=\"http://www.getoffyouracid.com/?afmc=2c&amp;utm_campaign=2c&amp;utm_source=leaddyno&amp;utm_medium=affiliate\">Get Off Your Acid</a> (use code SKINNY for 20% off your first purchase and get the strawberry kiwi minerals too).</p>\n<p>Michael and I think it’s the perfect pre-workout drink because it gives you a bit of protein, carbs, and fat, plus amino acids, antimicrobials, vitamins and minerals. Oh, and an iced coffee is best served with nugget ice. <a href=\"https://bit.ly/48s8DJY\">This is the machine</a> I recently bought and I fully recommend it along with this white <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3SON2Wb\">W&amp;P Porter tumbler</a>.</p>\n<p>+ Around 9:30/10 I head to the gym to <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/my-trainer-brent-hruska-on-micro-dosing-lowering-cortisol-how-yoga-changed-his-life/\">lift weights</a> with yet another drink concoction. Creatine is the most studied supplement in the world and it helps increase your performance and strength. <a href=\"https://www.livemomentous.com/skinny\">Momentous</a> is the one I use and I have 5 grams with a school of <a href=\"https://getkion.com/collections/see-all?utm_source=theskinnyconfidential&amp;utm_medium=grin&amp;platform=grin&amp;link_id=901932&amp;token=I1ig1VYsapR97bn3xXrjICbxDaWf3izF&amp;contact_id=f8f17aef-04fa-4673-8770-b9356d52d2e9&amp;attribution_window=30\">Kion mango amino acids</a>. And I’ll sip it during my workout.</p>\n<p>+ When I get home I’ll have a protein shake with <a href=\"https://bit.ly/48xiQoA\">Thorne fiber</a>. The protein I like right now is <a href=\"http://paleovalley.com/skinny\">Paleo Valley</a> vanilla. I do 2 scoops for 26 grams of protein and 1 scoop of fiber which is equal to 10 grams.</p>\n<p>+ After that I’ll have 3 poached or scrambled <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3P27H86\">eggs</a> with a bit of <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3SZUVs7\">Primal Kitchen ketchup</a> and a slice of sourdough with <a href=\"https://bit.ly/49wWVir\">grassfed butter.</a> Katie has been <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/sourdough-for-beginners/\">making sourdough</a> for me, but I also <a href=\"https://www.idevaffiliate.com/33359/idevaffiliate.php?id=248\">love this one</a>.</p>\n<p>+ For lunch and/or dinner I have a big bowl of meat. I take Force of Nature <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3wztSMC\">ground beef</a> or <a href=\"https://bit.ly/42ZAO1W\">venison</a>.

    "body": "<p>You may know by now that mouth taping has been the most life-changing practice in Lauryn’s life. It’s changed her entire face, increased her energy levels and brightened her eyes.</p>\n<p>The benefits speak for themselves, but let us remind you, consistency is key.</p>\n<p>Over the years Lauryn’s developed some tips and tricks, of course, and today we’re sharing them all with you to enhance your experience and maximize your results.</p>\n<h2>Lauryn’s Mouth Tape Tips: Maximize Your Results</h2>\n<h3>\n      <strong>LIFT YOUR FACE</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>As I’m applying <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/mouth-tape?selling_plan=4150198365\">mouth tape</a>, I pull my face up instead of down. It helps my tongue rest in a proper position and also lifts my entire face.</p>\n<h3>\n      <strong>REMOVE WITH MIST</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>When removing your mouth tape, use a mist to ensure it comes off gently and doesn’t pull at your skin. I love <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3B1xbOK\">Primally Pure’s Plumping Mist</a> or <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/ice-queen-face-oil?selling_plan=4027154525\">Depuffing Oil</a> to make it super easy.</p>\n<h3>\n      <strong>REUSE YOUR TIN</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>You can find mouth tape tins all over my house, in all my bags, in my bathroom and on my nightstand. I use them for lip gloss, prenatal vitamins, throat coat drops when I’m recording – for everything.</p>\n<h3>\n      <strong>WEAR YOUR RETAINER</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>If you use a retainer or mouth guard, you can still use them while you wear mouth tape. I wear my mouth guard every night and wake up feeling energized and refreshed.</p>\n<h3>\n      <strong>USE THE SLIT, OR DON’T</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>We designed mouth tape with optionality. You can use the slit if you like to sip water through the night, or pull it up over your top lip if you don’t need it.</p>\n<h3>Benefits of Mouth Taping:</h3>\n<p>Breathing through your nose can help you establish a stable breathing pattern, which can help you fall asleep faster, stay asleep longer, have a deeper sleep, AND wake up feeling more refreshed.</p>\n<p>All those little hairs in your nasal passages serve a purpose. And that purpose is to prevent the introduction of viruses, bacteria, &amp; other gross things into the body. Mouth breathing while sleeping makes it so much easier for these yucky things to enter the body. But, the good news is your nose was literally MADE to be one of the body’s first lines of defense from any &amp; all sickness.</p>\n<p>Mouth breathing at night is one of the most common causes of nasal congestion &amp; that annoying sound we call snoring. Not only can snoring disrupt your breathing pattern throughout the night, it can also really annoy your SO.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.sleepfoundation.org/snoring/mouth-taping-for-sleep\">Sleep Foundation</a>, mouth taping for sleep changes the angle of your palate &amp; tongue, and thus, mouth taping reduces snoring. No snoring = better sleep = better LIFE! (P.S. another super handy hack to prevent snoring is <a href=\"https://getcanopy.co/products/tsc-humidifier\"> The Skinny Confidential x Canopy Humidifier</a>.)</p>\n<p>Ok, guys. This one gets a little gross…but we’re gonna go there anyway. When you breathe through your mouth at night, it can cause dry mouth, bad breath, cavities, yellow teeth, gum disease, &amp; tooth decay. It can also introduce yucky bacteria &amp; viruses to your oral microbiome and long story short…it’s NOT GOOD for your <a href=\"https://www.colgate.com/en-us/oral-health/respiratory-conditions/mouth-taping-for-sleep\">oral health</a>. You will see an instant increase in oral health by mouth taping at night. For more on oral health you have to check out <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/how-to-heal-your-oral-microbiome/\">this post</a>, there are so many good tips.</p>\n<p>Sleep disorders &amp; major disruptions in breathing throughout the night can have some seriously negative health effects. These effects can include stroke, heart attack, high blood-pressure, &amp; other cardiovascular issues. Mouth taping will help you regulate your breathing, which will help prevent spikes in blood pressure &amp; adrenaline.</p>\n<p>Nitric oxide is produced in the nostrils of all humans. So, when we inhale through the nose, the nitric oxide goes all the way through the airways &amp; deep into the lungs. This promotes everything from relaxation to expansion of blood vessels to the destruction of some bacteria &amp; viruses.</p>\n<p>Have you tried mouth taping? What is the number one benefit you noticed and how long did it take to see it?</p>\n<p>x, Lauryn and The Skinny Confidential team</p>\n<p>+ <i>Give yourself a  total mouth makeover.</i></p>\n<p>++ <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/mouth-taping-tips-for-beginners/\">Mouth Taping tips</a> for beginners.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/lauryns-mouth-tape-tips-maximize-your-results/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>This post may contain affiliate links and Corporette® may earn commissions for purchases made through links in this post. As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.</p>\n<p>Sure, we all know what wardrobe essentials for work professional women are supposed to have in their closets, but if you’re buying one for the first time or replacing one you’ve worn into the ground, it can be a pain to find exactly the right incarnation in stores. In “The Hunt,” we search the stores for a basic item that every woman should have.</p>\n<p>Today we're rounding up a trend I've noticed: the double-breasted sweater blazer. Are you wearing them to work? What pants are you wearing them with — and when are you wearing it unbuttoned?</p>\n<p>The Best Double-Breasted Sweater Blazers for Work Outfits</p>\n<p>Amanda &amp; Chelsea</p>\n<p>If you want to try the trend, this black double-breasted option from Amanda &amp; Chelsea looks great — it's $41 at Nordstrom Rack and available in sizes XS-XL.</p>\n<p>Yes, yes, boring as it's also the Workwear Report today, but I was excited to see that Elizabeth had found yet another double-breasted sweater blazer! In a lot of the pictures they seem to be buttoning only the closest button, as if it's single-breasted… I'm not sure if that would look right in real life, but your mileage may vary.</p>\n<p>The knit blazer comes in sizes XXS-XL for $158, at Anthro; it's available in four colors including red, beige, black, and a leopard print.</p>\n<p>M.M.LaFleur</p>\n<p>We've featured M.M.LaFleur's double breasted knit jardigan for one of our weekend open threads — I feel like this would lay beautifully when it's buttoned. It was $359, but most colors are $249 now; black has the most sizes in stock.</p>\n<p>Tuckernuck</p>\n<p>If you like a boxier, more relaxed fit, look no further than Tuckernuck. As they note, “this 100% cotton sweater is the ultimate transitional piece. Keeping you cool on warm fall days and warm on chilly days this cardigan is a must have for your closet. With gold-tone buttons and a boxy fit, pair it with jeans, a button down, cross body, and heels for the ultimate fall office look.” Nice!</p>\n<p>I tend to think of this as the OG of double-breasted sweater blazers: the Sofia jacket from L'Agence has been around for several years now. I like the patch pockets, the three-quarter length sleeves, and the general polish — this one has a bit more substance than some of the drapier options (including shoulder pads, if I remember correctly).</p>\n<p>The sweater blazer is $395-$450; you can currently find it in beige, white, and a dusty pink at various spots — and L'Agence has a few exclusive colors including a deep pink, black, and a “pale jade” (some colors as low as $237!).</p>\n<p>By Malene Birger</p>\n<p>Our most expensive pick features two trends: the double-breasted sweater blazer as well as the very long, wide sleeves popularized by Khaite; that trend can be a bit tricky to make work if you're wearing it at your desk typing (and eating and etc) while wearing the sweater so this one may work best as outerwear, but maybe I'm wrong. (Oof, just checked sizes and they are down to lucky sizes — so clearly some women are making it work!)</p>\n<p>The sweater is a wool/cotton blend, and is $580 at Neiman Marcus; they have it in both ivory and black. (Like the look? Here's a random dupe I found on Amazon.)</p>\n<p>What to Wear If You Don't Like Double-Breasted Sweater Blazers</p>\n<p>Not into the double-breasted look? These are some of our other favorite sweater blazers, lady jackets, and cardigans…</p>\n<p>Hunting for a great double-breasted blazer or suit? As of 2025, this Ann Taylor version is really affordable and comes in great basic colors, and Argent always has classic versions in lots of colors, as does L'Agence (in knits as well as blazers). Some other latest favorites are below:</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://corporette.com/the-best-double-breasted-knit-blazers-for-work/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>By  V. R. Craft</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The apocalypse is coming tomorrow, so of course, Richmart is a nightmare. Every aisle I turn down, eight carts block my way, all pointing in different directions. In the cereal aisle, I have to say excuse me three times before two women, having an in-depth conversation about tinfoil hat design, finally move out of my way, giving me filthy looks in the process. I reach the end of the aisle and discover they’re out of the cereal I like.</p>\n<p>Moving on to the cold foods, I struggle past a family of five with an overflowing cart. The mom yells at her kids that they’re not getting anything else and to put those juice boxes back, while the dad grabs a carton of eggs, then pauses with the eggs halfway to the cart. He turns back to the refrigerated case and grabs another carton.</p>\n<p>“What are you going to do with those? Throw them at the spaceship?” an older lady asks, reaching past him for a bottle of orange juice.</p>\n<p>The dad and mom stare at her, apparently suffering a simultaneous sense of humor loss.</p>\n<p>They look at each other, then at the older lady.</p>\n<p>Dad eyes the eggs. “You know, that’s not a bad idea. If they can’t see out their windshield, they can’t shoot lasers at us, right?”</p>\n<p>She shrugs.</p>\n<p>He grabs a third carton.</p>\n<p>The older lady walks off with her orange juice, chuckling, and I slide past the family to the soy milk case. Fortunately, plant-based foods rarely sell out, even the day before the apocalypse.</p>\n<p>It’s not really happening tomorrow. The apocalypse has been underway for a long time, and everything is just going on as usual. But, it’s true that a single spaceship, impervious to all Earth weapons, heads towards this rapidly disintegrating world, and every day, everyone runs to the store for bread and milk and toilet paper and chocolate and maybe a new big screen TV to watch the end of the world on, in the comfort of their homes.</p>\n<p>Still, I would hate to run out of plant milk for my smoothies this week, and I don’t feel like coming back here any time soon…</p>\n<p>I’m putting the fourth carton of almond/soy blend in my cart when my phone beeps with a message.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Can you pick up some apples? I found this great recipe for a tarte tatin.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>With a sigh, I turn my cart and head into the melee again.</p>\n<p>My phone beeps again as I pick the apples.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Also, I’ll need tinfoil?</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>It’s not to make hats, is it? I reply.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Hats?</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Never mind. I’ll grab some.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>When I get home, I bring my groceries inside, setting the apples and tinfoil on the counter. My phone beeps.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>I’m almost there.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>I step onto the patio I share with four other apartments. My neighbors across the way are bundling their kids into the car, waving nervously at me. I wave back. All the other apartments are dark, their occupants long gone for wherever they think is safe from the aliens.</p>\n<p>As soon as they drive off, I send a text.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>The coast is clear.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>The craft lands in the middle of the patio, narrowly missing the table and chairs I hastily shoved against the wall.</p>\n<p>I didn’t really think they’d come, but as they step out of the craft, I rush to greet them like the old friend they sort of are. Or feel like. We’ve never met in person, but we’ve talked a lot online.</p>\n<p>They didn’t bring the whole spaceship, just a very small landing vehicle. I ask if I can hug them, and they stare in confusion despite having a good translation program. I tell them never mind, then grab the tarp, and cover their spaceship, leaving a lumpy shape that isn’t any bigger than an SUV.</p>\n<p>Inside, they look at the apples in excitement. “I can’t wait to make my first Earth recipe. I read through 4,178,564 on my trip.”</p>\n<p>“Uh, that’s…a lot. And you settled on…apple tart?”</p>\n<p>“Tarte tatin. It’s French. Do you like it?”</p>\n<p>“I’ve never tried it, but I like apple pie.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://flashfictionmagazine.com/blog/2025/09/04/shopping-list/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>We had chosen our baseball teams in the alley behind our houses like always and started to walk down the block to the special lot, the one we still called our prairie; the only open space left in our neighborhood big enough to play any kind of games. Frankie, one of the managers for that day’s game, heard a commotion before we could see anything, so he held up his hand to stop us, just like John Wayne in one of those war movies we’d see at the Saturday matinees.</p>\n    <p>“What the hell is going on?” he yelled.</p>\n    <p>As we turned the corner we saw pickup trucks and semi trailers full of building materials lined up and down the street. Loud construction workers pulled materials off the trucks and piled them on our ball diamond.</p>\n    <p>Jimmy looked at me, “They can’t do this, it can’t be legal.”</p>\n    <p>“It’s gotta be a mistake,” Joey said. “If we explain to them, they’ll go away.”</p>\n    <p>Frankie and I approached a group of workers who were wrestling work fencing along one side of the street.</p>\n    <p>I tapped one of the workers, the tallest one, on his shoulder. Maybe he was the boss. Maybe he would understand. He looked at me and started to walk away.</p>\n    <p>“Mister, “ I said, “You’re at the wrong place. It can’t be here. We’ve played on this field for years. Our dads played here before the war.”</p>\n    <p>“I’m sorry, kid, the work ain’t stopping for youse kids, or anybody else” he said. “Stay out of our way. We don’t want anyone to get hurt.”</p>\n    <p>Backhoes were already starting to dig foundations for more houses and apartment buildings. Like we really needed more houses in our crowded neighborhood!!</p>\n    <p>We stood together outside of the fence, hoping it was all just a dream. We wanted to tear it down with our bare hands, but knew our parents would never support any kind of hooliganism.</p>\n    <p>More workers walking by the fence told us to go away. They told us more trailers were coming to drop off pallets of bricks and lumber. More workers would join the people already working at the lot; raucous crews of carpenters and masons to complete the destruction of our ball diamond.</p>\n    <p>The tall man who first talked to me, he wasn’t so nice when he saw us still standing at the fence. When we threw clods of dirt at the trucks, he cursed and chased us away.</p>\n    <p>“Get the hell out of here,” he yelled. “If youse don’t go home in five minutes we’re calling the cops.”</p>\n    <p>All of us shuffled down the street, shaking with rage. We bit our lips, didn’t look at each other, afraid we’d see the tears on our faces. Even though the oldest players on the teams were only 12-years-old, everyone knew that baseball players didn’t cry.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/frankcmodica/home\">Frank C Modica</a>\n      <i>is a cancer survivor and retired teacher who taught children with special needs for over 34 years.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Every time my grandpa, my mother’s father, visited us he always brought a crate of fruits or vegetables, whatever he just harvested. I remember I was in second grade when he came by with the crate and asked how I was doing in math.</p>\n    <p>“Twenty-six plus six is one,” I said.</p>\n    <p>He loved it. He was half-Irish, which made me one-eight Irish. Not much Irish, many would say, but we had our own history.</p>\n    <p>Centuries earlier expulsion waves brought tens of thousands from the Emerald Isle to our part of Central Europe. They were refugees but had standards high enough not to stop in France or Germany.</p>\n    <p>The Irish worked hard, drank hard, and intermarried with the tossed salad of Austrians, Slovaks and Hungarians. Now, after several generations, only a few know or care about having a few pints of Celtic blood. The others have been reduced to marvel why their last name is Kenedi or Onel. One thing has endured, though, and as a result all the good townspeople become Irish once a year.</p>\n    <p>Legend has it, when news arrived from Ireland about one of the more productive massacres by the British, a painting of the Madonna shed tears of blood. On the day of anniversary the faithful go to the cathedral to kiss the picture, luckily covered by glass and wiped down after each smooch by a church servant. The blood drops are faded brown, still visible enough so only the most cynical atheists would dare question the miracle.</p>\n    <p>“The blood stains will miraculously disappear the day Ireland gains total independence,” my grandpa whispered to me, standing in the long line.</p>\n    <p>Years later, after I flunked out of college the first time, I visited him. I knew he was not well, still it was surprising to find him sitting in a rickety armchair late morning. “It’s pneumonia or a bad case of influenza. Stay away, it’s probably contagious.” Then he wanted to hear about my plans for the future.</p>\n    <p>I said I was going to join the Sinn Fein since Gerry needed more volunteers. He sighed and rolled his eyes. “What for?” A frosty response from a man who had the Starry Plough banner on the wall next to the crucifix.</p>\n    <p>I said, “I’ll go to Belfast or Derry and shoot the entire magazine of my AK-47 into a bunch of English soldiers.”</p>\n    <p>He waved. “Then what?”</p>\n    <p>“Then I reload.”</p>\n    <p>He waved again. “Go tell your grandmother to boil up water for tea. That with a spoonful of honey, and in a couple of days I should be back to my vigorous self. Then you and me, we’ll be on the beach checking out the young broads in their tiny bikinis.”</p>\n    <p>Even though most family members spoke little or no English, and our combined Gaelic vocabulary barely amounted to a dozen curse words, Irish music was playing during the wake. “That was one of his last wishes,” my grandma told us. I nodded. “He was very proud of his heritage.” Grandma rolled her eyes. “No, this is for your benefit. He told me, find some Irish songs for that crazy <i>mac soith</i>. He believes he is Irish.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.szjohnny.net/\">J.S.

The woman tapped her long black fingernails on the card. Bree wondered how the woman was able to shuffle with nails that long.</p>\n    <p>“The hides of March?” Bree asked. “What’s a March hide?” Long purple curtains covered the walls of the small room, and unscented white candles burned on the side of the little circular table.</p>\n    <p>“The Ides of March,” the fortune teller said, enunciating clearly. She flipped her hand, and her long bat-wing sleeves fluttered dramatically over the small table with its crystal ball. Bree pulled her head back to avoid getting smacked in the face. She worried about the candles.</p>\n    <p>“I’m not understanding you,” Bree sighed. “When am I supposed to be aware?”</p>\n    <p>“March 15th,” the woman frowned. “The date that Julius Caesar was murdered.” Madame Hannah looked at her as if she was a moron, but how was Bree supposed to know about Greek mythology?</p>\n    <p>“Oh well, why didn’t you just say that?” she sniffed. “March 15th is tomorrow. So what am I supposed to be looking out for?”</p>\n    <p>“Chaos and change,” the woman said dramatically, leaning so close that Bree could smell the cinnamon gum on her breath.</p>\n    <p>“Could you, like, be more specific?” Bree wrinkled her nose. “Is it like being-hit-by-a-bus type chaos, or like can’t-find-matching-socks level chaos?”</p>\n    <p>“Another card is ten dollars,” Madame set the tower card on the table and extended her hand.</p>\n    <p>“I’m good,” Bree stood, ignoring the woman’s extended palm, and walked out of the little bookshop. It was a gorgeous spring day in Chicago, and Bree took a deep breath of the fresh air, tinged only slightly with bus exhaust. Though she knew she needed to get back to her desk, she walked slowly back to her apartment, stopping by her favorite smoothie store to get a mango and chocolate super kale surprise.</p>\n    <p>The line was long, and the smoothie staff moved with a lurching apathy that made her wonder if they were all stoned.</p>\n    <p>Twenty minutes later, Bree took her smoothie from the counter and sipped the bittersweet sludge. She really needed to get back to her desk. She had taken a two-hour lunch break, but that was the joy of working from home.</p>\n    <p>Back at her desk, Bree removed the vibrating device from her mouse that made it look like she was working and went to work. She answered a few customer emails and then browsed Amazon for a new blender. Maybe she could start making smoothies at home.</p>\n    <p>With a perky ping, Bree received a message from her boss in the company’s ugly messenger system.</p>\n    <p>“Bree, I’m going to need you to come into the office tomorrow.” Her boss’s message said. “8am sharp, and make sure you bring all of your company-issued equipment, please.

    "body": "<p>40th reunion. 40. How did she get so old so fast? She was popular and had plans. A “most likely to…” type. Succeed. Be on TV. Own a beach house in La Jolla. She did none of that and didn’t want any of that, but the party at Penmar Golf Course — $100 for hors d’oeuvres with an open bar — has her feeling jittery, thinking about what might have been. Most likely to become a cliché is more like it. She kept the yearbook, Venice High 1985, and opens it periodically to reconcile it with what she sees in the mirror. She’s not entirely unhappy. Her hair is still blonde, no bangs glued straight with gel! Her blue eyes look tired now but mascara helps. And she’s bigger, like everyone else. But her tits look good, even better than back when she survived on diet coke and Marlboro lights. She will not take Ozempic, at least just yet, like her friends. No Botox either but she knows it’s just a matter of time. Everything is just a matter of time.</p>\n<p>She looks at the scrawl on the back page — “My one regret: not asking you out…” — from the skinny kid with the big nose and curly mop, the one who became a writer. She probably would have said no but as the years go by, she’s developed an abstract crush on him. She’s followed his career, read a story here and there, a blog where he talks about his divorce. Divorce! When she read that, she got a tingle. She’s married and living a perfectly fine, decent, good life. But knowing he’s free out there is fun, harmless; she smiles mischievously when she sees his name on the rsvp list. She knows her husband would have no interest so she buys one ticket.</p>\n<p>What will she wear? A teal linen dress, tan flats, simple; she remembers he was short so she doesn’t want to tower over him but she does wear a push up bra so a little cleavage shows, casually, like she didn’t mean it, her boobs are so big she can’t help it kind of thing. She puts the yearbook in the large leather bag she inherited from her recently dead mother. She is hoping that maybe, after a cocktail, she could get him to sign it again, let him know that she’s followed his career, hint that it’s not too late though for what she doesn’t know. She feels reckless. Giddy.</p>\n<p>He looks different, bald now, a graying overgrown goatee; they all have changed, but she recognizes him from his author photos so she walks up, tipsy, and says, “Hey Nathan!” and he says, “Hi!” as he squints at the name tag pinned to her chest with a picture from high school on it. She says, “Mallory. We went to high school together!” and he says, “I think all of us here did!” And they laugh, she can feel her face reddening from the tequila, she’s half a margarita in. He says he doesn’t remember her and she pauses. It’s too late to run away so she pulls out the yearbook, flips to the back, points at the exact words he wrote. “You wanted to ask me out but never did!” and he says, “Huh, that sounds about right.” And she says, “Why not? Why didn’t you Nathan?” thinking that using his name will create some intimacy and he says, “I don’t know,” but he is charming enough now to say, “I was an asshole for not trying” in a tone that is more polite than flirtatious.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/getaway-car-rebecca-tiger/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>My prehistoric grandmother, exemplar of Generation W (W for Waste), shamelessly threw away new, unopened packets of Tico’s Tacos “sizzlin’ hot” salsa.</p>\n<p>Decades later I’m haggling with squatters to excavate Tico’s Tacos “sizzlin’ hot” salsa packets from garbage dumps. I showcase the packets alongside similarly excavated fast food detritus—styrofoam packaging, plastic cups and lids, faded wax-paper wrappers—all lovingly collected in a gallery behind glass. We’re rabidly nostalgic for these sorts of things because the Tico’s Tacos chain, like every fast food chain, no longer exists. Some of its architecture survives, such as dilapidated sombrero rooftops once neon-lit, and Tico the Cat statues waving hola from atop tumbledown signage. But mostly, reminders of the before times have vanished.</p>\n<p>I curate Portals to the Past on Mission St, inside the protected Zone. The gallery is three blocks east of the checkpoint, a razor-wire interface between us and the hungry world. Lately the hungry have been trying to breach our razor-wire. My contact, Zook, the squatter who led the most recent excavation for me—he claims the hungry are planning to attack again in three nights, the same goddamned night as my Tico’s Tacos exhibition opening.</p>\n<p>“You should delay your party,” old Zook says, smelling of urine. We’re just outside the checkpoint.</p>\n<p>“Why are you telling me about this?”</p>\n<p>“Telling you about what.”</p>\n<p>“The attack.”</p>\n<p>“Because, young lady, I like you. You give me work.” His toothless grin seems lecherous. I ignore it.</p>\n<p>We finish our transaction: one box of ancient and interesting restaurant condiments in exchange for one box of jackets and boots. Then Zook’s limping off into the smoky urban wilds beyond the checkpoint.</p>\n<p>It’ll be sundown soon. Portable flood lights flicker on. Security sentries inspect my ID, rush me back through the gate to safety, and I traipse down an empty Mission St sidewalk towards the gallery, eager to examine my box of treasure. But Zook’s claim about the attack irritates me. If he’s correct, my soirée will be a bust. People will be too afraid to come.</p>\n<p>Dean phones as I pass the old California Shakes coffee shop. “Did Zook get anything good?” he says.</p>\n<p>“We have a problem. He insisted there’s going to be….” I stop myself, realizing I’m likely the only one in the Zone who’s aware of this supposed attack. Saying nothing will guarantee that people can attend the soirée. “Actually, never mind.”</p>\n<p>“Never mind what.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t worry about it.”</p>\n<p>“Um, okay, so about the Ranger Rick cups, I wasn’t able to fully clean them. There’s smoke damage….” Dean updates me on this and more, but I’m distracted, conflicted about whether I should alert Security. It’d be the right thing to do. However, I’ve been working on this exhibition for months, putting so much care into it. And I really need the business. And further, Zook could be mistaken; maybe the attack is mere rumor.</p>\n<p>“Gotta go, Dean.” I disconnect the call.</p>\n<p>The gallery is wedged between a dental clinic and a market. To the east loom unoccupied green-glass skyscrapers—stilled giants, generals without wars. As always there’s not much traffic on the once-busy thoroughfare; the absence of activity creates vacuous silence and loneliness, but I’m used to it. Earlier in the day I’d unlocked and raised the gallery’s steel shielding, hoping that rare passersby might pause and admire my window display. Presently I’m touched to see an attractive young man viewing the display, a menagerie of plastic rainbow straws, remnants of a Bloopee franchise. Above the straws hangs a neat hand-lettered sign advertising my Tico’s Tacos opening.</p>\n<p>“You should come!” I place Zook’s box on the sidewalk, then gesture up at the sign.</p>\n<p>The attractive young man smiles a gleaming smile, stares at my breasts, says, “Looks interesting,” which pisses me off, not because of his ogling but rather because I remember the supposed attack and its repercussions for my soirée. “Yes, it will be interesting,” I say, flirtatiously nibbling my lower lip, concluding that old Zook is full of shit, that the attack is indeed rumor and nothing more.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/scarcity-ian-mahm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She had dated Ayo for three years, from two days after her nineteenth birthday till her twenty-second birthday. That night, as I let Ulari in through the kitchen, she whispered, 'It's over between us; he is going nowhere.'</p>\n<p>She described the night in a monotonous whisper as we lay in bed together: The misogynistic remarks Ayo laughed at with his friends, his frenzied dancing and liberal drinking while she sat in a corner waiting for him to be done. As his brown Honda Civic zoomed across Third Mainland Bridge in the still of the witching hour, she told him she didn't want to be with him anymore. They had been together for three years, and there had been a lot of fun, but she'd come to realise they didn't have much in common.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"\">Ayo began to cry and attempted to stop the car, but they were still on the bridge, so she asked him firmly to keep driving because she wasn't trying to get assaulted by agberos at three am. She said he begged, 'Please, don't leave me, Lari baby, please don't leave me.' When liquid-laugh spewed out of him, dribbling down his black silk shirt and into the tight coils on his chest, she whispered, 'Keep driving,' pretending not to see, hoping to preserve some of his dignity, even though it was too late. I probed, asking for details. I wanted to know how many buttons were undone on his shirt and synonyms for the smell of the regurgitated asun. Ulari shot a disappointed look in my direction, and I swallowed the cheer that threatened to bubble out.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>She left Lagos immediately after their breakup for a master's degree at Rice University in Houston, where she remained after graduating. She came home intermittently, regaling us with stories that revealed the expansion of her world, primarily through job postings in different countries. She'd been seconded to Paris for two years, spent three in Vietnam, and had been in St. Petersburg for nine months. At her last visit four months ago, we spent the day celebrating my new job at Landmark Beach. Returning, we stopped to refuel at a Northwest fuel station in Obanikoro, and I spotted a well-known Honda Civic a few pumps away. I should have faced my front and minded my business. But calling out to Ayo had seemed harmless enough.</p>\n<p>Later that night, when he called my line to speak to her, and she agreed to meet him for drinks at Yellow Chilli in GRA, I encouraged it. She was leaving for her real life in two days, and Ayo was always fun. I would know. I had bumped into him in a club or two over the years. He would introduce me to his friends as 'the sister of the one that got away.' He sent drinks to my friends and me, dazzling us with the latest dance steps. The victorious tug that now graced his lips used to be on mine. So, when Ulari returned from meeting him at Yellow Chilli, spouting absurdities about known devils versus strange angels,</p>\n<p><i>I just weak</i>.</p>\n<p>Ayo insisted that our family's reticence to their sudden engagement was only because he was Yoruba. He was, after all, a 'spec'. He would say this with a triumphant laugh as he tore into large chunks of meat originally reserved for our father, which Ulari decided was his due as her fiancé. He refused to eat at the dining table after their engagement was announced because he was 'no longer a guest' but our big brother, so Ulari would serve him in the living room. Every time Ulari joined him, he laughed at the way his fiancée rolled her eba in her palm like an 'omo Ibo'.</p>\n<p>'You realise 'omo Ibo' is an offensive term?' I asked once.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/07/ulari-and-her-idiot-by-nf-kenure.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The family of trees grows near the powerlines. A flock of white egrets search for food. Alyssa holds a puffed dandelion near her cosmos-red lips, the exact right shade for her skin tone.</p>\n<p>Data: Cosmos-Red is for lipstick, not an actual color. The real cosmos is deep, dark, black.

I imagine the rest of the seed's voyage through stored image data: blue, dark sky and stars, planets, galaxies, the edge of universe and time.</p>\n<p>\"This could almost be our first date, Mark.\" Alyssa curls in next to me. Her voice saying my name activates all sorts of stimuli inside.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, let's think of it that way.\" My left side warms five degrees in response to her body, like a cabin in a snow storm with smoke rising from the chimney. A glow from the windows. Frost shielding half the glass. The night darkening, silhouettes of the redwoods and powerlines. Lights on an icy coast, promising warmth.</p>\n<p>\"I'd like to have a baby,\" she says.</p>\n<p>Data collection: Images of birth. pregnant women, round bellies, babies curled, pushing. Doctors and nurses working together. C-sections. Live births. The afterbirth. Blankets: pink, blue, green. A mother holding and gazing, nursing, rocking. Both fall asleep. Fathers taking a turn at midnight.</p>\n<p>\"Alone?\" I ask.</p>\n<p>Data search: Couples holding hands. Couples having sex to conceive. Making love. That won't be us. There are limits to my capabilities. I search fertility treatments. And I search for the right words, caring words. \"Should you need companionship, I am here.\"</p>\n<p>\"Even when I was with my ex, I was alone.\" Contradiction. I raise an error flag, note the exception. Her hair smells like peppermint shampoo. Brown freckles appear and disappear behind the pink fabric of her dress. The skin on her legs is soft, unlike the rough skin of her hands. All qualities that would attract men. But she doesn't want a man. She wants a baby.</p>\n<p>\"It's easier alone anyway. I prefer it,\" she says.</p>\n<p>Data Search: Loners. People living in cabins in the forest. A woman, smoking under a bridge in New York. A boat motoring out of a bay, toward the sea. A writer gazing from his desk through a window at the ocean of city lights below. All are satisfied and sometimes improved by their time alone. Still, they long for something. \"I respect that there are times in a person's life when the need to be alone must be honored...\"</p>\n<p>Alyssa gives a slight nod. \"It'll be good to have you, if I have questions. Or I need a bottle warmed and help with a night time feeding, that sort of thing.\"</p>\n<p>Night time feedings. \"Staying up with a crying baby is no problem for me.

Image generated with OpenAI Within the car that slowly wound through the maze of country roads, no one knew there sat a young woman in dire distress, her whole life having unexpectedly plummeted into the lowest depths of human experience. Not even the driver, who was paying far more mind to the road on this black, stormy night, had any inkling that the female passenger behind him was in the throes of misery. Miss Paulette Fairbringer considered this fact while tasting the salt from her silent tears. No one knew where she was, and once they noticed her absence, she would be a mere talking point of scandal for a month at most, and then, forgotten completely. Every moment, Paulette fought the urge to look inside her velvet-lined reticule, knowing she would see two train tickets staring back at her for a train that had departed nearly an hour ago. In her mind she was still standing on the covered railway platform, the rain pounding on the roof, staring with elated anticipation at her lover before he uttered the words that she had never anticipated, and would never forget. In a dismal trance she gazed out the car window, watching the branches on the bare winter trees whip against each other in the violent wind. After a turn in the road, the trees gave way, and she could see a wrought-iron fence wrapped around a sizable estate, the shadow of a great house hanging in the distance. Such grandiose homes were a common sight for a daughter born into privilege and wealth. But a quick flash of lightning that illuminated the house struck up a sudden interest in Paulette, and a rather miraculous lapse in her melancholy occurred. \"Sir, what home lies on that estate?\" she inquired of the driver. \"Pardon?\" he answered, sounding distracted as he leaned forward to squint through the windshield, as no lamps lit this road. Getting the sense he would be of little help, she looked once more at the house, hoping to catch another glimpse of the overgrown ivy and the boards which covered some of the windows. It was then that she noticed a light seeping through the curtain of the uppermost window, bright enough that it must be electric for her to see it at this distance. But electricity in what looked to be a derelict and unmaintained old monster of a home? Even her parents had yet to install electricity. \"These blasted roads,\" muttered the driver. But Paulette hardly heard him, for her eyes were still fixed on the upper room window. She felt a quick tremor in her heart when the curtain moved ever so slightly, revealing what was unmistakably the figure of a person staring out. \"Stop the car.\" With the force and urgency that Paulette said this, the driver was quick to put his foot on the brake and turn to her with utmost concern. \"What is it? What's the matter?\" It took a few seconds for it to occur to Paulette that she had said anything, and a few more for her to realize what she had said. And then came the greatest question of all, why she had said it. No answers came to her, yet she could not deny the overwhelming urge to exit the car. Throwing open her reticule, she blindly dug through it to avoid seeing the tickets. When her fingers landed on several bills, she passed them to the driver. \"I don't feel right…</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/07/only-ever-four-by-kelsie-thorschmidt.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A feast, but I was too nervous to eat.</p>\n<p>The poppies in the wheat field outside the window glowed like stop signs in the morning sun.</p>\n<p>\"Be careful, Lucy. There will be hell to pay if you're caught,\" they seemed to say.</p>\n<p>M. Thierry and his wife Mme. Mathilde Kasriels, the middle-aged directors of this holiday camp, clapped their hands in front of the stone fireplace.</p>\n<p>\"Alright, everyone. It is time to get ready.\"</p>\n<p>In fifteen minutes, a bus would take us to the town of Evian for an overnight trip.</p>\n<p>I'd just turned twelve. The five girls in my dormitory were all a year older than me. \"Don't forget your toothpaste, Lucy,\" they said, stuffing toiletry bags into their backpacks. \"You always forget</p>\n<p><i>les essentiels</i>.\"</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"\">Of course I'd remembered my toothpaste. My breath needed to be sweet.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>A whistle blew. Girls shrieked. Dozens of feet clattered down the back stairs toward the bus. No one seemed to notice my breaking away into the field of corn.</p>\n<p>The earth was damp with dew. The late August stalks stood tall, hiding my head. Silken crowns on the ends of the husks had already darkened to the color of rust. This was my last chance to escape. Tomorrow, if I made it, I would be free from my parents back in Paris - free from the horrible boarding school that awaited me in September.</p>\n<p>I stopped and yanked a flowered skirt out of my backpack. It would be so much nicer than the yellow shorts I was wearing. Five pairs of underwear and a training bra tumbled onto the dirt. Damn. What a butterfingers. At least the rhinestone barrettes slid easily into my short brown hair.</p>\n<p>The gravel road at the end of the cornfield was barely big enough for two cows to walk side by side. Georges, my favorite person in the world, was leaning up against his Deux Cheveaux a few hundred meters away. Smoke from his cigarette rose in the air. He smiled and waved his hand. His long red hair shimmered like satin around his shoulders. His bell-bottom jeans were iron-creased in the front.</p>\n<p>The sound of a car behind. My feet pounded over the stones. Metal doors slamming. Gravel crunching. Within seconds, hands tore at my blouse.</p>\n<p>\"Are you out of your mind, Lucy?\" Mme. Mathilde screamed.</p>\n<p>Georges waved again and took a few steps forward, but M. Thierry charged him like a buffalo and slammed him over the hood. His fist rained down on my hero's face.</p>\n<p>\"Stop,\" I yelled. \"It's all my fault.\"</p>\n<p>Georges fell to the ground.</p>\n<p>The Kasriels pushed me into the back seat of their Peugeot sedan. Mme. Mathilde jumped in beside me and grabbed my arm. The automatic locks clicked. M. Thierry turned his head around from the driver's seat. His eyes were wet.</p>\n<p>\"Did you think you could just disappear? Did you think we didn't care?\"</p>\n<p>Yes, I was a little crazed. Here is the story, told the only way I know how.</p>\n<p>My family lived in a penthouse apartment in the 16th arrondissement of Paris. Last June my mother laid out the Cheltenham Ladies' College uniform on my bed. In September, I would fly to England. Day in and day out, I would don this dull-green suit with a cloche hat.</p>\n<p>\"Oh Lucy, it's just lovely.\"</p>\n<p>The wool felt as rough as a Brillo pad. \"I should've flunked the Common Entrance Exam.

This is the story of my last, and most dramatic, trip to the Arctic.</h3>\n<p>\n      <i>My book,  Meltdown: The Making and Breaking of a Field Scientist, comes out this week, six years after I started writing it. It’s about my time as a female academic scientist traveling to remote field locations, and the illness that cut my career short. This Narratively Classic was critical for my book, as I drew heavily on its content and style to create a world that readers could understand and be immersed in. </i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>—Sarah Boon</i>\n    </p>\n<p>It was 10 p.m. one night in June of 2008 and we were cut off from our on-glacier camp. When we’d left that morning, it was sunny and the glacier surface was crisp and crunchy, perfect for our plastic boots and crampons. My graduate student and I had decked ourselves out in hats and sunscreen to protect us from the sun’s reflection off the ice, then headed up-glacier to check on a weather station and a stream gauge to make sure we were ready to capture all of the data we needed once spring melt began.</p>\n<p>It was a long day, and by the time we headed back down-glacier, toward our camp, my bad knee had started acting up and I couldn’t walk without pain. To make the situation worse, we realized that things had changed while we were away from camp. The warm day had melted the snow on the lower glacier, leaving a shifting landscape of ice slurries in hidden surface channels surrounded by small hummocks of solid ice. We got within 1,500 feet of our camp and couldn’t go any farther, as there were two slushy streams between it and us that were just too wide and deep to cross. My graduate student tried to cross anyway, but the slush was like quicksand. I had to yell at him to lie down and pull himself out by the arms instead of trying to kick out with his legs. Now he was curled up in the tinfoil blanket from the emergency kit, icy wet to the waist and moaning about not wanting to die. Thank goodness for 24-hour daylight.</p>\n<p>I couldn’t reach him, and neither of us could reach our camp. It was time to get out the satellite phone and call base camp in Resolute Bay, 250 miles southwest.</p>\n<p>Not all Arctic researchers have had the luxury of satellite phones or shortwave radios. Take the English explorers at the turn of the century: If they got in trouble on their travels, they had only themselves to rely on. Searchers were only sent out if the expedition didn’t return after several years. This is what happened to Captain Sir John Franklin, who set off to traverse the last unexplored section of the Northwest Passage in 1845. The story ends badly — Franklin and his crew died of zinc deficiency and scurvy, some resorted to cannibalism, and they left artifacts strewn across the Arctic tundra as they tried to walk for help. Franklin’s wife pushed for a search for the missing expedition as early as 1848, but it was too late for Franklin and his crew. More than 50 expeditions searched for 12 years before concluding that every one of the 129 men was gone. The searchers found only graves, relics and Inuit stories about the expedition. It wasn’t until 2014 that Parks Canada and the Royal Canadian Geographical Society finally found one of Franklin’s abandoned boats, the H.M.S. <i>Erebus</i>, on the seabed where the Inuit had always said it was. The wreck of the H.M.S. <i>Terror</i>, Franklin’s second boat, was found in 2016 by the Arctic Research Foundation. Both sites are currently being explored in collaboration with the local Inuit.</p>\n<p>The Arctic has long tempted researchers to take risks to answer questions of science. Consider Norwegian Fridtjof Nansen, who suspected that, rather than being static, sea ice was a dynamic system that moved ice from east to west across the Arctic Ocean, from Siberia to Greenland, and potentially over the North Pole itself.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/the-secret-life-of-a-scientist-new-book\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Nestled on a gravel-lined, dead-end street, my childhood home was an idyllic setting to raise a family. To the east, a snow-capped Mt. Hood jutted from the tree-lined horizon. To the west, acres of cow pastures rolled into the distant hills. Everyone on our tiny street knew everyone else, and everyone knew our next-door neighbors hated us. <br/>Lined up in neat rows along our backyard was a young orchard: spindly trees still too weak to bear fruit, propped up by wooden stakes and thick twine. Looping through the branches and woven between the trees was a series of tripwires adorned with silver Christmas bells. My father told me he put them up to keep the deer from eating our apples. That also explained the rifle, I thought.

For writers, that means carving out the time and space to finally give our creative projects the attention they deserve. We’ve designed our Narratively Academy summer class schedule with that in mind. And since we know summer is also for giving yourself a break, all of our upcoming summer classes are either short (one to three sessions) and/or designed so you can attend asynchronously. </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Sign up this week (by Sunday, June 15) and take 20% off any one of these classes by using the code EARLYSUMMER at checkout.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Read on for everything we have on tap!</p>\n<p>But before we get to the brand-new classes, just a quick reminder that we have Abeer Hoque back teaching <strong> The Insider’s Guide to Writing Personal Statements and Applying for Grants &amp; Residencies</strong> this coming weekend, June 14 and June 21. There are just two seats left in this small class, so if you want in, grab yours now!</p>\n<p>We all know that one of the trickiest things to write about honestly is family — especially parents. Talk about navigating emotional minefields! That’s why we’re so pleased to have Ladane Nasseri, a MacDowell fellow who has published everywhere from <i>The New York Times</i> to <i>McSweeney’s</i>, teaching a two-hour seminar later this month, <strong> The Way They Were: Writing About Parents and Formative Relationships</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you’re working on a memoir or a personal essay that you want to infuse with original reporting and research, don’t miss this class. Kristina Gaddy — acclaimed author, essayist and editor at the literary journal <i>true </i>— is leading a special two-part craft-focused seminar in July called <strong> Reporting the Personal Essay</strong>. Students really loved the first edition of this class last year, and Kristina has now expanded it to include a second day where you can discuss your own works-in-progress.</p>\n<p>This summer, just 10 writers will have the chance to work one-one-one with Narratively executive editor Jesse Sposato. Jesse edits almost all of the memoir pieces that are published on Narratively, and this is the very first time she’s teaching <strong> Summer Memoir Mentorship: Perfecting the Personal Essay</strong>. If you have a draft of a personal essay and you’re ready for professional feedback, Jesse will review and critique your story, hop on a one-on-one call to discuss edits with you, then review your revision and help you get it all polished up and ready to submit to publications. </p>\n<p>We could not be more excited about this next class which, honestly, everyone on our team wants to take ourselves! If you’re a journalist, essayist or other writer who has always wanted to try your hand at a screenplay, this summer is your chance to commit. Bill Gullo is a very accomplished Hollywood screenwriter and longtime educator. In <strong> this fun, fast-paced summer class, he’ll show you how to write a “vomit draft” of a screenplay in six weeks</strong>. What’s a vomit draft? It’s just what it sounds like: fast and disgusting, but productive. Plus you’ll feel better after you’re done! Any professional screenwriter will tell you about the importance of getting the first draft finished so you can step back and see what’s working and what’s not. Throughout these six weeks, Bill will walk writers through all the details of how to get that full first draft finished in a way that allows you to move forward with intention.</p>\n<p>One of our perennially popular classes, Katey Schultz’s <strong> The Fine Art of Deep Revision</strong> explores how revising your own writing can be efficient, productive and even fun — once you identify the concrete techniques that work best for you. Our three previous sessions of this class all sold out quickly, so grab a seat now if you want to get to work on revising your writing projects this August.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/first-look-check-out-our-new-summer-classes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Miller found himself teaching a man who was responsible for an unimaginably horrific crime. He turned his back on him just when he needed him and has regretted it ever since.</h3>\n    <p>We are so pleased to get to share with you this moving story, “One of My Babies,” from 2024 Narratively Memoir Prize finalist Matt W. Miller, an acclaimed poet who has recently taken up essay writing. Here’s what Matt said about working on<strong> </strong>this piece: “I’ve been thinking about and trying to write about, in poetry and prose, this experience for over 20 years now. I never quite arrived at what I was trying to say. I think only now, in middle age, with years of teaching behind me, was I able to really understand this moment. In many ways, this essay is a letter to a student, to any of my students, that I may have failed along the way.” Buckle up for this one, which asks the big questions and takes your emotions on a serious ride, leaving you with all the feels. Kleenex recommended.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/one-of-my-babies\"/>\n    </p>\n    <h2>One of My Babies</h2>\n    <p>What I recall about the prison is the smell. Not some dirty or rotting smell or even the fleshy old cheese odor of people who worked too hard and lacked proper access to deodorant. It was not that at all, even if that was what I expected when I was first buzzed into New Hampshire State Prison for Men to teach a class in literature and creative writing. No, the smell was clean. Too clean. Even beyond the antiseptic clean of a hospital. This was a scrubbed-too-hard-with-rendered-animal-fat-soap clean. This was a rub-the-skin-raw kind of clean. As I walked into the prison, it was everywhere. It was the kind of clean that made you feel filthy, like you could never be clean enough, scrub hard enough to be right. You could see it on the men too — their skin was dry and tough-looking, ruddy from scrubbing with the fierce, heavy waters that came out of the old pipes in this place. The correctional officers carried it on them too, but it was mixed with whatever they brought with them from the outside: a wife’s perfume, cigarette smoke or the meat sweat of some steak and cheese sub they’d eaten at a pizza place right before their shift.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/star-student-also-committed-murder-reconcile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It was Jimmy’s first time in the U.S., and we were all beyond excited. This morning, Anton and I were reminiscing, and we thought we’d share photos…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/boys-playing.jpeg\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>Jimmy lives in a small seaside town in England, and <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/tag/anton/\">Anton</a> told me: “We were joking around, like, ‘Do you have cars in England? Do you have scooters in England? Do you have light in England? Do you have color in England?’ It was really funny. And sometimes when Jimmy would make a joke, we would be like, ‘Is that funny in England?’ But his jokes were actually really funny.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/louis-vuitton-suitcase-store.jpg\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>Jimmy asked to see a few sights, and we were happy to oblige. “Can we go to the <a href=\"https://40visuals.com/louis-vuittons-nyc-flagship-becomes-a-giant-stack-of-luxury-luggage/\">Louis Vuitton store</a> that looks like suitcases?” he asked. I didn’t even know this existed, but when we headed to 57th Street, there it was!</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/natural-history-museum-north-american-mammals.jpeg\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/natural-history-museum-gems.jpeg\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>We took him to the <a href=\"https://www.amnh.org/\">American Museum of Natural History</a>, one of our long-time favorite places…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/times-square.jpeg\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>…and to see Times Square at night, where Jimmy did a back flip for a crowd. “He taught himself to do flips in his backyard when he was six,” Anton told me. “He just fully went for it because he didn’t know the consequences were that he could get his neck snapped!”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/chelsea-piers-driving-range.png\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>The boys also begged me to take them to the <a href=\"https://sports.chelseapiers.com/new-york/chelsea/sports/golf/driving-range\">Chelsea Piers driving range</a>. They hit balls while I did the New Yorker crossword puzzle. “Jimmy told me he wants to ride in a yellow school bus,” Anton told me. “He’s never done that.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/boys-laughing.jpg\" alt=\"boys laughing\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>We also just mucked around at home…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/citibike-station-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"citibike boys\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>…and in the neighborhood. “When we were walking down the street, Jimmy was like, ‘Look at that, look at that,’ because there were so many different kinds of foods — Japanese, Lebanese, Thai, Italian, Vietnamese, French, Chinese, Indian, Ethiopian…” said Anton. “He also loved <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/04/style/frozen-yogurt-16-handles-ceo.html?unlocked_article_code=1.i08.DAQK.kOAZxI2rKWpo&amp;smid=url-share\">16 Handles</a>.” </p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cafe.jpg\" alt=\"Saturn Road Brooklyn\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>At the end of the week, <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/tag/toby/\">Toby</a> and <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2016/03/29/beauty-uniform-jean-goddard/\">my mom</a> joined us, and we went to a neighborhood café for coffee and magic tricks with cards. Jimmy showed us some cool ones, and I busted out <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2024/04/15/easy-magic-trick-for-kids/\">my old favorite</a>.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/boys.jpeg\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>Finally, on Sunday, my brother and Jimmy headed back to <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/tag/england-vacation/\">England</a>, and, honestly, we all felt really sad. It’s hard to live an ocean away from loved ones, as I’m sure many of you experience, as well. But we’re so lucky to be able to keep in touch. When <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2011/02/14/our-grandparents/\">my maternal grandmother</a> moved from Manchester, England, to Chicago with her new <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2011/02/14/our-grandparents/\">soldier husband</a>, she could only exchange letters with her parents, until they visited many years later. Where do your relatives live? Are you close by? Half a world apart? How do you stay in touch? I’d love to hear. I know there are pros and cons to every arrangement. xoxo</p>\n    <p>P.S. <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2021/10/28/favorite-experiences-nyc/\">Holy smokes, I’ve lived in NYC for 20+ years</a>, and <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2023/03/27/best-kids-activities-nyc/\">six NYC itineraries for kids</a>.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/09/02/nyc-trip-with-preteens-teens-boys/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Tonight my kids piled into our bed to watch family videos from our favorites album on the iPad. I eventually put an end to it, even as they begged for more. I was stressed about bedtime, and tired…oh so tired. Grace, you gave me a bit of perspective I needed tonight. Even in my stress and stupor, I know these are the days I will miss the most.</p>\n<p>The perfect post to come upon, toddler asleep next to me, as I again question when it was that he was no longer a “baby”—knowing that he’ll always be my baby, even when he no longer sleeps beside me, even as we pass other families with baby babies at the grocery store while my baby walks by my side, even when he one day grows taller than me—knowing this day will come sooner than my heart will be ready for, and I’ll reminisce in the grocery aisle, maybe tear up or put my hand over my aching mama heart, then I’ll buy the chips. Thank you, Grace, for the important and meaningful work you do, always.</p>\n<p>I’m not much of a singer, but this makes me glad that I recorded myself reading The Gruffalo for my 4 year old’s Yoto player 🥹</p>\n<p>Love this. Definitely in the interminable bedtime universe and trying to savor it. My three year old calls out a lot and night and requests me to hold her hand. ❤️ but yes, sometimes my sanity is called into question in this season with two littles.</p>\n<p>Sitting here tearing up ( ok sobbing ) in the teriyaki place picking up an order for my daughter’s birthday celebration while she’s at my house with my son in law waiting for me. 37 years ago at this time she was not even a day old yet. Sweet sweet memories. This post by Grace is beautiful. I DID cherish every second, and still do. It was just yesterday, wasn’t it ?</p>\n<p>Sob! Beautiful comment too</p>\n<p>So excited to receive a text from 12yo almost 13, asking if I was going to shops and if I am can I get snacks so we can have snacks and watch a show. Any better Friday night invite?? No way. on the list maltesers, gum and chips. Hooray for chips.</p>\n<p>so fun!!</p>\n<p>My song for my oldest was “Sweet Baby James” and when it comes on we just look at each other and have a sweet moment of connection.</p>\n<p>More chips! So true. Anything salty.</p>\n<p>We’re out of the lullaby phase (I Don’t Want to Live on the Moon from Sesame Street was my go-to) but I did just rock out to Safe &amp; Sound with my 2nd grader. I’ll be sure to cherish it all, even when he’s asked Alexa to play it for the trillionth time.</p>\n<p>I had a song list that I sang to all of my kids when they were small. They fell asleep or calmed down if I started singing the songs. They’re all mostly grown now but they talk abt the songs sometimes. I miss singing to them and also reading to them. I read classic chapter books to them when they were in elementary school and had voices for all the characters. It was so fun. I miss it so much. Rocking them, reading to them, and singing to them…it went by so fast. I’ve had more years not doing those things with them now than doing them.</p>\n<p>In the twinkling of your eye, they are 18, 21,35, 42, now my son is 53….</p>\n<p>Man is this true. There is a card that is often on the rack right by the check out at the grocery store by me – it says “I blinked and you grew up”. I literally start crying in the check out aisle every time. I would give anything for one more little boy bedtime snuggle – mine are 24 and 26 now and well launched.</p>\n<p>My heart!</p>\n<p>This hits home.<br/>\nWe are dripping our daughter at college this weekend and moving her in.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/08/29/a-letter-to-you/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Hair clips:  French combs. Shoes: Comfortiva.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“I thrift almost all my clothes, including this dress. My go-to store for anything special is <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/vintanthromodern/\">Vintanthro</a> in New Haven. They remember who I am, they know my kids. They’ll be like, tell us about your upcoming event! It’s an old-school shopping experience, where they pull stuff and accessorize, and they’re just so excited for me.”</p>\n<p>“Then there’s Goodwill. You might come away with nothing, and you have to do it regularly. I go at least once a week with my kids. These days I’m into vintage sweatshirts and short-sleeve button downs, so I’ll just head to those sections because otherwise it can get overwhelming. It also depends on where you live — I’m lucky because I live in Connecticut and the Goodwills are super good here.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Tank:  similar. Skirt: similar.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“These days, for my hair, I’m doing the whole shower-then-keep-it-wet-and-don’t-touch-it-and-put-in-<a href=\"https://amzn.to/4mzppyx\">Perfect-Hair-Day-by-Living-Proof-5-in-1-Styling-Treatment</a> thing. It feels like a movement right now.”</p>\n<p>“Being a therapist is SUCH a good job. There’s something about listening to someone’s story for a full hour; I don’t think we get to do that a lot in life. I try to understand exactly what each person is saying. If they say the word ‘weird’ or ‘you know what I mean,’ I’ll push to make sure I’m not making assumptions. I have to be careful with my kids because I don’t want them to feel like they’re always in a therapy session. Sometimes I’ll ask, do you want me to offer therapy advice or do you want me to be a mom right now? If they want me to be a mom, I’ll just say ‘that’s hard’ and validate them.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Tee: thrifted. Overalls: thrifted, “handed down from my son, it’s the best having sons who are into thrifting,”  similar. Sneakers: Converse.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“I have a bee tattoo. First, because my last name is ‘Beesley,” and also because I went through a transition period, where I went from being Mormon to being not-Mormon and from being a stay-at-home mom to attending grad school for therapy. I had a lot of feelings about how Mormon women couldn’t hold higher leadership roles, whereas bee hives are matriarchal. A few days before I started at Columbia, I had a few hours before I needed to pick up my kids from school. There are a million walk-in tattoo places in New York, so I picked one and got it. It was a thrill. The only problem with the tattoo is that it’s on every pillow from T.J.

It was lousy, rotten timing, and I reflected that I should’ve done as Cecil said and called in sick, telling my superiors that I picked up a virus from the case we worked last week and taken the dawn shuttle instead of the evening one. But I knew it would’ve caused me more problems than it was worth, namely because the director would want to put me through a battery of tests when I returned to make sure I couldn’t pass the “virus” on to any of the computers or other sensitive equipment at the station.</p>\n<p>I should’ve done it anyway, because if I had, I wouldn’t be sitting here in the director’s office, listening as she handed me an assignment that almost certainly meant I wouldn’t be returning home for the foreseeable future. Cecil and Halvor <i>both</i> were going to kill me.</p>\n<p/><p>“I don’t know if you’ve checked my job description lately,” I told her as I tossed the screen on the desk, “but I promise you that <i>babysitter</i> isn’t in there.” </p>\n<p>“But <i>other duties as assigned</i> is.” She pushed the screen back to me, then leaned back in her chair, crossing her ankle over her knee. “Eilan Lázár must be escorted safely back to the palace.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t they have guards to do that?”</p>\n<p>“Eilan gave them the slip a few weeks ago, apparently.”</p>\n<p>“The palace kept that quiet,” I said.</p>\n<p>“Would <i>you</i> want the galaxy to know that you lost the heir to the throne?” she asked dryly. </p>\n<p>“Clever of them, to have slipped past security.” Despite myself, I was impressed. The palace was the most fortified planet in the galaxy. For a child to manage to escape without notice was impressive indeed, and meant Eilan might have a chance of survival after all.</p>\n<p>“You have a teenager; you know what they’re like. Slippery little things,” she said, shaking her head. “Only problem is, Eilan didn’t expect their father to die while they were out joyriding across the galaxy. But now the king is dead, and the entire galaxy is on alert. Intelligence tells me that Eilan is in Alexandria. I need you to find them and escort them to the palace. It’s not an overstatement that you’re the only person on the planet—hell, in this galaxy—who can do that.”</p>\n<p>“I’m a detective, not a bodyguard,” I said. “<i>And</i> I’ve got a week of leave that’s been on the calendar for eight months now. I’m going home.” </p>\n<p>“Do you have any idea what kind of unrest it would cause if the heir is murdered before they can ascend to the throne?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“Yes. It would create a power vacuum and likely result in civil war.” I lifted one shoulder in a shrug. “I don’t particularly care, and I don’t see why you do, either. It won’t affect us. Barnard’s Star will become the independent system they’ve always wanted to be, and so will Alpha Centauri and Sol. We’re too far away from those systems for any war to reach us here.”</p>\n<p>“Infrastructure across the solar systems will collapse; millions upon millions of lives could be lost–”</p>\n<p>“I don’t see why all that rests on my shoulders,” I snapped. “I am <i>one</i> android. You can’t possibly expect me to be able to keep the heir safe when people from five different solar systems want them dead. They’ll be killed before they even leave this system, you know that.”</p>\n<p>“Dominic—”</p>\n<p>I pushed myself to my feet. “I’m sorry, but the answer is still no. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have a shuttle to catch.”</p>\n<p>“I’ll release you from your contract.”</p>\n<p>I paused at the door, my fingers on the handle.</p>\n<p>“You’ll what?”</p>\n<p>“You heard me,” she said. “I’ll break your contract with us, wipe your record clean, and you can go home. For good, this time. Forever.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/06/05/escape-pod-996-sanctuary-part-1-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 994: Magical Girl Antifa War Machine</h2>\n<h3>Magical Girl Antifa War Machine</h3>\n<p>XYLIA</p>\n<p>We were at the bottom of a hole, a new construction site that went deep into the bedrock. I was the first to touch the artifact, a thing that didn’t quite have shape or color. I grabbed it. My new consciousness slammed into my mind so fast that there was just enough time for only one last wholly-human thought: <i>You’re a girl, you fucking idiot.</i></p>\n<p>My new form was sleek. Mathematically perfectly curved. Hyperfeminine in the truest sense. Breasts extending into six dimensions. A tall, lithe, highly reflective body. A smooth face with eyes burning with seductive rage. And strength, immense strength. I flexed and felt a distant star flicker a warning.</p>\n<p>I turned to look at the three friends I was with: Sapphire, Ella, and Raven. They were looking at me. To them, this had all happened instantly.</p>\n<p>I tried speaking but it can out as a high-pitched sine wave. I tried again, this time delicately forming air into coherent acoustics. “Hey,” I said. “I think I’m trans.”</p>\n<p>“Are you still alive?” Sapphire, ever the caretaker of our little group, asked.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” I said. I felt extremely alive.</p>\n<p>I could feel the rock under me down to the mantle down to the core, yes, I could feel cosmic rays as if they were sleet, yes, but I could also feel exploitation like a bad odor, I could feel the carceral state like a skin rash, I could feel climate change like a life-threatening fever.</p>\n<p>And I felt the need to destroy anything that would doom this planet or its people. It was just an itch at first, but the need was growing. By daylight, it had superseded all other needs, permanently. And it frightened me, badly. That was disappointing. I had spent my whole human life frightened.</p>\n<p>So, I turned to my friends, and said: “Well? What’re you waiting for?”</p>\n<p>If I hadn’t felt so scared, I think I would’ve at least tried to explain the choice they were about to make. None of us regret what we did—I don’t think we can—but I should’ve given them a real choice. I didn’t, because I didn’t want to do this alone.</p>\n<p>I’m sorry.</p>\n<p>They all touched the artifact and transformed. We studied each other and noted that yes, we were powerful, and yes, we were extremely hot, but also: there was a military base not far from us. There was a Nazi dive bar less than a mile away. There was a cop beating up a homeless man just around the corner. We could murder the cop-we <i>should</i> murder the cop; we <i>must</i> murder the cop—and demolish the Nazi dive bar and lay waste to the military base. We must, we must.</p>\n<p>I did what I’d always done, which was avoid my needs with whatever was available. Booze, video games, breaking into construction sites at night, and or sex.</p>\n<p>I radiated the want and the question out to my friends and they replied, yes.</p>\n<p>I had never wanted to fuck them before. <i>Never.</i> Except Sapphire. But right now it felt like it was the only thing I could do to stave off this other thing. And my friends must’ve felt likewise.</p>\n<p>The construction site flashed brilliant colors as we slid into each other along axes that until that night we could never have dreamed of.</p>\n<p>SAPPHIRE</p>\n<p>We all knew Xylia was trans long before they did. For years, they’d insisted that it was totally normal for a cis guy to have three transfemme best friends. Probably nothing. They were such a pro at avoiding themselves that they had to literally turn us all into weapons to crack their egg, God bless.</p>\n<p>I used to imagine every possible timeline of what it would be like when Xylia came out and was finally able to requite the crush I knew I had on them. The timelines where we made out, and the ones where we didn’t, and the ones we made out and then over breakfast quietly asked if we could do this again.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/05/22/escape-pod-994-magical-girl-antifa-war-machine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 993: That Thing With Bob and the Crop Circles</h2>\n<h3>That Thing With Bob and the Crop Circles</h3>\n<p>So last Tuesday, long about noon, I found myself down at the hardware store to buy chicken feed for the ladies.</p>\n<p>I never gave much thought to keeping chickens, I must admit, but my niece Donna said I needed something to give me structure now that I’m retired. I had figured that going to the coffee shop every morning and reading up on my journals counted as structure, but apparently it does not, according to Donna. She came over in her little Subaru and set up a chicken coop and put three prime specimens of <i>Gallus gallus domesticus</i> in it for me. </p>\n<p>Two of them are hens and one of them is a rooster who believes very firmly that it’s a hen, and since I respect everybody’s right to go through life in the way that suits them best, I call them all the ladies. And I have to admit that keeping chickens is soothing, whether or not you’re retired, since they make very nice little burble-burble-cluck noises and there isn’t a lot of angst to a chicken. Too many animals around now who are full-up on angst, if you ask me, which I blame on domestication gone a little bit too far. I met a dog the other day that was part Basset Hound and part Chihuahua and one look in that dog’s eyes was enough to make you reconsider a lot of life choices.</p>\n<p/><p>But anyway, there I was at the hardware store, where Marlene works. Marlene’s a good woman and she runs that place with military precision, by which I mean that everything costs five times more than it should and nobody knows where anything is. Still, I like to shop local, so I went in and bought some feed for the ladies and then we stood around and talked about the weather.</p>\n<p>I do not know why people get so bent out of shape about talking about the weather, as if it’s beneath them. A really good conversation about the weather can go upwards of an hour and meander widely. We had just touched on the year with the Halloween blizzard and followed it up with the Christmas it was ninety-five degrees, when who comes into the store but Bob.</p>\n<p>You remember Bob, of course—Marlene’s boy, not the Reverend. I couldn’t exactly say that Bob was a friend of mine, especially since I relieved him of an ill-gotten narwhal he was keeping in his aboveground swimming pool, but we stay pleasant (if distinctly chilly on Bob’s part) because he’s Marlene’s boy, although Marlene herself has often expressed the opinion that she took a few too many herbal supplements during pregnancy. I asked her once if she meant marijuana and she said no, she never touched the stuff, but she had gone through a dark patch in her life when she was hooked on goldenseal and brewer’s yeast, so take that as you will.</p>\n<p>Bob stormed in and it was pretty obvious he was in a mood. He slapped the counter and said, “Mom, give me the strongest stuff you got for crop circles.”</p>\n<p>“Crop circles?” said Marlene.</p>\n<p>“I got ‘em all over the yard,” he said. Then he noticed that I was there and said, “Doc,” with a little more politeness than he normally would, on account of his mother being there.</p>\n<p>“Good morning, Bob,” I said. “How’ve you been keeping?”</p>\n<p>“You’d know,” he said, “if you bothered to follow me on Facebook.”</p>\n<p>“Do <i>not</i> start down that road again,” I said. “The last time I visited your page, you had linked an article by some fella who claimed that there is an international female smuggling ring stealing men’s semen, and that is not a thing I wish to have inflicted upon me before I have had adequate coffee.”</p>\n<p>“It’s true though, Doc,” he said, and I could see the fire starting up in his eye. Bob never met a conspiracy theory he did not embrace like a long-lost friend.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/05/15/escape-pod-993-that-thing-with-bob-and-the-crop-circles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The Neurasuit has been in warming mode for a few minutes–my overwrought senses accept the lines of heat like a gift. Despite my anxiety for the fight, my trapezius muscles relax, creaking in the silence. Released from the tension, my vertebrae settle into place with small snaps, one or two with each breath.</p>\n<p>Wires snake through my hair, massaging the scalp pain I didn’t notice was there. More swirl around my neck, tickle between my toes, seeking the overabundant bristles of my nerves. The Neurasuit folds around me with a hiss and a click, shutting out the cold night air. Before the systems launch, before the fight begins, I have a moment of perfect comfort in a little space built for me.</p>\n<p>Jolt. Systems connect. I am the Neurasuit, the metal is my bones, the forcefields my flesh, the hydraulics and wires my muscles and nerves. I am hard, my new limbs pressurized cannons of potential energy, my skin a web of humming electricity. (My actual skin hums too, but in a different way, protesting its own existence.) The lights flick on in lines, <i>onetwothreefour, onetwothreefourfive, </i>plosions of sensation rolling up my back, down my limbs, splaying into my clawed hands and feet. An exhilaration of wind curves around my artificial body. (It doesn’t hurt–for now.) My breathing tube conveys the stink of our enemies–like sulfur, like rain upon burnt ruins.</p>\n<p>Imri’s voice crackles over the comms, “Should’ve known they were coming tonight.” (Too loud. My ears echo every syllable with a repulsed spasm. I wince and the suit reads my discomfort, turning the sound down.) “Those clouds at sunset. Unnatural. Looked like the sky was full of tomatoes. Wish I’d realized and taken a nap.”</p>\n<p>“Doesn’t matter to me,” I say, “Couldn’t sleep anyways. At least we have something to do now. Trying to shut my shoulders up was getting boring.” (I’d rather be sleeping, despite my bravado, but we must work within our limits, must we not?)</p>\n<p>“That’s the spirit,” says Espen. (A wince in his voice. Seems we all are suffering from the change in air pressure this evening.)</p>\n<p>Imri is crouching already, the piston rods in her legs driven deep into their casings, waiting to spring. Espen and I sink down on either side of her.</p>\n<p>The metal, wires, and solder transform us into beasts: sharper, bigger, faster, stronger, with razor claws and ruthless jaws. The lights delineate our shadowy bodies, flickering like the rainbow cilia of comb jellies.</p>\n<p>We are the only people who can control the Neurasuits. Our over-communicative nerves will scream that a rough pants seam or an ice cube in the palm is pain, so they flood the gap between neurons and circuitry with abundant commands, compelling the suits to follow our impulses as if they were our own bodies.</p>\n<p>Imri discovered our latent powers some five years ago, when we were mere roommates, trying to make a dingy, too-small house suit our diverging needs. At the time, her nighttime tinkering in the cramped shed was an oddity that Espen and I envied–where did she find the energy after her nine-to-five as an engineer? We hadn’t guessed it was a bid for survival, for our city and for our struggling bodies. We didn’t know those robot skeletons would be the bond that would cement us as a unit–fighters, friends, comrades.</p>\n<p>Espen’s head lifts, jaws opening to take in more scent. “Which direction are they coming from?”</p>\n<p>I turn my face to the clouds boiling in the night sky.

I love it when the rain falls so suddenly there’s no avoiding it and you’re drenched in seconds, or when the drops hit the ground so hard they bounce right back up at you. I love the crack of thunder that precedes the rain, and the rainbows that come after. This was the kind of storm I was riding through, just returned to our village after one of my courier runs to the neighboring communities.</p>\n<p>Racing through puddles, I didn’t mind the mud splashing up at me or that all this moisture was going to make a frizzy mess of my long curls. I spread my arms and raised my face to the clouds, relishing the coolness after building up a sweat over the miles I’d ridden. As I cut through our food forest, the tree canopy abruptly ended my impromptu shower, so I went back to focusing on my path, careful to keep my bike to the walking trails so as not to damage the ground cover plants.</p>\n<p>Passing one of the lower bushes, several chickens taking shelter burst out, startled, clucking their displeasure. <i>That’s odd</i>, I thought. <i>Someone must’ve left the coop open</i>. I hoped no predators had gotten into it. </p>\n<p/><p>As I emerged from the forest, the rain was already beginning to slow. I wound my way through the narrow paths between the buildings of our community, reaching up to gently touch the leaves of the hanging plants that descended from the balconies, creating my own little downpour. In some places, climbing plants rose up to meet the hanging ones, entangling like lovers, supporting each other as they grew. It made me think about how all of us in the village supported each other and were stronger for it, too.</p>\n<p>Normally, a storm like this meant the village core would be deserted, so I was surprised to see a small crowd gathered around Emma’s toolshare. Emma stood, hands on hips, staring toward the roof with a dour expression. Following her gaze, I noticed Yi-jun had climbed up there and was looking around.</p>\n<p>I brought my bike to a skidding stop in front of the shop. “What’s going on?”</p>\n<p>Emma gave me a nod in greeting, digging her hands deep into the pockets of her overalls. “Hi Amalia. Got here this morning to find the lights wouldn’t work. Yi-jun says my solar panels are damaged.”</p>\n<p>“From all the storms we’ve had lately?”</p>\n<p>“Not likely,” Yi-jun said, from his perch on the roof. “One of the panels is missing altogether. A storm wouldn’t do that.”</p>\n<p>“You think someone stole it?” I asked, surprised. In our community we shared everything. If there was something you needed, chances were someone else could make it or share one of their own. Theft just didn’t make sense.</p>\n<p>“The turbine looks damaged, too,” Yi-jun added.</p>\n<p>“Guess it’s lights out for me for a while,” Emma said.</p>\n<p>Yi-jun came down and assured her he could fix the damage and get her a replacement panel. She’d have lights back on by tonight but wouldn’t be up to full power for a while. Emma’s response was what I’d expected: “S’pose you’ll be needing some tools.”</p>\n<p>Then she looked at me. “Don’t tell me you came here for a bike repair.”</p>\n<p>“Nah, but I <i>had</i> been thinking about stopping by for a tune-up, since it’s been a while,” I said. “I don’t need it breaking down halfway between here and Beachside and then having to hoof it the rest of the way with the bike on my back. But I can see things are a bit hectic for you today.”</p>\n<p>“Never mind that,” she said. “Leave the bike. I’ll take a look at it out here once the rain stops. Won’t take long.”</p>\n<p>“Thanks. I appreciate it.”</p>\n<p>“You can do me a favor in return,” she said. “Head down to the potter’s if you don’t mind. He’s got some tools he borrowed I need back.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/05/01/escape-pod-991-after-the-rain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

From unpacking and hydrating ASAP, to pre-travel calm, here’s how Lauryn streamlines her vacation rituals.</p>\n<h2>OOO With Lauryn: Her Vacation Routine</h2>\n<p><strong>Lauryn Bosstick:</strong> Usually I make it a point to return emails and texts. It’s undisturbed time and my team knows to brace themselves for replies from 2 weeks of messages. I’ll also do to-do lists and visualizations on my iPad, or I’ll just relax and watch a show. I just finished <i>Sirens</i> and it was so good. </p>\n<p>If my kids aren’t on the flight with me I typically make it a priority to get some admin work done.</p>\n<p><strong>LB</strong>: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4g73cpm\">Smythson baby blue notebook</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/mouth-tape\">Mouth tape</a> (sometimes if all asleep)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3PNPbR4\">Caraway Container </a>(usually with my<a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/what-i-eat-in-a-day/\"> meat bowl</a> inside) </p>\n<p>iPad with a <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3ZrLshf\">white keyboard</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/45h2diU\">Baby blue charger</a> from Amazon</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/47PyvTl\">Arrae Bloat</a> (planes make me puffy)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4jPgsPI\">Glass water bottle</a> full of ice</p>\n<p>A book (just finished <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4l53qyy\">Barry Diller’s book</a>)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/4jRmZJJ\">Barefoot Dreams blanket</a> (I don’t use it on the plane though, I wait until I arrive)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ryvalia.com/products/collagen-deep-mask\">Ryvalia sheet mask</a> (use code LAURYN35 for 35% off)</p>\n<p><strong>LB</strong>: As soon as the plane lands I take my Arrae Bloat pills. When I get to the hotel I take my Barefoot Dreams blanket out of my carry-on and let it air out. Then I set up a station with my supplements, beauty products and wellness stuff. I call room service for a huge bottle of water and lemon wedges, fresh mint tea (or iced tea). While I wait I hang up all my clothes and unpack.</p>\n<p><strong>LB:</strong> Before a trip I get my brows done by Lena at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/browline_studio_atx/\">Browline Studios</a> in Austin and along with using <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/brow-peptide?selling_plan=4029317213\">Brow Peptide</a> twice a day, it keeps you looking youthful and refined with almost no makeup. </p>\n<p>The tint in <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/sunscreen?selling_plan=4029120605\">Caffeinated SPF</a> is perfect for a quick, put together look without a lot of effort. I also get my nails done before I leave and a Russian manicure by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/that_russiangirl_/\">@that_russiangirl_</a> is the absolute best. It lasts forever. </p>\n<p>I also do <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/pink-balls-facial-massager\">facial massage</a> and meditate every morning and schedule workouts during a vacation. I might not get to all of them but I make it a point to still work out on holiday and take <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4g3KfE0\">Arrae Tone</a> pre-exercise. All of these things help you feel your best during the entire holiday.</p>\n<p><strong>LB:</strong> During this pregnancy I ate a lot of liver, I took creatine the entire time (check with your own doctor), and used the <a href=\"https://lightstim.com\">Lightstim panel</a> every single night on my face. </p>\n<p>Three things I will continue to do postpartum:</p>\n<p>Putting my feet in the grass and getting sunlight in my eyes first thing in the morning.</p>\n<p>Creating boundaries and purpose around my phone.</p>\n<p>Not scrolling on social media at all.</p>\n<p>I’m focusing on spending time with my kids, the new baby and being present. I’m also writing another book so it’s nice that I’ll be able to focus some time and energy on that. My team is handling everything else so it’s nice that I can make the book a priority.</p>\n<h3><strong>HOT TAKE</strong>:</h3>\n<p>Gstaad</p>\n<p>Regulating your nervous system.</p>\n<p>A good eyebrow tint. After I see Lena at Browline in Austin, it’s like an instant facelift.</p>\n<p>Color you’re painting the season with:</p>\n<p>French baby blue.</p>\n<p>I like to give personal compliments that are specific and related to them only. I love to receive compliments about being a mom.</p>\n<p>My kids, Zaza and Townes. Whenever I see them I instantly get happy and excited.</p>\n<p>My phone will be on DND all summer.

We’re talking harsh chemicals, synthetic fragrances, and irritating additives your hair definitely doesn’t need.</p>\n<p>We believe nature knows best when it comes to beauty. Natural ingredients aren’t just safer and gentler on your hair, they <i>actually</i> work.</p>\n<p>Take rosemary oils, for example. It’s all-naturél and does wonders for your hair and scalp. Pair it with castor oil, a tried-and-true remedy that’s been used for generations on everything from skin to hair, and you’ve got a powerful combo for long, shiny locks.</p>\n<p>Today, we’re sharing a simple DIY natural hair treatment using both rosemary and castor oil. It’s easy to make at home and perfect for nourishing, strengthening, and encouraging thicker, healthier hair.</p>\n<h2>Castor Oil and Rosemary Oil for Hair Recipe</h2>\n<p>We’re <i>big</i> fans of castor oil, and for good reason. You can use <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/castor-oil-for-lymph-nodes/\">castor oil for lymph nodes</a>, to <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/how-to-make-eyebrows-thicker/\">make your brows thicker, fuller, and longer</a>, and, as an overnight detox—check out our post “<a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/discover-the-nighttime-benefits-of-castor-oil-patches/\">Benefits of Castor Oil Patches</a>” for more information on that.</p>\n<p>After realizing how powerful of an oil it is, we had to try it on our scalp and hair, too. And as we looked into the idea further, we found that rosemary oil pairs perfectly with castor oil to boost hair growth totally naturally.</p>\n<p>Here’s how you can make your own castor and rosemary oil hair treatment:</p>\n<h3>Is Castor and Rosemary Oil Good for Hair?</h3>\n<p>Yes! There are so many rosemary and <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/castor-oil-for-hair/\">castor oil benefits for your hair</a>. The nutrients in the oil can increase blood circulation to the scalp, promoting hair growth. At the same time, castor oil’s antimicrobial properties can keep your scalp healthy, reducing dandruff and scalp infections. </p>\n<p>Beyond stimulating hair growth, the combination of rosemary and castor oils can also strengthen and moisturize brittle and dry hair. Their rich, hydrating consistency helps add shine and reduce frizz by smoothing those hair cuticles.</p>\n<p>Basically, castor oil + rosemary oil = all your hair goals.</p>\n<h3>What Does Rosemary and Castor Oil Do for Hair?</h3>\n<p>Promotes hair growth</p>\n<p>Improves scalp health</p>\n<p>Moisturizes hair</p>\n<p>Strengthens hair strands</p>\n<p>Protects hair from damage</p>\n<p>Reduces hair shedding</p>\n<p>Prevents dandruff and dry scalp</p>\n<p>Reduces scalp inflammation</p>\n<p>Improves hair thinning</p>\n<h3>How to Make Rosemary and Castor Oil for Hair Growth</h3>\n<p>2 tablespoons <a href=\"https://bit.ly/45wFcID\">cold-pressed castor oil</a></p>\n<p>1 tablespoon <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4mvm8Ax\">jojoba oil</a>, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4fRGRvF\">coconut oil</a>, or other carrier oil </p>\n<p>5-10 drops <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4mxwnnV\">rosemary essential oil</a></p>\n<p>In a small glass or ceramic bowl, combine the castor oil, carrier oil, and rosemary essential oil.</p>\n<p>Fill the sink with a few inches of warm water. Then, place the bowl in the warm water (don’t let any spill over the top). Let it sit for a few minutes to warm the oils.</p>\n<p>The warmth from the mixture helps your pores open up and absorb more of the oil. Make sure you don’t microwave it though, because it can reduce the potency and degrade the beneficial nutrients.</p>\n<p>Wet your scalp and then use your fingertips to apply the oil blend directly onto your scalp, section by section. Massage the oil gently into your skin with your fingers or a <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3HLcN8q\">scalp massager</a> for 3-5 minutes. (Use code TSC25 for 25% off the Pellequr scalp massager.)</p>\n<p><br/>Then, pour a dime-sized amount of oil into your palm and rub your hands together to warm it up. Starting from the mid-lengths, work your way down to the ends, smoothing the oil evenly through your hair. Repeat until all strands are lightly coated.</p>\n<p>Let the oil sit on your hair for 30 minutes to 2 hours. You could even let it sit overnight for a deep treatment, too. Just make sure to use a <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4msBZ2u\">shower cap</a> to protect your bedding.</p>\n<p>Make sure to shampoo thoroughly—we even recommend shampooing twice to remove all the oil and buildup. Then, condition your hair as usual for soft, refreshed strands.</p>\n<h3>How to Use Rosemary and Castor Oil for Hair Growth</h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/castor-oil-and-rosemary-oil-for-hair-recipe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

This summer has been wild with three kids but also nice and relaxing with lots of family time at home.</p>\n<p>If you want to hear about Bond’s birth story, you can listen to it <a href=\"https://tscpodcast.com/episodes/\">here</a>. In the episode I talk about what I did to prep for birth, the epidural, Panicky Susan, practices and products that have been crucial postpartum and how I plan on losing 25 lbs.</p>\n<p>Here are some essentials that have been helping me fit in self-care when time is tight, and things that have been keeping Zaza and Townes occupied this summer so I can soak up Bond in this special newborn stage.</p>\n<h2>My Postpartum Lifesavers</h2>\n<p><strong>Ice Roller:</strong> First thing in the morning, throughout the day, in the evening you’ll catch me <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/how-to-use-an-ice-roller/\">ice rolling</a>. It’s a nice pick-me-up and the depuffing happens instantly. The <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/mint-roller\">Mint Roller</a> has been such a necessity for my sore nipples, too. Speaking of sore nipples, if you’re breastfeeding you have to try these <a href=\"https://bit.ly/45X8iQi\">Silverettes</a>.</p>\n<p>And while we’re talking about ICE, these <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4mLp7Fa\">Frida Mom instant ice pads</a> are amazing. You crack them and they get all cold and you put them in your underwear. So soothing post-birth.</p>\n<p><strong>Everything Spray:</strong> After I cleanse in the morning I love to use this mist. It’s hydrating, healing and you really can use it for everything. Use it as a toner, after a day in the sun, post-shave or as a wound remedy. (Use code SKINNY.)</p>\n<p><strong>Branch Basics:</strong> If there was ever a <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/your-non-toxic-product-guide/\">time to go non-toxic</a>, it’s with a new baby. From the cleaning concentrate to the laundry detergent, I feel confident using this around the house and on all of my kids’ clothes. (Use code SKINNY15.)</p>\n<p><strong>Beauty Salt:</strong> Now that I have 3 kids, I’m looking to streamline more than ever. Knowing that I get 3 supplements in one efficient scoop and that I’m hydrating properly with beauty benefits is a crucial way to start my day.</p>\n<p>It’s unflavored so I like to <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4oXFzTX\">froth it up</a> with Cymbiotika’s <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-24038909\">elderberry</a> or <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-24038961\">Vitamin C</a>. It’s like a little mocktail with health benefits. You can check out all our favorite Cymbiotika supplements <a href=\"https://partners.cymbiotika.com/TSC\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Claw clip:</strong> When I’m holding my newborn, I want my hair out of his face and off my neck and shoulders. Especially if they’re nursing or sleeping, the last thing you need is your hair tickling them awake. I love these claw clips because they’re big, easy to use and super cute to have in all your bags or around the house. </p>\n<p><strong>Pajamas:</strong> I’m a pajama connoisseur and I really stocked up before the baby came. These ones are so comfy (I have tons) and make you feel cute when you’re hanging around the house in a baby daze. I adore this collab with Eden Rock. When I was at the hospital I wore baby blue ones by <a href=\"https://djerfavenue.com/en-us/go-slow-pj-shirt-blue/\">Djerf Avenue</a> and they are the COMFIEST.</p>\n<p>You can shop everything <a href=\"https://www.shopltk.com/explore/laurynbosstick/productsets/11f055ef920ff5d68edd0242ac110019?utm_source=Klaviyo&amp;utm_medium=campaign&amp;utm_campaign=6%2F30+Lauryn%27s+Postpartum+Must-Haves&amp;utm_klaviyo_id=&amp;_kx=_eqU_s1fa4WWy8azfU4uPg.SDGCtL\">here</a>.

We’re also exposed to it from artificial things like cell phones, Wi-Fi routers, radio broadcasts, smart meters, and even home appliances.</p>\n<p>Here’s the thing: you need to protect yourself from all kinds of radiation. We put on <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/sunscreen?selling_plan=4150296669\">SPF</a> to protect our skin from the sun, right? But what about when it comes to protecting ourselves from our phones and other Bluetooth devices?</p>\n<p>The good news is that there are ways to block this artificial radiation, too. That way, you can keep your family safe from any potential harmful effects without unplugging from the modern world.</p>\n<p>Here’s how you can stay connected <i>and </i>protected:</p>\n<h2>How to Block Cell Phone Radiation + What You NEED to Know About EMF</h2>\n<p>The sun showers us with ultraviolet (UV) radiation, while our everyday devices emit electromagnetic field (EMF) radiation.</p>\n<p>Just like UV rays, this type of radiation is totally invisible. That’s why it’s so important to know exactly what it is, where it’s coming from, the potential risks, and, most importantly, how you can protect yourself.</p>\n<p>Before we jump into things, it’s important to note that <i>not</i> all EMFs are bad! Take electromagnetic therapy, for example, that uses electric fields to stimulate the body’s natural healing process. Sometimes they can do pretty amazing things… when they’re necessary. </p>\n<p>Just check out the Gary Brecka episode of <a href=\"https://tscpodcast.com/episodes/gary-brecka/\">The Him &amp; Her Show</a><i> </i>to learn more.</p>\n<h3>What Is EMF Radiation?</h3>\n<p>Electromagnetic field (EMF) radiation is made up of electric and magnetic fields working together. As a result, this is the invisible energy that’s all around us. It exists across the <i>entire </i>electromagnetic spectrum, which includes everything from the low-frequency waves from power lines to the higher-frequency RF radiation used by cell phones and Wi-Fi.</p>\n<p>Essentially, electromagnetic fields (EMFs) include lots of different frequencies. Some are so low we can’t see or feel them, like those from household appliances. Others, like visible light, are easily detectable by the naked eye. All of these are types of electromagnetic radiation, just at different energy levels.</p>\n<p>As we mentioned earlier, not all types of radiation deserve a red-flag warning. Just like spending time in the sun has its benefits, certain frequencies of EMFs can be helpful, too. You can learn more about that from longevity expert Gary Brecka in our post <a href=\"https://tscpodcast.com/superhuman-protocol/\">What is the Superhuman Protocol?</a></p>\n<h3>Is EMF Radiation Harmful?</h3>\n<p>There’s a lot of debate about whether EMF radiation causes adverse health effects, but there is NOT a debate over whether it impacts our bodies. Even the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-electromagnetic-fields\">World Health Organization </a>acknowledges EMFs absolutely have biological effects.</p>\n<p>So the question is: Does long-term exposure to EMFs at <i>any </i>frequency cause health problems?  There’s research out there that says it does, and health organizations are telling people to be mindful of exposure to be safe. </p>\n<p>Here are some problems EMF radiation may cause:</p>\n<p>Sometimes, exposure to EMF radiation can bring on headaches, fatigue, dizziness, brain fog, or even skin sensitivity. For some, it’s because of too much exposure, but others are just naturally more sensitive to these fields.</p>\n<p>Radiofrequency EMFs from cell phones, smartwatches, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth devices can trigger <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/oxidative-stress\">oxidative stress</a> in our bodies. When this stress isn’t kept in check, it can damage our cells and DNA.</p>\n<p>Over time, as our body’s repair systems and immune defenses weaken, abnormal cells may not get cleared out properly. This, in turn, can lead to an increased risk of cancerous tumor growth.</p>\n<p>DNA damage caused by ongoing oxidative stress can actually accelerate biological aging. This means your tissues, organs, and skin cells lose their ability to repair and regenerate effectively, making your body more vulnerable to wear and tear.</p>\n<p>As a result, you might start to look and feel physically older. We’re talking things like wrinkles, low energy, and slow healing times. This doesn’t just impact your health, it <i>also </i>impacts your self-esteem.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/how-to-block-cell-phone-radiation-what-you-need-to-know-about-emf/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The former distorts the Earth’s poles, making landmasses like Greenland and Antarctica <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/21/nx-s1-5508358/mercator-map-africa\">appear disproportionately</a> large. Advocates for the change argue that the map misrepresents and diminishes the world’s perception of the African continent. The Equal Earth map, on the other hand, enlarges the continent to more accurately reflect its relative size.</p>\n    <p>First devised in 1569 by Flemish cartographer Gerardus Mercator, the ubiquitous Mercator projection features<strong> </strong>longitude lines that are equally spaced vertically across the globe. Latitude lines, however, are unevenly spaced, with the gaps between them growing wider the further out they are from the equator. This scaling creates a distorted, stretched-out effect at the top and bottom of the Earth. As a result, Greenland appears about equal in size to the entire African continent, when in reality the latter is about<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/03/05/how-big-is-greenland/81597696007/\"> 14 times larger</a>, according to some estimates.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/De5V0-1200x2609.jpeg?resize=1200%2C2609&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>“The current size of the map of Africa is wrong,” Moky Makura, executive director of the nonprofit organization Africa No Filter, told <i>Reuters</i> in an interview about the Mercator map projection. “It’s the world’s longest misinformation and disinformation campaign, and it just simply has to stop.”</p>\n    <p>In the Equal Earth map projection, continents appear to more closely match their real relative sizes. Unlike the Mercator map, in which latitude and longitude lines meet at 90-degree angles, its lines are curved to reflect the earth’s spherical shape, leading to a more accurate portrayal of the African continent’s scale.</p>\n    <p>Some technology companies allow users to switch between map projections, but the Mercator remains the default on many services. A Google spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that users can choose between it and globe views of the Earth on its desktop Google Maps interface. The Google Maps mobile app, however, uses the Mercator map, according to <i>Reuters</i>.</p>\n    <p>The Correct the Map campaign launched a <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/correctthemap-to-show-africa-s-true-size?recruiter=1363623859&amp;recruited_by_id=31b50b20-d90f-11ef-a26d-ff384a668a53&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_campaign=petition_dashboard&amp;utm_medium=copylink\">petition</a> calling for the United Nations and the British Broadcasting Company (BCC) to adopt the Equal Earth map, encouraging other organizations to follow suit. The petition had garnered nearly 7,000 signatures as of the time of publication.</p>\n    <p>“This distortion isn’t just a cartographic error — it’s a narrative failure,” Correct the Map’s petition text reads. “In a world where size is often equated with power, misrepresenting Africa’s true scale reinforces harmful misconceptions about its geopolitical and economic significance.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035968/africa-wants-a-more-accurate-world-map/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Seven years in the making, the show is curated by Carmen C. Bambach, an Italian Renaissance art scholar in the museum’s Department of Drawings and Prints who previously worked on The Met’s blockbuster exhibitions <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2003/leonardo-da-vinci\"> Leonardo da Vinci: Master Draftsman</a> (2003) and </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/press-releases/michelangelo-2017-exhibitions\">(2017–18).</a>\n    </p>\n    <i>Michelangelo: Divine Draftsman and Designer</i>\n    <p>Many of these pieces, The Met’s Director Max Hollein said in a statement, have never before been shown together — making the exhibition an “exceptionally rare opportunity” to explore the depth of Raphael’s artistry.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Portrait-of-Baldassarre-Castiglione_1514-1516-1200x1489.jpg?resize=1200%2C1489&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Raphael: Sublime Poetry</i> will span the artist’s early years in Urbino to his untimely death at the age of 37 in Rome, tracing the development of his ideas and creative process across his lifetime in a roughly chronological order. Thematic presentations — including recent scientific research, preparatory drawings, and a focus on his approach to portraying women — will aim to contextualize Raphael’s practice in a new light.</p>\n    <p>Among the masterpieces on display will be Raphael’s oil portrait “<a href=\"https://www.raphaelpaintings.org/portrait-of-baldassare-castiglione.jsp\">Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione</a>” (1514–16), which depicts the eponymous Italian diplomat in an intimate, soft lighting and striking, realistic detail, and his tender “<a href=\"https://www.nga.gov/artworks/26-alba-madonna\">Virgin and Child with Infant Saint John the Baptist in a Landscape (The Alba Madonna)</a>” (1510), which showcases the artist’s expertise in color and balance.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/The-Head-and-Hands-of-Two-Apostles-Auxiliary-Cartoon-for-the-Transfiguration_ca-1519-20-1200x1651.jpg?resize=1200%2C1651&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Sublime Poetry</i> will notably examine Raphael’s work through the lens of his “unique artistic personality.” Vasari, in his extensive chapter on Raphael’s short but prolific life, praised not only the painter’s embodiment of Renaissance virtues but also his enviable social ease, which earned him friends, patrons, and the admiration of artists and assistants in his workshop.</p>\n    <p>“Nature created him as a gift to the world,” Vasari wrote. “After having been vanquished by art in the work of Michelangelo Buonarroti, it wished to be vanquished through Raphael by both art and moral habits as well.”</p>\n    <p>The show is slated to open on March 29 and run through June 28.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Portrait-of-a-Lady-with-a-Unicorn-1505-6-1200x1543.jpg?resize=1200%2C1543&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037141/a-landmark-raphael-retrospective-is-coming-to-the-met/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I cannot in good conscience comply with a culture of censorship, especially when it targets vulnerable communities.”</p>\n    <p>Sherald also cited other moments of political interference in the Smithsonian’s history in her essay, including former President Woodrow Wilson’s insistence that the institution implement Jim Crow racial segregation during his presidency in line with his <a href=\"https://calendar.eji.org/racial-injustice/apr/11\">segregation of the federal government</a> when he took office in 1913. Because the institution operates in a public-private arrangement, receiving funding from both federal and corporate sources, the Smithsonian <a href=\"https://siarchives.si.edu/history/featured-topics/African-Americans/american-negro-artists\">resisted</a> pressure from the White House.</p>\n    <p>But Sherald cautions that there have since been successful efforts to influence the content of the institution’s museums. A 2010 campaign by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/dec/01/smithsonian-pulls-christ-video\">right-wing Catholic League</a> led the National Portrait Gallery to remove a video work by David Wojnarowicz depicting Jesus being eaten by ants, a commentary on the federal government’s homophobia and failure to take action during the HIV/AIDS epidemic.</p>\n    <p>In her essay, the artist invoked a quote by former Metropolitan Museum of Art Director Philippe de Montebello: “A museum is the memory of mankind.”</p>\n    <p>“If that is true, then to manipulate museums is to manipulate who we believe we are,” she wrote of the quote. “Control the memory and you control the future.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037072/amy-sherald-speaks-out-on-cancelling-her-smithsonian-show/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>HAMBURG, Germany — “Ok, stop the cameras,” the head conservator commanded from the belly of the storage department. “I want to hear what these instruments sound like without Satch wearing the gloves.” The other assembled staff, seated in a scatter of folding chairs beneath the MARKK ethnographic museum in Hamburg, lowered their phones and tucked them away.</p>\n<p>These museum workers had gathered in the MARKK’s basement to oversee and document artist and musician Satch Hoyt “un-mute” the African instrument collection, as he calls it. A masterful player of wind and percussion alike, Hoyt has been working to gain access to African instrument collections in colonial and ethnographic museums so that they may be played again. Within certain African diasporic traditions, some of these instruments are understood as tools to communicate with the creator and ancestors. Thus, this un-muting is not a mere symbolic act protesting the enforced dormancy of museum storage, but an affirmation of fluid continuity between the living and ancestral realms.</p>\n<p>Surrounded by masks and statues in the dimly lit storage den, who seemed to be watching, Hoyt dispensed with the white archival gloves he had previously been instructed to wear. He then began, gently, to play a sanza.</p>\n<p>“And then,” Hoyt recalls, “It was — <i>Pffuuumm</i>, you could just feel the energy all of a sudden in the room.” Touching the instrument with bare skin invited a rush that the gloves had shielded. “There was a feeling of gratitude,” he said, “of ‘Oh, cool — somebody’s reactivating this instrument.’ Somebody’s actually, finally returning it to its proper use.” Hoyt grinned. “It was like they were going, ‘Yeah, we needed to hear this’” — “they,” in this case, referring not to the MARKK staff watching as he acquainted himself with the museum’s African instruments, but to the audience of masks and statues overhead. “If it happens, you just feel it,” he said, referring to the rush of presence he feels when an instrument has been successfully “un-muted.” As soon as you put your lips on the embouchure, a certain feeling happens….”</p>\n<p>Born in London in 1957 to an English mother and a Jamaican father, Hoyt’s early acculturation came at a time when the British Empire was in free fall, as many of its colonies, including Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, and Uganda, had recently won their independence. Artists, intellectuals, and musicians of the African diaspora converged on the fallen and swinging capital, forging a new era of Pan-African thought. Hoyt’s early mentors were of this milieu, including the Trini filmmaker Horace Ové and the exiled South African jazz trumpeter and flautist Mongezi Feza. In Australia, he was embraced by the First Nations painters Clifford Possum, Turkey Tolson Tjupurrula, and Johnny Warangkula Tjupurrula. Later on in New York, he ran with the pioneering Afrofuturist MC and visual artist <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/tag/rammellzee/\">Rammellzee</a>, as well as cultural critic and musician Greg Tate and the band Burnt Sugar the Arkestra Chamber. In Paris, he accompanied Louise Bourgeois on recordings of her poetry and composed for Grace Jones. His list of friends and collaborators is long and illustrious, but nowadays, Hoyt is increasingly focused on ancestral ties, and is coordinating recording dates in museum basements instead of commercial studios. </p>\n<p>The process of “un-muting” first occurred to Hoyt in 2017 at the Berlin phonographic archive, while he was studying the wax cylinders that archaeologist Leo Frobenius recorded in the Congo a century before.<strong> </strong>Wax cylinder recordings typically feature a bed of unruly static, through which distant intimations of highs can be heard. The rest — overtones, textural detail, any semblance of bass or mid-range frequencies — is left to the imagination. Unsatisfied with daydreaming, Hoyt decided to cut a new path.</p>\n<p>“With the phonographic recordings that Frobenius did, afterwards, he acquired the instruments that people had been playing. So, I thought, ‘Well, we’ve got all of these instruments, which are in these ethnographic museums. I can play them. I’ve collected them over years, and they should be sounded.’”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037093/satch-hoyt-artist-freeing-museum-musical-instruments/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In April 2025, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/22/nx-s1-5340753/trump-democracy-authoritarianism-competive-survey-political-scientist\"> NPR reported</a> that in a survey of over 500 political scientists, the majority believed that the United States was moving from a liberal democracy toward authoritarianism. And that was before June, when regular Americans took to the streets in record numbers to oppose it. Over </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-parade-turnout-protest-no-kings-millions-1235365602/\">5 million turned out</a>to support the “</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1020681/photos-capture-millions-marching-in-epic-no-kings-protests/\">No Kings</a>” marches across the country on June 14 to protest Trump’s policies and a “military parade” on his birthday, budgeted at</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://au.news.yahoo.com/army-reveals-scale-damage-done-130929092.html\">$45 million</a>. But where can we turn to for resistance strategies? Might the historical rise of authoritarianism in the ancient world help us understand its rapid expansion today? A freely downloadable book by top ancient historians across the globe,</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783111705446/html\">(De Gruyter, 2025),</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>argues that it can.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>In the new anthology, edited by Frederik Juliaan Vervaet, David Rafferty, and Christopher J. Dart, the authors collectively claim that readers can use Ancient Roman history to make sense of the rapid descent into fascism in the United States. A key reason for choosing Rome as a parallel to America is the extraordinary nature of the moment we are living in.</p>\n<p>“Before now, no long-established democracy has fallen to internal causes except Rome,” the editors told <i>Hyperallergic</i> in a statement. “Several of the old, consolidated democracies around the world are in trouble, and political science has only recently started to confront that as a problem; they are used to thinking of consolidated democracies as pretty safe.” </p>\n<p>The book treats the late Roman Republic as a dataset. Although the editors noted that Rome did not have the same scope in terms of policing, healthcare, or inflation controls, they explained that democratic decay or creeping authoritarianism is primarily about “interactions of political institutions, about the relative power of the different parts of the state.” While comparisons between Rome and America are nothing new, <i>How Republics Die </i>analyzes these empires’ parallel lives to underscore the consistent methods used by autocrats to shift societies away from dissent, democracy, or independent thinking, toward a triumphalist narrative of the past that culminates in their own ascent. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.walksinrome.com/blog/maps-and-mussolini-via-dei-fori-imperiali-rome\">four large maps</a>that showed Rome’s ascent and empire from 753 BCE to 117 CE, along with a new map of Italy’s future conquest of Africa in 1936, which had to be removed because the campaign was a failure.

(image public domain via the</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/maps/2022/03/out-and-about-in-a-provincial-empire-of-fascism/\">Library of Congress</a>)</p>\n<p>Although the United States became a “<a href=\"https://www.colonialwilliamsburg.org/discover/civics/was-the-united-states-founded-as-a-republic-or-a-democracy/\">mixed government</a>” predicated on republican and democratic models of governance, Rome adopted a republican model in 509 BCE. This came in the wake of the overthrow of the city’s last king. Four centuries after Rome’s Republic began, the underpinnings of the state and the explicit policies that limited the power of ambitious politicians began to erode rapidly. The book looks particularly at this period from the end of the Roman Republic to the rise of the Augustan New Order (133 BCE to 14 CE) — a time when Rome began to transition from an electoral republic to a military monarchy. Vervaet, Rafferty, and Dart told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that the decades marking Rome’s shift from a republic into an autocracy were heavily influenced by the arts. They also suggest how we might cross-compare Ancient Rome and America with other moments of rising authoritarianism around the world, such as in India and Belarus.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037152/an-ancient-roman-guide-to-donald-trump-authoritarian-playbook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>OTTAWA — I first encountered multidisciplinary artist Skawennati in person at her December 2019 talk at the former McLuhan Centre for Communication and Technology in Toronto. I recall that the artist wore Barbie-doll pink; I later learned that she is a Barbie fan.</p>\n<p>At the talk, Skawennati introduced herself as both an urban Kanien’kehá:ka (Mohawk) woman and a cyberpunk avatar. She discussed her longtime practice of costuming avatars in cyberspace as a means of realizing Indigenous peoples’ self-determination. This work takes place on a thriving, futuristic island built and maintained by the research-creation studio, Aboriginal Territories in Cyberspace (AbTeC), in the virtual world, Second Life. Later, she shared work-in-progress documentation for the project <i>Calico &amp; Camouflage</i> (2020–22), a fashion line of Turtle Island “resistance wear” — her interpretation of traditional ribbon shirts and combat pants as Kanien’kehá:ka protest gear — for both avatars and IRL models. </p>\n<p>At the time, I was taken by Skawennati’s commitment to working within a massive multiplayer virtual world that was, in my view, a ghost town. She was adamant that if the platform were to “sunset,” she would stop making her avatars: “In the end, I know it’s not mine,” she shared with me in a 2020 interview for <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-in-america/features/skawennati-abtec-island-indigenous-community-second-life-1202693110/\">an  Art in America profile</a>. The Montreal-based artist utilizes these characters, as well as settings and backdrops she has built and designed in AbTeC, for her machinimas and machinimagraphs — films and photography produced within virtual worlds. “That’s why I take lots of pictures, lots of documentation. As long as you know you’re not actually in control, you have a lot of control.” </p>\n<p><i>Skawennati: Welcome to the Dreahouse</i>at the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa. Foreground: the diptych “Dancing with Myself” (2015); background: “Birth of an Avatar (Homage to Mariko Mori)” (2017)</p>\n<p>Yet, as her current National Gallery of Canada (NGC) mid-career survey <i> Skawennati: Welcome to the Dreamhouse</i> proves, the trajectory of the past 25 years of her work lies not only in these machinimas and machinimagraphs, but also in her burgeoning work with fashion. The </p>\n<p><i>Calico &amp; Camouflage</i>collection was part of a turn in her understanding of the virtual as increasingly hybrid performative experiences involving garment-based sculptures and textiles. Within the NGC exhibition catalog, contributors Cheryl Sim and Mojeanne Sarah Behzadi make the case for how formative Skawennati’s engagement with fashion has been to her work overall. As exhibition curator Wahsontiio Cross, of the NGC, writes in the accompanying catalog, her creation of fashion and textiles has resulted in the artist finally “bring[ing] her idea of the future into the present.”</p>\n<p>The exhibition design for <i>Welcome to the Dreamhouse</i>, in which each room is perfectly structured for its intended purpose, is reminiscent of the Barbie Dreamhouse, aligning Skawennati’s multidisciplinary works with open-ended play. However, the artist clarified in conversation with <i>Hyperallergic</i> that she and Cross were drawn toward the “dreamhouse” concept for its aspirational potential. “A dreamhouse feels attainable. It might take work, but people think they can achieve it. I wanted to say with this show, this concept, this title, that a peaceful and just future is attainable.”</p>\n<p>Among the longstanding themes that carry through the show, a core motif is Indigenous futurism, wherein the pain of the colonial past is worked through a “future imaginary.” The term, coined by Skawennati’s partner and frequent collaborator, Jason Edward Lewis, reclaims historical narratives and centers Indigenous peoples in “exploring new cultural configurations that will enable us not just to survive, but thrive.”</p>\n<p>Across different galleries, visitors encounter new and old characters from the artist’s moving and still image works. Many involve Indigenous sci-fi retellings of Hotinonshón:ni cosmology and histories, ranging from the creation story told in “She Falls For Ages” (2017) to the ancestral narrative of the Iroquois confederation, updated to the year 3025, in “The Peacemaker Returns” (2017).</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036805/skawennati-cyberpunk-future-is-now-national-gallery-canada/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Sure, it may not be *that* cold out yet, but there’s something about the nostalgia of the season that comes flooding back with every bowl I make. (That and there’s always <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/07/5-summer-recipes-that-will-indulge-your-inner-child/\">gazpacho</a> for warmer days, right?) <br/>While I have a go-to list of fall soup recipes I lean on, I’m always up for refreshing it. (After the year we had, a refresher definitely felt in order!) Therefore, I took it to the internet to add a few more into rotation for this season, and I’m here to share my winning options with you today. So in the name of all that’s cozy and comforting, let’s dive in, shall we?</p>\n    <p>An oldie but a goodie, this soup always sounds like a good option. For this recipe specifically, underneath the bubbly layer of melted cheese (which I love oh-so-much) you’ll find two *secret* additions that make it really hit the spot. Click the link below to see what I’m talking about!</p>\n    <p>It wasn’t until later in life that I discovered my love for mushrooms. (And I’m so glad I did!) This vegan and gluten-free soup is one of the reasons for this, because of its creamy consistency and nourishing ingredients. It’s safe to say I will be making this once the first day of chilly temps hits.</p>\n    <p>Speaking of something I came to love later in life, soba noodles also make the list. I love their slurp-able qualities, especially when floating in a flavorful, savory broth. For cold season coming up, I’m convinced this is a perfect antidote!</p>\n    <p>My grandma used to make a variation of this recipe when we’d visit her on winter days. In fact, just looking at this recipe, I can practically taste the familiar herby goodness greeting my mouth. I like this rendition both for its flexibility (you can adjust based on what you have on hand) and budget-friendly ingredient list. Therefore, it’s a win-win in my book!</p>\n    <p>Soup season would be nothing without a little chili in the mix! Thanks to a little help from my favorite Cello cheese (their cheese is seriously so rich and delicious), we can make the ultimate comfort food to welcome the new season (and maybe watch a football game or two!).</p>\n    <p>I’m always looking for a recipe in which I can incorporate chickpeas, aka my favorite source of plant-based protein. The moment I laid eyes on this dish, which also uses my favorite spices—ginger and turmeric—I knew it would make my list!</p>\n    <p>Seafood lovers, rejoice! This ensemble, complete with homemade stock, is the ideal transitional soup to take you from summer to fall.</p>\n    <p>Last but not least is this colorful and zesty vegetarian recipe! Packed with sweet potatoes, fire-roasted tomatoes, and corn, it’s filling and fiber-rich. Better yet, it can be made in minutes thanks to the holy-grail kitchen appliance, <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/11/ive-owned-the-instant-pot-for-5-years-heres-my-honest-review/\">the Instant Pot</a>! (Psst! Don’t have one? Don’t worry, you can make this over the stovetop too!)</p>\n    <p>Sarah Schuh is a copywriter and freelance writer living in Chicago.

These reviews are intended to provide detailed information on products that may be of interest to you, so if and when you’re in the market for a given item, you have all the info you need to decide whether to make a purchase.</p>\n<p>The DRx SpectraLite™ FaceWare Pro is an FDA-cleared face mask from Dr. Dennis Gross that uses red and blue LED light therapy. The <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-7715167\">blue light</a> treats acne and evens skin tone and texture, while the <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-7715178\">red light</a> smooths lines, supports natural collagen production to firm skin, treats signs of sun damage, and treats inflammation.</p>\n<p>I have sensitive, dry skin that is starting to show fine lines. I also have dark spots on my nose and cheeks and I often deal with my skin looking a bit dull and red. Occasionally, I have mild hormonal acne. Because I have sensitive skin, I have to be careful with acids and harsh serums. Before I bought this mask, I had recently been diagnosed with early-stage rosacea. I noticed I was getting really red on my nose and cheeks when drinking alcohol, having spicy food, or being in the sun for a prolonged period.<i> </i></p>\n<p>I bought this mask in May 2024. I had previously tried the <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-7553836\">Solawave Wand</a> and found my skin benefited from red light therapy. With the Solawave Wand, I noticed some improvements in my skin pigment and texture. I noticed my dark spots looked minimized and my skin looked more radiant and firm.<br/>I wanted to invest a little more in an LED mask I could simply leave on without needing to manually move it to each part of my face. <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-6562814\">The Dr. Dennis Gross LED mask</a> is designed to treat the issues I noted above, like fine lines, dark spots, redness, and acne.<br/>Before I bought the Dr. Dennis Gross LED mask, I had purchased <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3B2Kajq\">this $150 LED mask</a> and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3XqwdTJ\">this $70 LED mask</a> through Amazon. I returned them both because they didn’t charge or stay on my face well. I was also worried about using a device sold by a third-party vendor, especially when using bright light so close to my eyes. Ultimately, I decided I wanted to try a product from a more reputable, well-researched brand. The Dr. Dennis Gross mask is FDA-cleared, which means it is a professional-grade LED therapy. </p>\n<p>I try to use the mask daily. Realistically, I use it about three days a week, because you know, life. To use, I wash my face and pat it dry, place the device on my face, turn it on, and use it for the programmed duration of three minutes.<br/>There are three modes: red anti-aging mode, blue anti-acne mode, and combined red and blue light mode. I usually do the red light mode. Afterward, I apply my normal skin products. <br/>This mask can be used morning or night. For best results, the brand recommends daily use—consistency is key! For more information, reference <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-7715195\">the full list of instructions</a> from Dr. Dennis Gross.</p>\n<p>With regular use, I’ve noticed the fine lines on my face are minimized and the redness has improved to the point it is not noticeable anymore. I’ve also noticed an improvement with hormonal acne. My cheeks have fewer dark spots but my nose continues to be a problem area that I am going to consult my dermatologist about at my next appointment. Overall, this product has been effective for me so far and I’m eager to continue using it long-term.</p>\n<p>No. I’ve used it regularly for four months and I have no complaints. It keeps a charge for a long time and is durable. I love the comfortable silicone lining too!</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/09/dr-dennis-gross-spectralite-faceware-pro-led-mask-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Maybe they’ve got a gift for being super organized and calm while juggling all the moving parts of getting a meal to the table. And then there are the rest of us, those who want to have people over but get tangled up in all the reasons to postpone.<br/>Hosting doesn’t have to be formal. It doesn’t have to look like my parties or any others you see on Instagram. <strong>The point of entertaining is to gather people to spend time together—regardless of the size of your home or your cooking skill level. </strong>Even without the pressure of comparison, it can be overwhelming to think of everything you have to do before and during such an occasion.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://housecall.substack.com/p/how-to-have-people-over\">I want you to have people over.</a> So I asked my friend (and generous host) <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lisahackwith/\">Lisa</a> to collaborate on a new entertaining series on Wit &amp; Delight called “Come Over For…” In each post, we’ll share all the essential information for hosting a delightful party around a specific theme or idea, including a timeline for the day before and the day of, a detailed grocery list, and recipes for each menu item. The series aims to make it easy to replicate these kinds of occasions for your group of friends or family.<br/>Lisa and I have been cooking and sharing meals for a long time. She entertains beautifully and is a gracious, calm host for big parties and small dinners alike. She’s also an incredible cook and has been developing her own recipes. She created all of the recipes in this post! By collaborating on this series, we’re exploring a richer approach to hosting that combines both of our styles and expertise.</p>\n<p>Beyond cooking and entertaining, Lisa is the founder of <a href=\"https://hackwithdesignhouse.com/\">Hackwith Design House</a> and a multi-hyphenate creative who’s good at everything she does. And, importantly, she’s confident in her abilities to create. I admire this about her so much because half the battle of creating is being willing to try. <br/>Lisa and I wanted to keep every recipe and step in this series light and doable. It’s entertaining without all the extra fuss. It’s a reminder that a simple approach to hosting can still feel special.</p>\n<p>For the first iteration, we curated a casual dinner party that’s easy, beautiful, delicious, and memorable. A tall order to fill but we did it! The menu for this casual dinner party is meant to be easy to bring to the table but still special. It’s vegetarian, filling, and delicious, so everyone will be satisfied. <br/>Here’s the menu, including a cocktail to start the evening:</p>\n<p>Whenever I’m hosting a dinner party, these are the things I like to keep in mind to ensure a low-stress, enjoyable evening.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forms.gle/gGMcSDGs1TcqPYDZ7\">We’ve taken care of this for you</a>! When creating a menu for a dinner party, I like to consider the number of people attending and what steps it takes to get the food to the table. This menu is perfect for up to six people but can easily be scaled up without much effort.<br/>Here’s another tip: If you’re cooking a new dish and want to practice making it, consider doing a trial run first. Make it a week or so before the party for your family or yourself so you can get comfortable with the steps.</p>\n<p>Plan the prep so you’re not feeling rushed the evening of your dinner party. Lisa and I put together <a href=\"https://forms.gle/gGMcSDGs1TcqPYDZ7\">a timeline</a> for what needs to be done beforehand and leading up to the party so you have an idea of how to pace yourself and the evening.<br/>For more tips on planning, creating a guest list, and sending invitations, read this post: “<a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/08/how-to-plan-a-dinner-party/\">How to Plan a Dinner Party: My Best Tips to Simplify the Process</a>.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/08/casual-dinner-party/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>As the seasons shift and we transition into the fall, I take stock of my closet and make a plan for edits, purchases, and repairs. I like to think of it as a “back to basics” approach. This isn’t about trends; it’s about timeless pieces that define your personal style. Much of my core style has been inspired by a classic French look. Whenever I find myself getting caught up in trends, this anchors me back to a place where I can make solid purchasing decisions that will add some oomph to an already solid foundation.  <br/>Sézane recently launched an extensive collection of classic pieces that are perfect for rounding out what might be missing in your wardrobe. Think of it as a “French Core” collection—iconic pieces that will not only be in stock now but will also remain essentials long after the latest monthly edit.</p>\n<p>The Vassili jacket is the epitome of effortless style, blending the structure of a blazer with the casual ease of a jacket. Made from high-quality materials, this piece is perfect for layering over anything—from a simple tee to a blouse. Pair it with jeans for a relaxed look or throw it over a dress for a more polished vibe. The Vassili jacket works seamlessly with both casual and dressier pieces, making it a must-have for any wardrobe.<strong>Fit Notes:</strong> I’m wearing a size small and could have sized up.</p>\n<p>The Peter skirt brings a touch of classic femininity to your wardrobe. Its navy color adds a sense of sophistication, while the A-line shape flatters every body type. Whether you’re dressing for work or a weekend brunch, this skirt will be your go-to.

This skirt is a workhorse!<strong>Fit Notes:</strong> It runs big! Size down.</p>\n<p>The length of the Martin crop trousers makes them ideal for transitioning between seasons, and the tailored fit ensures they’re as flattering as they are stylish. Pair these trousers with a simple tee and sneakers for a casual look, or dress them up with a blouse and heels. They’re versatile enough to take you from a day at work to an evening out.<strong>Fit Notes:</strong> These run small—size up if you are in between sizes.</p>\n<p>Mary Janes are a timeless shoe style, and the Mélanie Mary Janes take this classic silhouette and elevate it with a modern twist. Their patent black finish adds a touch of sophistication, making them suitable for both casual and formal occasions. Pair the Mélanie Mary Janes with anything from dresses to trousers. Their versatility makes them a key piece in your wardrobe, offering endless styling possibilities. The heel isn’t too high, making it a great shoe for a wedding or any other occasion that requires you to dress up for long periods.<strong>Fit Notes:</strong> These run true to size.</p>\n<p>No wardrobe is complete without a little black dress, and the Nicia dress reimagines this classic piece with subtle yet stylish details. It is VERY Françoise Hardy! Its simple silhouette makes it incredibly versatile, while the high-quality wool fabric ensures it’s a piece you’ll reach for time and time again.

Between the gorgeous <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/homemade-cinnamon-spice-potpourri/\">fall scents</a> to the upcoming time with your family it’s maybe the best season of the year.</p>\n<p>And fall fashion? We’re here for it.<br/>One thing we’re NOT so pumped for though, is seasonal skin changes.<br/>It’s that time of year when the air outside gets cooler and drier, and our skincare routines need some modification to keep up with the environment. Because drier air = drier, duller skin. </p>\n<p>So how best to keep your skin bouncy and beautiful year-round?<br/>As always, we’ve looked into it for you. We’ve got all the info you need to keep your skin glowing and healthy all year long.</p>\n<h2>6 Créme de la Créme Fall Skin Care Tips</h2>\n<p>To get the most out of your fall skincare routine, you’ve got to know how the changes in weather actually affect your skin. You don’t want to overdo it, after all—if you’re moving all the way from light skincare to <a href=\"https://health.clevelandclinic.org/slugging\">slugging</a>, but your face is only slightly more dry than in the summer, you might end up with a completely different problem. That’s not the move.</p>\n<p>Everyone’s skin is different, and many of us are dealing with different types of weather changes. So, before we get into what to do about your seasonal skin change, let’s talk about what that change actually looks like for you.</p>\n<h3>How Does Cold Weather Affect Skin?</h3>\n<p>The biggest thing affecting your skin as the seasons change is the humidity. As the weather gets cooler, humidity levels tend to drop as well.</p>\n<p>While this can be amazing for those of us whose hair tends to change styles in the humidity, it can also dry out our skin, leaving our summer skincare struggling to keep up. <a href=\"https://www.aad.org/news/cold-weather-and-your-skin#:~:text=Due%20to%20the%20drop%20in,healthy%20during%20the%20colder%20months.\">Dry, cold air can also make fine lines and wrinkles more noticeable</a>.</p>\n<p>But, it’s not just the air outside that’s stealing all your hydration—it’s the air inside, too. When you turn on the heat or kindle an indoor fire, the indoor moisture is sucked out of the air as well. So even when you get inside, your skin may still be suffering.</p>\n<p>Don’t sweat it. We’ve got the ideas you need to stay hydrated and baby soft this fall and winter.</p>\n<h3>Here’s Exactly How To Take Care Of Your Skin In The Fall</h3>\n<p>The first thing you can do to combat the dry air for your skin is to LITERALLY combat the dry air. Put some humidity back into your life. Your skin will thank you.</p>\n<p>Lauryn’s so obsessed with this humidifier, she actually designed <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/the-dreamy-humidifier-of-your-dreams-has-launched-and-its-by-the-skinny-confidential/\">her own</a>. It was limited edition but you can still get the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4fTCGhL\">bedside humidifier</a> AND a <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3GmEUYl\">TSC aroma diffuser</a> from the Canopy, and they really work.</p>\n<p>As the air gets drier both inside and out, we need to boost our skincare products to add and lock in moisture.</p>\n<p>Let’s start at the beginning: You’ll need a fragrance-free cleanser, like <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3AKPQig\">this one Lauryn loves</a>, that gently removes makeup and environmental residue from your face. </p>\n<p>It’s a good idea to get fragrance-free body wash as well. Even if your skin type isn’t sensitive, you’ll have more sensitive skin in the fall/winter. Fragrances and <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/the-best-beauty-products-for-senstive-skin/\">sensitive skin</a> do NOT get along.</p>\n<p>After cleansing, follow your normal skin care routine, but consider swapping out your products for more hydrating versions. You’ll want to look for products with humectants like hyaluronic acid and glycerin. This <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3Of3XPV\">Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream</a> has both.</p>\n<p>Reducing the frequency of treatments that dry your skin can help prevent weather-related irritation, as well as swapping light lotions for heavier creams.</p>\n<p>As ALWAYS, you’ll need to protect your skin from sun damage by using a product with at least SPF 30.<br/>HOT TIP: The best sunscreen on the block is the <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/sunscreen?selling_plan=1819443293\">Caffeinated Sunscreen</a> from TSC. It’s SPF 40, caffeinated, and super nourishing.</p>\n<p>For a super moisturizing skin care routine, check out Lauryn’s <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/my-exact-korean-skincare-routine-and-why-i-love-it/\">Korean skincare routine</a> or her <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/my-updated-skincare-routine/\">go-to routine</a> that she always updates.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/fall-skin-care-tips/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>There are people in my life who are the most wonderful gift givers—always thoughtful, always unique, always spot-on. I’ve learned some lessons from these friends and family members on how to be a really excellent gift giver, and I’m sharing them with you today. These gift-giving ideas apply to any occasion—from holidays to birthdays and every little celebration in between. Here’s to sharing meaningful gifts with the people we love.</p>\n    <p>People tell you what they love, and thoughtful gift-giving starts with <i>listening</i> in those moments. With everyone in my life, I’ve been listening to what they say and tuning into what excites them. I keep an ear out for gift ideas all year round so I’m not rushing when the holidays (or birthdays) arrive.<br/>Have they started a new hobby? Ask how it’s going and glean inspiration from there. Are they making a big transition into retirement or moving across the country? Listen for ways to help out, celebrate, or honor the milestone. The best gifts are the ones that show someone you notice the little things they’re loving or pursuing. </p>\n    <p>Don’t count on yourself to remember the ideas you pick up through all of your listening. Figure out a way to collect the information and organize it. I mainly use the iPhone Notes app. Joe and I have a shared note with a list of the birthdays of people in our lives. Underneath each name, I’ll write down thought starters for gifts and things I know they enjoy. I also save some ideas verbally in the Voice Memos app, which is an easy way to get ideas out of my head in the moment so I can revisit them later.</p>\n    <p>If you’re stuck, don’t be afraid to ask the person for a short list of exactly what they want. Some people shy away from being this direct or think it takes the magic out of gifting. I think it’s a perfectly reasonable way to ensure you’re giving a gift that will be used and enjoyed. When I ask for a list, I find the gifting experience just as enjoyable as when I think of gift ideas on my own. This leads me to my next point…</p>\n    <p>Don’t worry about coming up with the “perfect” gift idea. You don’t have to surprise them with something unexpected either! Choosing a gift from their wish list is a wonderful way to delight them <i>and</i> get them something they really want. I got Joe a specific pair of shoes he asked for on his birthday, and his reaction was as if it was a total surprise. He was so excited!! It reminded me that true surprises are overrated sometimes. </p>\n    <p>Watch out for the temptation to overcompensate, especially when you’re not sure what your giftee wants. When it comes to gift-giving, we often end up spending too much, which makes everyone uncomfortable. I think of the episode of <i>The Office</i> where Michael gave a video iPod in the group exchange when the spending limit was $20. <br/>Often, sentimental gifts mean as much (if not more) than costly items. For Joe’s birthday this year, I recorded a video about why I love him and the kids did too. It was a unique way to capture this moment in time and it didn’t cost a thing. If overcompensating is a pattern of yours, hopefully the ideas in this post will help you avoid it! <br/>For more gift-giving inspiration, I’ll be sharing my holiday gift guide on Wit &amp; Delight this month! Until then, browse <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/11/holiday-gift-guide-2023/\">last year’s gift guide</a> to get the gift ideas flowing.</p>\n    <p>Kate is the founder of Wit &amp; Delight.

    "body": "<p>Swapping favorite reads is my favorite form of social currency. I devoured some really special books this year and felt it was the right time to compile a list of the ones that stayed on my mind long after I read the last page. My criteria for what makes a read share-worthy extends beyond just liking the book. Many of these authors made me feel uncomfortable and squeamish, and that’s how I like it—but that’s not to say I don’t enjoy an escapist book.<br/>Today I’m sharing a short and incomplete list of the books I couldn’t stop talking about this year.</p>\n<p>Ever heard of a “Messy Perfectionist” before? Katherine Morgan Schafler’s <i>The Perfectionist’s Guide to Losing Control</i> resonated with me deeply because it delves into the origins and complexities of perfectionism, offering a 360-degree perspective on the many ways it manifests itself. I found Schafler’s insights and personal anecdotes refreshing. She suggests we discard the label “recovering perfectionist” (one I have subscribed to) and instead look at perfectionism as a superpower to be harnessed for good rather than hold us back. <br/>I read this book twice this year and plan to pick it up again over the holiday break.</p>\n<p>In <i>Bittersweet</i>,<i> </i>Susan Cain explores the concept of bittersweetness and how embracing both positive and negative emotions can lead to a richer and more fulfilling life. Through beautiful personal stories and research, Cain argues bittersweetness is an essential part of the human experience and that it can help us appreciate the beauty and fragility of life.<br/>This book touched parts of myself I had long shuttered away as weird, sensitive, and something I should never express in public. Yet they’re so core to who I am. Susan Cain continues to be a champion for sensitive, quiet, deep thinkers.</p>\n<p><i>Slowing</i> is a guide to living a slower, more intentional life. It offers practical strategies for reducing stress, increasing mindfulness, and finding more joy in the present moment. This book is organized around the process of learning to slow down, which I found incredibly helpful. We can’t run before we can walk, and <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/10/how-to-slow-down/\">slowing down in adulthood</a> is most definitely a learned skill.</p>\n<p>A time-travel love story meets workplace comedy with the twists and turns of a spy thriller. This book defies genres and delighted me with its whip-smart prose and deeply human characters.</p>\n<p>Everyone has an opinion about this book. I love it like I do a flawed but well-intentioned friend. I admire the creative choices July makes in all her work. Her willingness to leave things unapologetically messy and self-serving made her the perfect artist to crash into the public domain, shouting about the indignities of being a woman of a certain age. Post-childbearing deserves to take center stage and be seen. There’s something about that feeling of wildness that precisely captures the awakening I’ve just started to experience, and I know I’m not alone. <br/>It is interesting to hear what people under <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/10/turning-40-lessons-learned/\">the age of forty</a> think about the book. They’re often wide-eyed, terrified, and turned off by its barbaric and messy nature. To them, I say, you’ll get it when you’re ready.</p>\n<p>This book is essential for anyone brave enough to take their creative expressions seriously. Turn to any page and find a reason to keep pursuing that nagging urge to make something meaningful from the mystery of intuition.</p>\n<p>Like so many of you, the poem that made Maggie Smith famous came at the exact time I needed it most. This is the story of what happened to her marriage and career afterward.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

Sorting needs versus wants can be a tricky business, akin to sorting out the opinions others have of you versus the ones you have of yourself—murky territory for lifelong people pleasers. Where do I begin and who should I be in the end?<br/>Here lies the link between our perceived worthiness and how we spend. And it is one of the reasons my relationship with money has never been great. <br/>This concept became starkly clear as I cataloged my closet using the digital app <a href=\"https://whering.co.uk/\">Whering</a>. I’ll write about this in another post because it’s incredibly helpful. The process itself made me <i>nauseated—</i>also up for discussion in a forthcoming post. My <i>stuff</i> is an accumulation of my personas—all pieces of a whole, but not the whole me. I am done carrying the weight of all that. <br/>I’ve taken a curious view of my spending habits—<i>sans shame</i>—and I can see both sides of the coin. I see products that I do not want to live without. And when I look at what I use <i>every single day</i>, it becomes clearer what needs to go. Focusing on what you really like makes it a lot easier to let go of what you don’t. <br/>If you had to pick up and move right now or downsize significantly, what would you take with you? What do you miss when you’re away from home? They are good questions to help narrow in on where your needs and wants align in a Venn diagram and pinpoint the products worth the spend. Here are mine at this moment in time.</p>\n<p><i>$850</i><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3qw4C42\">This espresso machine</a> is the first thing I touch in the morning. I use it multiple times a day and it has held up nicely over the past four years. Embarrassingly, I could not live without it.

What I love about this display is it’s physically hanging in my office. My family can track our calendar, routine, and to-do lists without needing to bug me for instructions or a list. Hearth also has a handy AI “helper” that allows you to text items that need to be added to your calendar. I send my kids’ sports schedules, lunches, field trips, and events in a text message and VOILA, they’re on the calendar. It’s the single best device I’ve added to our family’s life. <i>This product was gifted to me as part of a partnership.</i></p>\n<p><i>$278</i><br/>You can throw <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-7907352\">these silk PJs</a> in the wash and they feel great on your skin.

And there’s a lot to navigate when it comes to neutral <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/03/choosing-a-paint-color/\">paint color selection</a>.<br/>I wanted to share a few of the best neutral paint colors I’ve used in our homes, why I’ve been drawn to them, and what I think they bring to a room. In the list below, I’m including four very different colors: white, cream, light pink (which visually reads as neutral), and black.<br/>If you’re deciding on a neutral paint color for your home, I hope this post serves as a helpful resource for you. This is also a great post to bookmark for your future design projects!</p>\n    <p><i>Where I’ve used this color: </i>The <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/01/basement-family-room-paint-reveal/\">basement family room</a> in our current home and the main floor in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2020/04/were-moving-a-goodbye-to-the-house-that-built-our-family-of-5/\">our previous home</a>.<br/>This is a crisp white that doesn’t feel sterile. It’s a warm color but because it doesn’t have too many yellow tones, it doesn’t read as cream. As design trends are moving toward warmer colors, this is a great classic white paint color to use.</p>\n    <p><i>Where I’ve used this color: </i>The <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/01/basement-family-room-paint-reveal/\">basement family room</a> in our current home.<br/>If you’re seeking a light neutral color that has a bit more visual weight to it, Sail Cloth might be the color for you. It’s a warm color that’s a step more creamy than White Dove. If you want to highlight the contrast between two neutrals, you could pair Sail Cloth and White Dove together like I did in our basement family room.</p>\n    <p><i>Where I’ve used this color: </i>The trim in both the <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/08/entryway-design-elements/\">entryway</a> and <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/03/guest-room-design-wallpaper-paint/\">guest room</a> in our current home.<br/>Setting Plaster is a great color to use if you want something a step beyond white or cream that isn’t <i>too </i>saturated. While it is light pink, it still reads as a neutral color and is a versatile option for so many kinds of rooms.</p>\n    <p><i>Where I’ve used this color:</i> The cabinetry in our <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2016/03/wd-renovation-domino-magazine/\">previous home’s kitchen</a>.<br/>This is a beautiful black-gray color that brings depth without overwhelming an entire room. Sometimes, a really dark black color can feel so overpowering it dominates every other design feature in a space. Wrought Iron has a softness to it that I really love.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

Months before <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/10/turning-40-lessons-learned/\">my 40th birthday</a> last year, I kept doing the calculation: <br/>If the next twenty years go as fast as the last, then I’m already sixty—which means I’m basically already eighty.<br/>Time x Speed = Life<br/>I felt like a life-sized cardboard cutout of the new millennial midlife crisis. <br/>To my horror, I continued to write through my disorientation. I felt like a woman walking the plank. Everyone told me life was just beginning, but I couldn’t shake the feeling it was slipping through my fingers each day—and I was powerless to stop it. </p>\n<p>We were told we could be anyone and anything we wanted. <br/>But the options are endless, and time is limited.<br/>It’ll never add up to enough.</p>\n<p>Facing what my math revealed about myself, and the truth of time and speed, I saw my crisis was telling me how I wanted to spend the rest of my life. So I put on my big girl pants, turned toward the secrets I had tucked neatly under my pillow at night, and let them into the light.</p>\n<p>You have everything you need within you.<br/>You are whole. You are enough.<br/>I was not in despair over a decline into obscurity. I craved an experience I had denied myself. Life wasn’t about surviving and becoming. It was about being whole and feeling human and <a href=\"https://housecall.substack.com/p/make-space-for-delight\">making room for joy</a>, desire, delight, pleasure, connection, love, and wonderment. <br/>Life was just beginning—and I was learning to slow down and enjoy it. </p>\n<p>Amid this call for slowness, my life is speeding up. There will never be a busier season of life than this one. My kids are blossoming into themselves, and with this comes friends, hobbies, sports, and memories to be made as a family. Joe is stepping into a season of his career where he wants to test his limits, grow into himself, and see what’s possible when he taps into his talent. <br/>And me. I find myself today overflowing with energy to put into the world. <br/>What does one do when the fullness of life threatens to sweep away the ability to savor life itself? <br/>I’ve been making strides to <a href=\"https://housecall.substack.com/p/kates-five-things-37\">slow down</a> daily, even when everything is swirling around me. I’ve started small, with the tiniest adjustments. <strong>Today, I’m writing about why slowing down matters so much to me and how I’m practicing slowness in this busy season of life.</strong></p>\n<p>I’m tired. That was one of the big secrets I had tucked under my pillow. Life is busy and I don’t have the energy to puff myself up and cheerlead anymore. What I can do, however, is slow down enough to notice when I need rest. <br/>The dichotomy of being bone tired and having a renewed sense of purpose in life is fascinating. It’s like learning to tame a new kind of beast, one that responds to tenderness rather than domineering, alpha-like control. Life is busy, getting things done matters, and enjoyment matters, too. So what does the balance look like? How is slowing down even possible in a busy season of life?<br/>I don’t have a perfect system. But I am not willing to go back to “keeping up” or feeling <a href=\"https://housecall.substack.com/p/how-to-stop-focusing-on-what-you\">a pervasive sense of lack</a>. Instead, I have a values-based approach, a willingness to keep practicing these habits, and a lot of forgiveness for myself. Because I’m tired. And I’m alive. </p>\n<p>When I’m rushing through life, I’ve noticed my pace is reflected through physical cues in my body. A few examples include:</p>\n<p>In practicing slowness, the most important thing for me is to notice and gently redirect these physical responses. I unclench my jaw, take a few slow, deep breaths, loosen my grip on the wheel, and sit up straight with relaxed shoulders. Keep in mind that your physical responses to busyness may look different than mine. Tune into what they are for you and slowly begin to redirect them.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/10/how-to-slow-down/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

All mediums and workspaces are welcome, including your home studio.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://laurievictorkay.com/\">Laurie Victor Kay</a>, Omaha, Nebraska</h2>\n<p><i>How long have you been working in this space?</i></p>\n<p>I’ve been in my studio, LVK Atelier, for about one year. I moved into the space shortly after my mom died from a very short battle with cancer. Moving here meant seismic change for me — leaving my family home, marriage, and longtime former studio. My mom worked with arts and accessibility. Her spirit is everywhere, and it is truly an amazing space. Every visitor feels the strong, positive, creative energy. When I moved in, I began imagining how I wanted my studio to feel, planning for months before starting construction. I was<i> </i>literally rebuilding myself while building my studio space. The first of many projects as a newly independent mid-career artist who had lost her mom and left her marriage to find herself.</p>\n<p><i>Describe an average day in your studio.</i></p>\n<p>My daily routine changes often. Constants: coffee. A long run, early-morning yoga, meditation — even a few times a week. Emails and Instagram. I read and journal. Each day is different because my practice is so varied. When I am making new work, I try to really let myself feel free. Music is so important to me. I like it loud — too loud for my neighbors. So many genres … I travel to time periods, places in the world, places in my mind with music. My <i>Composition</i> series is about music.</p>\n<p><i>How does the space affect your work?</i></p>\n<p>It is magical! The space is like a blank palette with which I can make anything. It is energetic in that my work is received and felt. I meditate often, balancing that with loud music. I feel so free here. During the first months in this space, I bought Yves Klein matte blue paint, and drew Buddhist quotes on the kitchen walls. I made a pact to be intentional about everything entering my space. I was leaving negative energy and needed a space to heal and grow. I wanted to use every corner in the space conceptually. I wanted a true artist’s home — welcoming, colorful, like a cabinet of curiosities; weird, filled with me.</p>\n<p><i>How do you interact with the environment outside your studio?</i></p>\n<p>I’m extremely involved with the art community in Omaha. This community is the reason I’ve stayed in this city. Omahans are down-to-earth and embrace bold ideas. The top three projects in my career were on the campus of the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Although I’ve moved further from the arts area, I’ve found the most important part of making art is feeling supported. My community is all over Omaha but also the world. I believe community is everywhere. Sometimes one close friend is one’s entire community. I want to continue to know my neighbors and support the arts organizations that support me.</p>\n<p><i>What do you love about your studio?</i></p>\n<p>One, I love feeling my mom’s presence. She was a mother to many beyond my family. She died too soon but left a legacy felt here. She worked with people who didn’t have access to art. Two, I love my trees. My home/studio has two massive oaks right through it. Three, I love that the studio is mine. I feel so free and independent now and don’t have to answer to anyone but myself. It was a long road to get here.</p>\n<p><i>What do you wish were different?</i></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037524/a-view-from-the-easel-300/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Suddenly, the fluorescent lights, lively chatter, and overpriced opening wine flowing onto the New York City streets beckon the passerby who has spent all summer tanning in Central Park. It’s fall art fair season, at last.</p>\n<p>As usual, the season’s kicking off with the gargantuan Armory Show next week, followed by a lineup of shows that range from the alternative (zines!) to the conservative and historical (Independent 2oth Century). This year brings a few changes, though: the unexpected <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032202/as-adaas-art-show-changes-course-a-nonprofit-is-left-in-limbo/\">cancellation</a> of the Art Dealers Association of America’s annual Art Show, for instance, typically an anchor of the autumn fairs. Volta is also skipping its NYC edition, while Clio is having <i>two</i> fairs in the same month. </p>\n<p>The art market might be topsy-turvy, but your fairgoing experience doesn’t have to be. Our handy guide below is here to help navigate your way through it all.</p>\n<h3>The Armory Show</h3>\n<p>September 5–7 | <a href=\"https://www.thearmoryshow.com/\">thearmoryshow.com</a><br/>Javits Center, 429 Eleventh Avenue, Midtown West, Manhattan</p>\n<p>The Goliath of the city’s art fairs, the Armory Show will once again descend upon the shopping mall-esque Javits Center to kick off New York’s fall season. More than 230 galleries will convene for the colossal event, with spotlight booths focused on the late artist Ming Fay and installation artist Sylvie Hayes-Wallace, among others. For the first time, the fair’s Platform section will be curated by a nonprofit, Souls Grown Deep, which will celebrate Black artistry from the American South with an exhibition of paintings, assemblages, sculptures, and textile works. Another fresh feature this year is the inaugural design-focused Function section, showcasing sculptural assemblages and installation works by Nikita Gale, Cauleen Smith, Ryan Johnson, and Gee’s Bend Quiltmakers.</p>\n<p>The Armory’s programming will also extend beyond the boundaries of Hudson Yards in a focused series of multi-borough partnership presentations. At the Queens Museum, a collaboration with Gagosian will produce a monumental banner reproduction of Honor Titus’s tennis painting “Louis Malle Practice” (2025) on the institution’s facade. Times Square Arts and the Whitney Museum of American Art will host nightly viewings of media artist Marina Zurkow’s multi-channel animation “The River is a Circle (Times Square Edition)” across 95 synchronized electronic billboard displays throughout the city.</p>\n<h3>Independent 20th Century</h3>\n<p>September 4–7 | <a href=\"https://www.independenthq.com/fair2\">independenthq.com</a> <br/>Casa Cipriani, 10 South Street, The Battery, Manhattan</p>\n<p>The modern art sibling fair of the contemporary-focused Independent fair returns to Manhattan’s Battery neighborhood with 31 galleries and arts nonprofits for its fourth edition. Solo, duo, and group presentations notably spotlight works by self-taught artists, Lebanese women artists, and influential figures from Latin America. Attendees can also check out a host of programs, including a live discussion between installation artist Judy Pfaff and author Joe Fig and a roundtable between directors of the Storm King Art Center, Princeton University Art Museum, the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, and Aspen Art Museum.</p>\n<h3>Art on Paper</h3>\n<p>September 4–7 | <a href=\"http://ny.thepaperfair.com\">ny.thepaperfair.com</a><br/>Pier 36, 299 South St, New York, New York</p>\n<p>Don’t underestimate the versatility of this pulpy, everyday material. Returning to its usual venue at Pier 36 on the East River, this year’s Art on Paper fair will showcase boundary-pushing artworks from over 100 galleries, such as Pace-represented artist Nina Katchadourian’s playful ecological sculptures made from found paper items.

    "body": "<p>LONDON — Of all the <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/y/young-british-artists-ybas\">YBAs</a> (Young British Artists) of the 1990s — including upstarts like Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin, mouthing off petulantly to the art establishment with dead livestock and unmade beds — it is Jenny Saville who has been most entrenched in the history of art. It is also Saville who can most convincingly claim to be Britain’s greatest living painter since the death of Lucien Freud (sorry, David Hockney). The artist’s superb draughtsmanship skills, informed by absorption and understanding of the Old Masters, are combined with a painterly technique that manipulates its plasticity for all its worth. (Ironically, Tracey Emin is a professor of drawing at the Royal Academy despite having no capacity for drawing.) Saville’s style is as complete and significant as that of Freud.</p>\n<p>It is hard to overestimate the impact of Saville’s early works on British contemporary painting. Her paintings often disappear into the most discerning private ownership. Those in public collections are the rare anomaly in her current survey, <i> The Anatomy of Painting</i>, at the National Portrait Gallery. As a result, some of that impact is recreated for those viewing her art for the first time. Enormous in scale, her uncomfortably close cropped depictions of women’s faces and nude bodies abound in the joy of painterly modeling, from bare — nude — patches of canvas to her swift, thick, viscous slathers, to dappled dry brush blends. The large scale alone may shock people accustomed to viewing only reproductions on screen. The distribution of muted and contrasting tones is sophisticated. In short, there is a wealth of virtuosic brushwork to drink in. </p>\n<p>Considering the painterly bombast, it is perhaps a pedantic complaint that the National Portrait Gallery has mounted an exhibition that has not a single “portrait” in it. We are given only a few of the sitters’ identities, and neither the museum nor Saville expound any particular reason for portraying them, nor any painter-sitter relationships to speak of. Hers is an academic interest with only perfunctory gestures toward body image issues, and pieces explicitly covering <a href=\"https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-5916645\">gender identity</a> are absent. In “Plan” (1993), one of the exhibition’s key works, Saville contours the nude flesh like ordinance survey map terrain, while “Ruben’s Flap” (1998–99) references the fleshy folds favored by the Dutch master, updated to the “real” folds of contemporary unidealized body types. In her most color-saturated rendering of flesh, “Figure 11.23” (1997), she deploys flat red more in the Renaissance discipline of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cangiante\">cangiante</a> – using depth of color rather than muted tones for shade – rather than realistically depicting blood. </p>\n<p>Similarly, a fantastic sequence of mother and child images that reference both Pietas and Maestas from Michelangelo, with bulbous children bending toward us, entasis-style, echo distinctly his Madonna of Bruges or the soft sfumato of Raphael, reimagined in colored pencil. Saville fails, though, to wear her influences on her sleeve when channeling her love for de Kooning into her compositions from the mid to late 2010s. Her attempts to break down nudes into intertwining layers of limbs and squiggles, shattering them with de Kooning-like surface articulation, feel forced, and obscure her gift for three-dimensional modeling. “Out of one, two (symposium)” (2016) nods to Cy Twombly simply by overlaying the nude figures with scribbles. Her academic attempts at abstraction — the opposite of Renaissance Old Master figure modeling — seem to be at the expense of her work’s soul.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036158/jenny-saville-uk-greatest-living-painter-national-portrait-gallery-london/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In photographer Alicia Vera’s portrait of her mother, Concepcion, she gazes skyward, her expression somewhere between curious and awestruck. The image has enough stylistic mottling and grain to obscure any sort of background, but Concepcion is clear: broad cheekbones, bejeweled ears, eyes full of wonder—maybe. Vera is a deeply humanistic image-maker, and it’s impossible to differentiate between a posed subject and a candid one. She approaches both with generosity.</p>\n<p>Isolated, the phrase “va a llover toda la noche,” which translates in English to “it’s going to rain all night,” feels like a snippet of poetry or song. A few years ago, it was a note left on Vera’s door by her mother. Now, it’s the title of Vera’s new project, and a self-published book of the same name, documenting Concepcion’s Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis and Vera’s experience processing it. “Every time I go home to Miami, I stay in my childhood home,” Vera shares. “My mom loves to leave notes on the door. I kept this one; a year or so later, when I was taking out all this material I had, I thought, ‘this is exactly what this feels like.’” The portrait of her mother is one of many in <i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i> (2025); alongside Vera’s portraits, the book includes archival images of Concepcion over the last several decades, text messages, emails, and other personal ephemera.</p>\n<p><i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i>(2025), with the caption: “Mom and her orchids in Miami”</p>\n<p>Vera, who is based in Mexico City, is an award-winning editorial and commercial photographer, and her personal projects feature some of her most captivating images. In “Basketball in the Sierra Norte of Oaxaca” (2018), she captured the Copa Mixe, a basketball tournament for Indigenous Mixe youth in Sierra Norte; for “Stripped” (2009–11), she spent years documenting strippers in Miami and the Bay Area. Her photos are devoid of the voyeuristic quality often visible in like-minded series by other artists; instead, she seems warmly welcomed, like a relative. She’s been photographing her own family, too, “since forever,” she says. “I think I knew deep down, one day, everything’s going to be so different. Every time I would go home, I would take a ton of pictures.”</p>\n<p>Concepcion was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease in 2018, which prompted Vera to begin photographing her more. In a Spanglish epilogue to the book, Vera writes, in English: “After my mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, I felt devastated, overwhelmed, anxious and helpless.” In Spanish, she adds: “<i>Mi mamá se me iba a ir. En mi desesperación de entender lo que le estaba pasando y porque nunca realmente sentí que la conocí, empecé este proyecto llamado</i>, <i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i>” (My mom was going to leave me. In my desperation to understand what was happening to her, and because I never really felt like I knew her, I started this project called <i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i>.) Vera’s understanding of her mother’s own personhood was limited by the challenges of their relationship—a too-common dynamic among mothers and daughters, and one that Vera has long hoped to correct. “She grew up in Mexico and I grew up in the US, so there were a lot of cultural differences,” she says. “In my 20s, I moved away and realized, ‘I really miss my mom.’ We started having these phone calls, and it hit me that my mom was an entire human … I remember trying to make an effort to get to know her, asking her really specific questions. When my mom got diagnosed, I was like, ‘Wait, but I’m just starting to get to know you.’”</p>\n<p><i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i>(2025), with the caption: “My mother as a child runs through a field with her brother in Mexico. / A prayer card found in my mother’s room.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037506/alicia-vera-photographs-depict-alzheimers-with-dignity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>A Pennsylvania art museum is suing the Trump administration after the government terminated a $750,000 federal grant for collection conservation earlier this year.</p>\n    <p>The Woodmere Art Museum in Philadelphia filed a lawsuit yesterday, August 26, against President Donald Trump, the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the agency’s Interim Director Keith Sonderling, and other administration officials, months after the agency revoked its Fiscal Year 2024 “Save America’s Treasures” grant. The museum, which operates out of a 19th-century mansion in the city’s Chestnut Hill neighborhood, alleges that Trump officials usurped Congress’s authority to distribute federal funds by prematurely terminating its grant.</p>\n    <p>The IMLS grant that the Woodmere received is administered in <a href=\"https://nps.gov/subjects/historicpreservationfund/save-americas-treasures-grants.htm\">partnership</a> with the National Park Service and awarded to “historic properties and collections.” After receiving the grant, according to the lawsuit, the museum initiated an “ambitious conservation project” to prepare an exhibition of Philadelphia artists in 2026, timed with America’s 250th celebrations. The museum received just $195,000 of its total grant before its termination. </p>\n    <p>The Woodmere hopes the IMLS will restore its funding so that it can continue its original planned <a href=\"https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/st-256887-oms-24\">project</a> to install new storage facilities, address collection crowding, and improve cataloguing efforts. </p>\n    <p>“This has delayed critical preservation, digitization, and conservation of our collection — work we hope to resume if the grant is reinstated,” Woodmere Art Museum Director and CEO William Valerio told <i>Hyperallergic. </i></p>\n    <p>With the grant expiration approaching in September, the museum stated in court papers that it has exhausted non-litigious methods of restoring the grant, including a formal appeal. Trump signed an executive order in March demanding that the IMLS and several other federal agencies <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/996700/trump-moves-to-dismantle-institute-of-museum-and-library-services/\">cease operations</a> of non-statutory functions, effectively dismantling the organization. The lawsuit asks the court to reinstate its grant and declare Trump’s gutting of the IMLS “unlawful” or “unconstitutional.”</p>\n    <p>The president proposed eliminating the organization’s funding in his Fiscal Year 2026 budget proposal, which also excluded the National Endowment for the Arts from federal dollars. A federal judge <a href=\"https://www.ala.org/news/2025/06/court-allows-trump-administration-proceed-efforts-destroy-institute-museum-and-library\">declined</a> to block Trump’s dismantling of the agency in June after other judges blocked <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1014493/museum-grants-reinstated-after-federal-court-ruling/\">some of his actions</a>.</p>\n    <p>The IMLS has not yet responded to <i>Hyperallergic’s </i>request for comment. </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037363/pennsylvania-museum-sues-trump-administration-over-grant-cuts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>CHICAGO — Though Wafaa Bilal was born in Iraq and is based in New York, his survey at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, <i> Indulge Me</i>, can be called a homecoming of sorts. In 2007, the accomplished yet underrated artist captured the art world’s attention with his durational performance “Domestic Tension,” wherein he lived for 30 days inside the exhibition space of Chicago’s FlatFile Gallery; a web camera broadcast his movements while a paintball gun was available for anyone to remotely fire at him via a website. Reconstructed as an open-face cubicle inside the museum’s pristine gallery space, the splatters of thousands of yellow paintballs on its interior walls do not convey the torturous persistence of the gun as forcefully as the brief video diary screened on a small monitor nearby. In an increasingly distressed voice, the goggled Bilal unironically thanks his audience for their participation as the gun processes a ceaseless string of firing commands. </p>\n    <p>For a significant survey, the exhibition is remarkably spare. Curator Bana Kattan selected five major projects, each one integrating technology, performance, and a conceptual approach to the conditions of being Arab in the United States in the post-9/11 era. In “3rdi,” Bilal surgically implanted a web camera to the back of his head and attached it to an internet-connected laptop slung at his waist. Each minute, the camera would take an image and send it via the laptop to a live website feed. We are privy to an oversized presentation of a year’s worth of these images, projected on a 14-foot scrim diagonally bisecting the gallery and synced to the date and time they were originally taken.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Bilal-1200x947.jpg?resize=1200%2C947&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>While Bilal once again submits himself to anonymous public scrutiny, making literal the Arab-American condition, the seemingly arbitrary images show the view from behind, telling us not where he is going but where he has been. The project title can be parsed as “third eye,” referring both literally to the camera and conceptually to the watchful eye of the state, but can also be read in Western-transliterated Arabizi as “my land,” pointing to the places from which Bilal has fled as a political refugee who could not look back.</p>\n    <p>The latest project on view, “In a Grain of Wheat,” exhibits Bilal’s persistent concern with the technological mediation of contemporary culture. Responding to the destruction of Iraqi cultural heritage by ISIS, the artist collaborated with a scientist and coder team to scan the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s lamassu and write its form into the DNA of a grain of wheat. The specific mechanics of this process are not comprehensible via the minimal didactics presented, so viewers must accept that the sculpture lives in the wheat as an act of faith in the art and science of the project. Aptly, the work demands a devotional gesture. To partake of the wheat, one must bend down before the replica winged bull to reach for the pile of seeds at its hooves. More than two decades after the American invasion of Iraq, to see mostly young non-Arab Americans readily perform this gesture of supplication to an iconic symbol of Iraqi cultural heritage makes me think that perhaps this country has forgotten its devastating entanglement with Iraq after all. Bilal, of course, cannot.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Bilal2-1200x788.jpg?resize=1200%2C788&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/001-1200x801.jpg?resize=1200%2C801&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Wafaa Bilal: Indulge Me</i>at the MCA Chicago (photo Bob [Robert Chase Heishman])</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/PXL_20250408_155635076.MP_-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/019-1200x801.jpg?resize=1200%2C801&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/025-1200x801.jpg?resize=1200%2C801&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Wafaa Bilal: Indulge Me</i>at the MCA Chicago.

    "body": "<p>Sobriety is a deeply personal and often sensitive subject. The decision to embrace sobriety can stem from many reasons—rooted in health, emotional healing, and often a mix of the two. The reasons are unique to each individual and shaped by their lived experiences. When someone chooses sobriety, it can bring up emotions in others who may be struggling with their relationship with alcohol. <br/>Every story in sobriety is valid. I share my thoughts from my own journey, fully aware that my path may look nothing like yours. My experience does not define sobriety as a whole, nor does it diminish or invalidate yours. <br/>Data shows alcohol consumption in America is <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/509690/young-adults-drinking-less-prior-decades.aspx\">changing</a>. At the beginning of the year, <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/01/03/us-surgeon-general-issues-new-advisory-link-alcohol-cancer-risk.html\">a new health advisory</a> was issued linking alcohol consumption to increased cancer risk. Culturally, our relationship with sobriety is broadening. This is what my sobriety looks like today. </p>\n<p>I am eighteen and at my first house party. It is my senior year in high school. My friends and I hit it off with a group of guys entering their junior year. I stand at the far end of a swampy beer pong table, gingerly holding my red cup. Afraid and liberated, I gulp a lukewarm keg of beer, the first taste of the kind of freedom college would provide. No one was there to monitor or judge except myself. <br/>I had grown up afraid of drinking alcohol, my parents and long-term boyfriend demonizing it. I rarely saw my parents drink aside from my dad’s nightly beer, a stark departure from a drinking culture I observed in my Irish dance community. There, drinking was synonymous with everything. During trips to Ireland as a preteen in the 90s, I eyed kids my age with a Guinness, sitting at the bar with their parents. <br/>There are also memories of my grandparents: sipping Miller Light or a buttery chardonnay, eating tortilla chips, and playing cards. Their laughter is synonymous with my happy childhood, a kind of togetherness that is rare and good and worth stopping to marvel at. Today that smell of hops and salty chips brings it all back home.<br/>By the end of my 18th summer, beer signified a different kind of togetherness. A beer in my hand was connection, security, and confidence. It was a key inside places I had yet to access and a gateway to relaxed ease that had alluded me for a lifetime. <br/>Enter adulthood, and I couldn’t imagine a future without it. </p>\n<p>My relationship with alcohol was murky. At 25, I tipped over the edge, blacking out often in the month leading up to <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2019/02/how-you-find-yourself-divorced-at-27-after-11-months-of-marriage/\">my first marriage</a>. Yet I always had an “off” switch. I never worried I’d forget when enough was enough.<br/>There were times in my 30s when the draw to drink was irresistible. We bought wine in bulk during the pandemic and through our early parenting years. Wine was a daily ritual. <br/>Much of my social life has revolved around booze. Wine as an activity. Wine as a unifier. As <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2013/12/love-marriage-second-chances/\">Joe and I fell in love</a> over drinks and didn’t think twice about a weeknight martini, I had friends who decided to go sober. With it came a sense of worry we’d lose contact. Thankfully, no friendships have been lost to sobriety. <br/>I listened to stories from those who found themselves outside of once <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/01/our-friendships-evolve-because-we-do/\">close friendships</a>, othered and not offered a seat at the dinner table, hurt by the fragility of a friendship built around booze. As I asked questions about life without alcohol, they opened my eyes to a world that is just as rich in connection and flavor as all the heightened sensations I’ve come to associate with both alcohol and my relationships. <br/>The beer in hand was no longer a ticket to entry. Sobriety offered a way to access a deeper connection. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/01/why-i-quit-drinking-alcohol/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Two weeks after I hit publish on <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/01/year-in-review-2023/\">my 2023 recap</a> last January, everything felt on the brink of falling apart. <br/>I could feel that the balance of my life—work, personal life, marriage, and my relationship with all of it—had been teetering on edge for a long, long time. However, I thought that if I acknowledged how I truly felt about it all, the delicate balance of my life would lose its shape, never to be reconstituted.<br/>We usually don’t face this circumstance unless there isn’t another option. It sits so profoundly in the dark that there isn’t a map. But we feel the threat lurking. Then something happens that turns the lights on, and there it is. We don’t always like what we see.<br/>Nothing particularly eventful happened last year. But I became “real”—real in the way we can only be when we finally allow our whole selves to be witnessed. <br/>I am only just beginning to understand what it means to be there for myself. Only beginning to take accountability for my reality.<br/>If I can tell you one thing, it’s that the things we fear facing the most are what we need to run toward. The truth really does set you free. </p>\n<p>The new year begins in earnest. We do January things even though it’s a balmy 30 degrees and not a snowflake clings to the ground. We clean out the house and make way for New Year’s intentions. We dance and drink martinis at Mancini’s. I host friends for roast lamb and cabbage and try to ignore the feeling of dread that follows me to my desk each morning. <br/>I sit at my computer. I wait to feel “good” about my career. I look at finances, which have been difficult to rightsize since laying the team off last June. There are tax bills, summer camps, and unexpected home issues that need to be paid for. Joe and I have always shared a joint bank account, but I remain in charge of the budget and big-picture view of the state of it all. I feel alone. I begin to daydream about selling everything and moving to a small cabin up north. On a beach. Anywhere but here. <br/>I go to Carlsbad with some girlfriends and forget about my troubles for 36 hours. I watch <i>Past Lives</i> on the way home and cry in public. <br/>When I arrive home, the tipping point reveals itself: Joe decides to leave his job abruptly. His toxic work environment has become impossible.<br/>It is the right thing to do. How it all went down will take me a long time to get over. I am angry. Very angry. And empathic. I agree with his decision wholeheartedly. I hold the two truths close to my heart and then feel an iciness cover everything. The show must go on, and bills are on their way.  <br/>I cut my bangs into the style of a French assassin. I feel bulletproof. I work and make pot roast and work more. I feel <i>alive</i> with purpose again. I am high on the feeling of being chased by the thought of financial ruin. <br/>I sign three months’ worth of business in a week. Maybe this is just how it has to be to feel like myself again, to feel in control and capable. I am so afraid of losing everything that I feel nothing at all. <br/>I have recurring nightmares. I walk for hours to calm down. I open up to my friend about my anger and guilt for being angry. I feel less alone in the presence of someone who sees me. I wonder if I can see myself.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/01/year-in-review-2024/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>With the right intentions year after year, why do we so often fail at our resolutions? I don’t know the answer, but I have two ideas. For one, they’re audacious. There’s nothing wrong with big goals, but in order for them to be sustainable, to last until the following year, goals need to be doable. Second—and I believe this to be the biggest culprit of what disrupts our success—we start chasing our goals without being aware of what our lives presently look like or how we really spend our time.<strong>Becoming aware of your habits puts you in the driver’s seat and, from my experience, helps you set more appropriate, achievable goals. So how do you become aware? By tracking your habits. </strong>With all of the energy packed behind New Year’s resolutions, habit tracking may sound a little passive. Who’s got time to spend tracking their habits when what they really need to be doing is working toward the best version of themselves? <br/>Everyone.<br/>Because when you start with habit tracking, you are more likely to create achievable goals, and therefore not have to start all over next year. Progress must be preceded by awareness, otherwise, you don’t truly know where you’re coming from.<br/>A few months ago, I began scrupulously tracking my habits. I had an idea of how I spent my days, but I wanted to become clear on what I <i>really</i> spent my time doing. I already knew that <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/02/decluttering-the-mind-an-ode-to-morning-pages-2/\">I spent most mornings writing</a> (I thought) and I went to yoga a few times per week (I thought). Only once I tracked my habits did I see the discrepancy between where I thought I spent my time and where I <i>really </i>spent it. This awareness has led me to some incredible progress.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Only once I tracked my habits did I see the discrepancy between where I thought I spent my time and where I</p><i>really</i>spent it.

It’s life-changing, I promise.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>All you need is a notebook, a pen, and a little dedication, because you’ll need to end each day going over your habits. (If you’re the kind of person who needs more structure than a hand-drawn grid, there are also apps, tools, and notebooks out there to help you track your habits.)</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: Looking for a premade habit tracking form?

For example, if one of the habits you want to track is exercise, be sure to define what that means. Is a half-hour of exercise the same as one hour to you? If not, then clarify that.<strong>Personally, some of my habits look like this: </strong></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/01/habit-tracking/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Earlier this year, I shared the first post in our Wit &amp; Delight entertaining series, “<a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/08/casual-dinner-party/\">How to Host a Casual Dinner Party</a>.” This series is a collaboration between me and my friend <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lisahackwith/\">Lisa</a>. Both avid hosts, we wanted to share ideas for entertaining that are approachable and special all at once. <strong>I am so excited about our second entertaining series installment: The Dessert Party!</strong><br/>Life is full in the weeks leading up to the end of the year. Finding time to connect with friends and family can fall by the wayside, especially for those in a season when small children are part of their daily routine. <br/>Since working on this series, I’ve learned the joys of planning ahead. Thinking about ways to cut back on labor and make things special is so much easier when you’re not running on impromptu plans. Lisa and I wanted to put together a menu that would work for an afternoon gathering—think afternoon teatime, but with desserts. The concept has you delegating recipes and responsibilities to friends, which is both collaborative and fun! </p>\n<p>The idea of a dessert party is to enjoy dessert and snacks with friends or family. The menu can be casual and the workload can be split between guests so everyone makes something to share. This entertaining idea is perfect for the holiday season but it can be executed any time of year.<br/>The beauty of this kind of party is that it’s completely flexible. It can be on a weekend afternoon or evening. The guest list can be intimate or big. You can sit around a dining table or—like we did—simply gather around a coffee table in the living room. Here’s what our dessert party entailed. </p>\n<p>There were six people on our dessert party guest list, including myself. I invited a few friends who love to bake and a few friends who would rather bring savory snacks. I think six is the perfect number, but a party like this works well for scaling the guest list up or down.</p>\n<p>Because dessert is so indulgent, we designed the menu to include both sweet and savory treats. Lisa developed each of the dessert recipes. A few menu items require more time and skill; others just require a trip to the store. Three people baked desserts, three people collaborated on the charcuterie board, and I provided the bubbles as the host.<br/>For drinks, I recommend going with something special like <a href=\"https://www.champagne-billecart.fr/en/collection/brut-rose\">Billecart Brut Rose</a> or something for everyday drinking like <a href=\"https://www.shophenryandson.com/product/il-mostro-frizzante-bianco/4895?cp=true&amp;sa=false&amp;sbp=false&amp;q=true\">Il Mostro Frizzante BIANCO</a>. For those not imbibing, try <a href=\"https://drywit.com/collections/all\">Dry Wit Pippi</a>.<strong>Here’s what our menu looked like:</strong></p>\n<p>Almost everything can be done ahead of time, so the finishing touches come together pretty easily on the day of the party. For this type of party, you can include your friends in each of the prep tasks, such as:</p>\n<p>With casual parties like this one, a thrown-together feel makes everyone relaxed and comfortable in your home. Plan to sit down about 30 – 45 minutes after everyone arrives. <br/>If a collaborative prep process is not your kind of thing, set your table (or coffee table in front of the fireplace if you have one), build a fire, light candles, and put on a playlist ahead of time. Grab friends drinks once they arrive, and invite them to place their contribution on the table. Once everything has been plated, have each person share a little note about what they brought, like the delicious new cheese they found at the market, the process of piping the frosting on the cake, etc. I’ve found talking about food with friends who care about food to be lovely. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/12/dessert-party/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The decision notably follows Trump’s <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/999509/trump-whitewashes-history-in-new-smithsonian-executive-order/\">March executive order</a> targeting the Smithsonian Institution and the release of his Fiscal Year 2026 budget, which excluded funding for the NMAL.</p>\n<p>The Molina Family Latino Gallery’s early closure means it will remain shuttered throughout Hispanic Heritage Month this fall, and marks a lengthy period of inactivity for the fledgling National Museum of the American Latino’s only current physical gallery, which the museum’s director, Jorge Zamanillo, has <a href=\"https://time.com/6314166/museum-american-latino-controversy/\">referred</a> to as the institution’s “first iteration.” </p>\n<p>Reached by <i>Hyperallergic</i>, a spokesperson for the institution cited preparations for the Smithsonian’s <i>Our Shared Future: 250</i> programming as the reason for the exhibition’s premature closure. </p>\n<p>“The National Museum of the American Latino is participating in the Smithsonian’s celebration of the nation’s 250th anniversary and wanted to meet the spring 2026 deadline for opening the <i>Puro Ritmo</i> exhibition in support of the Smithsonian’s institution-wide plans,” the spokesperson said, referring to the upcoming show <a href=\"https://latino.si.edu/exhibitions\"> ¡Puro Ritmo! The Musical Journey of Salsa</a> at the Molina gallery. “The Molina Family Latino Gallery is closed to visitors because museum staff need the space to safely de-install </p>\n<p><i>Presente</i>and then transition the exhibition space into a staging area to prepare for the renovation and installation of</p>\n<p><i>Puro Ritmo</i>.”</p>\n<p>The institution <a href=\"https://time.com/6314166/museum-american-latino-controversy/\">reportedly</a> adopted the salsa-themed exhibition as a softer alternative to a planned exhibition on Latino youth movements that garnered significant conservative backlash. Before Trump’s crackdown on the Smithsonian began, that exhibition was widely criticized by conservatives who disagreed with its focus on colonization and threatened to <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/835401/republicans-vote-to-block-funding-for-museum-of-american-latino/\">withhold federal funding</a> for the forthcoming museum in 2023.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>The Smithsonian spokesperson did not directly answer a question about whether Trump’s museum reviews or executive action influenced the decision to close the Molina Gallery in July. Trump has<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Letter-Sec.-Bunch-Smithsonian-8.12.2025.pdf\"> repeatedly pushed</a> the Smithsonian to promote “unity, progress, and enduring values” in time for the country’s 250th anniversary next year. Earlier this month, the administration demanded that Smithsonian museums submit their 250th anniversary plans to “<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/08/letter-to-the-smithsonian-internal-review-of-smithsonian-exhibitions-and-materials/\">align messaging</a>” with the White House Salute to America 250 Task Force.</p>\n<p>Three of the works named on last week’s White House list were created by living artists who were born in Mexico, including Galindo, raising questions about how the institution will protect its Latino artists under pressure from the federal government.</p>\n<p>When Galindo learned from a staff member that the museum was “rotating” the exhibition, he told <i>Hyperallergic </i>he remembers thinking, “Is that a new word for censoring?” </p>\n<p>The administration has already launched a review of <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/08/letter-to-the-smithsonian-internal-review-of-smithsonian-exhibitions-and-materials/\">exhibitions</a> planned for the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence as part of its larger probe. Trump’s government referenced the US’s 250th anniversary nine times in its letter to the Smithsonian announcing its review and forthcoming “content corrections.” </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037811/smithsonian-latino-gallery-quietly-closes-for-nine-months/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The buzz of neon lights drones in the background. It’s hard to say if the temperature has truly dropped, or if it’s psychosomatic, that the atmosphere has cooled your skin just by the power of suggestion. You’re floating in space, or suspended underwater — gravity works differently here.</p>\n    <p>The phases of the moon are painted on the wall in a matte metallic silver, and a small poem by Saar is draped across the wall: “The moon keeps vigil as a lone canoe drifts into a sea of tranquility seeking serenity in the twilight.” In the middle of the room, a long canoe, 17 feet across, sits atop a bed of branches, bramble, and sheets of jagged wood. At either tip of the ship is a watchful eye guiding the raft in both directions. Two sentinels — antiques affixed with antlers — keep watch at each end. Saar has crafted a fantastical scene; you can envision the boat careening upriver, striding forth.</p>\n    <p>The vessel is occupied by bird cages confining animal antlers and seated upon miniature chairs fit only for a toddler — or, perhaps, spirits who scarcely need a physical seat, just an invitation to rest. These scavenged items are characteristic of Saar’s found object assemblage; she hunts for her materials, whether in nature or at flea markets.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/cFoCY-1200x900.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>“I like combining manufactured objects with natural objects,” says the 98-year-old artist in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n2Dg3C10Y&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huntington.org%2F&amp;embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huntington.org&amp;source_ve_path=MjM4NTE&amp;themeRefresh=1\">video</a> at the back of the gallery. She started collecting at four or five, she explains, but the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. was a catalyzing moment. She was so overwhelmed with emotion that she could do nothing but create art, leading her to assemble one of her most famed sculptures, “The Liberation of Aunt Jemima” (1972), which empowers and equips a “mammy” figurine with defensive weaponry.</p>\n    <p>Saar is a famed Angeleno, a fixture in the city’s art scene, but she was raised in Pasadena, which neighbors the Huntington Gardens, where this site-specific commission went up in 2023. In the short directed by Kyle Provencio Reingold, the camera follows her through the massive campus, where she first wandered at 12 or 13 alongside her mother and neighbor. We forage the gardens with her as she instructs the Huntington employees of her artistic intentions; you can hear the giddiness in her voice as she remembers her childhood traversing its grounds, selecting fallen branches and trimmings. “Even in death, those things can be really beautiful,” she muses.</p>\n    <p>The gallery lighting shifts from daylight to dusk as time creeps along. <i>Drifting Into Twilight </i>is an encapsulated, self-sustaining environment of its own, like a display exhibit at a natural history museum with a surrealistic twist. The room is as relaxing as it is disorienting; it feels like you’ve been plunged into a misty and peculiar other world. You are sinking, descending, drifting into twilight. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/bcIbO-1200x900.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.huntington.org/exhibitions/betye-saar-drifting-toward-twilight\">Betye Saar: Drifting Toward Twilight</a> <i>continues at Virginia Steele Scott Galleries of American Art at the Huntington (1151 Oxford Road, San Marino, California) through November 30, 2027.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Since 1973, Vincent van Gogh masterpieces including his beloved sunflowers, wistful wheatfields, and self-portraits have been housed in Amsterdam’s Van Gogh Museum. The institution was established via a historic 1962 agreement between the painter’s nephew and the Dutch government to ensure the long-term preservation of hundreds of paintings, drawings, and letters comprising van Gogh’s oeuvre.<br/>Now, the museum says that the collection’s future is uncertain, citing a dispute with the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (OCW) over the funding for costly maintenance repairs and sustainability efforts mandated by the state. In a legal complaint, the institution claims that the Dutch government is violating its decades-old agreement by refusing to provide sufficient subsidies to cover the cost of the three-year, €104 million (~$121 million) project.</p>\n    <p>Under the Dutch Heritage Act, national museums, including the Van Gogh Museum, the Rijksmuseum, and the Kröller-Müller Museum, receive annual housing subsidies to help them maintain and preserve their collections. But the Van Gogh Museum says that this yearly government funding —<a href=\"https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0037533/2025-05-07\"> currently €8,428,300 (~$9.8 million)</a> — falls short of the more than €11 million (~$12.8 million) needed to help it finance much-needed renovations to its fire and security alarms, climate control system, and internal elevators leading to storage facilities, plus the sustainability upgrades required for all Dutch public buildings as of 2024.</p>\n    <p>“So far, the state of the museum has not directly affected the programming and operations,” a Van Gogh Museum spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “But it’s just a matter of time before it will become a major issue.” </p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for OCW said that the ministry “maintains that the allocated housing subsidy is sufficient to cover the necessary maintenance cost.”</p>\n    <p>“This position is based on comprehensive research conducted by independent experts commissioned by the Ministry,” the spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>, noting that the subsidy is a “fixed amount” that is annually adjusted for inflation. </p>\n    <p>The museum did not disclose how the subsidy is calculated, but the OCW representative said that the same methodology is used for other national museums, citing the Rijksmuseum, which receives<a href=\"https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0037533/2025-05-07\"> €37 million (~$43 million)</a>, and the Kröller-Müller Museum, which receives<a href=\"https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0037533/2025-05-07\"> €9.8 (~$11.4 million)</a>.</p>\n    <p>For the past two years, the Van Gogh Museum has been negotiating with the government to increase this annual subsidy by €2.5 million (~$2.9 million) to no avail.</p>\n    <p>If the institution does not come to a resolution soon, the museum says it may need to close its doors. The Van Gogh Foundation, established by the painter’s nephew, has also echoed concerns about the institution’s future and urged the Dutch government to abide by its obligations to protect the artist’s works as stipulated by the founding 1962 agreement.</p>\n    <p>The Van Gogh Museum houses the largest collection of works by the artist in the world, comprising over 200 paintings, 500 drawings, and 900 letters, as well as other works by the Dutch artist’s contemporaries and influences. Over the course of five decades, nearly 57 million people have visited the museum, with annual attendance reaching a peak of 2.6 million in 2017. Last year, the institution hosted five exhibitions, including a <a href=\"https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/visit/whats-on/exhibitions/overview-past-exhibitions/matthew-wong-vincent-van-gogh?_gl=1*hwymjv*_up*MQ..*_gs*MQ..&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw_L_FBhDmARIsAItqgt7ROFc2U8sSxAl_BZzcsB103XGQ8Jw98o63-UmTCCXX4lYhJiRItScaAho5EALw_wcB&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADhviGV-Km3u2LOuKphdQgDUdbYh0\">retrospective</a> exploring van Gogh’s influence on the late Chinese-Canadian artist Matthew Wong and a <a href=\"https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/visit/whats-on/exhibitions/overview-past-exhibitions/vive-limpressionnisme?_gl=1*glzo0v*_up*MQ..&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw_L_FBhDmARIsAItqgt7ROFc2U8sSxAl_BZzcsB103XGQ8Jw98o63-UmTCCXX4lYhJiRItScaAho5EALw_wcB&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADhviGV-Km3u2LOuKphdQgDUdbYh0\">show</a> paying homage to French Impressionism.</p>\n    <p>The case is scheduled to be heard in court on February 19, the OCW spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037500/amsterdam-van-gogh-museum-collection-faces-uncertain-future/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>‣ Design is a minefield of ethical dilemmas, incentivizing companies to work with exploitative clients and making it difficult for employees to say no. Elizabeth Goodspeed spoke with a few designers, writing in <i> It’s Nice That</i>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Questions about client ethics are tricky enough when you know exactly who you’re working for. Things get even murkier when work is licensed, resold, or embedded with no direct link between creator and end user. For type designers, this is the norm. Once a font is released, it can surface almost anywhere, often without warning. Jesse Ragan, cofounder of XYZ Type, says custom projects feel relatively straightforward to assess ideologically: if he doesn’t believe in a client, he can simply turn down the work. Retail fonts are a different story. A typeface is made in isolation long before it’s used, and can be licensed anonymously or simply pulled from Adobe Fonts without the designer’s knowledge. Jesse has seen his work turn up in porn, conservative Christian campaigns, and even materials for a far-right Texas militia. “It’s always a shock to see,” he says, especially given his left-leaning politics. He describes designing a typeface as a slow, intimate process – “every little letterform, it’s like, ‘hello, friend’, when I see them” – which makes it all the more jarring when it gets into the wrong hands. Rutherford Craze, founder of foundry Mass Driver, shares this feeling. “Some type designers feel that once they release a typeface, where it ends up is no longer their concern. I strongly disagree,” he says. “It’s not feasible to make a living and keep a spotless conscience, but it’s our responsibility to find the most equitable balance we can, whether that’s through [dis]incentivising certain usage, or turning down work for clients we disagree with.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>‣ Noguchi Museum Rights, an anonymous group of workers at the New York institution, penned an essay flagging longstanding allegations of racism and artwashing at the museum. They write in <i> Everything is Political</i>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Given that the keffiyeh is a cultural garment, meaning it is protected under city and state laws, and is the only thing ever explicitly targeted by this policy, how does the selective enforcement of this policy not discriminate against individuals who would wear a keffiyeh as a cultural item? What is the distinction between cultural and political in this context, and how is that dealt with by museum leadership?</p>\n      <p>Why were board Co-Chairs Spencer Bailey and Susan Kessler so involved in enforcing the keffiyeh ban, and in what ways does enforcing the ban relate to their responsibilities?</p>\n      <p>The leadership is not for the community, despite running a community museum founded by an activist artist who would be appalled by the current conditions. While people and organizations have stopped partnering with the museum, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaints have been filed, the staff has unionized, and the museum has received terrible press, those in leadership positions have simply crossed their fingers in the hope that the public will forget about it all. The Noguchi Museum is a community non-profit, and as a member of the community, you deserve answers.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>‣ The Moomins exhibition at the Brooklyn Public Library was easily one of the highlights of my summer, and for the <i> New Yorker</i>, Jon Allsop articulates the role these deeply human trolls can play in an age of anxiety and repression:</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037819/required-reading-748/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>SANTA FE — In 1998, science fiction writer Ted Chiang published “Story of Your Life,” in which aliens come to Earth in “looking glasses,” mirrored spaceships that act as communication devices. The central character, linguist Dr. Louise Banks, is tasked with deciphering the aliens’ language. In turn, she begins to see time like they do — as simultaneous events — and ultimately glimpses her own future.</p>\n<p>A reference to “Story of Your Life” is tucked into the exhibition guidebook for <i> Once Within a Time</i>, SITE Santa Fe’s 12th International. Curator Cecilia Alemani identified Chiang as one of the exhibition’s 27 “figures of interest” — catalysts for the 71</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>participating artists and more than two dozen writers. What struck me about Alemani’s inclusion of Chiang’s writing was not the reference to extraterrestrial life (many readers will be familiar with the accounts of UFO sightings in New Mexico), but the surreal, endlessly fascinating phenomenon of the looking glass.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><i>Once Within a Time</i> takes reflection as a major cue. Within each curated theme, such as “The Wheel of Telling” and “The Secret Life of Puppets,” are mirror images, doubles, reversals, and echoes, along with symmetries of place, histories, peoples, and legends — offering exhibition visitors concurrent rather than sequential events, in which multiple perspectives and timelines unfold. Even the treatment of the exhibition title, <a href=\"https://www.sitesantafe.org/en/once-within-a-time/\">in which “Time” is printed upside down</a>, gestures to alternative ways of experiencing the temporal, reflective nature of both art and language. </p>\n<p>Among the many echoing narratives are works by Nora Turato and Will Rawls. Turato’s mural “I WANT OUT!” (2025), a red vinyl triptych with one panel per word, is installed on the exterior of SITE Santa Fe, the main venue; inside the museum, Rawls’s <i>Amphigory </i>(2022), a series of inky, glitchy screen prints, seems to respond to Turato’s plea with the barely legible phrase “U Can’t Escape Alive.” </p>\n<p>In the gallery with Rawls is a suite of 72 computer drawings from 1969 by hard-edge abstract painter Frederick Hammersley, who died in 2009 at age 90. He hit an artistic dry spell in the late ’60s, saying, “I painted myself out,” a condition of exhaustion, liberation, or perhaps both. To shake things up, he enrolled in <a href=\"https://www.santafenewmexican.com/pasatiempo/art/by-design-art1-and-the-early-history-of-computer-art/article_f5239b0a-13d2-11eb-ae6c-378f161fb667.html\">a computer class for artists</a> at the University of New Mexico. He used the program ART 1 to create multiple printouts of the individual “drawings” that comprise the suite on view, visually undulating abstract compositions of gray monochrome letters, numbers, and punctuation marks. With additional presentations of Chester Nez and the “<a href=\"https://guides.loc.gov/navajo-code-talkers/profiles\">Original 29” Navajo Code Talkers</a>, Autumn Chacon’s radio frequency installation, and others, visitors may experience some seriously surreal data-driven reverberations.  </p>\n<p>In SITE’s central gallery space, color-rich reverse paintings on glass — a vase of flowers, a snake, a dreamlike landscape — by Rebecca Salsbury James, born in 1891, were just odd enough to make me linger and consider her time in Taos, New Mexico, with Mabel Dodge Luhan, Georgia O’Keeffe, and other New York-to-Taos transplants. A selection from James’s collection of miniatures, including figurines, mirrors, and devotional objects, is also on view, many of which are in pairs or otherwise doubled. One tells a story, but two hold a conversation.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere in the gallery, I felt like I was in a funhouse or hall of mirrors. Louise Bonnet’s fleshy, misshapen, iridescent-skinned figures had me reflecting on my own pale, bony frame as equally warped and grotesque, alien to New Mexico’s desert environment. Katja Seib’s large-scale portrait paintings present the concept of reflection in literal and metaphysical terms. For example, “Cornucopia” (2025) depicts a fortune teller revealing her cards to the viewer; in the background, a framed image of another woman doing the same creates an infinity mirror effect. Nearby, a travel chest that belonged to <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/money/Gertrudis-Barcelo\">Doña Tules</a>, dubbed the “Queen of Sin” for her business activities (gambling and possibly a brothel), sits in the corner lit by a red light bulb, which I read as a heavy-handed reference to the stigma applied to other fiercely independent women who’ve come to the region. </p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037395/seeing-new-mexico-through-the-looking-glass-site-santa-fe-12th-international/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Hailing from the upper classes of southern England, with regularized, side-parted, tamped-down hair, he spent much of his life in headlong flight from his upbringing.</p>\n    <p>Burra wanted to experience the shock of strangeness, to embrace the allure of the louche, the forbidden, the disapproved of. He sometimes left home for months at a time without even saying goodbye. Where has Edward gone? Nobody knew. Will he ever come back? Perhaps.</p>\n    <p>First it was to Paris, and then to Spain, the United States, and Mexico. As you walk around his carefully curated, chronologically organized <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/edward-burra\">exhibition</a> at Tate Britain of the best of a lifetime’s work, you can hear the drift of music in the air, the music Edward loved, the visceral excitement of jazz and how that excitement fed into the work of the Harlem years. You can even see a row of black vinyl discs along the wall. These were Edward’s records. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3754-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Edward Burra</i>at Tate Britain, London (photo Michael Glover/</p>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>It is riddling, foot-stomping, 1920s stuff, with all its wildness. You may feel an urge to put your arm around someone nearby and swerve them out onto the dance floor. There’s plenty of space in these galleries to make your mark.</p>\n    <p>Burra’s paintings, like him, are motoring away, at speed, from convention or respectability. Most are crowded with figures — you can almost smell the sweet sweat. You can almost feel the heady excitement of all those twists and turns and crazy swerves, the pushes and the pulls.</p>\n    <p>The figures’ limbs are often inclined to bend pneumatically, as if they might be nothing but inflatables. Fingers get stretched and rubberized. Features get squeezed into inhuman, mask-like shapes.

Who lives inside all these dangerously pouty cravings? This is erotic provocation on speed, surrealism lightly peppered with satire, and Burra records it all, relishing the particularity of his people and scenes. (It is he, of course, who has twisted things so out of shape.) Take a good, hard look at the weird grimaces of “The Two Sisters” (1929) or the parodic mistrust on display in “Balcony Toulon” (1929). In New York, he falls instantly for the appeal of Harlem’s nightlife — such gorgeous clinches to be savored in “Savoy Ballroom, Harlem” (1934)!</p>\n    <p>Then, once in Spain, amid the death and the turmoil and confusion of the Spanish Civil War, the mood and the palette darken, and the human figure begins to incline toward the anonymous and mechanized. War looms over these paintings. We stare into open graves to admire the skeletons.</p>\n    <p>At the end he returns to England and tries to work up some response to the puff-smoke of industry and the grit of working-class street life. Rude boys kick out in unison, like stiff performers on a stage. These paintings don’t quite convince — the old energy has left him. Burra can no longer dig deep enough.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/4.-Edward-Burra-Dancing-Skeletons-1934.-Tate-Purchased-1939-1200x1671.jpg?resize=1200%2C1671&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/13.-Edward-Burra-Simply-Heavenly-Scene-in-Harlem-1957.-Private-Collection-1200x812.jpg?resize=1200%2C812&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/11.-Edward-Burra-Balcony-Toulon-1929.-Private-collection-1200x1551.jpg?resize=1200%2C1551&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/12.-Edward-Burra-John-Deth-Hommage-to-Conrad-Aiken-1931-Whitworth-Art-Gallery-1200x862.jpg?resize=1200%2C862&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/10.-Edward-Burra-Valley-and-River-Northumberland-1972-1200x1799.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1799&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/6.-Edward-Burra-Minuit-Chanson-1931-Private-Collection-1200x901.jpg?resize=1200%2C901&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/15.-Edward-Burra-The-Watcher-1937-Scottish-National-Gallery-of-Modern-Art-1200x1821.jpg?resize=1200%2C1821&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/edward-burra\">Edward Burra</a> <i>continues at Tate Britain (Millbank, London, England) through October 19.

    "body": "<p>“Where did you get that rug??” is one of the questions I’m asked most often. Rugs were the first big purchase decor item I started collecting when I moved into <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/06/love-letter-all-the-places-i-lived/\">my first apartment</a>. Below you’ll find my favorite places to browse and buy rugs (the former of which I am almost always doing). There is a wide variety of brands, price points, and styles represented below, for a number of reasons. <br/>Even if you plan to buy more budget-friendly rugs, I still recommend browsing brands with rugs at all price points. In my experience, getting familiar with what’s available from different designers and at different shops is one of the best ways to get to know your style and what you’re drawn to most. I’ve found that if I expose myself to unique and interesting pieces, even if they are out of my price range, I learn to easily pick out the great pieces at stores with lower price points.</p>\n<p>I love what <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15333350\">Lulu &amp; Georgia</a> is doing with their rug collaborations. The <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15333314\">Sarah Sherman Samuel collection</a> is iconic! Along with the checkerboard rug we have in our current home, we had one of the rugs from this collection in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2020/04/the-often-overlooked-importance-of-decorating-your-bedroom/\">our main bedroom</a> at our previous house and loved it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15334757\">Chairish</a> is a place I love to browse rug styles, even though most are out of my price range. On a rare occasion, I will make a lowball offer—I’ve even had said offer accepted before (the vintage rug in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/03/how-to-be-brave-with-color-and-pattern-in-your-home/\">the family room</a> is from Chairish, as is the vintage rug in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/08/entryway-design-elements/\">the entryway</a>)! They still cost an arm and a leg, but they are forever pieces from a reputable site. Keep in mind that the Chairish return policy is very strict, so if you buy one here and do not like it, you only have forty-eight hours to submit your return.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3KGVIcg\">Loloi</a> is an amazing source for budget-friendly and kid-friendly (or pet-friendly!) rugs. They carry rugs in so many gorgeous styles, no matter your personal design taste. We have used them in areas where we know the kids and dog will play hard or may be more likely to spill. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15332981\">Annie Selke</a> carries super high-quality rugs for modern and traditional spaces. I love the punchy colors and graphic prints. We got an <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15332966\">Annie Selke runner</a> (pictured above) for our <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/03/everything-you-want-to-know-about-our-basement-kitchenette/\">basement kitchenette</a>, and combined several rugs into <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15335913\">a runner</a> for our basement stairs. We also had this <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15332870\">mini-checked rug</a> in our home for many years.</p>\n<p>I love <a href=\"https://shopstyle.it/l/bC3an\">eBay</a> for the DEALS you can find if you’re willing to be patient and/or negotiate. I purchased a Swedish kilim runner from eBay for the hallway to our bedroom (pictured above).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3qWoFcy\">ECARPETGALLERY</a> is a great source for vintage rugs at deep discounts. We have rugs from this store in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/07/how-design-theory-will-help-you-choose-the-right-rug-for-your-space/\">Joe’s office</a> and <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/02/blue-room-design/\">my office/library</a>. This is usually my first stop to see if a style I found on a site with more expensive pieces is available here at a lower price point. They update inventory often and have sales throughout the year, so this spot is worth keeping on your radar.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nordicknots.com/us\">Nordic Knots</a> carries rugs in solid colors and graphic patterns that are made in relatively small batches. We have two rugs from here—a <a href=\"https://nordicknots.com/us/product/grand-brick-red/\">red rug</a> in the dining room (pictured at the top of this post) and a <a href=\"https://nordicknots.com/us/product/grand-dusty-white/\">cream rug</a> in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/05/main-bedroom-tour/\">the main bedroom</a> (pictured above). One thing to expect is that these rugs tend to shed for the first couple of months you have them, so you may need to take additional vacuuming into consideration.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

    "body": "<p>Color and pattern add so much life and personality to a home. But for many of us, it’s hard to know where to start. We’re afraid of making mistakes or our homes looking too busy or cluttered. It wasn’t until I moved into a home where color and pattern were embraced that I even felt called to use their full potential. I realized I liked to be surrounded by color and pattern more than I thought I would.</p>\n<p>Five years into living with our eclectic and colorful home, I’ve learned the benefits of embracing color and pattern aren’t as simple as using my favorite colors—although this helps. Color and pattern are tools we can use beyond aesthetic qualities to evoke emotion, signal mood and vibe, and create a dynamic visual flow to make our house even more functional and enjoyable to live in.</p>\n<p>I stopped thinking about color and pattern as something you either “like” or “dislike” and instead embraced them as design tools to express ideas fully. This means even if you’re not into big bold colors and patterns, you can still benefit from the basic principles of using them deliberately.</p>\n<p>In this post, we’ll start by exploring the emotional reasons why it’s hard to be brave with color and pattern, and then I’ll offer some tips on how to get started and get better at it.</p>\n<p>Why is it so hard to be brave with color and pattern?</p>\n<p>There are a few reasons why stepping outside our comfort zones and using color and pattern in our homes can be challenging.</p>\n<p>Fear of making mistakes. We’re afraid that we’ll choose the wrong colors or patterns, and that our homes will end up looking ugly.</p>\n<p>Fear of being judged. We’re worried about what other people will think of our homes if they’re too colorful or patterned. We all have that friend whose well-intentioned remark on something that is very “us” and not “them” came off as snarky rather than loving. And sometimes, we are the ones who misinterpret it entirely! It’s time to let all that go. Doing our own thing means people will comment. And that’s OK. Let them. Being ourselves inspires others to be braver in their expression, which in the end, benefits us all. Be the one who starts that trend.</p>\n<p>Lack of confidence. We don’t trust our own taste, so we’re afraid to make bold choices. Let’s face it—the majority of us are not color experts! With the sheer amount of colors to choose from, it’s easy to psych yourself out.</p>\n<p>If you’re ready to start incorporating more color and pattern into your home, here are a few tips:</p>\n<p>Start small. Don’t try to do too much all at once. Start with a few small changes, like adding a colorful throw pillow to your couch or hanging a patterned curtain in your bedroom.</p>\n<p>Choose colors and patterns that you love. Don’t worry about what’s trendy or what other people like. Choose colors and patterns that make you happy and reflect your personality.</p>\n<p>Experiment. Don’t be afraid to experiment with different colors and patterns. Try out different combinations and see what you like best.</p>\n<p>Trust your gut. What you are first drawn to is often the right path to follow. Trust it. If you’re not sure about something, go with your gut. You’ll make the right choice.</p>\n<p>Some Ways to Get Better at Using Color and Pattern</p>\n<p>The more you work with color and pattern, the better you’ll get at it. Here are a few ways to improve your skills:</p>\n<p>Look for inspiration. Look for inspiration in magazines, books, and online. Pay attention to how different colors and patterns are used in different spaces.</p>\n<p>Take a class. If you’re really serious about learning how to use color and pattern, consider taking a class. This can be a great way to get expert advice and learn from others.</p>\n<p>Practice, practice, practice. The more you practice using color and pattern, the better you’ll get at it.

    "body": "<p>I was recently diagnosed with rosacea, which led me to take a closer look at the skincare products I was using. Through that process, I reassessed my skincare routine, paying special attention to how my skin reacts to different factors—especially my cycle. Right before my period, I tend to get a few pimples, and my rosacea flares up, so I focus on using gentle, soothing products during that time. I figured it was time to share what my routine looks like now. <strong>Today, I’m sharing my favorite skincare products, devices, and treatments that are working for me right now.</strong> In some categories, I rotate between a few go-to options depending on the day, while in others, I have a tried-and-true favorite I keep coming back to.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Products marked with an * were gifted to me by the brand.</i>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>1. </strong><strong>Rx Cleanser With Sodium Sulfacetamide and Sulfur</strong><br/>My dermatologist prescribed this cleanser to be used before my soap cleanser. It smells gross (like eggs) but if it helps keep my mild rosacea from flaring, I’m doing it. <strong>2. </strong><strong>Emma Lewisham Illuminating Oil Cleanser </strong><strong>*</strong><br/>I alternate between this oil cleanser and the one below depending on my mood or makeup. I find this cleanser easily removes waterproof makeup and I also like to use it when I have more time to incorporate facial massages. <strong>3. </strong><strong>CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser</strong><br/>This cleanser never irritates or fails to remove my makeup, and the price makes my other outrageous purchases sting a little less.</p>\n<p><strong>4. </strong><strong>SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic</strong><br/>I’ve used this vitamin C serum for years and years—it instantly brightens my complexion. I haven’t found a vitamin C I like as much! There was a period of time when I didn’t use it, and I noticed a clear increase in dark spots—a pretty telling sign of its effectiveness IMO.<strong>5. </strong><strong>Sunday Riley Good Genes</strong><i>*</i><br/>I use this serum about twice a week. This is enough exfoliation without aggravating my skin. It’s one of those products that moves the needle in terms of improving skin tone and texture. It is technically an acid, so be careful with this one if you have sensitive skin. <strong>Use WITANDDELIGHT15 for 15% off.</strong><strong>6. </strong><strong>Beauty Pie Über Youth Neck &amp; Chest Lift Serum Spray</strong><br/>My neck is becoming an area that’s lost elasticity since I’ve dropped weight and there is a whole wide world of creams and serums out there specifically formulated to treat the neck. I like this one a lot, especially because it’s easy to apply under a cream. </p>\n<p><strong>7. </strong><strong>Revision Skincare Nectifirm® Cream</strong><br/>And speaking of neck creams, this is the one I love the most out of the options I’ve tried. If I had to choose between the serum spray or cream, I think <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4iWo16V\">the cream</a> is the way to go. <strong>8. </strong><strong>INNBEAUTY Extreme Cream</strong><i>*</i><br/>I can’t say enough good things about <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-14616649\">this</a> deeply hydrating and firming lotion. It’s made me look alive again during my driest hours. It leaves my skin looking instantly plumper and, let’s face it, lifted. <strong>9. </strong><strong>UBeauty The Super Hydrator</strong><strong>*</strong><br/>This stuff is good at delivering a deeper level of hydration than moisturizer with a formula that includes peptides, hyaluronic acid, and panthenol. I’m no scientist but they’re known for creating this formula that goes on lightweight but still gets you that deeply hydrated feeling. I like this formula for warm days or for throwing on before a workout. <strong>Use WITANDDELIGHT20 for 20% off.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>10. </strong><strong>RMS Kakadu Beauty Oil</strong><i>*</i><br/>I have used a lot of facial oils in my day, and this one is hands down my favorite. It glides on smoothly, doesn’t have the lingering similarity to olive oil, and sinks in quickly enough to apply makeup right afterward. I use this oil as the last step in my routine, both in the morning and at night. After applying, I’ll often do about 30 seconds of facial massages under my eyes and on my neck—it’s a great way to help with puffiness. <strong>Use KATEA20 for 20% off.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/03/skincare-products-routine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>This month’s theme on Wit &amp; Delight is all about <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/06/mixing-interior-design-styles-june-2023-theme/\">the art of the mix</a> in interior design. I wanted to share more info on this topic and write about <i>how</i> you can apply the art of the mix in your own home.<br/>When I first sat down to write this article, I thought of the cookbook <i>Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat</i><i> </i>by Samin Nosrat (one I highly recommend!)<i>. </i>No, this is not an interior design book, but it <i>is</i> a book that helps people figure out how to mix and balance different elements in the realm of cooking. I decided to take a similar approach and write about how one can mix different elements in the realm of interior design.<strong>Today I’m sharing the five key interior design elements all of my favorite rooms have in common: color, pattern, texture, something old, and something that grounds the space.</strong> Here’s why each of these elements matters.</p>\n<p>If you’ve ever taken a painting class, you know that painters generally begin with a big field of one color on their canvas, which they then add to as they go. Consider the room you’re designing a canvas. Choose your base color first (which may be the existing color of the room <i>or</i> a color you plan to bring in), then consider which complementary colors you’d like to add to the mix. <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2020/07/a-color-skeptics-guide-to-color-theory-in-design/\">This article on color theory</a> will help you begin to get a sense of how different colors play together. <a href=\"https://www.houseandgarden.co.uk/article/paint-colour-rules\">This article from  House &amp; Garden</a> is also an interesting take on color rules to follow, according to interior designers.</p>\n<p>Pattern adds interest, depth, and emotion to any room. Without it, a space can feel somewhat flat. Patterns can be bold or subtle, colorful or neutral, and applied broadly or selectively. From wallpaper to upholstery to rugs to decor items, there is no shortage of ways to bring pattern into a home.</p>\n<p>I LOVE adding texture to any room. Similar to rooms without pattern, rooms without a variety of textures feel somewhat dull to me. I especially like to bring in texture through fabrics (e.g., velvet, linen, wool) and materials (e.g., rattan, marble, rustic wood, metal).</p>\n<p>There is always room for <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/10/thrift-antique-shopping-tips/\">something antique</a> in any room, particularly in spaces that are mostly filled with newer pieces. Be it furniture, art, light fixtures, or small decor items, old pieces bring <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/04/add-character-to-your-home/\">character and charm</a> to a home.</p>\n<p>A grounding element is something that acts as the foundation of a room; it’s the thing that brings the entire design together. I most often use an <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/01/rug-shopping/\">area rug</a> to ground a space. It helps define the seating area in a living room, bedroom, or dining room. It also offers another opportunity to bring color and texture to a space. <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/05/best-patterned-wallpaper/\">Wallpaper</a> can also be used as a grounding element, especially if you apply it to an accent wall and use a bold pattern. </p>\n<p>If you keep these five elements at the forefront of your mind throughout the design process, the art of the mix will become so much simpler. All of these elements are things you can continue to push and pull as your design preferences evolve. After all, each room in our home is meant to be seasoned and refined, bit by bit, rather than updated and finished in one fell swoop.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested in learning more about mixing elements in interior design, these are a few resources I’d recommend:</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

My friend <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lisahackwith/\">Lisa Hackwith</a> and her partner have spent years hosting friends and family at their cabin on a small lake, and over time, Lisa has developed a creative approach to cooking that makes weekends feel both effortless and special. <br/>Instead of hauling a long grocery list up north and ultimately leaving food to waste, she embraces the challenge of using a handful of ingredients in multiple ways, crafting menus as resourceful as they are delectable. This winter, she designed a weekend-long menu for a group of six that maximizes flavor, minimizes waste, and makes hosting a well-timed and intentional endeavor. From a cozy Friday night dinner to a Sunday send-off lunch, Lisa shows us that limitations in the kitchen can lead to inspired meals.<br/>This is the third installment in the Wit &amp; Delight entertaining series. Find even more recipes and entertaining inspiration in our first two posts on hosting a <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/08/casual-dinner-party/\">casual dinner party</a> and an <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/12/dessert-party/\">afternoon dessert party</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Friday Dinner</strong><br/>Potato, Bacon, and Sharp White Cheddar Cheese Pierogies With Sauteed Leeks and Buttermilk Crème Fraîche <br/>Arugula, Crispy Leek, Date, and Crouton Salad<strong>Saturday Breakfast</strong><br/>Jammy Eggs With Pickled Leeks, Dill, Capers, Smoked Salmon, and Buttermilk Crème Fraîche Toasts<strong>Saturday Lunch</strong><br/>Grilled Sharp White Cheddar Cheese, Bacon, and Date Sandwiches<br/>Arugula and Mustard Crouton Salad With Peppery Buttermilk Dressing<strong>Saturday Dinner</strong><br/>Pan-Roasted Salmon Fillets With Orange, Leek, Date, Capers, and Dill Salad<br/>Bacon Fat Twice-Baked Crispy Potatoes<strong>Saturday Dessert</strong><br/>Vanilla Date Buttermilk Bran Cake With Orange Crème Anglaise<strong>Sunday Breakfast</strong><br/>Buttermilk Bran Pancakes With Maple Syrup<strong>Sunday Lunch</strong><br/>Creamy Potato, Leek, and Poached Salmon Soup With Dill<strong>Total cost per person:</strong> $38</p>\n<p><strong>Lisa: </strong>When my husband and I first started hosting weekend getaways at our cabin, we would usually divide and conquer meal planning equally among our friends. I noticed that when we did that everyone usually lugged up at least a cooler’s plus worth of food and we always had way too much! A lot of the time no one knew what the other was bringing so the food could sometimes be way too heavy or we’d end up bringing the same thing. I wanted to create weekend-long menus that were easy, efficient, well-balanced, and let nothing go to waste.</p>\n<p><strong>Lisa: </strong>I think restraints can sometimes give room for more creativity. When I didn’t have a world of possibilities to create something new but a concise and small ingredient list, I found it easier to come up with new recipes. I love setting out all the ingredients for one weekend and just seeing what I can come up with!</p>\n<p><strong>Lisa: </strong>Yes! Sometimes it feels like the possibilities are endless! I was working on a spring menu last May and one of my ingredients was rhubarb. I ended up making the five recipes listed below—that’s when I realized there is so much you can do with just one ingredient!</p>\n<p><strong>Lisa: </strong>I start with what’s in season. Then I pick two to three main ingredients and start to build from there. After I come up with a few ideas, usually a few more ingredients come naturally into the mix. I settle on five to eight “stars” for the weekend and then let myself free flow and come up with as many combinations as I can think of. After that, I arrange my recipes into what I think would fit best into two dinners, two lunches, and two breakfasts. Sometimes there is a snack in there, one drink, and always one dessert.  </p>\n<p><strong>Lisa: </strong>Yes, sometimes it can feel restrictive and I can’t come up with combinations I’m happy about. I usually go back to the drawing board and just try a different combination of “stars” to see if I can come up with something new I’m excited about trying. And I’ve found that once I actually start cooking and tasting, new things often arise. Sometimes the best discovered are recipes that weren’t planned in my head but by tasting as I go while playing around in the kitchen.  </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/02/winter-weekend-menu-easy-recipes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Time management and organization have never come naturally to me. When life became unmanageable—a constant since my second child arrived—I looked to the experts. Not once did I think of listening to my own rhythm and body. Productivity, I thought, was something to master, not something to understand.<br/>Then I hit a wall.<br/>I was tired of feeling like this, so I stopped fighting my own nature. I stopped taking productivity advice from people who don’t have ADHD.<br/>For years, I had been trying to contort myself into someone I wasn’t—structured, disciplined, and neatly organized. A person who could follow a system designed for a brain that didn’t work like mine. Why had I ever believed I could manage my time the same way they did?<br/>The shift was subtle but changed everything. I’m unstuck, no longer languishing, moving ahead with purpose. I know I’ll get stuck again, but I also know this: I’m done chasing solutions that were never meant to work for me.<strong>Today, I’m sharing what  does work—how I get things done without draining myself in the process. </strong>Because when we work against who we are, burnout isn’t a possibility. It’s a guarantee.</p>\n<p>I define productivity as doing what I said I’d do—for myself, for others—in a way that makes sense for my life. I spent two years trying to heal burnout by “resting,” only to feel worse with each passing day. Turns out, rest isn’t just stillness. Some kinds of rest are active, and learning to restore <i>that</i> changed everything.</p>\n<p>Different kinds of rest follow different kinds of productivity. Knowing what you need means knowing your limits. Trying to function like someone without ADHD only pushed me further from those signals. ADHD brains need different types of rest—emotional, mental, creative, physical, passive.<br/>I don’t recharge by watching TV. I recharge by reading, cooking, taking long walks, and practicing Pilates. To outsiders, it might look like I’m always going, but this kind of movement restores me. Sometimes, organizing a junk drawer is self-care. Other times, it’s a warning sign. When I’m mentally drained, TV helps. When I’m emotionally overwhelmed, it makes me feel stuck. Learning the difference changed everything.</p>\n<p>We are taught to measure our worth by what we produce. Part of my midlife journey has been rejecting that, untangling my value from my output, and focusing on <i>making</i> rather than <i>measuring</i>. If you’re in the thick of that, this post may not be what you need today.<br/>Your worth is not your work. But making—creating, moving, shaping something from nothing—is an expression of <i>you</i>. It’s life-giving. It’s confidence-building. It’s the thing that can pull you out of a spiral before it takes hold. When I started honoring my inner drive to create, productivity stopped being something I chased. It became the natural result of <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/02/the-benefits-of-flow-and-how-to-find-it-for-yourself/\">finding my flow</a>. Momentum, not depletion. Creation, not extraction. And that changed everything.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>When I started honoring my inner drive to create, productivity stopped being something I chased.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>In 2019, Hugo Crosthwaite became the first Latino artist to win the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery’s (NPG) prestigious triennial Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition. The Tijuana-born and San Diego-based illustrator received the contest’s grand prize: $25,000 and a portrait commission for the museum’s permanent collection. He chose to depict Anthony Fauci, then the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), in a stop-motion format that captures the nuances of his complicated legacy, including his <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/how-dr-fauci-handled-aids-crisis-jexipk/26361/\">criticized and then celebrated</a> oversight of the HIV/AIDs epidemic.</p>\n    <p>Last week, Crosthwaite found his hard-won commission on a list of Smithsonian items that the White House found objectionable. He was one of at least three Mexican-born artists whose work was included on <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036180/trump-targets-lgbtq-history-migrants-and-more-in-chilling-smithsonian-hit-list/\">Trump’s art hit list</a>, along with illustrator <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036180/trump-targets-lgbtq-history-migrants-and-more-in-chilling-smithsonian-hit-list/\">Rigoberto González</a> and painter <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037811/smithsonian-latino-gallery-quietly-closes-for-nine-months/\">Felipe Galindo Gómez</a>.</p>\n    <p>“My first reaction was surprise,” Crosthwaite shared in an interview with <i>Hyperallergic. </i>“But then later on, [I] felt a bit of pride to be included in this list of other wonderful artists and wonderful projects that talk about the diversity of the United States’ history.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Hugo-Foto-1-1200x1485.jpg?resize=1200%2C1485&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>In 2022, after winning the Outwin competition, Crosthwaite and the NPG considered a list of individuals for a portrait. They agreed on Fauci as the commission’s subject. At the time, the infectious disease specialist was a polarized figure: a revered pandemic hero and a detested political opponent of the right.</p>\n    <p>“I jumped at the chance of doing this because it was 2022, we were in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Crosthwaite told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “He became a symbol of this fight between science and truth, against conspiracy theories; Dr. Fauci kind of epitomizes the nation’s current political divide.”</p>\n    <p>The five-minute stop motion animation, “A Portrait of Dr. Anthony Fauci” (2022), begins by portraying him as a young scientist in a lab. Later, a man infected by an unnamed virus becomes emaciated until he disappears into a black hole that morphs into a scene from ACT UP protests. Men carry signs that read “Silence = Death” and “Killed by the System.” Behind them, skeletons look to the sky.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/facui2-1200x904.jpeg?resize=1200%2C904&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The artwork references the AIDs memorial quilt before transitioning into a segment about the COVID-19 pandemic, in which a woman’s lungs explode into tiny bits of paper. Fauci is portrayed next to the White House press briefing room podium, where he often gave virus updates alongside Trump. Crosthwaite included a thumbs-up icon<strong> </strong>moving erratically up and down behind the podium, and Fauci off to the side. He also captured anti-Fauci sentiment and the right-wing rejection of vaccines, at one point portraying the scientist with devil horns. The stop-motion sequence ends with a woman receiving a vaccine, which cuts to a portrait of an aging Fauci.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/fauci3-1200x894.jpeg?resize=1200%2C894&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Crosthwaite told <i>Hyperallergic </i>that he doubts the Trump administration actually watched the video, instead targeted the work because of his identity. He rebuffed the White House’s Smithsonian list as a mediocre attempt to win a culture war, and said being included on the list was a badge of honor.</p>\n    <p>“The portrait was done from the perspective of a Mexican-American artist, someone who’s cognizant of the impact of age and COVID-19 on my community, which is presented in the animation … the diverse people who are being attacked by viruses,” he said.</p>\n    <p>The artworks that Crosthwaite initially submitted to the Outwin competition had nothing to do with Fauci. In fact, the work that secured his national win was a different stop-motion animation, telling the story of a woman he met who had crossed the US-Mexico border illegally.</p>\n    <p>Crosthwaite commended the Outwin prize’s capacity to open doors for artists like himself. Any artist residing in the United States who is at least 18 years old is eligible to submit to the competition. For Crosthwaite, it was life-changing.</p>\n    <p>“Getting the commission to do the portrait of Dr. Fauci is actually a great honor — being part of the Smithsonian,” Crosthwaite told <i>Hyperallergic. </i>“My piece is part of the record of American history.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Screen-Shot-2025-08-29-at-2.58.33-PM-1200x898.jpeg?resize=1200%2C898&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/fauci-1200x904.jpeg?resize=1200%2C904&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038060/hugo-crosthwaite-artist-whose-fauci-portraits-enraged-the-white-house/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>LONDON — Some of the Courtauld’s previous exhibitions have <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1010475/the-cortaulds-impressionism-show-is-a-victim-of-corporate-curating/\">suffered from insufficient curation</a>. <a href=\"https://courtauld.ac.uk/whats-on/exh-abstract-erotic/\"> Abstract Erotic: Louise Bourgeois, Alice Adams, Eva Hesse</a>, on the other hand, strikes the exact right balance. Drawing on scholar Jo Applin’s research, curator Alexandra Gerstein has taken as a starting point the work of feminist curator and critic Lucy Lippard, who coined the titular term to describe this sensuous strand of art emerging in 1960s New York. Making perhaps the best use yet of the Courtauld’s teeny exhibition spaces next to the permanent collection, this small but unstuffed show gives proper breathing space for artistic dialogue and, crucially, for the viewer to engage in exploring differences and similarities between works and practices for themselves. </p>\n    <p>In 1966, Lippard curated the exhibition <i>Eccentric Abstraction</i> to capture a new wave of sculptures created from unusual, pliable materials like wire, plastic mesh, netting, and latex, which evoked tactile organic forms and, by extension, the human body. This is the Courtauld’s first show devoted to standalone sculpture, and the contrast between these blob-like forms and its Impressionist-heavy permanent collection may go some way to recreate just how different — even alarming — these pieces will have appeared to 1960s audiences just getting over the shock of Abstract Expressionism’s  rehauling of formalist painting.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Installation-view-l-r-Bourgeois-_Avenza_-_Lair_-_Fee-Couturiere_-_Hanging-Janus_-1200x880.jpg?resize=1200%2C880&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Abstract Erotic: Louise Bourgeois, Eva Hesse, Alice Adams</i>, featuring works by Eva Hesse and Alice Adams (all photos Olivia McEwan/</p>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>The three artists are each afforded an introductory caption presenting historical context. No direct written comparisons are made between them, nor any attempt to force commonality, for historically, there is none other than their working in generally the same space and time. This is good curating: The show allows viewers to ask and think for themselves. Its skill lies in making suggestions via the pieces selected for display, allowing for robust visual comparison. Viewers won’t be able to ignore the strain of eroticism that stems from their irresistible tactility, which is both alluring and fear-inducing, nor their uncanny resemblance to certain human appendages (<i>ahem</i>).</p>\n    <p>Applin and Gerstein do point out that all three artists’ experimentation with latex marked a turning point in their explorations of eroticism and the unconscious. The exhibition’s most well-known artist, Bourgeois, was born in Paris in 1911 and moved to New York in 1938. Duly included here is her “Filette (Sweeter Version)” (1968–99/ 2006), unmistakably an erect penis (or, more accurately, one yanked upwards by string) in urethane rubber, given the ambiguous French title “Little Girl.” Adams graduated from Columbia University with a degree in Fine Arts in 1953 before becoming an accomplished weaver. Her foray into obscure materials is here represented by such pieces as the nearby “Expanded Cylinder” (1970), in which she allowed latex foam to expand and set into a constricting tube of chain link, producing a regular weave-like texture while maintaining a phallic, slippery form. Finally, Hesse, born in 1936 in Hamburg before settling in New York, made sculptures of forms bound, twisted, and caught in netting. Applin and Gerstein draw out the latex connection again via the caption, which quotes Hesse on the material’s inevitable deterioration: “Art doesn’t last; life doesn’t last.” Fittingly, though unfortunately, there are no latex examples here.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Installation-view-l-r-Hesse-untitled-pieces-and-_No-Title-or-Not-Yet_-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>It is also unfortunate that this small but perfectly formed show was relatively empty on a weekend. The scrappy, experimental mark-making explored by these three pioneering artists is one important strain in the development of feminist art. Their unsettling forms provoke, titillate, and amuse — welcome responses to female voices and artistic expression. Perhaps it is reflective of trends in audience attention that a solid academic show like this should be less visited than the packed-out recent exhibitions on <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/804963/what-does-peter-doig-have-to-do-with-the-impressionists/\">Peter Doig</a> or yet more <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1010475/the-cortaulds-impressionism-show-is-a-victim-of-corporate-curating/\">Impressionism</a>.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>When the United States Department of Agriculture established the Farm Security Administration (FSA) in 1937, hoping to provide aid to rural communities affected by the Great Depression, it also implemented a photography project headed by government official Roy Stryker. The photographs were meant to generate support for the agency, allowing the public to witness the impacts of the Depression for themselves. Made by recruited photographers and then selected by Stryker for inclusion in traveling exhibitions and news outlets, the chosen images overwhelmingly depicted White families — a narrow and literally whitewashed view of rural America.</p>\n    <p><i> Crafting Sanctuaries: Black Spaces of the Black Great Depression South</i>, a new exhibition at the Museum of Art and Light in Manhattan, Kansas, showcases a broader view of FSA imagery, focusing on Black Southerners documented by photographers like Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Russell Lee, Marion Post Wolcott, Arthur Rothstein, Ben Shahn, and Jack Delano across six states: Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Florida, Mississippi, and Missouri. </p>\n    <p>Presented in partnership with Art Bridges Foundation, the photos highlight the intimacy of life among one’s community — private quarters, public gathering spaces — and the care taken to build one together. The exhibition, curator Tamir Williams told <i>Hyperallergic</i>, “is an examination of the significance of Black Southerners investing in their spatial worlds — and more largely in beauty — while living through this intense period of economic hardship and racial violence.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Sr4qw-1200x905.jpeg?resize=1200%2C905&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>During the summer of 2023, Ashley Holland, curator and director of Curatorial Initiatives for the Art Bridges Foundation, approached Williams to curate its first in-house traveling exhibition, drawing from the FSA photography collection. At the time, they’d just begun a job there as a curatorial research assistant.</p>\n    <p>“I came across Nicholas Natanson’s <i> The Black Image in the New Deal: The Politics of FSA Photography</i> (1992) and Sarah Boxer’s ‘</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/12/whitewashing-the-great-depression/616936/\">Whitewashing the Great Depression</a>’ (2020) for</p>\n    <p><i>The Atlantic</i>,” Williams said. “I knew that I wanted to focus on this issue of the absence of Black and other non-White persons from the larger visual memory of the Great Depression — and specifically explore how and why this exclusion happened and how it could be redressed.”</p>\n    <p>Williams spent a week poring over the Library of Congress’s digital FSA collection. They were drawn to images of small homes built by both White and Black laborers, particularly in La Forge, Missouri. Curious about “what home and homemaking might have looked like for other Black persons and families beyond La Forge,” they expanded their research.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/gdoxx-1200x797.jpeg?resize=1200%2C797&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The exhibition’s photographs are reverent, offering glimpses into otherwise unseen instances of Black domesticity and community. “I find Jack Delano’s ‘Negro tenant family near Greensboro, Alabama’ (1941) to be incredibly striking,” shared Javier Rivero Ramos, associate curator at Art Bridges. In the image, a young family poses in their home, the walls and ceilings plastered and reinforced with newspaper clippings, a kitten at their feet. “It seems like every conceivable emotion, thought, and event unfolding through the country is somehow refracted in the image,” Ramos added. Ibby Ouweleen, Art Bridges curatorial associate, said they were “taken by Marion Post Wolcott’s interior scene of three children and a dog in their family home, which feels sort of magical and mundane at once.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/WzRNF-1200x897.jpeg?resize=1200%2C897&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The exhibition is displayed in tandem with <i>Sanctuary in Motion</i>, a companion installation developed in collaboration with the Yuma Street Cultural Center. Kristy Peterson, vice president of Learning, Engagement, and Visitor Experiences at the museum, pointed to the history of the site.</p>\n    <p>“Manhattan, Kansas, has a rich history as a town site established by abolitionist settlers, circa 1855,” Peterson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “<i>Sanctuary in Motion</i> shares information about Manhattan’s history and community, and tells the story of Yuma Street [part of the city’s Historic District] … and its significance as a sanctuary where families made something out of nothing.”</p>\n    <p><i>Crafting Sanctuaries</i>, which runs through next spring, is both a corrective and a meditation. “It is my hope that these photographs allow viewers to see and witness how Black Southerners adopted expansive definitions of beauty to craft personal and communal sanctuaries and spaces of respite,” Williams said.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/y1qCn-1200x893.jpeg?resize=1200%2C893&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038134/reclaiming-a-whitewashed-history-of-the-great-depression-museum-art-light-kansas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Joe Amrhein and Susan Swenson were going to sit out the Armory Show this fall for the first time in a quarter century until they got a call last month from the fair’s director.</p>\n<p>The owners of Pierogi Gallery in Brooklyn’s Williamsburg neighborhood initially did not apply this year due to the show’s rising booth costs, which can exceed tens of thousands of dollars. Pierogi is planning the next phase of its business, which could include <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/970425/a-williamsburg-family-reunion-at-pierogi-gallery-30th-anniversary-opening/\">relocating to Lower Manhattan</a>. </p>\n<p>But Armory executives Kyla McMillan and J. Tyler Woodall appealed to Pierogi and the fair’s shared history — in 2016, Amrhein suggested the Armory use an empty space to display Jonathan Schipper’s <a href=\"https://www.jonathanschipper.com/slow-motion-car-crash\">installation</a> of a Volkswagen Golf crashing into a wall; the presentation of large-scale art has since become a cornerstone of the show. They recently negotiated a smaller exhibition space for Pierogi with a lower rate, enabling the gallery to return.</p>\n<p>“We had been on the fence about it since the economy is very uncertain and it’s a big investment,” Swenson said. “We’re not one of the big box galleries. Some of them have their own economies now.”</p>\n<p>The Armory Show has come a long way from exhibiting several New York gallerists on three floors of the Gramercy Park Hotel in the mid-1990s. Since 2021, the fair has set up camp at the spacious Javits Center near Manhattan’s Hudson Yards, where it will host some 230 galleries from more than 35 countries from September 4 through 7.</p>\n<p>The show also has new owners. Two years after Frieze <a href=\"https://www.frieze.com/article/frieze-acquires-armory-show-and-expo-chicago\">acquired</a> the Armory Show and EXPO Chicago, its parent company, Endeavor Group Holdings, sold its roster of art fairs for <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/biz/news/ari-emanuel-buys-frieze-endeavor-group-1236383561/\">$200 million</a> to Hollywood superagent Ari Emmanuel. The former Endeavor CEO envisions Frieze as a key piece of a new global events company he formed this year, and perhaps one positioned to compete with Art Basel’s dominance in the contemporary art market.</p>\n<p>But with a reported downturn in the market, galleries have been weighing their options.</p>\n<p>Once mainstays at the Armory, blue-chip institutions have instead drifted toward Frieze’s <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1011006/frieze-new-york-is-back-to-its-old-ways/\">spring fair</a>, the Art Dealers Association of America’s (ADAA) Art Show (before it was abruptly <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032202/as-adaas-art-show-changes-course-a-nonprofit-is-left-in-limbo/\">canceled</a> this year), or TEFAF New York — or they are skipping the New York fairs entirely. David Zwirner hasn’t exhibited at the Amory Show since <a href=\"https://www.davidzwirner.com/fairs/2022/the-armory-show\">2022</a>, and chose to show at ADAA several years before that. Pace Gallery’s last year at the Armory was <a href=\"https://www.pacegallery.com/artfairs/the-armory-show-4/#:~:text=At%20The%20Armory%20Show%202019%2C%20Pace%20Gallery%20will%20present%20a,of%20twelve%20LED%20panel%20artworks.\">2021</a>. Gagosian hasn’t shown at the Amory since <a href=\"https://gagosian.com/fairs-and-collecting/fairs/armory-show-new-york-2020-rudolf-polanszky/\">2020</a>, back when it was held at Piers 92 and 94. Lisson hasn’t been at the fair since <a href=\"https://www.lissongallery.com/news/lisson-gallery-at-the-armory-show-s-25th-edition\">2019</a>.</p>\n<p>Others are busy courting international buyers in Asia and the Middle East, where <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1014206/does-the-art-world-need-a-new-art-basel-fair-in-qatar/\">Art Basel Qatar</a> will launch in Doha in February 2026. It doesn’t help that Frieze is competing against itself: Its three-year-old Frieze Seoul fair overlaps with Armory next week, forcing galleries to choose.</p>\n<p>“Everybody is asking where we should be investing our energy and time and our focus,” David Norr, partner at James Cohan Gallery, told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “The cost of shipping, travel and built-in expenses in participation in these fairs continues to go up.”</p>\n<p>Others are simply skipping the season altogether. Jack Shainman stepped back from showing at New York fairs in recent years to focus on its exhibitions in Chelsea and the newly renovated <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/867108/jack-shainman-gallery-takes-over-manhattans-historic-clock-tower/\">Clock Tower building</a> in Civic Center. After wildfires <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/982535/it-looks-like-a-bomb-exploded-la-artists-grapple-with-loss-as-fires-rage/\">ravaged Los Angeles</a> in January, Night Gallery chose a gallery residency at Arsenal Contemporary instead of participating in several international art fairs.</p>\n<p>“This is both a result of the market and our ability to be in multiple places at once,” Night Gallery spokesperson Shy Watson said. “We are trying to create alternative models of exhibition, promotion, sales, and community.”</p>\n<p>The Armory is used to a relatively high degree of churn. This year, 55 galleries are participating in the fair for the first time, with another 20 returning from a hiatus, roughly in line with figures from 2024, a fair spokesperson said.</p>\n<p>But the relative lack of large commercial institutions at the show presents an opportunity for New York galleries to cultivate new collectors and promote their artists to a broader audience.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038050/new-york-art-dealers-get-candid-ahead-of-the-armory-show-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>A round of layoffs at the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) this summer is raising alarms at one of the best-known arts schools in the country as the institution grapples with rising costs.</p>\n<p>The Santa Clarita-based private arts school laid off nine administrative employees in July, including five unionized workers and four non-union workers, claiming in a schoolwide message that CalArts needed to cut expenses in the face of a projected <a href=\"https://calarts.edu/sites/default/files/2025-05/Toward%20a%20Sustainable%20Financial%20Future%20for%20CalArts.pdf\">$15 million deficit</a>.</p>\n<p>“The nine staff positions, as well as about a dozen vacant staff positions, are being eliminated as part of a necessary workforce reduction, which will enable CalArts to address a structural deficit, prioritize student-facing services, and better align our staffing with current and projected enrollments to continue providing exceptional educational opportunities to our students,” a CalArts spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>.</p>\n<p>But faculty and staff members are questioning the administration’s decision, arguing that the layoffs could harm the school’s ability to train and nurture the next generation of artists.</p>\n<p>“Everyone was disappointed in this having to happen at all when we’re working so hard to try to better serve the population,” Emily Lytle-Painter, a web and digital media producer at CalArts and union member, told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “When we were trying to go into discussions with the administration, we felt like there were other avenues.”</p>\n<p>Tensions between CalArts employees and school leadership have been simmering since last fall, when dozens of faculty and staff <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DCikoHURbCM/?hl=en\">decided to form a union</a> after enduring what they described as years of stagnant wages, increased workloads, and minimal benefits. In December, CalArts faculty <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/972509/calarts-staff-and-faculty-move-to-unionize/\">delivered a letter</a> to President Ravi Rajan announcing their intention to organize with United Auto Workers in a unit that would represent approximately 600 workers. They held elections in March and ratified the union a month later.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the school had been struggling with enrollment, which <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/institutions/specialized-colleges/2024/04/08/enrollment-declines-threaten-small-independent#:~:text=Though%20it\"s%20enrollment%20has%20also,creative%20industries%2C%E2%80%9D%20Rajan%20said.\">declined</a> by about 12 percent since the pandemic, from 1,532 students in 2019 to 1,353 students in 2023 (tuition surpassed <a href=\"https://calarts.edu/admissions-aid/tuition/tuition-and-fees/cost-attendance\">$60,000</a> per year in 2025–26). </p>\n<p>In an April 2024 interview, Rajan told <i>Inside Higher Education</i> that CalArts was “<a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/institutions/specialized-colleges/2024/04/08/enrollment-declines-threaten-small-independent#:~:text=Though%20it\"s%20enrollment%20has%20also,creative%20industries%2C%E2%80%9D%20Rajan%20said.\">fiscally sound</a>.” But the school proceeded with several budget cuts to reduce its operating costs, including tighter spending controls, hiring delays and travel limitations, and adjustments to admissions and financial aid packages. These measures, Rajan said in a schoolwide message, saved the school $5.5 million.</p>\n<p>This spring, CalArts sought to reduce its headcount and sent voluntary separation and early retirement notices to between 50 and 60 faculty and staff, union leaders estimated. But only 32 employees, including 22 faculty and 10 staff, took the school’s offer and Rajan moved ahead with layoffs despite vociferous <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DN3-oBcEmIH/?igsh=MXExOWNyY2VhY2J5Yg%3D%3D\">objections</a> from the union. </p>\n<p>“I acknowledge how painful this news is,” Rajan wrote in a July 15 letter to faculty and staff reviewed by <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “These are not just abstract positions—they are roles held by our colleagues, teammates, and friends. I’m immensely grateful for their contributions and mindful of the weight of this moment for our community.” </p>\n<p>When the school announced layoffs, union leaders bargained with the administration for three months of severance, instead of two weeks of pay per year of service; three months of COBRA insurance; and priority rehiring in any vacant positions over the next two years for anyone who was laid off.</p>\n<p>“Everyone is understandably sad and worried, and there’s a general feeling of having to move forward with what we have,” Lytle-Painter said. “I personally was really proud of our bargaining team being able to bargain for increased benefits for those affected by the layoffs. That’s part of why we have a union.”</p>\n<p>Thomas Leeb, an adjunct faculty member in the School of Music and union member, said he is approaching the next academic year that starts on September 8 with mixed emotions.</p>\n<p>“A lot of institutional knowledge has left with the voluntary separation program, and that’s sad and it hurts. At the same time, there’s a bit of optimism,” Leeb said, referencing the newly formed union. “Someone I spoke to who has been at CalArts for 25 years said this is the first time he felt protected.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038229/facing-15m-budget-deficit-calarts-lays-off-workers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The past few months, I’ve been trying a different approach to getting dressed. Instead of asking <i>Is this flattering?</i> or <i>Does this go together?</i>, I’ve been asking <i>Do I like how this feels? Do I like how this looks? </i>I’m reaching for baggy pants, oversized button-downs, sneakers, and maxi dresses—clothes I used to avoid because they weren’t “feminine” or “put-together” enough. Now they’re exactly what I want.</p>\n    <p>I wore this on one of those in-between days where it’s hot in the sun but cool in the breeze. This sweater tee reminds me of something I wore on repeat in college. The hat and sunglasses are louder than I usually go, but I love how they shift the whole mood to <i>do not disturb; probably reading.</i></p>\n    <p>This outfit came together in five seconds and felt easy, but totally different in the best way. I threw the button-down over the dress because I saw “the kids” doing it at the last concert I attended. Now I want to wear this combo every day. It’s simple and unfussy.</p>\n    <p>I love this dress because it’s soft and swingy but structured enough to feel up for taking it out to a party. The flip flops make it casual, and the basket bag makes it feel like I could end up at a market in the South of France… or Target. Which is my reality, but I keep dreaming anyway.</p>\n    <p>This is what I wear when I want to feel cool but also like I’m in pajamas. I threw this on after a swim, added some layered necklaces, and suddenly it looked intentional.</p>\n    <p>This outfit just made me happy. I started with the pants (bows!), which felt like an outfit in their own right, and kept the top breezy and the accessories summery.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

    "body": "<p>Father’s Day is coming up on Sunday, June 15, and picking something thoughtful but cool for dads who know exactly what they like can be a bit tricky. Here’s a collection of Father’s Day gift ideas inspired by my husband—he loves well-made things, has a great eye for design, spends weekends biking or coaching baseball, and appreciates stylish clothing and accessories (think New Balance, Norse Projects, Bode) and great music (FKJ, Fred Again..).<br/>Joe provided his own thoughts on each of these items, both for my benefit and yours. Happy gift shopping! – Kate</p>\n<p>Yes, dads can carry tote bags—and if the dad in your life does, he’ll find that they are incredibly practical. The “go bag” of summer can hold the ever-evolving kids’ gear, swimsuits, groceries, and heck, even a bottle of wine for after the game if time allows. I live out of my tote in the summer.</p>\n<p>While these are not the glasses one would wear to a wedding reception, they are for the blossoming runner, hiker, or biker who understands how much more enjoyable the experience is with a nice pair of shades.</p>\n<p>It’s 2025, and I’m not saying our grandpas were wrong, but having rough palms isn’t a sign of bravery; it’s a sign that you might need to use some hand balm. It takes approximately six seconds to apply, and he’ll thank me later.</p>\n<p>My thoughts on sauce are pretty well documented, and this chili crisp will transform the most entry-level panini or protein into a flavor-packed experience. Heck, I put it on steamed broccoli.</p>\n<p>Our kids give me grief as they claim I have music on 90% of waking hours, and they’re not wrong. I like to play a wide array of “chunes” to help up the energy on a sleepy morning or get us pumped up before heading to the ball fields. And with a simple carabiner, this will easily clip onto Dad’s golf bag.</p>\n<p>A hat that doesn’t have a major league baseball team or local baseball association logo on it, that his partner actually thinks is cool and might borrow from him? It does exist. The seersucker material breathes and is perfect for summer.</p>\n<p>The ultimate “dad” shoe. Nothing screams I’m up at six for the soccer game quite like a gray on gray on gray New Balance 998. I recently procured my first pair of New Balance, and can attest that they are the most comfortable sneakers I’ve ever worn.</p>\n<p>I love a statement shirt that breaks out of my reliable navy, forest green, and gray color palette.  This piece of wearable art is beautiful and reminds me of something my grandmother made me when I was a child. I love <a href=\"https://bode.com/collections/mens-one-of-a-kind/products/island-sunrise-shirt-s-m\">this style</a> too.</p>\n<p>If the kids are now old enough to go on bike rides that can take the family outside of the neighborhood and to area ice cream shops, breweries, and restaurants, one thing Dad will need is a bike lock to ensure the trusty steeds are there after the meal.</p>\n<p>J. Crew makes a fantastic pair of swim trunks. In addition to my versatile solid color Patagonia baggies, the trunks here offer some fun patterns that fit well and can handle the lake, the pool, or the splash pad.</p>\n<p>Co-managing the family calendar is not for the faint of heart—I’ve found that writing things down can reduce the “oh sh*% soccer is at 5 pm?!” drills. In addition, sometimes our kids will write motivational messages on my rad dad notepad that help me through the slog of days filled with Zoom calls.</p>\n<p>Kate gave me a lot of grief when she discovered this product on my wish list, but she’s also the catalyst behind my newfound interest in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/03/skincare-products-routine/\">skin care</a>. Can you simply fill a large bowl with water and ice cubes? You sure can, but this tub has a breathing tube so you can snorkel for literal minutes without coming up for air. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/06/best-fathers-day-gift-ideas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>I love having a closed-concept home.<strong>To me, a closed-concept home means that (in most cases) there isn’t a direct view from one main living space to the next. </strong>Rooms are separated by either a wall, a door, or an archway. In our home, while there is a view from the entryway to the sitting room to the dining room, most of our main living areas are separate from the others.</p>\n    <p>A girlfriend recently reminded me what happened the first time I had her over for dinner. I let the dogs in the back door, covered in mud, and a mess quickly ensued. I closed the doors between the kitchen and the rest of the house to contain the mess, cleaned everything up, and then got back to the party pretty quickly. It was something I’d become so used to, I didn’t think twice about it! It wasn’t until she brought it up that I realized how useful the layout is for our family’s lifestyle. <br/>When we have people over, it’s also easier to do last-minute cleaning and to maintain a general sense of order since things don’t spread out from room to room as much.</p>\n    <p>Now that the kids are getting a little older, we can let them play independently more often, and Joe and I can have alone time in separate spaces. Having the rooms divided up helps facilitate this, and I treasure the alone time I can get in an otherwise busy life.<br/>It should be noted that we do live in a bigger house <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2020/04/were-moving-a-goodbye-to-the-house-that-built-our-family-of-5/\">than we did before</a>. This means there’s naturally more space to spend time separately. However, we tend to use about half of the house most frequently when it’s just our immediate family, so the closed-concept floor plan definitely still helps provide some separation. </p>\n    <p>When you are designing within an open-concept floor plan, you’re first and foremost building the design around a cohesive scheme. It takes a bit of skill to figure out how to do that. With our closed-concept spaces, it’s felt like each room can have its own personality.<br/>While I’ll consider the overall color palette of the home when I’m designing any given room, I don’t feel a need to be too closely tied to it. This made the process of experimenting with rooms in our main living areas especially fun. You can see the individual personality of different spaces in rooms like the <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/02/blue-room-design/\">blue library/office</a> and the <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/09/one-year-later-its-finally-here-the-design-reveal-of-our-family-room/\">green family room</a>.</p>\n    <p>I know from experience that when you have a big great room with a TV, it’s easier to get set in your routines. When it comes to downtime, this often includes the TV. In this home, with separate spaces without a TV, we’re drawn to do different activities. The kids will read when I’m working in the office, we’ll play games in the living room, and we’ll do crafts at the kitchen island.</p>\n    <p>Kate is the founder of Wit &amp; Delight.

    "body": "<p>I see such a deep connection between our interior lives and the way physical movement creates space—not just physically, but emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. Movement has been the foundation of my healing journey, and while my body may look different than it did a few years ago, it’s just a small reflection of the deep transformation I’ve experienced. When we move with intention, with presence, we start to feel what it’s like to really live in ourselves. To fully occupy who we are. <br/>That’s why I wanted to sit down with Berit Ahlgren, the founder of <a href=\"https://www.spacesunna.com/\">Sunna</a>. She’s created something that’s more than a movement class. It’s a kind of invitation. A gentle but powerful reminder that healing doesn’t have to be performative, and that we can return to ourselves at any time. I wanted to ask her how it all came to be, what keeps her going, and what she’s dreaming about next.<strong>Twin Cities locals,  check out Sunna at 514 2nd Street SE in Minneapolis! </strong>New clients can claim a </p>\n<p>Berit:<strong> </strong>This is such a beautiful, poignant question—thank you for asking. I grew up in dance and made a life and career out of it. Since opening <a href=\"https://www.spacesunna.com/\">Sunna</a>, my involvement with dance has massively slowed, but will never cease to exist. Dance has brought me joy, freedom, playfulness, and presence, as well as a powerful way to process sadness and pain. But “exercise” has always felt like a “should”—to negate what I ate and drank, to strive to look a certain way, to do what I read, heard, or saw was the right, trendy, or healthy thing every woman should be doing. I’ve had to learn to reframe my daily activity as something that helps me feel like me, an important part of how I developed who I am over four decades, a part of my day that leaves me feeling complete.<br/>I’ve learned to see movement, dance, or otherwise, as a means to find gratitude in my strength and acknowledge a privilege not everyone has. Knowing that movement brings endorphins and keeps my body healthy is a mindset I’ve adapted as I look in the mirror and witness a naturally aging body. But mentally, there is still something there that feels shame or guilt when I don’t prioritize a portion of my day to move my body. I’m still sorting this out and admit that there are layers of expectation that are likely unhealthy.<br/>Like you, I’m learning to listen more to physical feeling and not mental expectation, and perhaps because this has been a newfound understanding for me, it has shown up as a guiding force for Sunna as well. I encourage students to note their energetic, physical, and emotional selves to make a smart decision about what kind of class to partake in on any given day—feel what they really need, not just what expectations tell them. Within classes, too, I constantly remind people to tune into their feelings. What I’m offering as an instructor is a suggestion, but their agency to intensify or pare down the level of the class based on their feelings is a skill and strength to practice—one that doesn’t always come naturally in how our culture has guided us to associate with our bodies.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/05/sunna-minneapolis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>After four months <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/01/why-i-quit-drinking-alcohol/\">alcohol-free</a>, I started my “soberish” chapter in early March. It began as unceremoniously as it ended—no dramatic moment, just a quiet shift. Since then, it’s been going well: a drink or two a week. <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/08/casual-dinner-party/\">Dinner parties</a> now wrap up with one glass of wine, a feat I never thought possible.</p>\n    <p>What’s made this shift feel manageable is knowing <i>why</i> I want a drink when I do—and finding something else that gives me exactly what I was looking for. That part surprised me. Because I’ve realized, not drinking is actually easier than only <i>sometimes</i> drinking. Gray areas are squishy. And what I’ve learned in the squish is this: What I want when I crave a drink usually isn’t alcohol. It’s a moment to unwind. To relax. To savor something lovingly prepared.<br/>Now, my favorite nonalcoholic drinks are staples in my house. I reach for them more often than wine. Going dry for four months taught me that the desire to drink was almost always a desire to treat myself, soften the day, and feel a little bit held. And it turns out, I can do all of that—without alcohol.</p>\n    <p>If you are craving a cocktail, this is the best alternative I’ve found out there! I drank these through holiday parties and didn’t miss my beloved martinis once I found them.</p>\n    <p>Oh, my other beloved drink! I love all flavors of Ghia, but my favorites are the <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16781118\">Sumac &amp; Chili</a> and <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16781104\">Lime &amp; Salt</a>.</p>\n    <p>My friend Peder co-founded this NA brand, and it’s a gorgeous bottle worthy of dinner parties or special occasions. The main ingredient is pine tea (made from local white pine)—it’s spunky, fresh, and perfect in warm weather.</p>\n    <p>A genuinely delicious beer. I like the <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16782425\">Upside Dawn Golden</a> and <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16782439\">Free Wave Hazy IPA</a>. </p>\n    <p>I recently tried a sampler pack of these Minneapolis NA craft beers and would highly recommend it for hosting a party. There is something for everyone!</p>\n    <p>This is a solid light and fresh beer that is sold pretty much everywhere these days. It’s great with food and on a hot summer day.</p>\n    <p>I drink these when I crave sparkling water; they’re so good! I’m not big on sweet drinks, so this earthy, fizzy drink is a real thirst quencher. It also feels special, which is really what I’m looking for when I want a drink. Something that feels like a treat, a little break in the day-to-day.</p>\n    <p>This is the drink I mix up for friends and family who aren’t into beer. It’s also what I make for myself when I want a drink after a long day and an NA beer just isn’t calling to me. I usually have all the ingredients on hand. Simply fill a glass with ice and soda water, add a dash or two of bitters, and squeeze in fresh lime juice to taste.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

    "body": "<p>I’ve shared my desire to <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/11/gift-giving-ideas/\">be a better gift giver</a> over the years, and let me tell you, it’s an ongoing process. Mother’s Day is on Sunday, May 11, and I’ve found that 90% of being a better gift giver is planning well ahead of time. So today I’m reminding you to get those gifts squared away, and offering my personal favorite Mother’s Day gift ideas (including a few that don’t cost a thing).<br/>If you want to get extra personal, ask mom for her own wish list—or ask her best friend to spill the details on what products she’s been talking about lately. You can never go wrong with a personalized gift picked just for her.</p>\n<p>I have a note from Bennett’s preschool teacher I’ve been meaning to frame for five years now! Framing can feel like a chore because of all the decisions that have to be made, from selecting what to frame to figuring out the best way to display it.<br/>Framebridge is my favorite place for creative inspiration, and they can frame just about anything. One way to hit it out of the park with any mom is to frame a memento she’s saved and cherishes but hasn’t done anything with yet.</p>\n<p>I don’t know one mother who isn’t thinking about environmental health these days. Give the gift of safe cookware, especially if mom has a particular pot or pan she’s been wanting to replace. It’s an upgrade she’ll appreciate.</p>\n<p>Putting a Lunya silk sleep mask on signals “off duty” mode. I have one of these masks, and I immediately exhale once it hits my eyes. It’s a hit with Joe too—we often have to trade off who gets to wear it at night.</p>\n<p>Book a sitter (or be the sitter yourself) and block off a day on her calendar to do whatever she wants, wherever she wants. Feel like a hero.</p>\n<p>As my kids get older, I associate their uniqueness with what lights them up. A bracelet with icons and symbols that represent the whole family would be a really special way to celebrate the family you’ve created together. Etsy has a ton of create-your-own options.</p>\n<p>These are such great, high-quality tees—the perfect basic clothing item. They’re structured enough to hold their shape over time but still feel perfectly relaxed. If the mom you are buying for is practical and discerning, Kule will be a hit.</p>\n<p>When I was at Esalen last month, I tried an amazing body oil I can’t stop thinking about. I would rarely treat myself to it, but it would make such a luxurious gift.</p>\n<p>I love the idea of a creative gift that kids and dad can make together. One idea: Have each kid make a portrait of mom to display when she wakes up. Another: Write little messages to mom on colorful paper, roll them into little scrolls, and place them in <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16243285\">a hand-painted wooden chest</a>. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16243974\">Indoor plants</a> are a great gift for anyone who loves to exercise their green thumb. If she loves to garden, get her <a href=\"https://www.greatgardenplants.com/collections/perennials?\">a perennial plant</a>. Even better, make it a ritual that grows over time, each year adding something new to the garden. Don’t be shy in asking her what plants she loves the most. </p>\n<p>Removing some of her mental load is an amazing gift to give mom. I have the Hearth Display—it’s an incredible way to keep track of everything our family has going on, all in one place. If you get a gift like this, be sure to own the initial set-up process too, so it’s not one more thing that has to be on mom’s plate!</p>\n<p>Any luxurious upgrade to an everyday staple will be a winner. Cashmere socks are the ultimate little luxury. You can find a wide range of pricing, from <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16139221\">Comme Si</a> (with amazing colors) to <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16139632\">J.Crew</a>, which has pretty good sale prices on their cashmere-blend socks. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/04/best-mothers-day-gift-ideas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>By  MB Valente</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>I leave you this message the only way I can, given my capacities and language so different from yours. We’ve known each other all of my life, which has been long for me, but short for you, so that sometimes I am sure you see me as a child—your child. But your child was born hungry, unpardonably carnivorous, already dreaming of blood as I drank my mother’s milk and you stroked her head, calling her sweet names. She was your daughter, too.</p>\n<p>So many misunderstandings have accumulated over our months together. How can I be sure this letter will mean anything to you? I started subtly, writing in the language of scents, rubbing my goodbyes into the furniture with chin, cheek, and hips, until I remembered how poor is your reading of smell. And so I turned my whole body into a letter and took to lingering in places suggestive of departure—stairways, scuffed thresholds of doors. Did the silk of my belly, spread over the doormat, communicate anything to you, besides a desire to touch?</p>\n<p>I had hoped not to resort to organs, to the signs your ancients read in offal. But having tried every means less distasteful to you, I find myself forced to write with the ringing clarity of fresh violence. (Remember, I was born with the taste of blood in my mouth.) So I arrange tiny hearts and intestines, birds’ livers and the butterflied lungs of mice, all to compose this message, which I still cannot be sure you will read. I feel generous for having tried, at least, since you never once tried to understand me. You prefer to clutch me close, bind me to your breast, and squeeze self-indulgent tears from your eyes. What you need is a pillow—a dumb, animal comforter—and so you see me as all fur, all exterior, no center.</p>\n<p>You’ve never felt the fragile flame of a life snuffed out between your teeth, and so you refuse to see life as something fragile. When you were younger, you used to tug on life’s thread to see if it would unravel—it’s written in white hatching down your forearms. The thing you almost touched then terrifies you now. So you swallow your fear, you fold it closed. You go to work, you eat your bloodless mush, you spend two nights a week with a man who doesn’t know you. You curl yourself around your phone and type things like “Sure” and “Ok see you.” His replies are ten lines long and bristle with question marks. You absorb their meaning without reading the words. He wants more. He needs to know you better. You write, “Sure.” I could tell him not to bother, if he would only read me.</p>\n<p>Then came the day he rang your doorbell without warning. He had things to say, grievances to air. You are selfish. You bring him down. Instead of shedding warmth, you leave him cold. You think you know what he means by this, but I am not convinced that you grasp it any better than you do the semantic subtleties in an arrangement of rabbit entrails. His main point got through, at least. I read it, too—in the smell of singed pride on his jacket, the abandoned-suckling reek of his breath. And you, you nodded and said you understood. You watched him walk away; you shut the door behind him, when you should have clawed his eyes out, kicked his stomach until it opened. You could at least have scratched. I tried to tell you that, remember? I was by the table leg with my back worked into blades, sinking my claws into the wood.</p>\n<p>Ever since, you’ve been something uglier than human, softer than flesh. You go to work, you come home, you live swaddled in sweaters, you disappear into the wool. Your hands reach for threads to tug but can’t find them. You, who are full-grown and healthy with no offspring to nurse—none but me, cursed and yellow-eyed—you could be rampaging free, tearing what you need from the world. Instead,you go to work, you come home, you close your eyes until the feelings go away.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://flashfictionmagazine.com/blog/2025/08/28/a-farewell-letter-translated-from-the-felinese/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>If Richard was going to commit suicide—and this time, he really was—he wasn’t about to make some elaborate production of it. He refused to leave behind a situation which needed cleaning up. That meant not hanging himself, not slitting his wrists, and definitely not shooting himself. Sleeping pills were the obvious choice, but Richard’s brother had died of an overdose, and he just couldn’t bring himself to go in a related fashion.</p>\n<p>Which was why, today, he’d decided on carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>\n<p>It’ll be painless, he told himself, flicking the light switch in the garage. Like falling asleep. He got into his ancient Nissan and turned the key for what he planned to be the last time. He hadn’t bothered to write a note; there was nobody to address it to. Breathing his vehicle’s exhaust, he took in his final surroundings. A dim, cluttered room. Stuff in boxes. Stuff in bags. Two fold-up chairs, a lawnmower, a spattering of camping gear, a neglected set of weights. The detritus of a life that filled Richard with dread each time he remembered having lived it.</p>\n<p>He smiled to himself. (Who else would he be smiling for?) How unspectacular, to go out like this. Alone, in an old car he’d never liked, encircled by crap. How fitting. How perfectly Richard.</p>\n<p>The tang of gas riled his nerves. It occurred to him: what if this didn’t work? What if he only succeeded in becoming mush for someone to take care of?</p>\n<p>Detecting a headache—a sign the fumes were working—he turned on the radio. He was encouraged to find himself hallucinating when the radio referred to him by name.</p>\n<p>“Hello? Richard?” An elderly woman’s voice crackled through the car’s antiquated sound-system. “I’m looking for Richard.”</p>\n<p>“This is him,” Richard answered out of habit, immediately feeling ridiculous about it.</p>\n<p>“I have bad news, Richard. You can’t die today.”</p>\n<p>Choosing not to engage with the sputters of his dying brain, Richard didn’t reply.</p>\n<p>“You’re straying from the authorized flow of events,” said the scratchy voice. “Normally I’d allow a deviation, but with the holidays…” A sigh through the speakers; a gust of static. “Richard, we’re simply overcrowded. You think the population crisis is bad on this material plane, where people only exist for the blink of an eye? Imagine eternity. So I’m sorry, I can’t make any exceptions—you’ll have to wait until your time, young man.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not young.”</p>\n<p>“You’re alive. That’s young.”</p>\n<p>Richard shifted in the driver’s seat, unable to get comfortable. A numbness spread through him—a hollow feeling, like hunger cramps. He couldn’t piece together the logic behind what his car was telling him, but he supposed he shouldn’t expect a talking car to make sense. All a dream, anyway.</p>\n<p>Falling asleep, painless…</p>\n<p>“This isn’t a dream,” said the car radio, the old woman, the hallucination. “Snap out of it, sad guy.”</p>\n<p>“Who are you, the grim reaper?”</p>\n<p>“That’s one thing people call me. Listen, you’ll wake up from this. You just have to decide whether massive brain damage sounds appealing.”</p>\n<p>“Because I’m not meant to kill myself?”</p>\n<p>“Very few people are meant to kill themselves. And wouldn’t you know it, the few who are meant to, those are the ones who never get around to it. Anyway, you’re not one of those few.”</p>\n<p>“Go away, Death.” He considered his words, and quickly added, “Just take me with you.”</p>\n<p>“What if I said you had a child you didn’t know about?”</p>\n<p>“I’d say you’re lying.” During those rare periods in Richard’s life when he’d been sexually active, he’d also been obsessively careful. “It’s no use. I don’t care anymore. I just don’t care.”</p>\n<p>“If that were true, you wouldn’t mind making a mess on your way out. You’d just shoot yourself and be done with it, Dick. Is it fine if I call you Dick?”</p>\n<p>Richard sensed, far away, a note of anger inside him. “If you stop me, I’m just going to try again. If not today, tomorrow.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/dick-tries-to-die-jake-stein/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>When I was nine, my dad warned me about the dangers of dreaming.</p>\n<p>“You know, it’s like if you drink too much water, it shuts down the electrical connections and you just keel on over,” he’d said in his woodchip voice as we sat at the kitchen table.</p>\n<p>“Your body forgets how to breathe. Same with dreaming—you get too high in them dreams, there ain’t enough oxygen.”</p>\n<p>I had made the mistake of telling him I wanted to be an explorer that day, after Mrs. Hastings showed us a National Geographic article about the Galapagos Islands. I was too young to know about brain synapses and what electricity had to do with any of it so I’d just nodded. My father had cupped my cheeks in his dry, cracked hands, and left to tend the chickens.</p>\n<p>I didn’t blame him. He’d wanted to be a mechanic as a young boy. But his mom got sick, bills came due, and his dreams lost the oxygen needed to keep on. Perhaps the electricity too.</p>\n<p>Maybe that was why he’d never been able to see the valley of dreams.</p>\n<p>I lay in that valley now, amused by the flowing and frolicking nature of these benign aberrations.</p>\n<p>I’d known it forever, this expanse of long, swaying grass, sprawling for miles until being taken in by the Catskills. It was a sight to behold—nature as it was designed, free from humans save for the touch of a barn and a withering fence in the distance.</p>\n<p>The barn was of course not a barn at all, but a home. It was where I had grown up, except for a short stint at Binghamton University. It was my parent’s farm, but its day to day operations were mine now.</p>\n<p>I could see the dreams drifting along the valley–gusts of green and squalls of scarlet scheming to take me away. If only for just a short while.</p>\n<p>It’s possible I’m crazy. I’ve considered this before.</p>\n<p>I did bring an old girlfriend once—had her sit under the gnarled weeping beech tree with me. But Madeline did not see the colorful clouds that meandered around me with scenes of game-winning shots and yuletide festivities—she saw nothing but a normal field. A beautiful field she had assured me, but nothing strange.</p>\n<p>I had thought she might see her dreams, and I can never be sure she didn’t I suppose, but, like my father, her eyes didn’t seem to light up like you would imagine when witnessing your desires as figments and flashes floating in the air. If she did see anything, she never told me, and then we broke up, and she never told me anything after that.</p>\n<p>But unlike Madeline, I saw the dreams and the dreams seemed to see me.</p>\n<p>Now I was thirty-eight, still single, and I knew the rhythm of a day. It was Wednesday, which meant by sunrise I’d completed all farm tasks in need of my attention.</p>\n<p>Free for a spell, I’d come to the valley where dreams wandered.</p>\n<p>With the wind mellow and lazy, it allowed the dreams that drifted my way to linger, letting me settle into them before they moved on to wherever else they had to be.</p>\n<p>I saw a particularly large one drifting—a cloud the color of an ocean sunset. Pink and puffy, and gliding down a draft of air like a child on a waterslide. It slid along before engulfing me in its mist.</p>\n<p>This was a road-not-traveled dream. Well, they all were really. I witnessed a scene of myself and Ella Feldman, sitting on a couch, watching TV together. It looked vaguely like my parent’s house but with slight alterations—many horse statues abound and lace curtains. This was of course because when I had had a crush on Ella, back in third grade, she had a major obsession with horses. She probably still did, but I wouldn’t know because we had drifted apart freshman year of high school. She’d stuck around the area, but she was married now and had two children.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/where-dreams-wandered-andrew-m-jaromin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In New Zealand, there’s a candy assortment of gangs. Most often, they ride on motorcycles, deal in narcotics, prostitution, illegal guns and fear. Recruitment’s booming as New Zealand’s underpaid police scarper to Australia, and dysfunctional kids clamber up the criminal career ladder.</p>\n<p>As a court bailiff, John Brady thought he’d seen them all: Mongrel Mob, Head Hunters, Tribesmen, Killer Beez, Black Power, you name it. But these days there was a new gang hitting the courts with increasing regularity: Grey Power.</p>\n<p>Today, he was in charge of Edith Smith, aged eighty-five. She was on so much medication it was hard to keep track of; pills for rheumatoid arthritis, underactive thyroid, high blood pressure, fluid retention, probiotics, magnesium (“keeps your stools soft”), and so much more. It takes her an age to swallow them all. She has to use a walker to get into court and John helps her to the dock.</p>\n<p>“You’re a good boy, John,” she says, looking at him with rheumy eyes. She reminds John of his grandma. Yet this little ol’ lady is apparently in charge of the most notorious gang in the country.</p>\n<p>“You’ll be right, Edith,” he says and gives her a small smile.</p>\n<p>“All rise for His Honourable Judge Adams.”</p>\n<p>“Edith, you’re meant to stand,” whispers John.</p>\n<p>“Stand? I’ve only just sat down. Bugger that.”</p>\n<p>“Court is in session, Crown versus Edith Smith.”</p>\n<p>It’s a first appearance, and Edith is facing a raft of charges. The prosecution alleges that Edith is the mastermind behind some of the most infamous crimes reported in New Zealand. The “headless chicken” where a known paedophile was mangled by a pensioner’s mobility scooter. The “rolled-over-Rowan”, a repeat rapist out on a technicality who met his demise under a pensioner’s Rolls Royce. And the “upsa-Daisy” where a woman who had scammed millions out of the elderly was found dead, floating upside down in a pensioner’s duck pond. In each case, the pensioners involved claimed, “It was an accident”, “I didn’t have my glasses on”, “My hearing aids weren’t plugged in” or “I’ve got dementia, dear” and all were let off the hook.</p>\n<p>Edith lets out a little chuckle as each one is mentioned. “OOhh, that was a good one,” she says at the upsa-Daisy. “I remember that one.”</p>\n<p>John sighs. This is not boding well.</p>\n<p>“Does the defendant have counsel?” asks the Judge.</p>\n<p>“Edith, he’s speaking to you,” whispers John.</p>\n<p>“What?! Speak up, young man.”</p>\n<p>The Judge shouts across the courtroom, “I SAID, DO YOU HAVE COUNSEL?”</p>\n<p>“No need to yell. I’m not deaf. You just need to enunciate your words better.”</p>\n<p>John had never seen Judge Adams do an eye roll before today.</p>\n<p>“Your Honour, we understand Ms Smith has declined counsel,” says the prosecution trying to be helpful.</p>\n<p>“Ms Smith, is that true?”</p>\n<p>“Well, if you’re talking about that pimple-faced boy, fresh out of law school, I thought I might do a better job myself.”</p>\n<p>“Ms Smith, these are serious charges you’re facing, and the prosecution has already indicated they’re opposed to bail. It’s in your best interests to have counsel represent you.”</p>\n<p>“As I’ve said all along, I’ve done nothing wrong. All I do is operate a Garden Club for like-minded pensioners. We like to do a bit of collective weeding.”</p>\n<p>“Your Honour, I must interject. A search of Ms Smith’s home produced copious evidence pointing to the Garden Club being a front for illegal activities where Ms Smith and her associates seem to have taken it upon themselves to mete out their own form of justice.”</p>\n<p>“Like I said, we do a spot of weeding.”</p>\n<p>“Ms Smith, I’m going to take a half-hour break. During that time I urge you to instruct counsel. Court’s adjourned.” The Judge slams down his gavel, a tad too enthusiastically.</p>\n<p>“A bit tetchy, isn’t he, John?” says Edith.</p>\n<p>“Edith, let me help you find a lawyer.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t you worry, pet. It’ll be all right. Anyone would think our Garden Club was doing something wrong with all the fuss.”</p>\n<p>John couldn’t believe what he was hearing.</p>\n<p>“Edith, it is wrong. You can’t…”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/grey-power-anne-wilkins/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>After our boss quit the senior executives replaced him with a coffee machine. They said that the consultant had delivered his report and that the replacement was appropriate and cost effective.</p>\n    <p>Each morning we gathered around the shiny appliance and said good morning. We even gave it a name which someone printed out from the label maker and pressed tenderly against the metal: “Sean.”</p>\n    <p>We poured in the beans lovingly and caressed the button and smiled as Sean internally alchemized them into the fragrant liquor that poured lusciously from the vents. Motivation improved. Team morale was at an all-time high.</p>\n    <p>Sean brought the team together in ways that we hadn’t experienced before. In those soft moments just before he ground the beans sometimes someone would be compelled to share something from deep within their private self.</p>\n    <p>“I don’t think I love my second child.” Said Linda, who usually only spoke about payroll.</p>\n    <p>“I think my erectile dysfunction is somehow linked to being jealous of my wife.” Said Brad, from IT, who usually never responded to people’s emails.</p>\n    <p>At the end of financial year staff evaluation survey we all gave Sean the highest appraisal. He was an irreplaceable part of the office – able to inspire us to the highest level of performance, help us realize our potential and foster consistent outputs.</p>\n    <p>We kept gathering around him every morning, collaborating and ideating freely.</p>\n    <p>Someone even worked out how to put little electronic inspirational messages on his display:</p>\n    <p>“Be the change you want to see in the office.”</p>\n    <p>“Your attitude is determined by your altitude.”</p>\n    <p>But after a while one of the executives grew suspicious of Sean and felt he was going outside his scope. The executive decided to put him back in his place and one sad morning we arrived to find Sean had been redeployed to the building manager’s office.</p>\n    <p>We were bereft and aimless for a time, until the boss told us a new addition would be arriving soon to bring the team culture back to an optimum level. He said he had recently read a book about how to foster collegiality for productivity and was keen to implement his learnings.</p>\n    <p>Then she arrived – shiny and new looking like a picture of perfection. She was a sparkling new toasted sandwich maker. Her name was Sharon.</p>\n    <p>As we pressed her lever down gently, the ripples of satisfaction were palpable through the team. Morale was having an uptick. Sitting around eating the toasted sandwiches, we all basked in the sensation of a hug from a mother that we never had.</p>\n    <p>We were sluggish with carbs, too contented to complain about anything, so after nodding to each other cordially we went methodically back to our tasks.</p>\n    <p><strong>Fiona Murray</strong> <i>is a writer and social worker living in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney.</i></p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/everydayfiction\">If you want to keep EDF around, Patreon is the answer.</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/irreplaceable-fiona-murray/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Jacob, a TV journalist for a regional station, was setting up the shot with Tommy, his cameraman, when Eris first approached him.</p>\n<p>“I saw what happened,” she said.</p>\n<p>“You saw the trampoline take off?” Jacob asked, giving her a quick look over as he did so, seeing if she was sufficiently telegenic for his report.</p>\n<p>“Yes, the whole thing. It was awful.”</p>\n<p>Jacob weighed her up. Local accent, but clear voice. Clean, well-dressed, nice features, not emotionally constipated. She would do.</p>\n<p>So Eris made her television debut in Jacob’s report from the scene of the fair, where unexpectedly high winds had whipped an unsecured trampoline and its four juvenile occupants momentarily aloft. No major injuries unfortunately, so not reaching the tragedy level that would make the national news and so boost his profile, but better than nothing.</p>\n<p>Two weeks later, arriving at the scene of a fire at a hospital two towns away, Jacob recognized Eris in the bystanders.</p>\n<p>“I had an appointment at the eye clinic,” she explained. “I’d just arrived when the fire broke out.”</p>\n<p>Remembering how well she’d come across in his previous report, Jacob decided to use her again. As before, she was a good witness, emotive and descriptive.</p>\n<p>Jacob thought little of this coincidence until three weeks later, when he attended the motorway pile-up. He’d arrived a bit late on the scene and was setting up a favorable angle with his cameraman when he saw one of the national broadcasters interviewing Eris.</p>\n<p>He listened in and heard her state, “Yes, I was driving along on the way to meet an old school chum when the tanker veered right across the road. I managed to brake in time but…”</p>\n<p>All through the rest of the summer, Jacob would arrive at every significant tragedy or accident, murder scene or disturbance and Eris would already be there. Even when he wasn’t working, he would see her being interviewed on his TV screen. She was never directly involved or affected, but always close enough to witness. It turned out she was even a neighbor of the “Sofa Strangler,” the serial killer who was caught that summer. “He seemed like a nice man,” she opined.</p>\n<p>Other journalists noticed her regular appearances on their screens. There was initially some suspicion that she was actively involved in these diverse tragedies, but a cursory glance at the facts showed the impossibility of this. It simply was all just a rather unlikely coincidence.</p>\n<p>Word got around locally however and it was the town’s Mayor who first approached Eris, gifting her tickets to a theatre performance at the other side of town while his inauguration was taking place in the Town Hall. It was an astute move, as it turned out, as a hostage crisis broke out at the theatre just as Eris arrived. She was subsequently interviewed about it on live TV.</p>\n<p>Local companies started approaching Eris with offers of free products if she would only stay away from their stores and offices. One less scrupulous businessman offered her money to attend the premises of his business rival and as Eris approached, the building was levelled by an engine that fell off a passing jet airplane.</p>\n<p>Despite these unique earning opportunities, fame wasn’t kind to Eris. She now had the reputation as a jinx and was consequently shunned by all and sundry. She was unwelcome at any of the local shops, while people actively crossed to the opposite side of the street when they saw her coming. Friends deserted her and even her family would only talk to her by phone.</p>\n<p>Jacob didn’t really believe that there was anything special about Eris. She didn’t have psychic powers, she wasn’t cursed. She was just unlucky, a statistical outlier, the victim of a series of coincidences, unlikely but not impossible. He knew though, that the public believed otherwise and ever alert to an opportunity to advance his career, he arranged to interview her in her home.</p>\n<p>Eris, isolated and alone, jumped at the chance to both see a familiar face and explain herself to the public, to let them see she was just a normal person.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/the-jinx-bill-cox/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

There's so much trauma. He flips around his laptop screen, showing me the bulleted list.</p>\n<p>\"Probably not,\" I say, \"but it gets you in the ballpark. Although you forgot amp volume.\"</p>\n<p>\"Is it essential?\" Parker asks.</p>\n<p>\"What do you think? Ma can't stand anything above three, which - you play guitar?\"</p>\n<p>He shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\"Well, three is a joke.\"</p>\n<p>He adds</p>\n<p><i>Amp volume</i>to the list.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"\">Who knew the future could be like this? Forget flying cars. This, now</a>\n    </p>\n<p><i>this</i>is the future: trading moms in. And, I mean, why not? Why not get a say in the matter? This is the United States, after all, not some backwater. Of course, there has to be a catch, a dumb \"age cutoff.\"</p>\n<p>\"Just my luck,\" I say. \"A thing like this comes along and I'm too old to take advantage. Story of my life.\"</p>\n<p>\"How old, exactly, are you?\" Parker asks.</p>\n<p>\"Thirty-two in February.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh.\"</p>\n<p>\"I know I don't look it,\" I say, sweeping back my shoulder-length jet-black hair so he can get a good look at me. \"What's the age cutoff?\"</p>\n<p>\"To tell you the truth,\" Parker says, waving me closer, looking around conspiratorially, and I bang my knee good scooting my chair in closer to his desk. \"I can bypass the cutoff, no problem.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, now we're getting somewhere,\" I say. \"That's more like it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Of course, it'll be extra.\"</p>\n<p>I pay him the \"extra\" in a coffee shop a block away. Then ask, \"Just for my own personal edification, what</p>\n<p><i>is</i>the age cutoff?\"</p>\n<p>\"Twelve.\"</p>\n<p>\"Jesus. And you don't think bypassing protocol won't raise a few eyebrows? Are people gonna be coming after me, Parker?\"</p>\n<p>\"No, the system thinks you're twelve.\"</p>\n<p>\"But I'm not.\"</p>\n<p>\"The system thinks you are. That's what matters.\"</p>\n<p>Even with a sweet deal like being able to trade your mom in, things take time. First, the system's got to get to know my mom in order to match me with a model. Parker says \"model\" is a non-demeaning term for what they are. \"But human, yes?\" I ask.</p>\n<p>\"Better,\" Parker says.</p>\n<p>\"There's better than human?\"</p>\n<p>He assures me there is, though I'm skeptical. But she wouldn't need to exactly set the world on fire to be better than the mom I've already got. So, I figure I'll roll the dice.</p>\n<p>The first phase of the thing, of the system getting to know my mom so it can replace her, is me wearing special glasses that record what she does, both audio and visual. I also have to wear a heartrate sensor which tracks my stress levels when I'm around her. This way the system, Parker told me over lattes, gets to know my particular \"mommy triggers.\"</p>\n<p>\"Your eyes bad or something?\" Ma asks me in the kitchen.</p>\n<p>\"No, I just wear 'em for the look of the thing,\" I say.</p>\n<p>\"A comedian. Stop following me like a puppy. I can make my own breakfast, Charlie.\"</p>\n<p>\"I know you can, Ma. I just like observing ya. I'm a student of the human condition.\"</p>\n<p>\"You want toast?\"</p>\n<p>\"I want white toast, golden brown. I want it firm but not burnt. And as far as eggs go, I don't go in for -\"</p>\n<p>\"Who are you talking to?\"</p>\n<p>\"You, Ma.\"</p>\n<p>\"Doesn't sound like it. You know we only have wheat toast. And I serve eggs one way.\"</p>\n<p>\"I know, Ma. You're nothing if not consistent. I'm just making a personal record of my likes and dislikes, for posterity's sake.\"</p>\n<p>\"Boy, if you don't like the way I do things, you can eat elsewhere. Live elsewhere, too.\"</p>\n<p>In the basement, we arrange the totems on the floor and sit cross-legged just outside the circle we've drawn in cigarette ash.
