You know that sweet spot where a trip feels polished and effortless but still outdoorsy and spontaneous? That was Bellevue. I expected “nice.” I didn’t expect to spend mornings zipping through new-growth trees, afternoons cruising past waterfront mansions on a whisper-quiet boat, and evenings hopping between skyline views and cozy neighborhood patios without ever feeling stressed or rushed. But that's exactly how our long weekend went down and why I think Bellevue is the most “have-it-all” city break in the Pacific Northwest right now. Why Bellevue Works (Even If You’re “Not A City Person”) Bellevue has major-city energy! World-class dining, slick hotels, and shiny shopping await, but it also lets you vanish into parks, lakes, and leafy trails in minutes. One second you’re grabbing a latte; the next you’re biking next to a blueberry farm or kayaking a quiet slough with turtles popping up next to your paddle. It’s clean, it’s easy, and summer here is perfect . We based ourselves at The Bellevue Collection , a trio of properties (Bellevue Square, Lincoln Square, and Bellevue Place) connected by skybridges. Let me translate… movie theaters, VR arenas, restaurants, and both of our hotels were a weather-proof stroll apart. No logistics math, no Ubers for short hops. Just wander. @traveloffpath The Bellevue Collection Is THE Place To Stay when visiting Bellevue! ♬ original sound – reeltemplates.pro Where We Stayed: W Bellevue vs. The Westin We split the stay to compare vibes, but never even had to cross a street thanks to the skybridge connections! We loved both stays, but if you're wondering which one you'd like more here is what we thought: W Bellevue — Young, buzzy energy with fun public spaces. We arrived early, dropped our bags, and literally went upstairs to catch a movie while the room finished—then walked back via skybridge to check in. If you like a stylish scene with a great bar…",

Residents reveal how policies and culture shape daily life and create a sense of calm. In 2025, peace can feel like a rare commodity. Global wars are escalating, border security is tightening, and trade tensions continue to mount. According to the 2025 Global Peace Index (GPI), the number of state-based conflicts has reached its highest level since World War Two, with three more breaking out this year alone. Many countries are responding with increased militarisation. Yet despite those grim statistics, some nations continue to prioritise peace. The GPI, produced by the Institute for Economics & Peace , tracks 23 indicators, from external conflicts and military expenditure to safety and security measures like terrorism and homicide. The countries ranked at the top of the index have been remarkably consistent for nearly two decades, showing the stability that peaceful policies can bring over the long haul. We spoke to residents in some of the world's most peaceful counties to learn about how those policies shape day-to-day life – and what gives them a unique sense of security and calm. Iceland Ranked number one since 2008, Iceland remains the world's most peaceful nation, leading across all three domains: safety and security, ongoing conflict and militarisation. It even recorded a 2% improvement this year, widening the gap from the second-place country on the list. For locals, that sense of safety is baked into everyday life. \"While harsh weather conditions, especially in winter, may not always…",

As I stepped aboard Mr Henderson's Railway in the Spanish city of Algeciras, the sun's rays pierced through the branches of juniper trees, and we chugged away from the glittering Bay of Gibraltar. The three-carriage retro British train soon trundled over the Guadiaro river, and cork forests framed the green-and-ochre patchwork fields as we wound our way north into the heart of Andalusia. Ride the train You can purchase tickets for Mr Henderson's Railway here. Three trains a day travel between Algeciras and Bobadilla. One-way tickets cost €18.70 and round-trip tickets cost €29.90. Two hundred years after the British invented the modern railway , this Victorian-era line, launched in 1892, still weaves its way between mainland Europe's southernmost rail station in Algeciras, through the stunning Serranía de Ronda region to its terminus in Bobadilla. During the three-hour journey the diesel-powered carriages slowly climb the single track to nearly 800m above sea level while journeying through 16 tunnels and across 20 bridges. The route offers passengers up-close views of rural Andalusian pueblos blancos (white hill towns) and undulating countryside, seamlessly reconnecting travellers with the golden age of train travel. Gibraltar's strategic location at the western entrance of the Mediterranean has long lured overseas powers, including the British. After Spain ceded \" The Rock \" to Britain in 1713, the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 increased the headland's strategic importance. But in…",

Now, almost 100 years after its grand opening, the Beaux-Arts giant has been reborn as a five-star hotel – and could soon welcome international trains again. Monstrous in scale yet elegant in design, Canfranc International Station's 200m-long, Beaux-Arts facade seems curiously out of place in a mountain village of just 500 residents. But this behemoth tucked high in the Spanish Pyrenees isn't merely incongruous; it's often called Europe's unluckiest train station. When it opened to great fanfare in 1928, the lavish new transit hub was meant to shuttle hundreds of thousands of passengers between Canfranc and the French city of Pau. But almost from the start, misfortune struck. A fire gutted the building just three years later; the Great Depression slowed repairs; then the Spanish Civil War ground services to a halt. During World War Two, Canfranc became a hotbed of intrigue where Jewish refugees, escaped POWs and downed Allied airmen were smuggled across the border from Nazi-occupied France under the noses of German soldiers and Gestapo agents stationed on the French-controlled side. In 1970, a disastrous train derailment destroyed a key bridge on the French side, severing the line for good. The station was abandoned soon after. Almost a century after its opening, however, the \"Titanic of the Pyrenees\" – as it became known – is finally turning its bad luck around. In 2023, after years of renovation, the station reopened as a…",

Today, their legacy can be found in unique wooden tree carvings they left throughout the American West. Iñaki Arrieta Baro remembers the day he trekked through the sagebrush, desert and wooded trails of Northern Nevada with a Basque-American family to locate a very special ancestral heirloom. Tracing their grandfather's footsteps, the group followed GPS coordinates to a remote location on what is now a private ranch. Among a grove of aspens, they found what they were looking for: a tree engraved decades ago with their grandfather's name. \"We were standing in the same place where their grandfather stood,\" says Arrieta Baro, head librarian of the Jon Bilbao Basque Library at the University of Nevada, Reno. \"It was very emotional.\" Between the US Pacific coast and the state of Wyoming, stories from the region's 19th and 20th-Century Basque immigrant sheepherders unfold across the malleable bark of quaking aspen trees, turning rugged alpine forests into history books. From names and cartoon images to hometown homages and political messages etched in Euskara, E urope's oldest living language , these arborglyphs – tree carvings – offer a quiet glimpse into these often forgotten lives. \"The arborglyphs are a lens through which to understand the Basque immigrant community and sheepherding,\" says Arrieta Baro. Carefully placing a piece of tree trunk in front of me, he directs my attention to its inscription: \"Jesús María El Cano, 26-7.\" Getty Images Immigrant Basque sheepherders left arborglyphs throughout the American west (Credit: Haley…",

The Molina Family Latino Gallery at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, which has served as the home of the nascent Latino museum, will stay closed until April 2026.

There it was: an image of his 1999 illustration “4th of July from the south border.” Since 2022, Galindo’s work had been reproduced on a label about anti-immigrant prejudice as part of ¡Presente!

SAN MARINO, Calif. — Standing in the gallery of Betye Saar: Drifting Toward Twilight , you are bathed in oceanic, cobalt blue light. The buzz of neon lights drones in the background. It’s hard to say if the temperature has truly dropped, or if it’s psychosomatic, that the atmosphere has cooled your skin just by the power of suggestion. You’re floating in space, or suspended underwater — gravity works differently here. The phases of the moon are painted on the wall in a matte metallic silver, and a small poem by Saar is draped across the wall: “The moon keeps vigil as a lone canoe drifts into a sea of tranquility seeking serenity in the twilight.” In the middle of the room, a long canoe, 17 feet across, sits atop a bed of branches, bramble, and sheets of jagged wood. At either tip of the ship is a watchful eye guiding the raft in both directions. Two sentinels — antiques affixed with antlers — keep watch at each end. Saar has crafted a fantastical scene; you can envision the boat careening upriver, striding forth. The vessel is occupied by bird cages confining animal antlers and seated upon miniature chairs fit only for a toddler — or, perhaps, spirits who…",

Since 1973, Vincent van Gogh masterpieces including his beloved sunflowers, wistful wheatfields, and self-portraits have been housed in Amsterdam’s Van Gogh Museum. The institution was established via a historic 1962 agreement between the painter’s nephew and the Dutch government to ensure the long-term preservation of hundreds of paintings, drawings, and letters comprising van Gogh’s oeuvre. Now, the museum says that the collection’s future is uncertain, citing a dispute with the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (OCW) over the funding for costly maintenance repairs and sustainability efforts mandated by the state. In a legal complaint, the institution claims that the Dutch government is violating its decades-old agreement by refusing to provide sufficient subsidies to cover the cost of the three-year, €104 million (~$121 million) project. Under the Dutch Heritage Act, national museums, including the Van Gogh Museum, the Rijksmuseum, and the Kröller-Müller Museum, receive annual housing subsidies to help them maintain and preserve their collections. But the Van Gogh Museum says that this yearly government funding — currently €8,428,300 (~$9.8 million) — falls short of the more than €11 million (~$12.8 million) needed to help it finance much-needed renovations to its fire and security alarms, climate control system, and internal…",

Elizabeth Goodspeed spoke with a few designers, writing in It’s Nice That : Questions about client ethics are tricky enough when you know exactly who you’re working for. Things get even murkier when work is licensed, resold, or embedded with no direct link between creator and end user. For type designers, this is the norm. Once a font is released, it can surface almost anywhere, often without warning. Jesse Ragan, cofounder of XYZ Type, says custom projects feel relatively straightforward to assess ideologically: if he doesn’t believe in a client, he can simply turn down the work. Retail fonts are a different story. A typeface is made in isolation long before it’s used, and can be licensed…",

SANTA FE — In 1998, science fiction writer Ted Chiang published “Story of Your Life,” in which aliens come to Earth in “looking glasses,” mirrored spaceships that act as communication devices. The central character, linguist Dr. Louise Banks, is tasked with deciphering the aliens’ language. In turn, she begins to see time like they do — as simultaneous events — and ultimately glimpses her own future. A reference to “Story of Your Life” is tucked into the exhibition guidebook for Once Within a Time , SITE Santa Fe’s 12th International. Curator Cecilia Alemani identified Chiang as one of the exhibition’s 27 “figures of interest” — catalysts for the 71 participating artists and more than two dozen writers. What struck me about Alemani’s inclusion of Chiang’s writing was not the reference to extraterrestrial life (many readers will be familiar with the accounts of UFO sightings in New Mexico), but the surreal, endlessly fascinating phenomenon of the looking glass. Once Within a Time takes reflection as a major cue. Within each curated theme, such as “The Wheel of Telling” and “The Secret Life of Puppets,” are mirror images, doubles, reversals, and echoes, along with symmetries of place, histories, peoples, and legends —…",

LONDON — Edwards Burra was a chronically ill English painter, suffering from debilitating arthritis and asthma throughout much of his life. Hailing from the upper classes of southern England, with regularized, side-parted, tamped-down hair, he spent much of his life in headlong flight from his upbringing. Burra wanted to experience the shock of strangeness, to embrace the allure of the louche, the forbidden, the disapproved of. He sometimes left home for months at a time without even saying goodbye. Where has Edward gone? Nobody knew. Will he ever come back? Perhaps. First it was to Paris, and then to Spain, the United States, and Mexico. As you walk around his carefully curated, chronologically organized exhibition at Tate Britain of the best of a lifetime’s work, you can hear the drift of music in the air, the music Edward loved, the visceral excitement of jazz and how that excitement fed into the work of the Harlem years. You can even see a row of black vinyl discs along the wall. These were Edward’s records.

The kids are back in school, the long, hazy days of summer are in the rearview mirror, and there’s a new kind of energy in the air. It's that magical time of year when you start thinking about cozy sweaters, crisp autumn air, and that first glorious sip of a pumpkin spice latte. You're holding on to that hope of a perfect weekend fall getaway. Sure, you could book the obvious trip to New York City, but let's be real—you'll be fighting for a patch of grass in Central Park with a million other people. What if you could get all the amazing fall vibes without the crowds? Here at Travel Off Path , we believe the best autumn trips are the ones that fly under the radar. We've found 5 incredible, underrated U.S. cities that are perfect for a quick escape this season. 🍂 ⛰️ Chattanooga, Tennessee The Ultimate Outdoor Adventure Hub While everyone flocks to Nashville or the Smokies, Chattanooga is the smart choice for an active fall weekend. Tucked into the Tennessee River Valley, the city is surrounded by mountains that explode with color in late October. The vibe is laid-back, the hiking is epic, and the views are 10/10. You Have To: Take the incline railway up Lookout Mountain to visit Rock City and Ruby Falls. The panoramic view of seven states is a classic for a reason. For a more chill experience, walk across the vibrant blue Walnut Street Bridge and explore the cool local shops and cafes in the NorthShore district. 🍖 Kansas City, Missouri The Cool & Cultured Midwest Surprise Forget what you think you know about “flyover country.” Kansas City is having a major moment, and fall is the perfect time to visit. This city is a powerhouse of culture, with world-class jazz clubs, a surprisingly hip arts scene, and, of course, the best barbecue on the planet. You…",

Fall is arguably the best period to visit Cancun if you're hoping for smaller crowds and cheaper prices. After all, the July and August crowds are gone, hotels deliberately lower prices to attract more guests, and there are getaway deals galore… or are there? For years now, sun-seekers on a budget have waited impatiently for September to book their Cancun vacay, knowing they would get more bang for their buck, but as the experts have told us in 2025, this may no longer be the case. After all, ‘low' and ‘high' seasons are no longer existing concepts in the Caribbean hub. That's one of 4 things the Cancun Sun , the leading independent English-speaking authority on all things Mayan Riviera, has shared as we head into the (supposedly) quieter months: Cancun's ‘Low Season' Is a Thing of the Past If you're headed for Cancun this upcoming season, the main thing you should know is that those images of a deserted hotel strip, with a wide availability of first-come, first-served restaurants, and open slots on guided tours, may no longer be the case. As they have noted, ‘low season' now looks more like ‘less busy' . There are lower crowds than in winter, that's for sure, but if you're visiting on the weekend, you should expect a major influx of beach bums at public bathing areas, and partygoers to flock into the entertainment district. Long gone are the days you could just ‘chance it' and book stuff last-minute in the fall. Be it trendy restaurants, popular activities, like visiting cenotes or Mayan ruins, or spa appointments at your resort, you'd be wise to secure spots in advance. Who Will You Be Sharing the Resort With? The Cancun Sun also reiterates that, despite the continuous crowding, the type of crowd changes. After all, schools across the United States and Canada have resumed classes, so you can for sure expect to…",

Sorry, Nashville . Broadway lights are dimming this fall in favor of another Tennessee city. As leaves begin to shed and temps begin to drop, the astounding Smokies scenery, neon honky-tonks, and ‘smooooth Tennessee whiskey' are far from the only draw to the “Volunteer State”. Expected to be the state's trendiest fall destination , largely backed by lively festivals and stunning natural attractions, this city is also deeply rooted in intriguing Civil War history, locomotive heritage resulting in scenic train rides , and ample ways to explore the outdoors in the midst of autumn's luminous colors. Chattanooga may not have been on your Bingo card this year, but it's not too late to swap it out for wherever else you had planned. Don't pass up the opportunity to explore perhaps Tennessee's most underrated getaway that will no doubt be overflowing with fall splendor, quintessential Southern charm, and surprisingly luxe stays for a city that's still clinging on to “hidden gem” status. Whiskey River, Take Your Mind Alright, there's no actual “whiskey river” per se, but one can dream, right? But in a state steeped in grandpappy's medicine, it goes without saying Chattanooga can go toe-to-toe with the best bars for a night out. Bar-hopping, as fun as it may be, is nowhere near the only fun thing to do here, despite a buzzing downtown with a mix of college crowds and people like me hanging on to their last sliver of youth. One instantly noticeable enticement to the city is the winding Tennessee River, that is still a blast to visit during the fall. Hop aboard the Southern Belle , a popular riverboat cruise for sunset and general sightseeing tours. If it were me, this would be a priority night one, as it's easily accessible from the city center and a great way to get your bearings. Otherwise, wake up and start your day with a coffee in…",

In recent years, a slower, more scenic mode of travel has made a huge comeback. Of course, we’re talking about overnight sleeper trains . 🚂 While Europe is buzzing with new night train routes, you might be wondering how you can hop on this trend here in the U.S. Good news: Amtrak is not only running its classic long-distance routes, but it's also in the middle of a massive upgrade, pouring billions into new and refurbished train cars that are hitting the rails right now. Here at Travel Off Path , we believe there’s no better time than fall to try them out. Taking in the stunning U.S. foliage from the comfort of a private room is a bucket-list experience. Based on the latest schedules and what travelers are raving about, here are 5 of Amtrak’s best overnight sleeper train routes for this fall. 💺 Yes, Amtrak Still Runs Sleeper Trains (And They're Getting Better!) Let's clear this up: Amtrak operates multiple long-distance routes with dedicated sleeper cars, and they are actively getting a facelift. These new and updated cars mean better seats, updated interiors, and a more comfortable ride. All of these routes feature private rooms, from the cozy Roomette to the more spacious Bedroom . A Roomette gets you two comfortable seats that convert into beds, while a Bedroom offers more space and includes a private in-room sink, shower, and toilet. No matter which you choose, all sleeper car tickets include your meals in the dining car—a huge perk! to be immune to theme conflicts. - This is the most reliable architecture for your live website. --> Find Your Perfect Fall Train Trip Answer one quick question to get matched with the perfect scenic railway for your autumn adventure.

Mexico City. What do these have in common? Global fame often results in mostly unavoidable crowds, unless you venture into the locals' gatekeepers' secret hideaways. At Travel Off Path , we consider ourselves to be Mexico's #1 fans, forging through the often dramatized security concerns and putting them to bed. I alone have been to 19 different destinations across the country with nothing but rave experiences from the ‘dangerous' streets of Tijuana to the little-known shores of Mahahual. So, allow us to be your tour guide this fall by presenting you 5 underrated getaways to avoid jam-packed beaches, anti-tourism protests, and entitled retirees surrounding the swim-up bar. Salud! Aguascalientes 🍷 With direct flights from Dallas, Houston, and LA, reaching one of Mexico's best-kept secrets is easier than you might think. I just got back from Aguascalientes for the first time and quickly developed a crush from the moment I stepped foot in the timeless city center. Let the towering Catedral de Aguascalientes become your North Star for an unforgettable getaway, packed with sensational cuisine, European-esque streets brimming with sidewalk cafes, and perhaps North America's most overlooked countryside vineyards, such as Vinocola Santossca — it's worth the trek! For budget travelers, you'll be hard-pressed to find anywhere cheaper. We're talking $2 museums , $3 lattes, and Uber rides under $5 across the city. And with a name like Aguascalientes, you know you gotta visit the hot springs. Baños Termales de Ojocaliente is a great place to unwind in a vintage bathhouse for under $20. Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo 🏝️ If you're craving Mexico's paradise shores (and who wouldn't?), you likely by default have searched and searched to craft a perfect vacation in Cancun, Cabo, or maybe Puerto Vallarta. I've been guilty of that too, but I also have so many Mexican trips under my belt I have. a leg up on following the crowds, which is why my most recent beach trip South of…",

Listen, there's no denying Rome is the most iconic destination in Italy, if not Europe as a whole: it's home to world-renowned landmarks like the Colosseum, the Trevi Fountain, and it even plays host to the Vatican City, so you can't be exactly mad at tourists for flocking there in the first place. Be that as it may, we can't be the only ones who feel the novelty of Rome has far worn off. It has been on the radar of travelers for at least two millennia, and things are only intensifying in the age of social media. We're called Travel Off Path for a reason, though, and as you might have guessed at this point, it's the lesser-known gems that truly pique our interest—and you know, if you happened to be looking for an underrated Italian destination yet to be spoiled by the masses, you've come to the right place : The Italian Capital Of Culture For 2026 Is… Every year, the Italian Ministry of Culture picks out a new ‘Capital of Culture'. In other words, a city that has contributed significantly to the country's cultural tapestry, and that's not necessarily Rome, Florence, or Venice. We've had Pesaro in 2024, Agrigento ( a hidden gem of Sicily ) in 2025, and for 2026, the crown goes to L'Aquila , the much-overlooked capital of Abruzzo, a small Italian region east of Rome, straddling the Adriatic Sea. However, if you're expecting turquoise seas, postcard-ready pebbly beaches, and vibrant beach bars, you might be in for a bit of a surprise. L'Aquila isn't coastal: in fact, it bestrides a hillside in the middle of the Apennine Mountains. With only around 70,000 residents, it's far smaller, more compact than the sprawling cities of Milan or Naples , and unlike these other metropolitan examples, it's not exactly outgrown its original, largely medieval townscape: A Medieval City Surrounded By…",

Mexico City's status as one of the world's top culinary capitals is often credited to the creative tasting menus and celebrity chef collaborations found in its upscale Roma Norte neighbourhood. But the flavours served on those affluent, tree-lined streets often begin their journey to the plate at dawn – in a sprawling, chaotic market in one of the city's poorest boroughs. Located in Iztapalapa, Central de Abasto is the largest wholesale market in the world, covering 3.27 sq km – roughly the size of New York City's Central Park – and supplying 80% of the capital's produce. Between 04:00 and 08:00, the sprawl feels like a scene from Blade Runner, with buyers elbowing their way through narrow paths to haggle at thousands of warehouses and slapdash produce stalls. Diableros (hand-truck porters) sprint through the maze of crowds and beeping trucks, careful not to bump into colleagues balancing wooden crates on their heads. Whenever I hear a trilling whistle, I jump aside to let a \"little devil\" race past with a comically overloaded bundle. Central de Abasto opened in 1982 to replace La Merced, CDMX's colonial-era trading centre. Every day, it welcomes half a million visitors and handles more than 30,000 tons of produce from across Mexico. The ramshackle vibe is characteristic of Iztapalapa, historically derided as a \"trash district\" for its landfills and…",

For many Americans, Labor Day marks the unofficial end of summer; a long weekend for parades, barbecues and one last getaway before the school year begins. According to the American Automobile Association (AAA), the Transportation Security Administration expects 17.4 million people to travel between 28 August and 3 September, up from 17.2 million last year. Data from travel sites including AAA , Dollar Flight Club and Kayak show that domestic travel is up significantly, likely due to the fact that domestic flights are the cheapest they've been in five years. \"This Labor Day we're seeing one of the biggest splits in pricing we've ever tracked,\" says Jesse Neugarten, founder and CEO of Dollar Flight Club. \"Domestic flights are about 5% lower than last year and nearly 20% lower than 2019. On the flip side, international fares are still sky-high.\" According to Neugarten, international fares are two to three times higher on average, while domestic Labor Day fares are currently at a five-year low, with New York, Seattle and Boston being some of the most affordable US destinations overall.

The ferry ride from the Giens Peninsula takes just about 15 minutes, but when my feet touch the vehicle-free streets of Porquerolles, the French Riviera's glittering mainland already feels worlds away. Porquerolles is one of the three Hyères Islands (Îles d'Hyères), an archipelago stretching eastward from Giens like an ellipsis in the Mediterranean Sea. While the French Rivera lures visitors with its glamorous resorts and timeless elegance, it's often overrun by traffic and showy crowds. These islands, covered in pine forests and blissfully car-free, offer an unassuming alternative to the glitz of Cannes and Saint-Tropez. Stepping off the ferry, the cacophony of cicadas floods my ears. I'm well-accustomed to this soundtrack of southern France, but I've never heard them at such a pitch – here, no motors cut their hum. The harbour is fringed with pines, palm trees and sunset-coloured houses. Cyclists whirl by, dismounting to stroll down the main thoroughfare, where everyone seems to have an ice cream in hand. Having sat in traffic for hours to enter Saint-Tropez and shoulder-bumped strangers along the crowded lanes of Èze, I've yearned to find an unspoilt corner of the French Rivera – one with thyme-scented breezes and luminous beaches. The Hyères Islands just might be it. Getty Images Porquerolles Island, just 7km across the sea from the French Riviera, is a cyclists' paradise (Credit: Getty…",

It's happened to us all. You go in to work on a Monday morning to find your colleagues gleefully discussing their plans for the upcoming long weekend – the long weekend you completely forgot was coming up. You're desperately in need of a break, but it seems too late to make plans now…. or is it? No need to settle for another weekend in your pyjamas watching The White Lotus for the seventh time. While planning ahead – ideally two weeks or more – is best in terms of both cost and availability, it's still possible to organise a reasonably priced holiday with less than a week's notice. Here are some expert tips on how to do it. Flexibility is key Flights are usually the hardest (and priciest) aspect of a super last-minute trip. \"Airlines tend to increase fares as the flight approaches,\" said Rachel Mumford, UK travel expert at KAYAK . \"So, while booking flights as early as possible is typically the best way to secure deals, that's not always possible.\" Mumford and other experts stressed that flexibility is the key to overcoming this hurdle. \"For travellers booking within the week, flexibility is your superpower,\" Jesse Neugarten, founder and CEO of Dollar Flight Club , told the…",

When Norma Listman and Saqib Keval, owners and chefs at one of Mexico City's most popular restaurants, Masala y Maiz, won their first Michelin star, they were in New York City at a party for a fellow chef. \"Our team was calling us, and we weren't answering the phone,\" explains Listman with a laugh. \"And then the nerdiest of our managers, the most serious one calls, and I was like, he never calls unless something is wrong. Turns out that we were live on the stage [at the Michelin awards].\" The couple, known for establishing the restaurant's groundbreaking \"Eat What You Want, Pay What You Can\" initiative, is much more passionate about supporting community than prestigious accolades. Spending time celebrating a fellow chef they admire instead of attending an awards ceremony in honour of themselves is much more in Listman and Keval's wheelhouse.

Here are what he deems the best wings in town. Born and raised in the city of Buffalo, New York, Drew Cerza is a passionate ambassador for his hometown's eponymous dish: the Buffalo wing. The SpeciaList Drew Cerza, Buffalo, NY's \"Wing King\", is the founder of the National Buffalo Wing Festival , and co-creator of the Buffalo Wing Trail ; a self-guided tour through 14 storied wing joints. A tireless ambassador for Buffalo wings, he has been featured on Food Network and the Travel Channel. Whether he's judging competitions, promoting local eateries or handing out hot wings in a chicken suit, Cerza has one mission: to give wings the global spotlight they deserve. (Credit: Jalen Wright) \"Fiery, crisp and delicious, the Buffalo wing is an American culinary icon,\" says Cerza, better known as the \" Wing King \". \"It's more than bar food; it's the centrepiece of festivals, Super Bowl parties and food challenges, showcasing our love of bold flavour and communal eating.\" Buffalo wings – chicken (not buffalo) wings doused in a mixture of Frank's Red Hot sauce and melted butter – were created serendipitously at the city's Anchor Bar in the 1960s, where the tangy, spicy combination, served with celery sticks and blue cheese dressing, was an instant hit. \"In time, the bar's late-night improvisation became a game-day staple – and a global phenomenon,\" says Cerza. While spicy chicken wings…",

In 2019, Hugo Crosthwaite became the first Latino artist to win the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery’s (NPG) prestigious triennial Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition. The Tijuana-born and San Diego-based illustrator received the contest’s grand prize: $25,000 and a portrait commission for the museum’s permanent collection. He chose to depict Anthony Fauci, then the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), in a stop-motion format that captures the nuances of his complicated legacy, including his criticized and then celebrated oversight of the HIV/AIDs epidemic. Last week, Crosthwaite found his hard-won commission on a list of Smithsonian items that the White House found objectionable. He was one of at least three Mexican-born artists whose work was included on Trump’s art hit list , along with illustrator Rigoberto González and painter Felipe Galindo Gómez . “My first reaction was surprise,” Crosthwaite shared in an interview with Hyperallergic. “But then later on, [I] felt a bit of pride to be included in this list of other wonderful artists and wonderful projects that talk about the diversity of the United States’ history.” Hugo Crosthwaite was born in Tijuana and now lives in San Diego.

LONDON — Some of the Courtauld’s previous exhibitions have suffered from insufficient curation . Abstract Erotic: Louise Bourgeois, Alice Adams, Eva Hesse , on the other hand, strikes the exact right balance. Drawing on scholar Jo Applin’s research, curator Alexandra Gerstein has taken as a starting point the work of feminist curator and critic Lucy Lippard, who coined the titular term to describe this sensuous s trand of art emerging in 1960s New York. Making perhaps the best use yet of the Courtauld’s teeny exhibition spaces next to the permanent collection, this small but unstuffed show gives proper breathing space for artistic dialogue and, crucially, for the viewer to engage in exploring differences and similarities between works and practices for themselves. In 1966, Lippard curated the exhibition Eccentric Abstraction to capture a new wave of sculptures created from unusual, pliable materials like wire, plastic mesh, netting, and latex, which evoked tactile organic forms and, by extension, the human body. This is the Courtauld’s first show devoted to standalone sculpture, and the contrast between these blob-like forms and its Impressionist-heavy permanent collection may go some way to recreate just how different — even alarming — these…",

When the United States Department of Agriculture established the Farm Security Administration (FSA) in 1937, hoping to provide aid to rural communities affected by the Great Depression, it also implemented a photography project headed by government official Roy Stryker. The photographs were meant to generate support for the agency, allowing the public to witness the impacts of the Depression for themselves. Made by recruited photographers and then selected by Stryker for inclusion in traveling exhibitions and news outlets, the chosen images overwhelmingly depicted White families — a narrow and literally whitewashed view of rural America. Crafting Sanctuaries: Black Spaces of the Black Great Depression South , a new exhibition at the Museum of Art and Light in Manhattan, Kansas, showcases a broader view of FSA imagery, focusing on Black Southerners documented by photographers like Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Russell Lee, Marion Post Wolcott, Arthur Rothstein, Ben Shahn, and Jack Delano across six states: Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Florida, Mississippi, and Missouri. Presented in partnership with Art Bridges Foundation, the photos highlight the intimacy of life among one’s community — private quarters, public gathering spaces — and the care taken to build one together.

Joe Amrhein and Susan Swenson were going to sit out the Armory Show this fall for the first time in a quarter century until they got a call last month from the fair’s director. The owners of Pierogi Gallery in Brooklyn’s Williamsburg neighborhood initially did not apply this year due to the show’s rising booth costs, which can exceed tens of thousands of dollars. Pierogi is planning the next phase of its business, which could include relocating to Lower Manhattan . But Armory executives Kyla McMillan and J. Tyler Woodall appealed to Pierogi and the fair’s shared history — in 2016, Amrhein suggested the Armory use an empty space to display Jonathan Schipper’s installation of a Volkswagen Golf crashing into a wall; the presentation of large-scale art has since become a cornerstone of the show. They recently negotiated a smaller exhibition space for Pierogi with a lower rate, enabling the gallery to return. “We had been on the fence about it since the economy is very uncertain and it’s a big investment,” Swenson said. “We’re not one of the big box galleries. Some of them have their own economies now.” Get the latest art news, reviews and opinions from Hyperallergic. Daily…",

A round of layoffs at the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) this summer is raising alarms at one of the best-known arts schools in the country as the institution grapples with rising costs. The Santa Clarita-based private arts school laid off nine administrative employees in July, including five unionized workers and four non-union workers, claiming in a schoolwide message that CalArts needed to cut expenses in the face of a projected $15 million deficit . “The nine staff positions, as well as about a dozen vacant staff positions, are being eliminated as part of a necessary workforce reduction, which will enable CalArts to address a structural deficit, prioritize student-facing services, and better align our staffing with current and projected enrollments to continue providing exceptional educational opportunities to our students,” a CalArts spokesperson told Hyperallergic . But faculty and staff members are questioning the administration’s decision, arguing that the layoffs could harm the school’s ability to train and nurture the next generation of artists.
