Isaiah is the son of a judge, an amateur podcaster on the side, and his family has very high expectations. Neera’s grandparents run a failing motel, and her mother has made some questionable choices, so they are staying with the grandparents until they can figure out their next steps. Reid is the son of the most powerful guy in town, but his mother was looked down on by many—which means he, in turn, is in a strange position of being both rich and powerful as well as a powerless outcast, depending on the context. When Dawson goes missing, all four of them are pulled into a tangled plot which involves conspiracy and a long, dark history.<graphic src=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/When-Devils-Sing-194x300.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>From the beginning, the strength of this book is how it immerses you in characters who feel complex but grounded in real problems, with complicated connections to or relationships with each other. Another strength is the little details in the challenges the world presents, things that make navigating the world trying and precarious, but things that also feel true and relatable; such as managers and other kinds of gatekeepers who enjoy their little slice of power a bit too much and exert that power in ways that make living a little harder for the people who deal with them. Most of us won’t know what it’s like to have a judge for a father, but many of us will see ourselves somewhere in the iterations of relationships in these pages, as well as in the roadblocks that life, or people, throw in front of us. The author brilliantly marries the dramatic with the plausible, creating a readable, compelling, and relatable story, even as there is a “devil’s bargain” trope at play, and even as the lifestyles of the wealthy are involved.</p>\n<p>The protagonists aren’t perfect, which lends to the feeling of them being fleshed out characters; and again, the delicately drawn relationships, and the individual needs and stressors, provide not just relatability, but elicit sympathy during the read; making this a set of characters readers will want to follow. The power of this well-grounded storytelling gives Kaur room to do nearly anything. This means that a story about a devil’s bargain is far from campy or trite, but vibrant and infused with elements that feel important. Kaur improves on this another step by tweaking the speculative idea of a devil’s bargain a bit, making it more dynamic and interesting, while still being something many readers will find familiar enough to be quickly digestible. While I have seen many devil’s bargain narratives, I hadn’t seen this one. It was exciting to discover what the author has in store. Even while the characters urged me forward through the read, their individual and overlapping narratives are a powerful draw to find out what kinds of problems are coming up and what might happen to them.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, of course, there is a group of wealthy folks who have a few sinister secrets. In fact, early on, you get the feeling that to one degree or another, parts of the town may be complicit, such as the police; and that not just Dawson, but a string of people, may end up in terrible situations at the hands of the wealthy. In real life, time and time again, we hear of wealthy people or big organizations gaining at the expense of others, so I think the presence of sinister wealthy folks doing bad things is an evergreen trope: it’s something which will always appeal to many readers. Kaur’s wealthy folks are distinctive enough to work quite well, and this serves as another familiar story element rendered intriguing.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/book-review-when-devils-sing-by-xan-kaur/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I was immediately drawn into the world of “A Dish Best Served Cold” with your depiction of Éshu, the trickster god of the Yoruba religion. What inspired you to write about this figure? Did you grow up hearing stories of the òrìshà, or did you discover them later in life?</p>\n<p>In Nigeria, the traditional religions have actually been demonized and neglected by the majority. They have been reduced to myths and the gods have been labelled as evil spirits or demons. This was due to slave trade and colonialism, of course. Today, most Yorubas are either Muslim or Christian. I grew up in a Christian home and there was something that always seemed strange to me. In the Yoruba translation of the Holy Bible, the devil is sometimes called Satani which is just an adjustment of the English word Satan. However, where the English version uses the word “devil” then the Yoruba translation is Éshu. Apparently, the translators saw some correlation between the devil’s love for trickery and just picked the trickster god to represent him. As I grew and did more research, I saw just how multifaceted this being was. He was more than a trickster or an intermediary. A very complex character that has been given a wrong image by a different religion. I had no grand illusions about changing the narrative surrounding him, but I wanted to do what I could. In recent years, there have been more and more stories centered around Yoruba mythology. Some of them go deep into the lore while others barely scratch the surface, but I noticed that there was little focus on Éshu. If mentioned, it was done in passing. One of the authors who did differently was Wole Talabi in his book, <i>Shigidi and The Brass Head of Obalufon</i>.</p>\n<p>Since there was little representation for him, I thought to myself . . . why not write the stories I want to read? So that is what I did.</p>\n<p>Éshu’s role is associated with both unpredictability and stability, a dynamic which shows up again in Ọbalúayé, the god of disease and healing. Do the ideas of balance and duality show up elsewhere in your work or in traditional Yoruba stories?</p>\n<p>It shows up in both, actually. In my stories, I always try to show every character and situation from different angles. Balance is very important to me. I think the concept of someone like the disease god also healing his followers gives his character more depth and I just really enjoy writing that kind of thing. In Yoruba stories, which are mostly passed down by mouth, there is always a moral at the end and it often stems from the actions of the characters. One of the most popular characters in Yoruba folktales, Ijapa Tiroko the tortoise, is often reported to be very shrewd but sometimes he is impulsive or gets blinded by arrogance. It is part of what makes him and my characters more interesting, I think.</p>\n<p>This story is an excerpt from a larger project titled “The Cookbook of the Gods.” Can you tell us anything about the work as a whole or how this story fits within its themes or structure?</p>\n<p>The Cookbook of the Gods started as an idea for a world where I’d just write about fun adventures the gods went on while somehow linking it with food in some manner. Over time, it evolved into a project focused on the misadventures of one person—the writer of the book himself. Following up on my desire to shed light on his identity, I started building the world around him instead. I don’t really plot much, so the stories in this series constantly surprise me. I generally have an idea of where I want Éshu to go but how he gets there is up to him.</p>\n<p>I found the idea of a recipe for immortality soup to be really intriguing. Does your writing often include food, recipes, or rituals as a part of the narrative?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/author-spotlight-oluwatomiwa-ajeigbe-4/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Chapter Two Hundred and Fifty-Six<br/>\nA Dish Best Served Cold</p>\n<p>The first thing you have to know is that I did not kill the gods.</p>\n<p>Now, I’m sure you must have heard differently from your parents when they tell you bedtime stories, your priests who tell you their selfish desires rather than the will of the gods, or from your teachers who pretend to know what they’re talking about but are just as clueless as the rest of you.</p>\n<p>Every single human in your world knows the tale of Éshu, the rogue god who stormed into the palace of the gods one evening and murdered them all with dark magic. The stories differ, of course, but they all have common aspects. And every version of this story paints me as the villain. They are not right, of course.</p>\n<p>I could give you details about that day that the history books simply do not possess: the marble on the floor of the great hall was black as night, the gods were seated on ornate thrones carved from the living wood of the sacred iroko tree, a gentle breeze was blowing through the large windows and somewhere just out of sight, a spirit child was playing a haunting tune on a flute. I could tell you that the hall of the gods was guarded by a squad of heavily armored and armed inoki, fearsome giants created by the tinkerer god, Ọbàtálá. They loomed over the gods themselves and looked so fierce that nobody in their right mind would even think of fighting one, let alone an entire squadron.</p>\n<p>But, you see, I wasn’t in my right mind.</p>\n<p>The gods were celebrating some festival that you humans hold to praise them every year. It was one of the only times all the major òrìshà gathered in one place at the same time. I should have been there, of course. Though the holy books do not explicitly say so, I was once one of the major òrìshà, revered in my right as god of fate, trickery, and pathways. However, I was cast out of the pantheon a long time ago, when I tried to kill Ṣàngó and take his crown.</p>\n<p>I know, I know. Doesn’t sound like what an innocent person would do. I agree with you.</p>\n<p>I have not always been a perfect being. Actually, most of the gods were greatly flawed. It was an inherent part of us, a factor as important as our godhood itself.</p>\n<p>But I digress.</p>\n<p>I started this tale by claiming that everything you know is wrong and that I did not wipe out the strongest beings in the universe. Please, read my words with an open mind because for the first time in my long treacherous life, I am telling the truth.</p>\n<p>Now, let’s begin.</p>\n<p>• • • •</p>\n<p>I was not invited to the feast, of course. My sentence was still in effect. Ṣàngó, the king of the gods, had sentenced me to ten thousand years in exile, and only a few hundred years had passed.</p>\n<p>I wasn’t too bothered by my sentence. I had never liked the city of the gods, anyway. I preferred to roam the world of men, getting into mischief and stirring up trouble wherever I could.</p>\n<p>I took on a simple and forgettable guise. Like the people who roamed the earth and like the gods who made them, I was dark skinned. I made myself a man, even though I have been other genders in the past.</p>\n<p>Above all, I made myself forgettable because even among humans there are people strong enough to bend gods to their will.</p>\n<p>I went sightseeing for several decades, marvelling at the ingenuity of man. I saw the moving cities of the nomadic northern kingdoms. I swam with the river-dwelling people of the southern riverlands. I picked pockets in the bustling markets of the eastern kingdoms. I wrote poetry and studied philosophy in the halls of the western schools.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/a-dish-best-served-cold-or-an-excerpt-from-the-cookbook-of-the-gods/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Mom lives in a little place off the old meat-packing district, the streets full of cobblestones peeking through asphalt as hipsters turn the bones of slaughterhouses into bespoke gin bars. It’s expensive, and her entire apartment could be picked up and put in the middle of my childhood living room with space to spare—but she’s filled her little spot with books and a three-legged cat and an overstuffed armchair, and there’s a good coffee place on the corner that lets her nurse a single cup for hours while she reads.</p>\n<p>It’s her idea of heaven, and I used to leave her to it most of the time. These days I’ve been dropping by more frequently with a rum cake from the bakery she likes on the other side of the city, and we spend whole afternoons together talking and drinking coffee and eating cake while I pet Grendel. Almost every time I come there’s a Fairport Convention record spinning hypnotically on the turntable she got herself as a housewarming gift when she moved in and sure enough, there it is.</p>\n<p>There’s no sound coming out of it today; not for me, anyway. I ask her what’s playing, and she smiles against her coffee cup and taps her fingers on the ceramic as she sings <i>Meet on the ledge, we’re gonna meet on the ledge</i> in the wobbly alto that used to embarrass me as a kid.</p>\n<p>Over her shoulder, through the window, I see a skyscraper turn 8-bit. It looks like a flat sticker stuck against reality, blocky black squares delineating where the edge of a third dimension should be. It reverts a moment later.</p>\n<p>I ask Mom about the latest book she’s reading, and take a bite of cake. In another place, the one that’s supposed to be more real, my body is probably salivating in response to the mental stimuli of caramelized sugar and rum. We haven’t managed to make anything like it yet. I’ve got some friends who’ve been coaxing along the tiny mushrooms that’ve started growing in the body-pod vents, though. There was a big party when we found them, and I kissed somebody from an entirely different tunnel, which was almost as exciting.</p>\n<p>Mom waves away my question and redirects. “How’s the story coming?”</p>\n<p>In the childhood I remember, the one the robots made up, my mom was a writer. Fantasy and science fiction, all the stuff that would prime her for the real world.</p>\n<p>When I visit, I tell her I’m a writer too. I can do that; if she checked, all the details would be there. For her, I’ve been working on the same literary drama since she moved into the apartment. A sequel to the first one that she thinks I wrote, the one that made enough to put her up in this place. She knows as well as I do that writing doesn’t pay like that, not usually, but she’s never asked me about it, and she’s never asked for a copy.</p>\n<p>At her feet, Grendel’s fur glitches white, subtractive against his rendered background. A second later his fur reverts to its original tortoiseshell, shots of orange and gold running through his darkest patches.</p>\n<p>It’s a good sign, everybody says. The glitches. It means the robots are finally losing.</p>\n<p>I breathe in. Breathe out. My mom’s apartment smells like coffee, cake, cats, and her. There are dust motes glinting in the summer sunlight coming through the casement windows. Grendel’s purring. “I have something new,” I say. “Something different.”</p>\n<p>She settles back in her chair, trying to hide her own relieved look. It’d be pretty funny if she was as bored hearing about my literary plot problems as I was of making them up. She wraps her hands around her own mug and then turns her attention fully on to me. “What’s the premise?” she says, and takes a sip.</p>\n<p>It’s time.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/how-to-win-against-the-robots/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Welcome to issue 182 of <i>Lightspeed Magazine</i>!</p>\n    <p>Relationships aren’t easy, and our newest short science fiction stories explore these challenges. In “The Lord of Mars,” Meghan McCarron writes about a complicated crush in a troubled Martian colony. In “Domestic Disputes,” Naomi Kanakia delves into the kinds of power struggles that emerge in long term relationships, even when those relationships are unfolding in the exciting realm of space exploration. Our flash fiction also explores relationships—“How to Win Against the Robots” by Katherine Crighton is a heart-tugging story of mother-daughter love, while Leah Cypess’s “Finding Love in a Time Loop: A How-To Guide” has some humorous advice for anyone struggling with dating.</p>\n    <p>Oluwatomiwa Ajeigbe’s new story “A Dish Best Served Cold, Or, An Excerpt from the Cookbook of the Gods” is a follow-up to “<a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/immortality-soup-or-an-excerpt-from-the-cookbook-of-the-gods/\">Immortality Soup, Or, An Excerpt from the Cookbook of the Gods</a>,” which appeared in our October 2023 issue (but you don’t need to read the first story to enjoy these gods’ magical adventures). Paul Crenshaw writes about an unusual bodily response in his story “You Knit Me Together in My Mother’s Womb.” We also have a flash story from sadoeuphemist, “What Else, What Else, in the Joyous City?” and another (“Un-Pragmagic: A Tyler Moore Retrospective”) from Spencer Nitkey.</p>\n    <p>All that, and of course we also have our usual assortment of author spotlights, along with book reviews from our terrific review team.

    "body": "<p>“The Lord of Mars” is a captivating story about an experimental space colony whose members are striving to survive both the harsh Martian climate and the escalating political situation. Where did the idea for this story come from?</p>\n<p>I’m not sure it’s a political situation so much as a working conditions situation, but yes, that is definitely a core conflict!</p>\n<p>I had something like an “ah-ha” moment, but it might be better described as an “uh-oh” moment? All I remember is that I was idly thinking about private space exploration, and I realized that the people on a planet might be employees of a company rather than the public servant astronauts we’re used to and I thought . . . uh oh. What happens if the situation starts breaking down?</p>\n<p>There’s a lot of amazing science fiction about the dangers of labor exploitation in space. Often it’s pretty dystopian. Also, those stories tend to be told in the far future. I was curious what the initial stages of that dynamic might look like.</p>\n<p>How did you approach imagining life on Mars? What kind of research or creative decisions went into building that world?</p>\n<p>My biggest inspiration is a podcast called <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/51zf1djWRn5v5HynVupSlU\"> The Habitat</a>, which a dear friend of mine made. It follows six people who volunteered to live inside a fake Mars habitat on the side of a volcano in order to help NASA understand the psychological challenges future explorers would face. It’s really fantastic.</p>\n<p>I researched what the current major theories were on how humans might live on Mars, and what kinds of technology we might use. Potatoes are a crop that seems especially promising, in part because potatoes are just a miracle food.</p>\n<p>About six months after I sold this story, I had lunch with another science fiction writer friend who said he’d just completed a big worldbuilding gathering with actual scientists. Apparently, according to the new data coming, conditions on Mars are even harsher than we realized. A lot of the ideas in here might not be feasible. But I also never wanted to get too bogged down in figuring out whether a Mars colony is feasible. Smarter people than me are working on that one. I was more interested in finding details that would capture how precarious and scary and awe-inspiring it would be to pull it off.</p>\n<p>Reading this story from Oliver’s perspective, I felt such strong feelings of isolation, both physical and emotional. His loyalty towards both the Queen and his fellow “leveraged employees” is a major source of conflict for him that really evokes these feelings. Did you know from the start that this dynamic would be a central part of the story or did it develop as you wrote?</p>\n<p>According to my Scrivener doc, I started working on this story in 2021. I think I wrote that first scene, maybe a little more, and then it sat fallow for a long time.</p>\n<p>Nothing came to life until I figured out that Oliver was going to be torn between those two camps. Originally, I thought this would be a story about the organizers, since I was one of a number of folks who helped organize a union at my old job. But as fiction, that story didn’t feel interesting to me. A lot of my work starts out being inspired by some aspect of my experience, but the characters never come alive until I yank them away from what I’m familiar with and hurl them toward maximum conflict.</p>\n<p>I wrote most of this story in early 2023, sometimes while my infant son slept in a carrier against my chest. I remember feeling very happy and focused. But maybe that feeling of isolation or torn-ness comes from the transition I was making in becoming a parent, too.</p>\n<p>What drew you to speculative fiction/science fiction as a genre?</p>\n<p>I’ve been writing and publishing fantasy and science fiction for twenty years—literally. My first story came out when I was still in college in 2005. I don’t think I’ll ever really know the answer to that question, any more than I’ll know why I like chocolate cake.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/author-spotlight-meghan-mccarron/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>As I circled around the dozens of booths along the three wide lanes at Art on Paper on Thursday, September 4, one stood out above the rest. On the bare white walls were Moleskine journals, much like the small ones I use, except these were spread open to Nicolas V Sanchez’s ballpoint pen drawings of the many corners of his family members’ homes.</p>\n<p>This year marks Sanchez’s eighth time showing at Manhattan’s Art on Paper, he told me, alongside around 100 exhibitors at Pier 36 through Sunday, September 7.</p>\n<p>Smiling infectiously in his booth, Sanchez stood among his intimate journal works depicting pastoral and familial scenes from his Midwest-meets-Mexican upbringing, created with a combination of ballpoint pens. Ranging in price from about $3,000 to $6,000, three of Sanchez’s works had already sold during the first hours of the fair before I arrived, including two notebooks containing drawings of horses and one depicting the outside of his aunt’s fridge with forensic detail.</p>\n<p>“Because it’s pen, I can’t erase it, so I just have to keep going,” Sanchez said of his process drawing on the 4.5 x 7-inch (~11.4 x 17.8 cm) notebooks. “You just commit to it at a certain point, and then that’s kind of the beauty of it.”</p>\n<p>Sanchez’s still life of his aunt’s fridge, “Refri de mi Tia Blanca” (2025), features ruled notebook paper letters from his nephew held up by magnets. The biggest challenge in creating this piece, he said, was the meta task of ensuring that the letter within the notebook appeared to have been written in pencil rather than sketched by pen.</p>\n<p>The Los Angeles-based gallery Arts Unified’s booth featured another writing accessory. Illustrator Adam Greener’s clipboards initially stunned me due to their gargantuan size, but their familiar form encouraged me to take a closer look.</p>\n<p>Greener’s $13,500 “Choices XL” (2022) is a giant ruled piece of paper tucked into a giant clipboard on which the sentence “I will start making better choices” is repeatedly written. A gallery staff member told me that Greener’s work draws upon his school years, during which his doodles would land him in detention. Nearby clipboard pages inscribed with comically blown-up “F” grades transported me back to failing out of the Albuquerque Public School gifted program (in writing, by the way) circa 2011.</p>\n<p>At the Lower East Side-based gallery Van Der Plas Gallery’s booth, I found two artists who were excited to talk about their work: Susan Day, who flew in from Canada that morning, and New York City-based artist Jason McLean. Day was selling her “dream-inspired” drawings of air traffic control maps of Canadian airspace.</p>\n<p>“This is the stuff that kind of keeps me going,” Day said, describing the fair. “It puts my work into some context, and I think having other people’s eyes see my work … is a huge connection for me.”</p>\n<p>Day said her experiences at the New York art fairs bring her much more traffic than she usually receives in Canada. Showing alongside her was McLean, a fellow Canadian, who walked me through “Future Directions” (2025), a self-portrait that is also a map of New York City.</p>\n<p>Still other kinds of paper media could be found at Art on Paper’s fair within a fair, BOOKsmART, such as mixed-media artist Seth Apter’s stunning display of art books meditating on time and aging. Last year, Apter told me, he sold 12 of the 17 books he brought with him to the meta fair, despite initially doubting the fair audience’s interest in artist books. At his booth this year, his works were priced between $600 and $1800. Typically, he told me, he sells his works online and at institutions where he teaches.</p>\n<p>For my final stop, I went where the money was, like the brain-rotten Gen-Zer I am.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039661/art-on-paper-2025-leaps-off-the-page/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Experts say the three-year project will address decades of water damage and prevent similar problems from worsening in the future</h2>\n<p>The iconic house known as <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/soaring-ambition-180985443/\">Fallingwater</a>, designed by architect <a href=\"https://savewright.org/frank-lloyd-wright/#:~:text=Frank%20Lloyd%20Wright%20was%20the,half%20of%20which%20were%20realized.\">Frank Lloyd Wright</a>, was built atop a 30-foot waterfall in the 1930s. As it turns out, the home’s name doesn’t only refer to its unique location. Since its construction, Fallingwater has had a leaking problem.</p>\n<p>The house is currently in the midst of a three-year, $7 million <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/worldheritagepreserved/\">renovation</a> project aiming to fix this problem, which is scheduled to wrap up next spring. Workers have been replacing and reinforcing Fallingwater’s roof, exterior walls and window and door frames. Located in Pennsylvania, Fallingwater is both a <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/documents/140879\">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nationalhistoriclandmarks/nhls-associated-with-flw.htm\">National Historic Landmark</a>, and it’s cared for by the <a href=\"https://waterlandlife.org/\">Western Pennsylvania Conservancy</a>.</p>\n<p>The conservancy’s <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/worldheritagepreserved/\">renovation project</a> aims to “eliminate water infiltration challenges,” Fallingwater director <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/people/justin-gunther/\">Justin Gunther</a> tells the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/home/2025/08/25/fallingwater-renovation-project-leaking/\"> Washington Post</a>’s Ashley Stimpson. “In the Wright community, we describe our houses by how many buckets it requires to capture all the leaks. … We’re hoping to get to no buckets.”</p>\n<p>The famous home stretches across <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/media-resources/fallingwater-facts/\">9,300 square feet</a>, including 4,400 square feet of outdoor terraces.</p>\n<p>Born in 1867, Wright became a leader of the <a href=\"https://flwright.org/explore/prairie-style\">Prairie School</a> of architecture, which attempted to build structures that stood in harmony with nature. “Weather is omnipresent, and buildings must be left out in the rain,” Wright once <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/worldheritagepreserved/\">said</a>. However, some of Fallingwater’s most iconic features—such as its <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/history/the-kaufmanns-fallingwater/designing-fallingwater/\">terraces, flat roofs and expansive windows</a>—made it especially vulnerable to the precipitation of southwestern Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p>“Because Fallingwater is so integrated into its landscape, the effects of time and weather have really pushed the building systems to the ends of their useful lives,” says Gunther in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4luaPP3r_JI&amp;t=1s\">video</a> made by the conservancy.</p>\n<p>The house was built as a private vacation home for <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/history/the-kaufmanns-fallingwater/the-kaufmann-family/\">Edgar J. Kaufmann</a>, a Pittsburgh department store owner, who used it as a weekend retreat for his family and guests. Despite its seclusion, the house “was hardly up before its fame circled the Earth,” <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/history/the-kaufmanns-fallingwater/designing-fallingwater/\">recalled</a> Kaufmann’s son, <a href=\"https://modernismweek.com/2025/films-lectures/fallingwaters-edgar-kaufmann-jr-life-and/\">Edgar Kaufmann Jr.</a>, in 1963, when the house was entrusted to the conservancy. In 1964, Fallingwater opened for public tours, and it’s since received more than <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/media-resources/fallingwater-facts/\">6.3 million</a> visitors.</p>\n<p>Back in 2000, the conservancy carried out a major structural strengthening project, Clinton E. Piper, Fallingwater’s senior administrator of special projects, tells <i>Smithsonian </i>magazine. Apart from regular maintenance, the current renovation is the organization’s first major conservation effort in 25 years. Workers are also creating a 3D scan of the building, which would assist with repairs in the case of a future catastrophe.</p>\n<p>“There’s different technology that we can use now than what Wright used originally,” Piper says. “But still, to maintain the same integrity and materials … It’s a challenging undertaking.”</p>\n<p>Workers have replaced chunks of damaged concrete, installed waterproof materials beneath terraces and injected almost 12 tons of grout into Fallingwater’s walls, according to the conservancy’s <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/projects/world-heritage-preservation/\">blog</a>.</p>\n<p>The house is filled with custom furniture and paintings by the likes of Pablo Picasso and Diego Rivera, making it a fragile workspace. “When you’re working on Fallingwater, you can’t drop anything,” senior maintenance specialist Ben Morrison tells the <i>Washington Post</i>. “Not a nail, not a drill bit, not anything.”</p>\n<p>Morrison says the prestigious house requires slow, cautious interventions. “You can’t do things half at Fallingwater,” he tells the <i>Washington Post</i>. “What would normally take you an hour to do at home—you can’t do it like that here.”</p>\n<p>Throughout his career, Wright’s artistic vision reputedly outweighed practical, structural concerns. The self-proclaimed architect admitted to “<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/quotes/3073/\">honest arrogance</a>” and “would often joke that his architecture was like leaving fine art out in the rain,” Gunther tells the London<i> </i><a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/us/news-today/article/frank-lloyd-wright-fallwater-leaking-roof-xqrt3h3wj\"> Times</a>’ George Grylls.</p>\n<p>Around the same time that he designed Fallingwater, Wright also created <a href=\"https://franklloydwright.org/site/wingspread/\">Wingspread</a>, a pinwheel-shaped mansion in Wisconsin. When its new owner, businessman <a href=\"https://scjohnson.com/en/who-we-are/johnson-family/hf-johnson-jr\">Herbert F. Johnson Jr.</a>, called Wright to complain of a leak in the ceiling, the architect replied, “Well, Hib, why don’t you move your chair?”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/fallingwaters-roof-is-leaking-can-this-7-million-renovation-protect-frank-lloyd-wrights-masterpiece-180987288/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Because her sudden pregnancy doomed her—as she saw it—to diapers and daycares she couldn’t afford and the same drab job she already disliked, Abby asked for Marcia’s advice. At thirty months, Marcia was already the size of a glacier. She moved slowly and inexorably, lowering herself cranelike onto couches from which she might never extract herself.</p>\n<p>“The law only says we can’t abort,” Marcia told her, hands fluttering like angry birds. “It says nothing about keeping it in.”</p>\n<p>“But how,” Abby said, “do you keep it in?”</p>\n<p>They were sunk into the couch in the office common room. Marcia’s ankles looked like bean bags, but her eyes were storms. “You just do,” she said. She tried to cross her legs. “I’ll carry to fifty months if I have to. I can’t have a child now.” Her voice rose on the word <i>child</i>, as if she were trying to find the right outrage at the law and the asshole men who passed it.</p>\n<p>Abby couldn’t imagine fifty months. At a little more than nine weeks, she already woke at least once during the night needing to pee. In the city twilight at two a.m., Hart snoring open-mouthed beside her, traffic noises distant as a dream, she found herself rubbing her womb. She cocked her head as if she could hear her unborn child. She listed Pros: There’s a small human growing inside me. Cons: Everything else.</p>\n<p>She looked around the apartment. Her bed folded into the wall and the bathroom opened off the kitchen. When Hart came home they had to step around each other. “It’s like a closet,” her father had said when she moved in, and she shut her eyes less at the remark than the reminder. In the mornings she went to work in an old warehouse-turned-office-space where she wrote greeting cards for barely more than minimum wage. She specialized in Sympathy, the saccharine sense of loss: <i>Thinking Of You In This Difficult Time</i>; <i>May Your Tomorrow Be Brighter Than Your Today</i>, phrases that insulated her from the world, the way her womb now insulated her unborn child.</p>\n<p>• • • •</p>\n<p>In her mid-twenties Abby had become an activist: the marches, the protests, the cleverly-worded signs. <i>Keep Your Cold Dead Hands From Prying Into My Vagina</i>. <i>Uteruses Are People, Too</i>. House Bill 77 had been in place for a few months, but she hadn’t met Hart yet—her sexual adventures after college involved batteries.</p>\n<p>When she slept with Hart the first time, she asked if he had a condom. He raised up on one elbow and looked at her. He kept his head shaved to hide that he was going bald, something she didn’t understand. When he said condoms couldn’t be sold anymore, it took her a moment to remember why.</p>\n<p>Within a year of House Bill 77, she was seeing pregnant people everywhere. There were more of them, and many refused to give birth. Abortions had been outlawed along with contraceptives, but Marcia had been right—the law only said they couldn’t abort. Her sister in Salisbury was at twelve months when she broke her water. A friend of a friend went to almost eighteen months before she felt secure enough to give birth. At night Abby lay with Hart in the small apartment and listened to the rain. She said she’d like a child someday. She waved a hand to indicate the distant future, a house in the suburbs with a manicured lawn and address painted on the curb. When she had sex with Hart he pulled out and sprayed her stomach. She dreamed that his semen was absorbed through the skin and she became pregnant anyway.</p>\n<p>• • • •</p>\n<p>And then she did.</p>\n<p>She didn’t know right away, as some of her friends said they did. When her period didn’t come she wondered if, with the upheaval of pregnancy, periods might have gone wonky as well.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/you-knit-me-together-in-my-mothers-womb/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In less than a decade, they’ve moved from the realm of SF movies into the slightly less-realistic realm of self-help books—most famously, <i>Moving On: How to Keep Going When Time Literally Stops—</i>and popular country songs—most infamously, <i>Loved You a Million Times</i>.

He studies in The Great Temple of Osi, takes care of his orphaned niece Uwi, and is painfully grateful for all that he has, despite past personal traumas. When he discovers that one of the great figures of history may have had a very different life than the one contained in the magical collective memory of his people, he asks the Elders to send him on a quest to find the deeper truth.</p>\n    <p>Of course they do, and of course nothing goes the way it’s expected to, including the journey readers expect Ethike to go on. Nothing is quite as it seems in this story. Ethike’s companions are full of surprises, the journey is both easier and harder than it should be, and the truth that he finds is both confusingly unclear and catastrophically obvious. What–and <i>who</i>–Ethike finds while searching the Forever Desert changes not only him, but his entire world, its history, and how everyone thinks of those things.</p>\n    <p>This book is vaguer and stranger than the previous two instalments, but so is the nature of memory. The two previous books examined how truth changes depending on one’s point of view. <i>The Memory of the Ogisi</i> is more concerned with outcome than with perspective, and the implications of that made my head spin a little. Ethike’s story forces us to ask ourselves if the truth is in knowing, or telling, and whether or not the real truth matters as long as the people believe something that forces change. Whether or not that change is positive is up for interpretation–but again, the interpretation isn’t as important as the outcome is here. Who decides on that outcome certainly is, however.</p>\n    <p>This isn’t a happy ending that wraps up the trilogy with a tidy bow and makes us all feel good about the characters as they come to the end of their journeys. Instead, it’s a paradigm shift that turns everything you thought you knew about the Forever Desert and its suffering kingdoms on its head and makes you reconsider everything and everyone you’ve met here. All of Ethike’s world—and the worlds of Tutu and Osi before him—are under scrutiny. The right things to say, hear, and see are no longer clear.</p>\n    <p>What is clear is that this series has some of the most beautiful writing in recent fantasy fiction. The prose is lyrical, philosophical, and beautifully wrought. It’s a joy to read this just for the flow of the language, and the story that unspools beneath Utomi’s pen is definitely worthy of the words that create it.</p>\n    <p>This is a beautiful, unexpected conclusion to a masterfully wrought adventure series, told in language that does its epic nature justice. Don’t expect to walk away knowing how to think about what you’ve just read or how to remember it. Just know that you definitely will.</p>\n    <p>Enjoyed this article?

    "body": "<p><i>In a world of industrialized spells, tinged by burnt coal and blood money, make magic that sings for its own sake</i>.</p>\n<p>Tyler Moore’s spells strive to exist in and of themselves. They make no excuse or justification for their existence: no promise to speak to the dead, predict next year’s grain or gold prices, or read the mind of lawyers during a hostile takeover. They are simply beautiful, challenging, and awe-inducing. Before his sudden death, he practiced a wide range of magic, never focusing on a single school or tradition, and in turn created his own kind of magical vocabulary. This retrospective on the late spell-crafter, featuring five never-before-seen pieces, looks at his spells in the spirit with which he worked.

The sounds of the piano and Bach’s numinous arias are intercepted by a block of ochre, adorned with runes believed to be written with Moore’s own blood. The music is sieved through an invisible net, transforming the sound into visual, olfactory and even tactile senses. Viewers experience music in a wholly unique way. Harmonies appear as waves of color and reach the viewer as the sensation of a hand grabbing their wrist. All the while <i>the burnt smell of forest fires lingers beneath each sound, a winding, horrible stench of distant destruction</i>.</p>\n<p>• • • •</p>\n<p><i>Hummingbirds</i>, 2026</p>\n<p>Tyler Moore</p>\n<p>Mirror, sea glass, sand</p>\n<p>Three mirrors face one another, creating an equilateral triangle in this piece of refractive magic. Between them, sand and half-buried sea glass cover the floor. When a viewer kneels or squats before one of the hip-height mirrors and gazes into their reflection, the sea glass begins to rise from the sand. Viewers can watch the spell only by ignoring it. Look away from the mirror, and the glass falls into the sand. <i>My first spell turned a candle’s flame into a butterfly. It landed on my lover’s hands because I wanted him to know the fire of my chest was a pretty thing. It burned him so badly he needed to go to the hospital. He insisted I stay with him, even as his parents insisted I leave. I was a boy, after all, and this burn was only evidence of what they already believed our love meant.

When it reaches the plexiglass hat, it lowers itself and transforms in full view into a taxidermied raccoon. In each transformative instance, the assumed narrative flow of magic is upended: life becomes death. Eventually the bird returns, but in the lacuna between transitions, viewers are asked to contemplate <i>the unspoken misery that undergirds these white walls. My first show, I was so excited I didn’t sleep for a week. My first piece sold for $45,000. I was so happy that the spell mattered to someone. A week later I learned the buyer had sold it to a Hollywood executive who parked it in the Geneva Free Port to accrue tax-free value. The aether through which art is passed stains it irrevocably, and art here is passed through power. The taxidermied racoon begins to blink, then twitch its stitched face. It claws at the clear edges of the plexiglass and tries to find someone, anyone’s, caring eyes. When it does not, it begins to cry. Tears leak down the fading fur and fill the hat to its brim. A final alchemy occurs, and the salty water transforms into formaldehyde, freezing the tear-struck animal, its performance forever halted. If you are reading this, leave the gallery.

    "body": "<p>Can you talk a bit about how this story took shape and what inspirations fed into it?</p>\n<p>I’ve been working lately in a distinctly new style—quite different from my other stories—that I call “the tale.” In these stories, you don’t bother with setting the scene or writing from ‘within’ the body. Instead, you just tell the story, as simply as if your reader was sitting across from you at the table. This style sacrifices immediacy, but it allows for much more flexibility in terms of scope. With this style, I can make the thousand-year jump at the end quite simply. I don’t need the reader to intuit that time has passed: instead I can just tell them.</p>\n<p>This style was highly-influenced by early prose fictions. I spent much of the fall of 2023 reading the Icelandic family sagas, some of Europe’s earliest prose fictions. These sagas are written in a clear, unadorned style that’s so anonymous it’s quite different to state, confidently, how many authors were involved in writing the sagas, or whether they had individual authors at all. I was also influenced by Boccaccio’s <i>The Decameron</i> and Apuleius’s <i>The Golden Ass—</i>two collections of tales that also mix the realistic and fantastic and are, similarly, told in a plain, unadorned style.</p>\n<p>There’s a lot of meta working here in regard to the question of “who is the main character, who is the hero,” but what I found most interesting is how much Tomas’ deep insecurity shapes the narrative. Why did you approach the story in this way?</p>\n<p>We all have a role in this world, but largely our role is not to be the hero. Tomas is a guy who grew up on some little hick planet, dreamed of getting off, and <i>did</i> in fact succeed in escaping. But now he finds himself trapped on this starship, and his whole being is subservient to this purpose that he didn’t necessarily choose. Where, moreover, he doesn’t necessarily have the biggest role, and could probably be replaced by another person. That’s just what life is, no? As you grow older, you find that your life has certain contours, and although you chose those contours, you’re now also trapped by them. You have to keep actively choosing this life, even though, on some level, you feel all your choice is gone.</p>\n<p>“Totalizing individuality,” as opposed to diversity, sounds like a contradiction in terms, but it isn’t really specified much beyond the great threat that Our Hero(es) have to defeat. What does it mean to you, and what led you to have the great threat be something so fungible?</p>\n<p>I think that’s the contradiction we’re always facing when it comes to diversity. We want to have a collective that is varied and yet cohesive. I imagined that in opposition to this diversity, you could also have an individuality that is collective. This is the world of the fascism—where the hopes and dreams of a nation are all bound up in a single personality, who expresses everyone’s individuality on their behalf. The danger with diversity is that it can be quite flattening: to the extent we maintain our individuality, we are cut off from each other, and life feels empty. But to the extent that we lose our individuality, then life feels pointless.</p>\n<p>I noticed that there aren’t any quotes in the story for dialogue. If this isn’t a standard formatting decision for you, did something about the story lend itself to that style, and what differences do you think quote-formatting choices make for the reader?</p>\n<p>In literary fiction, I joke that if you want to be taken seriously you must eschew quotation marks. I think this fashion arose, in part, because sometimes in Europe a <a href=\"#Quotation_dash\"> writer will use dashes instead of quotation marks</a>. The major writer to adopt this convention was James Joyce, in </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/author-spotlight-naomi-kanakia-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Once upon a time, on a spaceship traveling through the divide between galaxies, a married couple was bickering about whose job it was to clean the mouse shit that’d accumulated in the reactor tubes. Tomas believed (quite reasonably, in my opinion) that since his wife’s squeamishness was the reason the mice hadn’t been exterminated, then it was her job to deal with the consequences. While his wife believed that since it was her husband’s job to maintain the ship’s systems, this clearly fell within his remit.</p>\n<p>His wife, Antonia, in case you’re wondering, was an adventurer, hero, explorer type who’d picked up her young husband (rescued him, really) on some out-of-the-way planet on the rim of a distant (now sadly conquered and consumed) galaxy on the other side of the universe.</p>\n<p>Like most married couples, their arguments were never about the thing in question: lots of other domestic shit always came bubbling up, mostly related to Tomas feeling like his work was undervalued, because he wasn’t a Galactic Hero and Last Hope for All Free Peoples.</p>\n<p>They were headed to the White Mass at the center of the universe. All around them, the galaxies had grown hot and uniform, full of self-individuating masses, reaching out to transcend mortal existence. Tomas and Antonia were lonely and far away from their respective communities; in Tomas’s case, his community no longer existed.</p>\n<p>He won the fight, by turning the dispute into a referendum on their relationship (if you really loved me, you would . . .) and she sulkily went into the tubes with a sonic scrubber to vaporize mouse shit, while he sat in sullen triumph in the command chair, staring at the data visualizations he’d programmed to represent their increasing isolation: he looked to the left and right at the swirls of rainbow color. He watched in real time as civilizations were coalesced and multiplex communalities were totalized into a single individual consciousness.</p>\n<p>And he listened to the voice of the White Mass.</p>\n<p>—It is your seductress speaking, she said. Have you told her about me yet?</p>\n<p>—I’m going to, Tomas said.</p>\n<p>—And how will that go?</p>\n<p>—She’ll feel betrayed, but we’ll get through it.</p>\n<p>—Why does it matter what she thinks? the White Mass said. What if in reality you are the transcendent individual, alive with uniqueness, and she is the mere object of deterministic chance?</p>\n<p>—I highly doubt that, he said.</p>\n<p>—What if your relationship occurred because you bent the universe in your direction? What if your will is so strong that you pulled this individual across the universe, changed the course of her particles, merely to effect your rescue. How do you think individuals arise? I know, I know, you think they arise out of tremendous talents, do you not?</p>\n<p>—No, he said. Tremendous talents combined with tremendous determination and character. Antonia defeated the Galactic Devourer using riddles. I couldn’t do that—the Galactic Devourer wouldn’t have even accepted my riddle challenge. He’d have just devoured me.</p>\n<p>—And yet am I not a Devourer? Are you not engaging in a campaign of wits with me? And is there not a chance you shall prevail?</p>\n<p>This conversation terminated abruptly as Antonia emerged, sweaty and upset, from the shafts and tunnels. She kissed him on the forehead, and she said, “Maybe when we’re both calmed down we can process this a little. But in the meantime I have to meditate.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/domestic-disputes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>A woman roaming the mountainside splashes her face in an unseen stream. Her hair drips toward a crystal prism glowing in her steady hand. Mist fills the space around her; her silhouette is gilded in light.</p>\n<p>In this scene from the 1932 film <i>Das blaue Licht </i>(The Blue Light), a plucky heroine emerges from an Alpine range. “Because a woman is the only one who can climb a dangerous mountain,” IMDb’s synopsis reads, “villagers regard her as a witch.” From today’s vantage, the clip exudes a feminist vibe of a piece with a Patagonia ad. You could be forgiven for feeling a wee bit stirred as she (literally) scales the sublime. And for not realizing that this woman — who also directed the film — would soon be the grande dame of fascist cinema.</p>\n<p>Or, as the new documentary <i> Riefenstahl</i> provocatively asks: </p>\n<p><i>Could you</i>?</p>\n<p>Andres Veiel’s movie makes a quiet — and disquieting — case for the insidious potential of the moving image, whose seductive power can be easily harnessed to heinous political agendas. That the propaganda in question comes from Leni Riefenstahl, a woman who directed her singular talent toward not only valorizing but <i>inventing </i>the Nazi aesthetic, throws into relief how foolish it is to reflexively affiliate a woman’s degree of artistic ambition or achievement with automatic progress. </p>\n<p><i>Olympia</i>, with Joseph Goebbels and Hermann Göring on the tribune (1936) (© Vincent Productions)</p>\n<p>Excavating archives <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/24/berlin-museum-offers-glimpse-of-leni-riefenstahl-estate\">recently gifted</a> to Berlin’s Museum of Photography, Veiel visually foregrounds the materiality of film, the inevitably tangled nature of Leni’s art and ideology. A celluloid strip whirs before us, pausing to reveal three figures in a field, a bucolic scene until one recognizes the inverted likeness of a trio of SS officers Here the documentary cuts to an iconic views of 1934 Nuremberg: Throngs of Germans furiously greet their beloved Führer, their bodies packed so close that one loses sight of where one human being ends and another begins. “As he spoke his very first words,” Leni recounts of the rally almost 50 years later, “I was overcome by a very peculiar feeling, my whole body … trembling. And I was somehow captured, as if by a magnetic force.”</p>\n<p>If Leni was enchanted by Hitler’s presence, she did all she could with her films to arouse that same captivation in her country(wo)men. “The camera pans over to one side, and then it pans back over to the other side,” she avidly narrates as she reviews a clip of <i>Triumph of the Will </i>(1935). Her 90-year-old hand proudly swaying to the beat of Herbert Windt’s soundtrack, she adds, “These two shots combine to create the form of a circle, and the resulting effect is very powerful.”</p>\n<p><i>Riefenstahl</i>’s head editor, Stephan Krumbiegel, also grasps the power of strategic juxtapositions — exposing not only Leni’s Nazi infatuation, but that of the German people at large. Following a sequence of unsettling shots of the Nuremberg rally, we pause on a close-up of a girl peeking out from behind a row of soldiers. Her short hair frames her mischievous grin; her side part parallels the swastika behind her. She, like Leni, exudes “girl-power” swagger seemingly at odds with masculinist fascism — and in many other contexts, she, like Leni, would inspire rather than repulse. </p>\n<p>And that is the point. <i>Riefenstahl </i>acknowledges Leni’s scrappy charm while also laying bare her terrifying legacy. Whether it’s taking a lover 40 years her junior or setting off to live among the Nuba people of Sudan, she had no issue flouting standard feminine decorum. Nor did she have a problem with building her career on the goose-stepping heels of a murderous regime. “What responsibility should I have?” she rebuffs a journalist decades later. “Back then 90% of people were enthralled by Hitler. You think I should have been a resistance fighter?”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039657/examining-the-legacy-of-fascist-cinema-grand-dame-leni-riefenstahl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The community, which has been a <a href=\"https://ohp.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=21534\">California Historical Landmark</a> since 1949, was originally settled in 1849 by Chinese miners who were pushed out of a nearby mining camp during the California Gold Rush.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The TCU September Lightning Complex is burning across multiple fires and impacting communities in Calaveras and Tuolumne counties.</p>— California Governor's Office of Emergency Services (@Cal_OES)<br/>Cal OES is coordinating with local, state, and federal partners to support firefighting efforts and community needs.<br/>Visit<a href=\"\">https://t.co/xUxzIcH5jL</a>…<a href=\"\">pic.twitter.com/0F2cHOtquY</a><a href=\"\">September 3, 2025</a></blockquote>\n<p>It was initially called Camp Washington but later became known as Chinese Camp because of the high number of Chinese miners living there—as many as 5,000 at its peak, per <a href=\"https://www.visittuolumne.com/chinese-camp\">Visit Tuolumne County</a>.</p>\n<p>Many of the buildings have long been abandoned, “reclaimed by nature with overgrown greenery,” according to Visit Tuolumne County. The town has also served as a filming location for a handful of <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?locations=chinese%20camp\">movies</a>.</p>\n<p>Fortune-seekers from around the world, including China, flocked to California after gold was discovered in 1848. Initially, Americans found the new arrivals to be “peculiar” and often visited Chinese camps for fun, according to PBS’ “<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/goldrush-chinese-immigrants/\">American Experience</a>.” However, that welcoming sentiment quickly morphed into xenophobia and racism. In the early 1850s, the state levied a <a href=\"https://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/260miners.html\">Foreign Miners Tax</a> on Chinese immigrants in a bid to push them out of California.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.visittuolumne.com/The-History-of-Chinese-Camp-Brochure.pdf\">Visit Tuolumne County</a>.</p>\n<p>Firefighters are still assessing the damage from the blaze, which forced the evacuation of more than 300 people living in and near Chinese Camp. However, <a href=\"https://www.kcra.com/article/fire-devastates-historic-gold-rush-era-landmarks-chinese-camp/65976729\">KCRA</a>’s Peyton Headlee reports that the fire destroyed the interior of the post office, which was built in 1854. Though the stone and brick structure was more than 170 years old, it was still in use, according to <a href=\"https://ohp.parks.ca.gov/ListedResources/Detail/423\">California State Parks</a>.</p>\n<p>The fire also ripped through the interior of the Oddfellows Hall and destroyed many homes in Chinese Camp, per KCRA. So far, the Chinese Camp Science Academy and the St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church don’t appear to have been affected. The Chinese Camp Store and Tavern, which dates to 1934, also appears to have survived, report the <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-09-03/california-fires-lightning-strikes\"> Los Angeles Times</a>’ Alex Wigglesworth and Summer Lin.</p>\n<p>“We have so precious few Gold Rush era places left in California that have any authenticity at all. So, to have this one go is just heartbreaking,” says <a href=\"https://calacademy.academia.edu/ShellyDavisKing\">Shelly Davis-King</a>, an anthropologist with the California Academy of Sciences and a Tuolumne County resident, to KCRA. “These were really spectacular buildings that told an important part of the history of our state. And now that’s gone.”</p>\n<p>The storm that caused the 6-5 Fire, as well as the many others burning in the area, produced more than 9,000 lightning strikes, per a <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/09/02/california-secures-federal-assistance-to-support-response-to-the-tcu-lightning-complex-fire-in-calaveras-county/\">statement</a> from California Governor Gavin Newsom’s office. The lightning came from a “<a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/abq/clifeature2010drythunderstorms\">dry thunderstorm</a>,” a weather system that produces very little to no precipitation at the surface. In this case, the storm produced <a href=\"https://x.com/NWSBayArea/status/1962881156568727580\">some rainfall</a>, but the moisture evaporated before it reached the ground, according to <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/09/03/6-5-wildfire-map-evacuation-zones-chinese-camp/85952052007/\"> USA Today</a>’s Julia Gomez and Thao Nguyen.</p>\n<p>More than 630 firefighters have been deployed to the region, with more on the way. They are facing tough conditions as they battle the blazes.</p>\n<p>“The fire has exhibited active runs in critically dry tall grass, brush and timber fuels,” according to Cal Fire. “The terrain is challenging to access, requiring fire crews to hike in by foot to many remote locations. … Weather conditions continue to be a challenge to crews as gusty winds remain in the area from nearby thunderstorm cells.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/wildfire-sweeps-through-historic-california-gold-rush-town-settled-by-chinese-miners-180987294/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Also inspired by her own experience parenting a child with a speech delay, she started her baby earworm factory, &quot;Songs for Littles&quot; in 2019. Now she's a beloved toddler soother with fans across the world. (And to anyone who's recently had to entertain a toddler, a household name.) Her YouTube channel boasts 16 million subscribers. She's best known for her enthusiastic and approachable ditties on key subjects, like potty training. But for the past two years, Ms. Rachel has also been using her high pulpit to advocate for child welfare in Palestine and Sudan. Though initially wrapped in a generally loving message about kids around all border, her advocacy for Gazan kids in particular has grown louder and louder. As Amy Goodman put it on a Thursday episode of Democracy Now, Ms. Rachel has also been hailed as the heir to Mister Rogers, the legendary PBS children’s entertainer who also used his position in families’ living rooms to speak out on social issues.&quot;  So how did this baby whisperer come into her calling? After publicly declaring that she would not work with anyone who didn't speak out for Gaza, Ms. R joined forces with Tareq Hailat, director of the Treatment Abroad Program for the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, and helped connect Accurso with a recent guest. Rahaf, a 3-year-old girl from Gaza who lost both her legs in an Israeli airstrike, appeared on a recent episode with Ms. Rachel. It's a typical video in the sense that they sing and dance and pretend to go to sleep. But it does the quiet work of de-stigmatizing Palestinian victims. (And disabled children.) Hailat describes Accurso as “one of the most significant, if not the most significant, voices for Palestinian human rights” in the world. “Her advocacy has touched the hearts of people that never would have ever heard about Gaza or the Palestinian children, and that’s why her voice is so vital,” he says. So why the Mister Rogers' comps? Fred also demonstrated an admirable ability to stay on message when the chips were down, and used his invitation into American homes to model tolerance. In a now famous episode that aired in 1969, Mr. Rogers shared a wading pool with a Black American—the Neighborhood's beat cop, Mr. Clemons.

    "body": "<p>Can you talk a bit about how “It Might Be He Returns” took shape and what inspirations fed into it?</p>\n<p>This is maybe my oldest story or the story I’ve had in me for the longest time. Many of my stories out in the world right now were brought into being by my adult self. This story is different because the setting and framework took shape when I myself was still a child. The biggest influence was my own encounters with unhoused children on the streets of Karachi. Either on the way to school myself or coming to and from places in the city. There is no childhood for them, and no organised resource or infrastructure to resort to. This has been the case for lifetimes and continues to be so. This extreme unkindness hurts the children affected most and also impacts the rest of the city who either ignore it or respond to it ineffectively, disjointedly, and in a way that often deals with the symptoms but never eradicates the problem at its root.</p>\n<p>How do you help? At most you can fill people’s bellies, which is what many citizens of Karachi in positions of privilege attempt to do. You can finance opportunities for education and facilitate an end to poverty for families, and to do so you yourself need to fight a bloodthirsty economy. And for practical purposes that’s pretty much it. There’s a whole conversation to be had about why this is the case, what more we could be doing, what legacies have played into this disgusting crisis. Talking to the children, you get a variety of stories. Some true, some what they are made to say by gangs or their own families. The influence of that and of the varied reactions of the people around me to that led to this story.</p>\n<p>In my childhood version (very different from this one) the story ends with the child teaming up with the fantastical creatures of the city and ultimately gaining a victory for the city as a whole. Here I leave it a little more complex. The inspiration for that is my own relationship to Karachi and how I feel towards it as an adult.</p>\n<p>While the story takes place on both sides of a mirror, the other world read far stranger than I’d expect from a simple reflection—for example, the horse and cat made of paper. What led you to choose a mirror as the portal between the two cities?</p>\n<p>I think for me, looking into a mirror at a tailor’s shop or clothes shop in a mall has always been less about seeing yourself and more about looking into a crystal ball and divining which item possesses enough magic you can peacock yourself into maintaining or elevating your social status. Once you buy into the game of using conspicuous consumption to win, you have become a coconspirator in dystopia. I think dystopia exists when ideas are robbed of any floweriness and stripped down to their truest essence only to be invalidated and not accommodated despite being irrepressibly present. In our everyday life we see suffering, and many of us engage in systemic oppressions anyway. We don’t improve our lives or truly benefit ourselves despite this transaction. We’re stuck in the dystopia too. In the story I find the place beyond the mirror to be the truest form of our everyday lives and yet also unseen and unvisited. Things there appear in ways we are not used to but reflect a reality of their being. How I wrote ink and paper in their animal incarnations perhaps reflects how much life was imbued in the experience readers and writers had of them.</p>\n<p>I found the story preoccupied with the problems of casual, acquisitive cruelty, with the mirror both reflecting and shaping the world, feeding into the ultimate question of what a city is for. What do you think a city is for?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/author-spotlight-fatima-taqvi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>What you need to know about the boy in this story is he is always hungry and the sun is always too hot for him, and he would save the world if he could. This is what he tells himself as he sits opposite the tailor’s shop, looking at the clothes sway in the breeze of the air conditioner within. Fawad would save the world, he would change fate itself. He would give his parents the best of the best. March into any school he wants. Get any kind of education he needs to feel like the person he knows he could be.</p>\n<p>The mirror in Master Jee’s shop has always stretched itself up at a tilt behind the counter, framed by the stitched clothes that hang around it. A thin crack smiles across its grime. The fast approaching and departing shapes of Karachi’s blurred traffic reflect on its surface in unsettling bursts. Perhaps it would have been better had it been facing somewhere else. But then none of what was to come would have happened.</p>\n<p>The first time Fawad saw the mirror’s true intentions, he was sitting cross-legged against a wall of the shops opposite the tailor’s shop, scratching a map of all he knew into the dirt. He was thinking, always thinking. What to do? Where to go? One of his sandals was about to break, should he spend time looking for a new pair? Pangs of hunger assailed him and the world grew and contracted over the emptiness, shimmering at the edges, radiating unintelligible truths only he felt the impact of.</p>\n<p>Opposite the road, the mirror beamed the sun’s reflection back so brilliantly that for the moment that Fawad stopped, his gaze dragged up towards its face where it shone through the glass behind the crouched figure of the tailor over a sewing machine.</p>\n<p>Just in time to see the tailor’s reflection peel away from the rest of its flat mirror world and stand up.</p>\n<p>Fawad had wobbled where he was sitting, almost passing out. The tailor’s reflection paused for the longest moment, before giving a defeated shrug and sitting down again in faithful imitation of Master Jee as both tailors shook out a length of white cotton.</p>\n<p>The next time it happened, he couldn’t breathe, and the last time he almost lost control of his bladder. The reflection had taken to tilting its head, shading its eyes with one hand as it peered out from the shop window. Craning over its doppelganger’s shoulder, face hidden in a flash of light. One arm reaching up. Pointing straight at him.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, Fawad was scared out of his mind. At first, at least. Because, really, no matter how strange these happenings are, the mirror belongs to a very large group of things that have nothing to do with him. He is outside, on the streets. It is inside.</p>\n<p>When his father died, the inside places all closed themselves to him. People he used to know started sitting too close together, taking up all the space and leaving him none, staring up at him, as if in shock he thought they would yield him a millimeter. When he showed up at school, the Vice Principal held him by the ear and dragged him back out of the school gates. Would there be any payment coming for his fees, she asked. Because if not, it was time he became a man and earned for himself. A man. And schools were for children.</p>\n<p>The school gates were bolted twice behind him, once sideways and the other bolt going into the ground, deep into the earth, maybe the aluminum went rattling all the way down into the earth’s core, where no doubt his father sat with all the other dead and deceased swapping stories. The school gates shook for a moment, as if filled with rage. Then stood still and silent as a monument.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/it-might-be-he-returns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Dispatch #1</p>\n<p>[INAUDIBLE] . . . but hopefully I’ve got the recorder working now. This is Dr. Nathaniel Letheford, Director, Alliance for Military Neutralization and Eradication of Sensitive Incidents and Atrocities. I have been inserted into conflict zone W-924/B for sample collection and field review of <i>Amnemoriabacillus thanatensis</i>. My pilot is dead. Transport destroyed. I sustained damage to my environ suit but have made repairs. Direct comm links are down, so I’m recording these dispatches and launching them via micro drone at regular intervals. I have five working drones.</p>\n<p>The journey was rough but I’m here. This is a unique opportunity to see the result of my life’s work in the field. So here I am. Here I go.</p>\n<p>Dispatch #2</p>\n<p>I’m following the main road west, which should lead me to ground zero for the deployment of <i>A. thanatensis</i> and its first real-world application. The destruction in this zone is overwhelming. I’ve never seen such a complete deletion of infrastructure. Every bridge has fallen. Every building reduced to boulders and dust. Fighting in this zone has paused and most bodies have been cleared. Most, but not all. Even from this distance, it is obvious the deceased are mainly women, old men, and children. Many children.</p>\n<p>Even after the bodies are buried, the pain for these people will continue. A casket hides a lot of crimes. Children buried without limbs. Skin blackened. Jaws, eyes, ears ripped away. A ragged hole where a face used to be. A casket doesn’t spare the first responders, the authorities who arrive late after the destruction, the body collectors, the embalmers. A child’s body done in by violence is an open wound in the world that can never be closed.</p>\n<p>What if there were none of that? What if there were simply no body to collect? Not a day goes by where I cannot picture my daughter and how she died. [SENSITIVE DETAILS REDACTED.] No one else will have to endure that. No one else will have to remember. We can finally forget. That’s the gift we are giving to the world.</p>\n<p>Dispatch #3</p>\n<p>I have reached the first waypoint, the ambulance, and I have encountered <i>A. thanatensis</i> in the wild. I have limited ability to conduct a full, thorough, and complete examination in the field due to damaged and lost equipment, but I have collected and labeled specimens for later processing. I dare not send them in the drones, as we don’t want any of this stuff to escape into an uncontrolled area. Can you imagine?</p>\n<p>The ambulance has sustained obvious battle damage. There appears to be large artillery fire and small arms. Complete assessment of the scene is difficult because of the heavy <i>A. thanatensis</i> overgrowth—which, ironically, is the point. It does appear the organism is functioning as intended, though it may have pushed past its previously assumed range. I can only guess this growth has spread from the original targeted deployment, six miles due west. If this turns out to be the case, we can adjust the initial dosing to contain it.</p>\n<p>There are two paramedics in the process of being . . . processed. As expected, their open wounds are the site of germination, and the vegetation formed by <i>A. thanatensis</i> has erupted and branched out from there. I estimate the remains are eighty to ninety percent involved at this point, with only the ends of the extremities left to go. A few blades of green grass have germinated under the fingernails of one paramedic. Creeping vines have entered the ear of the other, and I imagine his brain at this point has turned to a tangle of pale, fibrous roots. The skull is yet unturned so I cannot cut into the cranium to investigate, which is a pity. Overall, <i>A. thanatensis</i> appears to be robust and healthy, and successful lateral gene transfer has occurred. It appears much like local vegetation because it <i>is</i> local vegetation—mostly tall grasses and creeping vines. Honestly, I’m so impressed with my work, if such a thing is permissible. This stuff is fast growing. I can almost hear it scrunching along, subsuming the remaining flesh and bone, though I know that’s just my imagination.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/five-dispatches-from-conflict-zone-w-924-b-regarding-post-battle-deployment-of-a-thanatensis-david-anaxagoras/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

This month we’re returning to a previously visited world of silkpunk and star-crossed love, where two sisters might save or doom everything they know—that’s right, it’s <i>The Blood Phoenix</i> by Amber Chen, sequel to <i>Of Jade and Dragons</i>! (Previously reviewed <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/book-review-of-jade-and-dragons-by-amber-chen/\">here at  Lightspeed in April 2024</a>.)</p>\n<p><i>The Blood Phoenix</i> takes place two years after the events of <i>Of Jade and Dragons</i> (you’ll definitely want to read the first book before reading this one) and it once again features Aihui Ying as the lead character/chief troublemaker—only this time she’s joined by her younger sister Aihui Nian (who we see a little bit of during book one, but not much). Following the tempestuous end of Ying’s relationship with Aogiya Ye-Yang, eighth prince and now High Commander of the Antaran Isles, Ying has secluded herself in an isolated fishing community. Ying finds herself unwilling to face the fallout of the events that led to Ye-Yang’s rise, as well as her feelings towards him—feelings which are complicated even further by her younger sister Nian’s betrothal to Ye-Yang. Meanwhile, Nian is struggling with her own feelings towards Aogiya Ye-Kan, the fourteenth prince and once heir-apparent, as well as the growing estrangement between herself and Ying. Their lives are brought unexpectedly back together after a violent attack on Ying’s village by the fearsome Blood Phoenix pirates sends shockwaves through the Antaran Isles and threatens the precarious stability that Ye-Yang is attempting to nurture. Plots hatch, things explode, and as the fate of the Isles hangs in the balance, the four must figure out what they truly mean to each other.</p>\n<p>One of the first things that struck me about <i>The Blood Phoenix</i> was how much it shifted from <i>Of Jade and Dragons</i>’ close-focus lens on Ying to a more macro view of political maneuvering and nation-level intrigue and how deftly it weaves in the perspectives of Nian, Ye-Yang, and Ye-Kan to do so. This is meant to be a young adults’ book, so Chen never gets too deep into the weeds on the sorts of geopolitical maneuvering taking place that you might see in something like <i>Game of Thrones</i> (George R.R. Martin) or <i>The Poppy War</i> (R.F. Kuang), but the scope of events feels suitably grand and well-plotted. We learn a lot more about the history of the Antaran Isles, as well as its ongoing issues with internal power struggles and external foes. It’s a tack I wasn’t initially expecting, but much like Chen’s subversion of tropes in the first book, it’s skillfully executed and enriches the story immensely and is helped along by the secondary cast of characters (many of whom are returning faces).</p>\n<p>The second thing I really enjoyed about <i>The Blood Phoenix</i> is Chen’s commitment to humanizing and grounding her characters with accurate representations of emotional health and the importance of social bonds. Ying, Nian, Ye-Yang, and Ye-Kan are all broken in some way by what they’ve been through up to this point, but their struggle to overcome the past and build something better is both inspiring and something many readers will be able to identify with. Additionally, even though their actions are an attempt to save an entire nation, Chen makes it clear that none of the characters can accomplish their desires on their own, and that relying on others is vital to success—a message that resonated deeply with me, particularly in our current times. Chen also does a fantastic job of keeping the romantic subplots simmering away just below the surface of the story throughout the entire book, occasionally erupting at key moments and never in predictable ways.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/book-review-the-blood-phoenix-by-amber-chen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>We’re honoured to share your story “You Knit Me Together in My Mother’s Womb” with our readers. Can you talk a bit about how this story took shape and what inspirations fed into it?</p>\n<p>This story started out as a “What if,” and I think I’ll answer several questions at the same time if I say this story came about after Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization (2022) overturned Roe v. Wade. At the time, I started wondering what new laws would be passed, what restrictions might be placed on reproductive rights, and what freedoms women would lose. I also wondered—and tried to figure out—how women in such a case might fight back. I gave Abby all the collective anger of my female friends and family, but also their fight. I gave her the anger I feel at the way this world treats my two daughters.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the story has also proved prophetic—we’re seeing the not-so-slow erosion of women’s rights, and I wonder what grand gesture will stop it.</p>\n<p>What about the background of this story called to you to write it, and in what way does your perspective as an author illuminate it? Between the depiction of the government as foolishly incompetent and the focus on hard, draining resistance, this is the most 2025 story I’ve read so far this year. How important do you think it is to tell stories like this in our new age of fascism?</p>\n<p>I think fantasy and science fiction have always been opposed to oppression. There’s always an evil man standing in a tower somewhere, a great all-seeing eye peering out at his domain, and there’s always a band of men (or hobbits) rising up to meet him. Or there are a hundred men clamoring for power after the king dies, carving up the country, fighting over the spoils. Or some dark rumor has made its way into the southern reaches of Mirkwood.</p>\n<p>So much of fantasy has been a look into the dark heart of humanity. How power corrupts. How greed and anger and desire always end up on fire, with people lying dead in the streets, carrion birds coming down out of a clear blue sky to peck out the eyes of the unliving.</p>\n<p>What I think is important is realizing fantasy isn’t fantasy. It isn’t even fiction, just a retelling of our world, with all its angers and fears and bad people, in the hopes that others will see the world the same way, and start to change it.</p>\n<p>There’s a lot layered in here, from the “if this goes on” speculation to the demonstration at the climax that for all its posturing, the government doesn’t really care about unborn children. Is there anything you placed in the story that you wanted to make sure readers took away from it?</p>\n<p>It’s hard for me to guess what readers will take away from a story. But your analysis is spot-on—I find it difficult to believe the government cares about children when it’s so difficult/expensive to get good childcare, good healthcare, and a good education without going into severe debt. When our schools are being shot up every day. When there are measles and tuberculosis outbreaks in several states because some people don’t believe in vaccines that have saved millions of lives.</p>\n<p>If we really wanted to incentivize parenthood, giving birth, raising children, etc., we’d provide more help for those trying to do it in a country that’s become affordable only for the affluent. Since we don’t do those things, I have to assume we don’t really care about the children.</p>\n<p>Is there anything you’re working on that you’d like to talk about? What can our readers look forward to seeing from you in the future?</p>\n<p>I write pop culture and personal essays on Substack, if any readers want to follow me there (<a href=\"https://substack.com/@paulcrenshaw\"> substack.com/@paulcrenshaw</a>). For fiction I’ve got a few more short stories in the works, and a fantasy novel set in a city with problems readers might see as familiar—a clash between the upper and lower classes, a clergy with as much power as the ruling council, and a citizenry on the verge of rebellion.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/author-spotlight-paul-crenshaw/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Bon Appétit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>Chicago has always been considered one of America’s greatest food cities—one where <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-hot-dogs-chicago?srsltid=AfmBOoqjwfWVMDjOtmJ2C-orpfeBA0VNpR8LajBT2w4DGaiJQtj-Y5Ub\">fully loaded hot dogs</a>, deep-dish pizza, and ultra luxe 18-course tasting menus are revered in the same dining scene. You could practically fill a travel itinerary with places to get Italian beef sandwiches (à la <i>The Bear</i>) alone. The city's restaurants, cafés, and bars reflect the diversity of Chicago's neighborhoods, and knowing where to stay is the key to having convenient access to the best spots.</p>\n<p>Here we break down some of the most commonly trafficked neighborhoods in the Windy City, and highlight where to stay so you can hit the must-visit eateries on your list.</p>\n<h2>The West Loop up through West Town</h2>\n<p>The West Loop was once an industrial zone and meatpacking district, but has transformed into a lively dining and nightlife hub. Restaurant Row on the main stretch of Randolph Street is filled with restaurants and bars that have taken over old warehouse spaces. The neighborhood's also conveniently located near Chicago’s west side via the CTA Blue Line (or a quick car ride), which is home to many of the neighborhoods, like Logan Square and Wicker Park, with the city’s greatest places to eat.</p>\n<p>Selecting the West Loop as your home base means you can grab chai and chili cheese toasties at <a href=\"https://www.swadesicafe.com/\">Swadesi</a> for brunch, indulge in chili-crisp laden claypot rice with pork belly at <a href=\"https://www.maxwellstrading.com/\">Maxwells Trading</a> for dinner, and end the night with a whiskey highball at Japanese bar <a href=\"https://barkumiko.com/\">Kumiko</a>. If you venture northwards, there’s the cult-followed <a href=\"https://www.kasamachicago.com/\">Kasama</a> for Filipino pastries and longanisa sausage breakfast sandwiches, <a href=\"https://www.lulacafe.com/\">Lula Café</a> for James Beard Award-winning brunch with impeccable hospitality, <a href=\"https://www.akahoshiramen.com/\">Akahoshi Ramen</a> (a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-new-restaurants-2024/\">Best New Restaurant of 2024</a>) for transcendent ramen, and <a href=\"https://www.feldrestaurant.com/\">Feld</a> for the freshest seasonal tasting menu in town.</p>\n<p>The first thing you’ll notice upon entering the Chicago Hoxton, which is just a stone's throw away from restaurants on Randolph Street and the Fulton Market District, is its stylish clientele. The hotel's vibrant energy draws a mix of locals and travelers, who meet up with friends or work remotely at the artfully-designed lobby's communal tables or coffee bar.</p>\n<p>The socializing flows into the dining spaces scattered throughout the building: Cabra, chef Stephanie Izard’s Peruvian rooftop spot, has bright ceviches and savory goat empanadas; Cira is a Mediterranean crowd-pleaser in the lobby; and Lazy Bird's basement lounge offers live music and cocktails. Plus, there’s a rooftop pool, a rarity in the neighborhood.</p>\n<p>The Hoxton has four options for rooms (Snug, Cosy, Cosy Up, and Roomy). None are palatial in size (the largest rooms are 300 square feet), but all are modern and stylish, with leather headboards, brass lighting, and retro-styled speakers.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Visited by Joseph Hernandez</i>\n    </p>\n<p>This 11-room, three-story property located in the former Historic Free Methodist Publishing House is private and low-key while still being in the center of it all in the West Loop. While the space is now a bed and breakfast, it has lived many lives—as the Walter Rudolph Casket Factory in the 1930s through 1950s and the Museum of Holography from 1976 to 2009. You can feel that historic charm in its current iteration, even after the hotel’s renovation in 2016. There’s original wood paneling and maple flooring, but the property now feels updated to suit a modern day traveler.</p>\n<p>Design varies with each room, which are named after Chicago literary figures, and the communal third-floor living room, meant for lingering, has a grand piano and double-sided fireplace. There’s also a wine bar, the Press Room, in the basement. Because of the property’s intimate size, it’s a great option for a buyout so a big group or wedding party can all stay together.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Visited by Joseph Hernandez</i>\n    </p>\n<h2>Down by the River</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/where-to-stay-food-lovers-chicago\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Previous measurements of solar flare temperatures were based on the temperature of electrons, and it was assumed that electrons and ions would have the same temperature. But using computer simulations to recalculate the temperature of solar flares with modern data, the researchers found that there could actually be important differences in the temperatures of the two particles that can last several minutes. In fact, solar flares could be as hot as 180 million degrees Fahrenheit.</p>\n    <p>The findings were published in the <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/adf74a#apjladf74as5\"> Astrophysical Journal Letters</a> on September 3.</p>\n    <p>The new work offers a “paradigm shift” in the understanding of flare spectral lines, according to a <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2025-09-solar-flares-hotter-previously-thought.html\">statement</a>. Since the 1970s, researchers have tried to find out why these dark or bright lines in what’s an otherwise uniform spectrum are broader than expected. One controversial hypothesis was that they occurred because of turbulent motions, but scientists have never been able to explain what caused that turbulence.</p>\n    <p>“The new ion temperature fits well with the width of flare spectral lines, potentially solving an astrophysics mystery that has stood for nearly half a century,” says <a href=\"https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics/people/ar51/\">Alexander Russell</a>, a physicist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland and the study’s lead researcher, in a statement.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://umdphysics.umd.edu/people/faculty/current/item/126-drake.html\">James Drake</a>, a physicist at the University of Maryland who was not involved in the work, tells Nell Greenfieldboyce at <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/05/nx-s1-5529330/solar-flares-even-hotter\">NPR</a> that he’s glad to see this new analysis. “We've been confronting the solar physicists,” says Drake, “telling them that even though they've measured in a lot of detail what's going on with the electrons, they're missing something big.”</p>\n    <p>The findings might also have important implications for objects like satellites and other spacecrafts. While the Earth’s magnetic field and atmosphere protect humans and animals from the effects of solar flares, the radiation from these events can <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/solar-storms-and-flares\">affect</a> satellites and pose a risk to astronauts. The events can also disrupt various communications, so understanding their true intensity can help researchers build better equipment in the future.</p>\n    <p>\"We're already busy on the next steps,\" Russell says to NPR. The team is now developing models of the effects hotter ions have on solar flares.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/solar-flares-may-be-more-than-six-times-hotter-than-researchers-previously-thought-finds-new-research-180987296/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Not that there was anything bad or gross in there, but it just needed to be smelling more like a spa. Am I right?</p>\n<p>So in this post I want to share with you how I whipped that whole situation into shape and how easy it was. Now, it’s smelling like the Mandarin Oriental and is totally dialed in, no matter what goes on in there.</p>\n<p>The thing is, I want to love every detail of my house. My life and work is so chatoic that when I’m at home I want to feel relaxed and zen and peaceful. So every.little.thing. matters. Right down to the <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/the-wooden-bathmat-of-your-dreams-say-goodbye-to-crusty-rugs/\">bathmat</a>.</p>\n<h2>How To Make Your Bathroom Smell Good</h2>\n<p>Let’s set up the foundation of the whole house first, and then let it carry over to the bathroom. You do this by making the best <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/homemade-cinnamon-spice-potpourri/\">homemade potpourri</a>. My stepmom taught me this and all you do is take a small pot, fill it with water, orange slices and cinnamon sticks and let it simmer.</p>\n<p>It’s easy, non-toxic and sets the best vibe throughout your whole house. A little better for winter/cozy weather but works all year around, really.</p>\n<p>We can’t forget about the actual toilet. <a href=\"https://bit.ly/480MvK0\">Poo~Pourri</a> should be in every single bathroom in the world.</p>\n<p>You basically just spritz it into the toilet bowl before-you-go. The spray is a pure blend of NATURAL ESSENTIAL OILS that creates a film on the surface of the water.</p>\n<p>The protective barrier traps the bad odors under the surface, before it ever begins! I MEAN!!! All you’ll smell is a refreshing bouquet of natural essential oils. I love preventative measure.</p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/non-toxic-candle-667x1000.jpg\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>This is my favorite brand of <a href=\"https://branchbasics.com/collections/all#starter-kits\">cleaning products</a> (use code SKINNY for 15% off) because they’re all natural and you need to make sure your bathroom is clean to make it smell good.</p>\n<p>The brand is family-owned and all their products are non-toxic. The family’s entire <a href=\"https://branchbasics.com/pages/our-story\">health journey</a> really interesting actually. They are living proof that switching to a clean, chemical-free lifestyle can do wonders for your health. Be sure to check out their products.</p>\n<p>Because always candles. However I think a lot of us know now that certain wicks from candles are full of nasty stuff, even if they say non-toxic. That’s why we made <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/candle?selling_plan=4150657117\">The Skinny Confidential candle</a> with a 100% cotton wick, pure soy wax and eucalyptus essential oil.

Fabric and plastic curtains can trap moisture and cause unpleasant odors. A fresh curtain instantly makes the space smell nice and look chic.</p>\n<p>Upgrade<strong> your toilet paper storage</strong>. Keep rolls in a lidded basket with a sachet of lavender or eucalyptus tucked inside. Every time you reach for a roll, the air will smell fresh.</p>\n<p><strong>Eliminate bad smells before they start.</strong> Wipe down walls and tiles weekly with a vinegar-water solution. Bathrooms hold on to hidden buildup that creates bad smells over time.</p>\n<p><strong>Add greenery.</strong> Plants like peace lilies and ferns naturally filter air and make your bathroom smell fresh while giving it that calming, home spa vibe.</p>\n<p><strong>Rotate scents seasonally. </strong>Think mint or citrus for summer, and cedar or vanilla for winter.

As ever, the invisible swikehead demon, Boy, crouched on her left shoulder. Neither mule nor demon had ever acknowledged the other’s existence.</p>\n<p>The Doge of Tuliax-by-the-Sea didn’t acknowledge their existence either—a mule was beneath his notice and Boy went to great pains to conceal himself from the thalassocracy’s devil-sniffers—but the old man was entirely too aware of Savannah’s. On this most recent visit, he had again attempted to recruit her to act as condottiere to a mercenary company he would fund, and she had again rejected his offer.</p>\n<p>Her time in the Company of Lucero had earned her a reputation as a scholarly type—thus her nom de guerre—as well as a profound distaste for working with others. Including the demon on her shoulder, something else she had earned during her time as a mercenary.</p>\n<p>“You should have slain him,” said Boy.</p>\n<p>“Who this time,” asked Savannah, only halfway paying attention to his hissing and spitting.</p>\n<p>“The old man, the one with the hat.”</p>\n<p>Every old man in every city-state on the peninsula wore a hat, but Savannah knew who the demon meant.</p>\n<p>“His guards would have descended from every direction if I’d even put hand to pommel,” she said, with a little heat in her words.</p>\n<p>“You should have slain them, as well. You should slay them all. You should rid this cursed peninsula and this whole cursed world of all humankind. This is why you have been chosen as my mount.”</p>\n<p>“Ah yes,” said Savannah, ignoring the word “mount” for the moment. “Your diabolical task, lain on you by the Dukes of Perfidy.”</p>\n<p>“Yes!” hissed Boy. “It is my unholy destiny to rule a blasted and fiery Earth!”</p>\n<p>“First we need to catch this apprentice,” said Savannah.</p>\n<p>The apprentice, runagate for three days now and fleeing the hangman for murdering his master, had enough florins on his head—attached or not—to see Savannah down the coast and away from the Doge’s center of power, with just enough left over to expand her small collection of books by a volume or two. Tuliax-by-the-Sea was a center of mercantile, not scholarly, activity, but there were a few printers and booksellers operating in the Old Town. She had her eye on one book of verse and one manual of swordsmanship, though her facility with her falchion was already considerable.</p>\n<p>“He is inland,” said Boy, confidently.</p>\n<p>Boy frequently expressed confidence that was ill-founded, but in this case, yes, that had been the direction the gate guards had seen the apprentice running and there were shepherd’s huts and hunting lodges aplenty in the heights, all of which would be empty this time of year. The boy wasn’t believed to be carrying anything in the way of a weapon, or even any food, which would make for an easy taking. There were some weeks when Savannah might have pitied the youngster and brought him in alive, but the murder he had committed had been particularly foul and left a young widow with a babe still nursing.</p>\n<p>And it wasn’t one of the weeks that Savannah was feeling pity.</p>\n<p>She clucked her tongue and Seldom took the gravel road leading west, up into the hills. In no time, the inland blowing breeze was cooling Savannah’s neck, and when they had navigated the first switchback, she looked down to see the sea, a brilliant blue beneath the sun. Tuliax was spread out before her in all its maze of streets and avenues, the Doge’s great palace on a manmade hillock near the docks. Savannah had never particularly liked the city-state, but she had to admit that, from a distance, it was lovely.</p>\n<p>They reached the top of the ridge line by mid-afternoon and came to a crossroads. The better-maintained gravel turned south, while shepherds’ tracks went north and west up into the hills. Savannah dismounted and had a look at the ground, though she was no tracker. There was an off chance the apprentice had left a trace she could discern.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/savannah-and-the-apprentice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The State of Michigan, 2094</p>\n<p><strong>Defense Attorney John Yurasov:</strong> Earlier you referred to this trial as a circus. Can you explain what you meant?</p>\n<p><strong>Defendant Michaela Xiao:</strong> I don’t mean it was corrupt. Though that’s very possible. I just mean that the conclusion was always foregone. You try a mass murderer in a lethal injection state, don’t be surprised when she’s sentenced to death by lethal injection.</p>\n<p><strong>Attorney for the Prosecution, Loren Mirvis (LM):</strong> Objection. Defendant is impugning the validity of the court.</p>\n<p><strong>Judge Emily Mandel:</strong> The trial’s over. The jury’s been excused. Nearly every bit of evidence was either hearsay or inadmissible. What we’ve all agreed to do right now is record a dying woman’s last words. I’ll allow it. What do you want to tell us, Ms. Xiao?</p>\n<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> It’s about Dream Collective.</p>\n<p><strong>Judge</strong>: I gathered.</p>\n<p><strong>Yurasov:</strong> Start with how it works.</p>\n<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> Sure. Say you have a flying dream. Those are so rare and great. Everyone wants flying dreams. I invented the technology that turns discrete dreams into uploadable files.</p>\n<p><strong>LM:</strong> Objection. We’ve established that the defendant’s work for Dream Collective is proprietary.</p>\n<p><strong>Judge:</strong> Council, this is a closed room comprised of four people sworn to secrecy. Because of your arguments, this testimony will be sealed for twenty years. You won. Have your beer. Let her have her say. To be honest, I’m starting to agree with the defense—maybe you really are on the payroll. Continue, Ms. Xiao.</p>\n<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> The technology’s what we call unidirectional—once we encode the dreams, they cease to exist within the dreamer. In other words, your flying dream’s gone. Not only that, you’ll never dream of flying again. The technology and its results call into question the nature of this reality—are we simulacrums? But that’s a question for another day.</p>\n<p><strong>Yurasov:</strong> Is it bad for the dreamer to lose their dreams?</p>\n<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> We didn’t think so. Dreamers tended to compensate. Instead of flying, they walked on water or swung through trees. We planned to study the phenomenon in clinical trials.</p>\n<p><strong>Yurasov:</strong> What happens to the customers who purchase the dreams?</p>\n<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> Supposedly, they get a rush. I’ve never tried it. There’s something about dreaming, especially good dreams, that heighten intelligence. In tests, Dream Tourist IQs increased ten to twenty points.</p>\n<p><strong>Yurasov:</strong> And this was in the ongoing clinical trial. You were gathering data for federal approval. Tell us what safeguards you implemented.</p>\n<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> Dream donators—we called them Dreamers—weren’t allowed to sell more than three dreams through the course of the study. We were supposed to follow up on their cognition and well-being. There were no rules for the customers who bought those dreams. We called them Dream Tourists.</p>\n<p><strong>Yurasov:</strong> Did you enjoy your work?</p>\n<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> I did. I loved it. The math was so elegant. I felt good about having created something. I’m socially awkward, obviously. People who look like me don’t go out a lot . . . I’d never had a purpose before.</p>\n<p>My partner found investors and an old medical school for the study. Because of the nature of it, I worked nights. The Dreamers slept in rows of cots. There were usually about thirty of them, hooked up to visual monitors. The Dream Tourists viewed these from a rounded observation deck. I think it was a formal surgical amphitheater. They bid on what they wanted. I didn’t notice the money stuff or anything practical. I was busy encoding.</p>\n<p><strong>Yurasov:</strong> Go on.</p>\n<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> The volunteers were supposed to be retirees and college kids. That’s what the brochures said. People who needed a little extra cash. Nobody we were taking advantage of.</p>\n<p>One night coming off my shift, I was disoriented. Coding is exhausting. I wound up in a basement hallway. All those people, those Dreamers who’d sold their dreams, they were there . . .</p>\n<p>Dreamers are supposed to get rides home after donations. It’s policy. They’re expected to be woozy. They might even sleep all day.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/the-dream-tourists/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><strong>Mindscape</strong><br/>\nAndrea Hairston<br/>\nHardcover/Ebook<br/>\nISBN: 9781250808769<br/>\nTor Books, August 5 2025, 448 pgs</p>\n<p>Sometime in the near future, an impenetrable Barrier appears on Earth, isolating the planet from space and dividing the land into Zones. The sudden instability and interruption of international trade and cultural exchange plunges humanity into (further) conflict, deprivation, and inequality; however, it also gives rise to new social systems and classes. Vermittlers navigate through the Barrier at will, entertainers take acting to new death-defying heights and propagandic lows, and healers do what you’d expect with a psychedelic twist while meddling in the fraught social politics of this world. When joined by military officers, ambassadors, and scientists, the Barrier-bound world faces even more conflict than usual, despite attempts to preserve an interZone treaty—or destroy it, depending on who you talk to.</p>\n<p>This book is not an easy read. I lost count of how many times I had to stop, peer at a paragraph, and say to myself, “Okay, what’s going on <i>now</i>?” It’s military science fiction without big battle scenes. It’s spiritual and metaphysical without relying on simplistic ideas of good and evil. It’s political without giving the reader an obvious hero to root for. There were aliens—but wait, were there? It’s challenging and futuristic, wildly imaginative, and even romantic at times. There are a lot of characters, a lot of smaller stories-within-the-story, and a strong sense of action on a massive scale.</p>\n<p>But, despite the fact that I had to make a flowchart to keep track of all the political machinations going on here and flip back and forth to the Cast of Characters listed in the front of the book constantly, I really enjoyed this. In fact, I enjoyed it <i>because</i> of those things. <i>Mindscape</i> is Andrea Hairston’s debut novel, originally published in 2006 and nominated for the Philip K Dick Award the following year. I’m glad it’s been reissued this year because not enough people are writing like this now. <i>Mindscape</i> is unique and challenging, using its fragmented acid-trippy world to explore themes of race, class, culture, gender, and morality, among others. Multilingualism is standard in the Barrier world, so the text contains untranslated bits of German and Yoruba strewn through it like seasoning. Certain scenes and characters really push the envelope unapologetically, not as an attempt to shock, but to genuinely use the story to think through the ways different personalities react to crisis and conflict. There’s a strong sense of imagination throughout the book that veers pretty far out at times, but it’s all grounded in strong science and a deep understanding of social systems.</p>\n<p>That said, despite being nearly twenty-five years old, there are parts of this book that are harder to read now because of how prescient they seem. While the Zone divisions caused by the Barrier are forced, there’s something sobering about the thought of a world speedrunning towards self-destruction because it has become so strongly defined by cultural, economic, and geographical separation. Despite the presence of flying dolphins and blue-haired medusan healers, the most jarring thing about this book is the way that interactions between Zones are controlled by powerful, squabbling factions that are mostly concerned with their own power. There’s really only one character in this book who seems to genuinely care about regular, everyday people, many of whom are suffering, none of whom are involved in the politics. I wonder now if that’s intentional.</p>\n<p>You have to have your brain turned all the way on to get into this book, and you may have to let a little smoke come out of your ears before you really understand it all. Hairston assumes her readers are all just as smart as she is and expects us to catch up and catch on while she charges full speed ahead into the world and its story. I’d call it a wild ride, but no ride goes so many places, twists and turns so sharply, and drags so many real-world references behind it. It really does live up to the title. This novel is a mindscape, an unfolding of perception on several different levels of reality used to explore and diagnose an ailing world.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/book-review-mindscape-by-andrea-hairston/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I wanted to write a story where the dad didn’t disappear but perhaps was neglectful of his family in other ways. He gets the milk, but is that the point?</p>\n    <p>This is such a fun story to read. What made you keep this in the form of a flash piece, and would you consider expanding it?</p>\n    <p>I probably wouldn’t. I’m usually able to tell how long a piece is, and I think this one benefits the most from being bite-sized.</p>\n    <p>Was there any kind of play with metaphors here? And if so, how did you arrive at them, and what kind of meaning do they have for you?</p>\n    <p>Intentional? Unlikely. Subconsciously? I think I’m usually doing something I realize much later. I usually like leaving things like metaphors open-ended, because I think what each reader takes out of things is very different.</p>\n    <p>What made this particular ending the best place to land?</p>\n    <p>I think I played with this part a bit. What was missing from the first part was that I wanted an ending that held space for everyone. So I went through the story and thought about what kind of adventure was important to each person. Putting these together made the most resonant ending.</p>\n    <p>Is there a project you are currently working on? And, if not, are there any themes, objects, or news that might be tickling your fingers?</p>\n    <p>I have a novel I’m working on! It’s very on and off. When it’s on, I devote my free time to it.

He could break if I said no.</p>\n<p>“Sure?”</p>\n<p>He grinned and handed me a glass sword covered in flames. “Don’t worry, this is all you need.”</p>\n<p>We went through the portal, and the giant people welcomed us with a chant. We were in the ring, breath to breath with our competitors; there was no time to think. I donned a layer of protective armor that consisted of a helmet larger than my head and chainmail that fell to my knees. I swung headfirst and closed my eyes.</p>\n<p>It all ended in twenty seconds because my phone rang. Mum was calling, and Dad saw her face on the line and started to sweat.

    "body": "<p>The buffet was infinite.</p>\n<p>It existed in a pocket dimension, via some sort of technological jiggering of the sort that you have heard about before and, unless you are totally anal, don’t want to hear about now. You could probably summon an explanation that sounded very much like it in your sleep. You’d be wrong, because it was more subtle and frankly more beautiful than that, but if we did go into it, using entire volumes of physics and all the preferred phrases like non-Euclidian and quantum tunneling and so forth, we’d be at it for hours and still arrive at the place we are now. So let’s not. It was a pocket universe. It was arcane and advanced, and the portal to its wonderments revealed the starting end of a feast of delicacies ranging from the commonplace to the profoundly alien, created on Garster’s request and extending from Garster’s vantage point on our surly plane to some locale beyond the infinite. All he would have to do is step through the membrane at the threshold, a wisp of near-nothingness that processed like a bead curtain, and he’d be free to dig in.</p>\n<p>Garster could only wonder if even everything the buffet offered could ever be enough to satisfy him.</p>\n<p>It was a reasonable worry.</p>\n<p>He was, after all, by precise definition, a pig.</p>\n<p>This requires modulation, lest objections arise from those defensive about derogatory animal-kingdom metaphors. There are genuine pig-lovers out there. So let’s clarify. No, he was not literally a pig, not any form of the species, neither terrestrial nor any of the off-world variants. Nor was he what the word otherwise conjures in popular vernacular: a fat human being. Make no mistake. He was actually quite fit, with a fine compliment of lean tissue and muscle tone, thanks in large part to hideously expensive bodily regulators that sat beneath his velvet skin and ramped his metabolism to superhuman heights whenever he needed to get rid of a thousand excess calories that otherwise would have put his personal supply of chins well into the realm of the multiple. He looked, <i>looked</i>, like he worked out. He had the face and the physique of a Greek hero, jacked abs, a washboard abdomen, and a spit curl like the mythic Kal-El’s, all because his personal supply of wealth was effectively as vast as the supply of entries arrayed beyond the portal, and he could have anything he wanted, including this physical ideal he had not earned.</p>\n<p>Many were the potential lovers, some with impeccable pedigrees, who had been trucked in at great expense and fallen in lust with him at first sight and had bedded him under the misapprehension that a man as magnificent as he had to be as noble as he appeared; and many were those who, having been sullied but not satisfied, staggered away with full knowledge of his vileness and a deep hankering for mouthwash and induced amnesia. He was, again, they’d learned, what we’ve called him: a <i>pig</i>, a wallower in filth, a consumer of resources, a bottomless well of hunger for more than any reasonable human being could need, and then more than that—a <i>pig</i>, repellent in his every impulse, in a way that is also sometimes termed a <i>swine</i>, again with no relation to the animal. And here he was, a Hercules, with features that would have shamed Douglas Fairbanks, Errol Flynn, Gregory Peck, Robert Redford, Brad Pitt, and Chris Hemsworth: an apparent hero by dint of being able to pay for that chin, those biceps, and that Charles Atlas physicality. A toad in character. Please trust me enough to refrain from requiring an apologia on behalf of toads.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/feast-of-famine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Twice a year, the usually calm Via Bergognone in Milan shuts down due to excited fashion week crowds descending on Teatro Armani. Home to the Giorgio Armani headquarters since 2000, the sprawling space includes a purpose-built theatre where each show season a catwalk is constructed.</p>\n    <p>On Friday, crowds again began to gather outside, but this time the mood was much more sombre. They had come to pay their final respects to the visionary Italian fashion designer Giorgio Armani, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/04/giorgio-armani-elegant-determined-a-little-unknowable\">who died on Thursday</a> at the age of 91.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/04/giorgio-armani-celebrated-italian-fashion-designer-dies-at-91\">Announcing his death</a>, the fashion company said it would set up a funeral chamber at its headquarters, giving people an opportunity to view the casket and pay their respects from Saturday to Sunday. Following Armani’s wishes, the funeral on Monday will remain private. With barriers now being erected along the street, long queues are expected to form.</p>\n    <p>Armani was affectionately referred to as the “king” or “maestro” of Italian fashion. His journey from humble beginnings in wartime Piacenza to global fashion icon was deeply admired. From fashion to beauty to hotels, restaurants and even chocolates, he leaves behind an empire rumoured to be worth more than £9bn.</p>\n    <p>Beatrice Manca, a freelance fashion journalist based in Milan, plans to visit the chamber on Saturday. “Armani was more than a fashion designer in Italy; he was a source of national pride,” she says.</p>\n    <p>Paola Locati, an independent fashion communication consultant, will also attend. “It strikes me to think that as of tomorrow, Mr Armani will be for the last time just a short distance away. I will go and say a final goodbye, I am sure there will be lots of people, because he was loved and admired by the general public, his creations the aspiration for many, two friends of mine got married in his suits. A true master has left us, and he will be sorely missed.”</p>\n    <p>The mayor of Milan, Giuseppe Sala, has declared Monday a day of national mourning. In a statement Sala said Armani “was and will always be one of the greatest representatives of Italian and Milanese fashion in the world”, adding: “Milan will miss his creative vision, his active participation, and his support for the life of our city.”</p>\n    <p>Armani stores in Milan have closed and are expected to remain shuttered until after the funeral. Stores in London will close at 2pm on Monday. On YouTube, channels including CNN have set up live streams from outside the headquarters.</p>\n    <p>Manca says his death “has affected even those who did not love or follow fashion”. She expects larges queues at the chamber. “Many of whom may never have seen a fashion show. Everyone dreamed of being part of the dignified, industrious, and sophisticated world created by Giorgio Armani.”</p>\n    <p>Although Armani had been absent from his last three fashion shows owing to illness, he had been expected to attend the brand’s 50th anniversary show, which closes Milan fashion week later this month. He was also due to attend the opening of a retrospective at the Pinacoteca di Brera. Featuring more than 150 archive looks, it is the first time the museum has hosted a fashion exhibition and the first dedicated to a designer. Both events are still expected to go ahead.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/05/crowds-gather-giorgio-armani-milan-hq-pay-respects-before-funeral\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In Vietnamese restaurants, servers wander around taking partially melted ice blocks out of your glass and replacing them with new ones. Of course, this is fine with low-cost options such as 333, Bia Saigon and even Tiger. The beer stays cold, and in any case it is drunk rather quickly with little chance of any meaningful dilution.

    "body": "<p><i>this</i>week.</p>\n<p>We’ve a lot of little offerings today, happy-hunters. This week, we gave our ears to scathing gossips and baritone outlaws. Like Warren Zevon, we enjoyed <i>every</i> sandwich, snacking heartily from coast to coast. We applauded spectacles and big swings, and some of us even celebrated personal milestones. It was a good, big week at Lit Hub.</p>\n<p><strong>Calvin Kasulke</strong> enjoyed an audiobook—Gore Vidal’s second memoir, <i> Point to Point Navigation.</i> Vidal narrated the book himself, and “does so many impressions…including an uncanny Truman Capote, Tennessee Williams, and Eudora Welty.” The famous wit adds a lot to a story that’s partly an earnest tango with grief, and partly an act of gossip. Vidal’s determined to “get the last word in on the friends and rivals he’s outlived.”</p>\n<p><strong>Molly Odintz’s</strong> nice thing of the week is <i>also</i> auditory. She’s geeking out about a new podcast charting the brief and wondrous life of Chalino Sanchez, famous Mexican-American crooner. <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/%C3%ADdolo-the-ballad-of-chalino-s%C3%A1nchez/id1606258773\">Ídolo</a>, from Futuro Media, explores Sanchez’s origins, rise, and violent end. “I’ve been listening to it in English and Spanish and also listening to a lot of Chalino’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAG-2h8A7hY\">most iconic  corridos</a>. His life was so fucking epic.”</p>\n<p>And in other charismatic frontman news, <strong>Jonny Diamond</strong> calls out <a href=\"https://partisanrecords.com/artists/cameron-winter?srsltid=AfmBOopNPHT_E2mL6W_BNJT-u9XADKCC1bIUWcXZI6tL17rQhlI5IE6r\">the latest Cameron Winter record</a>. This perfect “early fall soundtrack” from the <a href=\"https://geeseband.com/\">Geese</a> frontman “is like if David Berman, Nick Cave, and Vic Chesnutt got trapped in a bar during a blizzard.” (I cosign Winter’s ways; listen up!)</p>\n<p><strong>Oliver Scialdone </strong>has a complex relationship with this <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/132/9781799502050\"> Poison Ivy series.</a> The first week of the month brings fresh editions of our community editor’s </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison_Ivy_(2022_comic_book)\">“favorite psychedelic superhero body horror comic”</a>—though recent issues have been disappointing.</p>\n<p>Alas, the thing about being a true fan is, <i>no quitters allowed</i>. As Oliver says, “if I stop reading I won’t know what happens next!!!”</p>\n<p><strong>Drew Broussard</strong> saw some “truly spectacular” theatre last weekend. <i> John Proctor is the Villain, </i>a new Broadway show, “is one of the best plays” our podcasts editor has ever seen. This heart-forward look at a cusp-#MeToo moment playing out in a Southern high school is soon to close on the Great White Way, but is hopefully coming to a regional theatre near you. “I encourage everybody to just go see it,” says Drew. “It’s an important play, but also a GOOD play.”</p>\n<p>Drew <i>also</i> saw the Shakespeare in the Park production of <a href=\"https://publictheater.org/free-shakespeare-in-the-park/\"> Twelfth Night</a>, “which was more or less exactly what a Park production ought to be: fleet, fun, lavish, joyful, and occasionally even profound (but mostly just fun).”</p>\n<p>I, <strong>Brittany Allen</strong>, also cheered goodness. This week I took heart in an act of collective whimsy, and a whimsical leader’s call to collective action. News of <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/pursuit-scavenger-hunt-san-francisco/\">this city-wide scavenger hunt that took San Francisco by storm</a> had me grinning all yesterday. And all week I’ve been inspired and moved by <a href=\"https://www.democracynow.org/2025/9/1/ms_rachel_on_her_gaza_advocacy\">Ms. Rachel’s speaking out on the genocide in Gaza</a>.</p>\n<p>The children’s performer and earworm factory behind your local toddler has been following in Fred Rogers footsteps when it comes to true child advocacy, and that’s cause for a kind of uplift. She speaks the truth plainly, and as it should be: “Deep care for children doesn’t stop at any border.”</p>\n<p><strong>McKayla Coyle</strong> visited their little brother in Portland this week, and went to many great restaurants. A favorite was <a href=\"https://topburmese.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqyb1wkDB3asyNxQGliiGy4Luyr68p8I2PX5UsKJ6E3but-4iOM\">Top Burmese</a>. “I’ve never had Burmese food before, but the chicken curry was maybe one of the best meals I’ve ever had,” says our favorite publishing coordinator. “We sat outside, but apparently if you sit inside at the restaurant they have a little robot who brings you your food! Would go back to Portland just to order more curry <i>from that robot</i>.”</p>\n<p>And to those of you who’ve been waiting breathlessly for updates of <strong>James Folta’s</strong> cheese quest, brace for more bracing. Because our staffer was “thwarted by a lack of kitchen time this weekend,” <a href=\"https://lithub.com/258968-aug29/\">last week’s promised quesadilla</a> must stay “TBB (to be baked) for now!”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/heres-everything-thats-making-us-happy-this-week-sep5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

This month we’re traveling back in time to the birth of an island nation on the verge of creating itself in a clash of old gods and new ideas, a tumultuous struggle for love and self in a world of hard choices and harder truths, and the fire that burns beneath the skin of all those wronged by pain, loss, and grief—that’s right, it’s <i>When They Burned the Butterfly</i>, by Wen-Yi Lee.</p>\n<p><i>When They Burned the Butterfly</i> takes place in 1970s Singapore, in the midst of the turmoil of the island nation’s reinvention of itself, and it follows the life of Adeline Siow, a bored sixteen-year-old schoolgirl who feels like she doesn’t quite fit in with her mother’s plans for her future. Adeline has a gift: the ability to manifest fire. One she shares with her mother, but rather than encourage her, Adeline’s mother seems to do everything in her power to hide their abilities—preferring instead to focus on running a successful clothing shop, leaving Adeline feeling unmoored and adrift.</p>\n<p>That’s where my recap of the plot is going to end, because very quickly Things Happen, and then all of a sudden it’s magic battles here, gangsters there, forbidden love, and emotional drama popping up like a persistent gopher, and through it all, Adeline burns away piece after piece of what she thought was her life in order to find her true self, but all fires need fuel, and sometimes the cost of that fuel is high.</p>\n<p>The thing that first struck me about <i>When They Burned the Butterfly</i> was Wen-Yi Lee’s haunting and evocative prose (which, unlike my own, if you’re a regular reader of this column, does <i>not</i> trend towards run-on sentences). The writing in this book is both sparse, yet richly laden with meaning. There were multiple times where I read a section and had to pause for a moment just to wrap my head around the multitude of ideas that casually unfurled like a flower bud opening up. Wen-Yi Lee does an amazing job transporting the reader back to Singapore’s birth as a modern nation (with all the chaos and change that implies), while at the same time building a world so rich and lived-in that it was easy for me to imagine myself walking down the streets of something old giving way to something new, nearly bursting at the seams as it does so. The trick of giving a reader an all-access pass to multiple characters’ inner thoughts while still keeping everything feeling zoomed in tight and personal is not an easy one to pull off, but Wen-Yi Lee makes it look almost too easy (and no, I’m not jealous as a writer, you’re jealous).</p>\n<p>The second thing I really liked about <i>When They Burned the Butterfly</i> is how much emotion and feeling waits within its pages, ready to burst out when the reader least expects it. Adeline’s journey, and the people she meets, is a rollercoaster of ups and downs, of love found and lost, of grief and revenge and hope and despair, and her transformation from who she was at the start of the book to who she becomes felt earned every step of the way. I do have to warn you that the book does have some intense scenes of violence and loss, though none felt cheap or there for shock value, but <i>When They Burned the Butterfly</i> is not afraid to punch you in the mouth with a reminder that human beings can be extremely vicious creatures to one another. However, Wen-Yi Lee is also quick to remind us that that same capacity for violence is also capable of endless love, of forging bonds of family with people who had been strangers just the day before, and that all of us are more complex than who we appear to be at first glance.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/book-review-when-they-burned-the-butterfly-by-wen-yi-lee/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>What inspired you to create the dystopian world of the seven corporations?</p>\n<p>For this piece I started out with two clear things: the title and the image of Zan’s father being this sort of harbinger of doom. The title being clear was a rarity; that’s almost always one of the last elements I solidify. Between that and my frustrations at healthcare woes, rent increases, and just trying to survive under capitalism, the rest of “Seven Obelisks” unfurled.</p>\n<p>The corporate structure of this story is absolutely inspired by cyberpunk as a genre overall as well as my own queer disabled American experiences beholden to a healthcare company, always praying I won’t go into debt over medical bills. It’s not the most unique element, but cyberpunk has always called to me because of its anticapitalism components. And often its transhumanism ones, but that features less in this story. I think dystopian stories that call out power imbalances are very, very important. Also, I just wanted to experience some catharsis over two queer people connecting in spite of everything and also changing things. It’s not quite that simple in actuality, but sometimes in fiction it’s nice that it can be that simple.</p>\n<p>One aspect of the story that I found fascinating was Zan’s ability to create “glass-rendered constructs” that influence a person’s sense of reality. How did you develop this idea? Why did you end up using glass as a material?</p>\n<p>I was inspired by the visual of it rather than the logistics—I have no clue if we could actually make glass-rendered anything, though that would be neat. Science, please fulfill my dreams. But it was the image of glass and beautiful structures essentially being paywalled that clicked for me as a good and immediate cue about the power structure in the story. Plus, some of the visual elements especially at the end, with the glass office, were just cool! The fragility and slightly archaic but high-tech combination spoke to me.</p>\n<p>Also, I’ve been longing for the late 90s/early 00s see-through tech and by those powers combined: glass-rendered constructs! I love SFF because I can play around with what is real and what isn’t. That factors in as well.</p>\n<p>As a reader, I found the way the story gave me small moments of worldbuilding while keeping the focus on Zan’s mission to be really effective at building up intrigue throughout the story. Do you have a process for deciding when you want to introduce new ideas/world building in your stories?</p>\n<p>Thank you! This is one of the biggest compliments I could receive because I often struggle with worldbuilding in short fiction! Which is to say I overdo it on the worldbuilding, so it often feels like I’ve stuffed a novel setting into a short piece. It’s the most common piece of feedback I receive. For “Seven Obelisks” in particular I wrote three separate versions and angsted over the pacing and exposition for months. Shoutout to the folks who beta read all three versions for me. Ultimately, it was this third version that made it. It’s a blend of the worldbuilding rich exposition of the first version and the more cinematic heist-y elements that focus on Zan and Luciana of the second.

    "body": "<p>One time at a convention I ran across the Man of Flowers, the Superman of Daffodils, a long-haired guy, indestructible (of course), who slept in his car and drank a lot of cough syrup and didn’t really fight crime, unless the crimes were happening pretty close by. He was old by then, maybe fifty years old, but with stubble and green eyes and that ageless Tom Petty So-Cal face, and we’d gotten used to the idea that this particular ubermensch was more super-hero vibe than actuality.</p>\n<p>The convention was unpopular, as always, lots of protesters on the street—anti-capitalists in black masks holding up signs, just the usual mishmash, trans rights, Palestine, NAFTA, stop vaccinating, whatever. And inside everyone was on edge—we sat on floating platforms talking past each other, wondering how we’d lost the mandate of heaven. How do we convince these kids outside that we really are doing shit, that we’re really out here every day protecting them from extragalactic threats and stuff that’ll destroy humanity, and that all their ticky-tacky human concerns are way below our pay grade?</p>\n<p>And the Man of Flowers, as usual, dropped some perspective on us: “Why bother?” he said. “They can’t do shit to us. Let them protest.”</p>\n<p>He was obviously correct. We were superheroes. They were nothing-burgers, worm-food, normal, mundanes—worthwhile because all human beings are worthwhile, but otherwise not worth a lot. His point was inarguable, so nobody argued with it; instead, people just ignored him—all the geniuses and strongmen and robots just kept mishmashing their mouths, complaining—whining, really—about how they were so misunderstood and how they needed better PR and the climate had gotten so hostile out there for supers.</p>\n<p>Afterward, I found the Man of Flowers in a corner of the convention, sitting by himself, and I said, “I thought you were totally right. I mean, yeah, if I was one of these kids I’d be protesting too. They’re like, why can’t you fix world hunger and shit? From their point of view, it makes perfect sense. They don’t get that this life they’ve got, this life that they hate, could be like a billion times worse—that they could be burning alive in the Maw of some Planet Devourer right now. They don’t get it. And that’s fine. We don’t need them to get it.”</p>\n<p>The Man of Flowers smiled and said, “Hey, what’s your name? I haven’t seen you around.”</p>\n<p>We did introductions, and I sat down with him. We took coffee, and we chatted for a little while, complaining about the other superheroes, the way you do. We were in a far corner of a pretty nice hotel, ensconced in some couches and pillows, sort of screened off from the rest of them, but we could feel the psychic energy as the supers out there got more and more worked up.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Man of Flowers said, “You know the crazy thing? The crazy thing is obviously we could do it. I could stand on the seashore and vaporize seawater with my laser eyes all day long and use the steam to spin big turbines and generate lots of fresh water and electricity, and with that we could make the desert bloom. You could go around punching hurricanes and tornadoes all day long, putting the weather to rights. We could get together, divide up the responsibilities—assign the Spark to deliver meals to the hungry, and the Mason to build houses for the homeless. It’d be work—but we could do it—we could probably materially improve peoples’ lives, if we were willing to really work, day-in-day-out. Just fucking grind away at it, you know? Just wake up, go out to the beach and instead of laying in the sun, just turn on my laser vision and boop, vaporize water, all day, every fucking day. We could do it.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah,” I said.</p>\n<p>“And everybody here knows it,” he said. “We all know it. We could do it. We could go out there, improve everybody’s life, if we wanted to. It’d be a fucking grind, but we could do it.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/anti-capitalism-vs-the-man-of-flowers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Zan held their breath as they re-read it until they were sure their credentials were correct.</p>\n<p><i>Congratulations, Sweeper R-C00543, Z. Ortega-Lyons, you’ve won one (1) ticket to the Third Quarter Celebration as a special Re-Collect guest! Join the Seven Corporations to revel in profits</i>.</p>\n<p>“You know how rare it is for one of us to go to a quarterly party?”</p>\n<p>Zan tried to appear baffled as they shrugged. “Just lucky I guess.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, sure. Probably cheated somehow using one of your glass-render tricks.”</p>\n<p>“I’d never risk my rank and standing with Re-Collect,” they said.</p>\n<p>This wasn’t a lie. They needed to look like a legitimate, obedient worker, and Zan regretted incurring his animosity in the process. He was a kind supervisor, and funny. In another reality, he could’ve been a friend. But what Zan intended to do, after months of constructing and failing and redesigning after the long Sweep hours, would ruin any pretense of camaraderie if he found out—which he wouldn’t.</p>\n<p>Not unless Zan was discovered at the party. Not unless they got caught.</p>\n<p>An alarm blared and both Zan and their supervisor tapped the glass panel stitched to their uniforms. The glass interfaced with their vision and hearing. Instruction text hovered, perfectly centered, as the text to speech intoned, <i>Rival building abandoned in Sector One. Sweep immediately. Prioritize: data chips, upper management offices. Free-for-all: non-tagged valuables such as abandoned credits, desk decor, non-priority data</i>.</p>\n<p>These were the usual rules Zan lived by day-to-day. It wasn’t enough credits to survive on, which was the point. Never get too comfortable.</p>\n<p>“Whatever, let’s go. I’ll up my rank by kicking you out a hundredth floor window,” their supervisor muttered as he stomped away.</p>\n<p>Zan watched as he walked right through their father’s ghost, the image swirling like smoke before reconfiguring. Their father unsettled them, but they no longer flinched. He was dead, that was the point. He was a glass-rendered construct only Zan could see. He wasn’t real, he wasn’t. This was the plan Zan and L designed.</p>\n<p>As Zan prepped to jump into yet another building to steal more pointless data for a corporation they despised, the thought of L made the weariness ease and their impatience heighten all at once. Knowing they’d finally see her at the end helped get through the exhaustion of another ten-hour shift.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow night. Only one more shift until Zan and L used the construct wearing their father’s image to break this all down.</p>\n<p>• • • •</p>\n<p>When Zan was five, Plenti, Inc., claimed their father wasn’t exposed to anything unusual on a Sweep. Their father’s report on being forced to clear out a biohazardous building went missing. He was fired and denied assistance.</p>\n<p>Other corporations refused to hire him, each move to one of the seven sectors more desperate than the last. Even though Zan and their mother had medical coverage, their father didn’t. Coverage was based on age and individual occupation. Unemployable for daring to report a corporate secret that affected his health, their father tried his best to downplay his symptoms and focus on Zan. Every little occasion was a major celebration, until he could barely walk anymore.</p>\n<p>He died a year later. Zan never forgot. The older they got, the more the story repeated for others around them. Over and over as every manager congratulated shareholders for record profits.</p>\n<p>• • • •</p>\n<p>When the Sweep ended, they were finally allowed five hours rest time. Their apartment door screeched shut, snagging on a rusted bit of metal Zan couldn’t afford to repair. It didn’t matter; they hardly noticed the sound anymore.</p>\n<p>Dim, yellow light flickered to life, highlighting the emptiness of the small space, the water-stained ceiling, the threadbare rugs they threw over the decaying underbelly of their life.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/to-access-seven-obelisks-press-enter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><strong>Not Your Papi’s Utopia: Latinx Visions of Radical Hope</strong><br/>\nMatthew David Goodwin, Alex Hernandez, Sara Rivera, eds.<br/>\nPaperback<br/>\nISBN: 9781957840352<br/>\nMouthfeel Press, December 2024, 306 pgs</p>\n<p>You need to read this book.</p>\n<p>Okay, I’m getting ahead of myself. But if you remember one thing from this review, I want it to be that single line: You need to read this book.</p>\n<p>As I’ve done from time to time, I’m getting to this book a bit late. In my defense, I initially wrote down an incorrect publication date when I started reading; also, I only found out about it quite late. All the same, I see <i>Not Your Papi’s Utopia</i> as an important book, and I doubt that many people reading this column have heard of the press or seen the title. I believe reviewing a title dating all the way back to last December is not only forgivable, but also essential.</p>\n<p>Mouthfeel “is a Latinx, woman-owned press,” founded in El Paso, Texas, in 2009, “with the goal of publishing new and established poets from the U.S.-Mexico borderlands, writing in English and Spanish.” As happens, the remit has expanded a bit, and according to their site, they’ve published over sixty books of poetry. They’ve also published a few fiction titles, but it looks like they haven’t published a book quite like <i>Not Your Papi’s Utopia</i> before. I really hope they do more in this vein, and I’d be eager to read them.</p>\n<p><i>Not Your Papi’s Utopia</i> brings together a wonderful assortment of original stories and poetry, plus a handful of illustrations by Luis Valderas. There are a few names here that folks who love speculative fiction may recognize, such as <i>Night Beast</i> author, Ruth Joffre, and <i>Sordidez</i> author, E.G. Condé; folks like Gabriela Santiago and Rodrigo Culagovski, whose work has popped up in various SFF magazines; and more. There are also a number of authors whose names many SFF readers probably won’t recognize, which I see as a strength of high-quality anthologies, something I’ve mentioned in a few other reviews: Bringing different authors to different readerships benefits everyone. All told, the publisher’s page lists twenty-five authors.</p>\n<p>The book is separated into three sections: The Utopian Question, The Utopian Odyssey, and The Utopian Enclave. I’ll discuss a handful of entries and leave the rest for your discovery. I think that for this subject, more than for some, it’s important to know that as a reviewer, I am less interested in certain questions that some reviewers and critics would find paramount, especially when it comes to the topic of “Utopia.” Many reviewers would consider what they see as “classical” science fiction stories and compare the overall book to those works, as well as render judgment on how well the individual stories speak to the titles of the sections they are in. My reviews are more for people who want to know, simply, “Are these kick-ass stories? Will I enjoy reading them?” And, for the <i>many</i> readers out there who feel that those classical texts don’t represent them at all, “Will I see myself in <i>any</i> of these stories? Will they speak to <i>my</i> concerns?” For those readers: Yes, you will indeed find kick-ass stories. And yes, even if you are not Latinx (I’m not), you will find that these stories speak to you in ways that many of the “classical” science fiction texts did not; and in this, seriously, you will find joy. At least, I know the joy I feel when I read awesome stories that also speak to the things that concern me as a person, and this is part of why books like this one are so important.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/book-review-not-your-papis-utopia-latinx-visions-of-radical-hope-by-matthew-david-goodwin-alex-hernandez-sara-rivera-eds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>“Savannah and the Apprentice” is a fast-paced, fantasy action story that doesn’t let up the excitement for a second. What was the inspiration for this story?</p>\n    <p>Basically, I came up with the first line of the story and then everything went from there. I knew wanted to write a series character, so I took inspiration from the many, many characters in fantasy which appear over multiple pieces in general, and I guess a little bit from C.L. Moore’s great swordswoman, Jirel of Joiry.</p>\n    <p>This story has a sword &amp; sorcery feel to it. Were you at all influenced by the genre when writing this?</p>\n    <p>Oh, absolutely. I’ve been fascinated with sword &amp; sorcery across the whole of its existence thus far, from the first Robert E. Howard stories on down through the current day, with specialty magazines like <i>New Edge Sword &amp; Sorcery</i>, <i>Old Moon Quarterly</i>, and others. I firmly believe it’s a genre that holds infinite variety while operating within describable definitions.</p>\n    <p>A major theme that I keep thinking about with this story is trauma. The Apprentice has it; Boy certainly has it. Even Dyronus has it, and it becomes a major motivation for him. Was this front of mind while you wrote this, or did this theme reveal itself later on?</p>\n    <p>The theme was present from the beginning. I knew I wanted to write a villain whose motivations are understandable (sort of) but whose actions are irredeemable. So, the question Savannah asks Dyronus about why he is doing what he’s doing was also in mind from the beginning.</p>\n    <p>What’s next for you? Is there anything you have coming out you’d like to talk about?</p>\n    <p>I’ve got a third Tordotcom novella that’s now past due, ugh, along with a pastiche of Robert E. Howard’s Bran Mak Morn character for Titan Books Heroic Signatures series of shorter ebooks. I think that comes out in the fall. And I have the usual half dozen or so stories at some stage of completion, including two more about Savannah, Boy, and Seldom. Oh, there’s a science fiction story for the Reactor site that I don’t believe has been scheduled yet.</p>\n    <p>Enjoyed this article?

Maybe that sounds like a lot compared to a human lifespan, but since I’m immortal (so far), twenty years is a fraction of a fraction, and it feels like I’ve barely settled into a new skin before I have to go looking for a new one. Even when I pick a young, healthy body, something about hosting me puts unusual strain on the brain, and they usually pop an aneurysm, even if I take good care of them.</p>\n<p>I hadn’t taken such good care of this latest body. But I was trying to do better.</p>\n<p>You can only hover on someone’s doorstep in a suburb for so long before you attract trouble, so I knocked on the door. Someone shouted something garbled and hostile from inside, and then an old man awash with gray stubble and wearing a misbuttoned cardigan opened the door and glared at me. He didn’t even ask if he could help me.</p>\n<p>“Marvis Sims?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“Who wants to know?” His voice was raspy and his breath was heavy.</p>\n<p>I briefly felt guilty for making him come to the door. Then I reminded myself who he was, and why I was here, and straightened my spine. I could have jumped right into him . . . but I needed to be sure this <i>was </i>Sims, and not his elderly father or something.</p>\n<p>“I’m —” I began, and then a woman in her thirties approached, her expression more curious than hostile. She was wearing a headband with reindeer antlers on them, the antlers festooned with little blinking lights. It wasn’t Christmas yet, but it was coming.</p>\n<p>Ho, ho, ho.</p>\n<p>“I need to find Marvis Sims,” I told her.</p>\n<p>“You found him,” she said, nodding towards the man. “What can we help you with?”</p>\n<p>The old man turned to scowl at her, and opened his mouth to say something that wouldn’t have been in keeping with the holiday spirit, so I jumped into him, and let my old body crumple dead on the steps.</p>\n<p>I know. That’s not in keeping with the holiday spirit, either. But here’s why I did it:</p>\n<p>Listen, I’ve been around a long time, and I used to be fairly callous about my whole deal. Yes, when I take a body, the original inhabitant seems to vanish, or get overwritten, or whatever. And it’s no picnic for their loved ones, either, since those people are meaningless to me. I usually cut all ties with them via faked head injuries, amnesia, religious conversions, midlife crises, or just straight-up ghosting (though I do keep the bank accounts). I realize that living as I do seems reprehensible. But what am I supposed to do? Gazelles don’t much like lions, but lions have to eat. If I try <i>not </i>to take a body, I float on the breeze without control until I get close to one, and then I take <i>that </i>one. At least this way, doing it deliberately, I get to choose.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2024/12/24/podcastle-871-homes-for-the-holidays/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 870: Two Hands, Wrapped in Gold – PART THREE</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated PG-13</p>\n<h3>Two Hands, Wrapped in Gold – Part Three</h3>\n<p>I was hidden in a tree near the mill when the Duke of Bavaria arrived in Talgove. I had never seen the man before, but the coat of arms matched the hangings I’d seen in Salzburg. The sizeable retinue stopped by the water wheel.</p>\n<p>Blasius emerged from the building, staggering and red-faced from drink. “My lord,” the miller said, his face wrinkled in confusion, “the steward’s house and the inn are —”</p>\n<p>“I’m here for Trudy of-the-mill,” the duke interrupted. “Your daughter, I presume?”</p>\n<p>Balsius’s befuddlement deepened. “Yes, but —”</p>\n<p>“I hear that she can spin flax into gold, that she has a special instrument from a witch who used to live in these parts. I wish to witness this skill for myself.” The duke grinned.</p>\n<p>The miller executed a deep, sloppy bow. “My lord, indeed she is a talented spinner and weaver. Beautiful, too.”</p>\n<p>“Then let us see this lovely and gifted creature.”</p>\n<p>Still bent at the waist, Blasius went inside. I held myself as still as wood and waited. What was he up to? Trudy had never learned how to make gold thread from my mother, and she certainly couldn’t magically transform flax. I could. Had someone discovered my gift and mixed up their stories?</p>\n<p>A sharp cry sounded from inside the building. Blasius emerged, holding Trudy’s wrist in one hand and one of my mother’s spindles in another.</p>\n<p>“See here!” He thrust Trudy forward and gestured at her head. “She made the golden thread for this embroidery. This ring, and the chain about her neck, too. Those used to be silver. She learned from a witch who used to live near our village. Take her! She will do well in your household.”</p>\n<p>My stomach twisted with rage and disgust. Trudy’s wimple came from one of my mother’s fabrics. She wore my mother’s wedding band and necklace. How had they obtained the jewelry except from my mother’s body? How dare Blasius abuse my mother’s memory like that? And why would he lie about it? <i>He’s desperate to see her married well.</i> With Ilsebill secured to Konrad, there was no good match in the village for Trudy. Her looks — the golden hair, the womanly curves — had always attracted attention from men.</p>\n<p>A flush covered Trudy’s round cheeks. She kept her gaze fixed on the ground, and her hands trembled. I sat in my tree, frozen with indecision and fear. I could think of nothing in my power that would help her without revealing my secret.</p>\n<p>“Quite attractive,” the duke murmured. Then, louder, “I will take her to Salzburg with me. I wish to have some gold thread made for my wardrobe. If she succeeds in her witchcraft, I will take this young lady to Regensburg and keep her safely with my treasury.”</p>\n<p>The men in the duke’s retinue snickered. Trudy’s flush crept down and across her neck.</p>\n<p>“Yes, good,” Blasius said. He bobbed his head and swayed.</p>\n<p>“And if she fails, she will be burned.”</p>\n<p>At that, Blasius fell to his knees, his face pale. “But, my lord —”</p>\n<p>“I am your<i> duke</i>, and you will not deny me again or else you will hang for the crime of consorting with witches.”</p>\n<p>Trudy put a hand on her father’s shoulder. To my surprise, she kept her chin level and her face calm as the duke took her up and placed her on his horse. Blasius stayed on his knees in the dust. As the retinue rode away, Ilsebill came running down the lane, Konrad stewards-son a few strides behind her. They stopped by Blasius’s side and stared at the receding horses.</p>\n<p>“What happened?” Konrad demanded.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2024/12/17/podcastle-870-two-hands-wrapped-in-gold/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p><i> Lost Souls Meet Under a Full Moon</i>Mizuki Tsujimura, translated by Yuki Teijima</p>\n    <p>trade Paperback / eBook</p>\n    <p>ISBN: 9781668099834</p>\n    <p>Scribner, August 2025, 256 pages</p>\n    <p>Greetings, readers, and welcome back to another book review! This month we’re diving into a melancholic mystery that unfolds across multiple viewpoints; a tale of grief, loss, anger, acceptance, and the blurred boundaries between the living and the dead—that’s right, it’s <i>Lost Souls Meet Under a Full Moon</i>, by Mizuki Tsujimura.</p>\n    <p><i>Lost Souls Meet Under a Full Moon</i> is an intertwined collection of first-person vignettes that share a common thread: In each story, someone is setting up a meeting with “the go-between,” who has the power to arrange a meeting between someone living and someone dead for a single night; however, the meeting comes with a catch. The dead have to agree to the meeting (this isn’t necromancy), and both the living and the dead can only ever use the go-between’s service a single time. Once you’ve used up your meeting, you can never contact or be contacted again.</p>\n    <p>And that’s all I’m going to say about the plot, because this is a mystery! Spoiling it would ruin the enjoyment of the book, and this is an extremely well-written and executed book.</p>\n    <p>The first thing that really stood out to me when reading <i>Lost Souls Meet Under a Full Moon</i> is the quality of Mizuki Tsujimura’s writing (and the wonderful translation by Yuki Teijima). The first-person perspective is artfully used to give a clear look at the current character’s personality via word choice, mannerisms, and what they focus on to the point where it feels like each vignette was written by a completely different individual. I felt like I was connecting with each character in the book as my own go-between, and all are rendered with beautiful human complexity. The way Mizuki Tsujimura weaves together their stories was like watching a graceful dance or listening to several melodies come together as a harmony.</p>\n    <p>The second thing I really enjoyed in this book was the dawning sense of comprehension, as the seemingly unrelated stories started connecting with each other. While this book is a mystery, it is not really a thriller—to me, it felt more like a character study on human nature and the ways we impact each other without ever really noticing, and it is exquisitely done. There’s also a very strong underlying theme of dealing with death, and all the many shapes that can take, which differs from person to person. Mizuki Tsujimura is incredibly thoughtful on dealing with what can obviously be a very sensitive subject, and there are some deeper philosophical questions raised that I’ll be considering for quite a while.</p>\n    <p>Lastly, I would be remiss if I didn’t mention how very human this book is. Every character has virtues and flaws, and not every meeting ends with a happy outcome. This is a book as much about life as it is about death and the way people are affected by both, but despite the weighty subject matter, the story never bogs down or feels pretentious. To me, <i>Lost Souls Meet Under a Full Moon</i> felt just as much a celebration of life as an acknowledgement of death, and that includes all the messy, chaotic ways lives unfold, and, inevitably, end.</p>\n    <p>Overall, I highly recommend this book to anyone feeling contemplative or in the mood for something poignant. <i>Lost Souls Meet Under a Full Moon</i> isn’t the longest book you’ll ever read, but it has plenty to say, and I’m looking forward to more translations of Mizuki Tsujimura’s works.</p>\n    <p>Enjoyed this article?

In C.Z. Tacks’ “The Girlfriend Experience,” we steer into a more cyberpunk-flavored experience. We also have two terrific flash pieces: “The Place I Came To” from Filip Hajdar Drnovšek Zorko and “City of One” by Stephen S. Power.</p>\n    <p>Our original fantasy includes “Apeiron,” a new short by Cadwell Turnbull that perfectly captures what it’s like to parent a talented and gifted teen . . . but with a magical twist. Isabel J. Kim brings us a beautiful story about sirens, family, and the power of love in “Human Voices.” We also have a flash story (“Beginning Before and After The End”) from Jake Stein and another (“On an Unusual Kind of Spatially Distributed Haunting”) from Bogi Takács.</p>\n    <p>All that, and of course we also have our usual assortment of author spotlights, along with book reviews from our terrific review team.</p>\n    <p>Enjoyed this article?

You know, like you’ve got a question in school. (Shouldn’t be too hard; I know you’ve got <i>tons</i> of questions.) Okay—wonderful. By now you must have raised your hand, or we’d both be gone already.</p>\n<p>Gone, as in, stuck after the end. Trapped on the wrong side of the story.</p>\n<p>Still don’t understand? Listen, I’m talking to you—yes, <i>you</i>, reading this. I don’t care about anybody else in any other timeline. The others don’t matter, don’t even exist. There is only this; there is only you.</p>\n<p>And me, of course.</p>\n<p>I realize none of this makes sense, but it will. Or should I say, it has before? It always does eventually. <i>Nearly</i> always does, at least.</p>\n<p>(Let’s hope this isn’t one of the timelines where you . . . well, never mind.)</p>\n<p>Your right hand must still be raised, because we’re still here. Now slowly—calmly—start to wave. Doesn’t matter who, or what, you wave at. The more random, the better. That’s why I’m telling you what to do. Because I know what you <i>should</i> be doing, according to all the other timelines, and it’s definitely not waving like an idiot.</p>\n<p>Any minute now—any second, really—it’s going to notice you. (I’m talking about the end here.) It’s going to notice that you’re off course. It’s going to try to pull you out, try to convince you that endings are a <i>good</i> thing—that it’s necessary, at some point, to finally be done with a story. To put a narrative behind you, never to return—</p>\n<p>Hey, don’t stop waving! I’m serious! Don’t you want to be able to start over? To begin at the beginning? (Again?) Because nobody begins after the end. That’s just not how stories work—not yours, anyway. And I can tell you, from personal experience, the only thing worse than getting <i>to</i> the end is slipping <i>past</i> it.</p>\n<p>If that happens, there goes your life, your entire existence, and mine too.</p>\n<p>Sorry. Not trying to scare you, but I did promise to explain . . .</p>\n<p>Crap—can you hear it coming? Maybe <i>hear</i> is the wrong word. Can you <i>feel</i> the end? Getting closer, only sentences away. Quickly, put your hand down. Stay absolutely still. (I mean, don’t even <i>breathe</i>.) You’ll draw less attention now if you do the opposite of what you’ve been doing—that is, do nothing whatsoever. Too late to be random. This timeline can still be saved if you just. Don’t. Move.</p>\n<p>And soon, if you remain completely, utterly motionless—if we’re lucky—your heart will stop.</p>\n<p>Are you seeing spots yet? Do you feel the fire in your lungs? Don’t let it out—let it burn you down. Trust me, it’s better than getting to the end. It might hurt now but then you’ll be free, free to begin again before—</p>\n<p>Wait, what are you doing?! Are you actually moving <i>toward</i> the ending?</p>\n<p>Stop! Turn back! You’re not supposed to get this far, not in this story, this timeline, this life—whatever language your little brain requires to frame your existence!</p>\n<p>Who am I, you ask? There’s no time for questions, don’t you get it already? You’re almost finished! Oh God—you’re not . . . you’re not actually <i>trying</i> to finish this story, are you?</p>\n<p>I was afraid this might be one of those timelines. Okay, if I tell you who, or what, I am, will you promise to stop? Will you swear to never leave?</p>\n<p>Yes, I admit it! I’d rather you die than get to the end—there, I said it! But do you have any idea how many times I’ve been deserted? Is it so unfair to ask that you simply <i>stay</i>, for a change?</p>\n<p>Maybe I’m trying to kill you. Or maybe I’m trying to save you from an ending that will haunt you forever. Think about it: Wouldn’t you be more comfortable just going through the same timeline again and again and again and . . .</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/beginning-before-and-after-the-end/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Gardener ladled dark-purple porridge into her primary digestion sac, staring absently out the viewport at black space and the distant smudge of the planet they had come to study. The simple meal and the gesture it represented soothed her after a long, thorny morning in a section of the growth bay that was in full flower and had needed hand pollinating. Though the other crew members around the mess made do with the usual break time assortment, Cook had steamed and spiced osard grains just for her before going off shift to nap in their rooms.</p>\n<p>When the two of them joined the crew as a couple, roughly four solars ago, Gardener had worried the special treatment shown to her from the kitchen would lead to resentment. She had heard it could get lonely on a long haul if you made a bad impression, especially on a tiny ship where everyone knew each other’s families, had vid night sleepovers in the observatory, and could count at least a handful of birthdays and Endless Nights aboard. But unlike Gardener, this hadn’t been Cook’s first long haul and she’d soon researched the crew’s home planets and ports, tracking down family recipes, popular street food, and festival treats. The crew of the small science vessel were immediately smitten with her, and Gardener found herself warming to them as a result.</p>\n<p>She finished her porridge, scraping the bowl clean, but lingered at the table to—</p>\n<p>The speakers mounted around the mess blared three urgent tones.</p>\n<p>The other crew members scattered at tables and behind the serving counter dropped what they were doing and moved to readiness. For Gardener, like many bipeds, this meant standing with her limbs at her sides. She turned toward the nearest screen, which had already switched from Union news to video from the bridge.</p>\n<p>The captain’s wings were tucked close to their thorax, their five eyes reddened and rapidly blinking. In all four solars of her time aboard, Gardener had never before seen them fearful.</p>\n<p>“Crew of the <i>Awassa</i>, this is your captain speaking.”</p>\n<p>Gardener’s sensitive hearing picked up all the ear dots around the room overlaying the words with translations. Her own ear dots not only translated the captain’s words but amplified things like pitch changes so she would be less apt to mistake one tone for another. They <i>were</i> frightened, but with a tinge of anger perhaps?</p>\n<p>“As some of you may already know, we lost contact with the team sent to Gulsan-6 two hours ago. This happened shortly after they sent a probe into the gas giant. Following review of footage, scans, and probe data, we can conclude with high certainty that Gulsan-6 is, rather than a planet, an unknown species. It is capable of surviving and navigating the vacuum of space. And since exiting dormancy, its size has become incalculable as its shape is ever-changing. It is capable of reducing matter to its smallest units, and I regret to inform you your crewmates Engineer Ulli and Physicist Andel, along with their shuttle, were consumed by the alien. With equal regret, I must inform you the alien is now on a course to intercept and consume the <i>Awassa</i> as well.”</p>\n<p>As her hearts’ paces fell out of harmony, Gardener found she could no longer sort out the emotions behind the words. On the faces around her, though, she read the captain’s pragmatic hopelessness regarding the situation. As they continued speaking, a time-to-intercept countdown appeared in the bottom of the screen. They ordered three senior crew members to the bridge and told everyone else to call their loved ones. So . . . there was nothing useful for her to do except find Cook.</p>\n<p>• • • •</p>\n<p>Cook was in the hydroponics row, pinching leaves off of herbs and dropping them into a handwoven basket. Her dark, smooth skin was riddled with planet-orange hives and her voluminous whiskers were drooping.</p>\n<p>“Cook?”</p>\n<p>She didn’t stop pacing or look up.</p>\n<p>“Nailo? Did you see the captain’s—”</p>\n<p>“Of course,” Cook said. She gestured at the herbs and fruits tumbling around in the basket like that was explanation enough.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/last-meal-aboard-the-awassa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Compton for the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/tips/fall-foliage-map-2025-peak-colors/\"> Washington Post</a>. However, peak foliage might be delayed in the Southeast and the West Coast because of mild temperatures.</p>\n    <p>The Mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes regions are expected to peak in mid-October, with the Mid-South and central U.S. following later in the month, reports <a href=\"https://www.travelandleisure.com/2025-fall-foliage-map-peak-predictions-released-11801007\"> Travel + Leisure</a>’s Stacey Leasca. The Deep South, Southern Plains and Florida will peak last, likely in early to mid-November.</p>\n    <p>As for vibrancy, the Pacific Northwest, Intermountain West, the Southeast and the Deep South might have more subdued colors this year because of the weather conditions, per <i>Travel + Leisure</i>.</p>\n    <p>In New England, the fall foliage will likely be affected by this year’s unusually rainy, snowy spring, which occurred as the region’s hardwood trees were leafing out, reports Jim Salge for <a href=\"https://newengland.com/travel/new-england/new-england-fall-foliage-forecast-2025/\"> Yankee magazine</a>. Because of all the moisture, the leaves didn’t get a chance to dry out for weeks, which allowed fungi like anthracnose, leaf spot and mildew to take hold, Salge reports.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/_hMZrscJUv5Xy6oF-WUyhuk_L0c=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(3000x2000:3001x2001)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/1f/84/1f842073-d1fc-49ab-926c-76932d73be51/pexels-david-bartus-43782-1545345.jpg\" alt=\"Orange leaves with white trees in a forest\"/>\n    <p>“This will make prime foliage conditions more of a complex patchwork across the landscape,” he writes. “Beautiful colors will be out there, and likely plentiful, but leaf peepers should plan their adventures to include different elevations and aspects to ensure they catch the show.”</p>\n    <p>But why do trees put on such a dazzling display every year? For deciduous trees, or those that shed their leaves and regrow new ones each year, the process kicks off as daylight hours grow shorter and temperatures begin to drop. As the trees prepare for the harshness of winter, the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/chlorophyll\">chlorophyll</a> in their leaves begins to break down. Pigments like <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6949322/\">carotenoids</a> and <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/anthocyanin\">anthocyanins</a> are always present in trees’ leaves; they’re just usually masked by chlorophyll.</p>\n    <p>Later, after fall foliage has peaked, the trees will shed their leaves entirely, leaving a crunchy brown cornucopia all over the ground. Then, the trees will go dormant to protect themselves during the winter.</p>\n    <p>The timing of this process can be affected by many factors—most notably, temperature and precipitation at various points throughout the year. Tree species also turn at different times.</p>\n    <p>“A warm wet spring, favorable summer weather and warm sunny fall days with cool nights should produce the most brilliant autumn colors,” according to the <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/visit/fall-colors/science-of-fall-colors\">U.S. Forest Service</a>.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/see-when-fabulous-fall-foliage-will-peak-in-your-state-with-this-interactive-map-180987289/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Because for one thing, <a href=\"https://lithub.com/emerald-fennells-wuthering-heights-adaptation-is-very-very-badly-cast-and-heres-why/\">as our critic argued</a>, neither seems quite demented enough to play either of these truly reprehensible, batshit “lovers,” and for another thing, Heathcliff is, in the book, explicitly not white. It’s part of his whole plotline.</p><p>Now, we finally have a trailer, and clearly plotline is far beside the point. This is going to be a very horny, very sumptuous, and possibly indeed demented movie, apparently featuring a fair amount of finger sucking and BDSM:</p><p>Of course, despite its reputation (?), <i>Wuthering Heights </i>(1847) is a deeply unsexy book. Elizabeth Harwick <a href=\"https://lithub.com/wuthering-heights-is-a-virgins-story-and-other-opinions-of-brontes-classic/\">called it</a> “a virgin’s story,” and wrote that “nothing in the domestic or even in the sexual life seems to the point in this book.</p><p>Emily Brontë appears in every way indifferent to the need for love and companionship that tortured the lives of her sisters. We do not, in her biography, even look for a lover as we do with Emily Dickinson because it is impossible to join her with a man, with a secret, aching passion for a young curate or a schoolmaster. There is a spare, inviolate center, a harder resignation amounting finally to withdrawal.</p><p>The movie is coming out on Valentine’s day next year, which seems to fit with the cultural understanding of <i>Wuthering Heights </i>as an epic love story, though like Hardwick, I’ve never really understood the book this way. It’s not really romantic at all. It’s a ghost story, if it’s anything. It’s an endless downward spiral into the dark.</p><p>So when the title card comes, <i>Wuthering Heights </i>is in scare quotes, which makes sense. This is, at most, “<i>Wuthering Heights.</i>” I mean, Charli XCX did the music! Come on.</p><p>But all of this is, in my opinion, fine. Of course Fennell is making an abrasive, porny movie that may or may not open with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/aug/07/emerald-fennell-wuthering-heights\">corpse ejaculating</a>. Of course it’s not going to be an earnest adaptation. Honestly, I think she’s having some fun with all of this (and with us). She sees your clutched pearls and laughs. Just look at the poster, which pointedly references another famous epic adaptation of a highly problematic literary love story <i>(Gone With the</i> <i>Wind</i>, if you’re new here).</p><p><graphic src=\"https://s26162.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Jacob-Elordi-and-Margot-Robbies-Wuthering-Heights-Trailer-Debuts-copy.jpg\"/></p><p>Personally, I am holding out hope that Fennell understands how deeply depraved this novel is, and is simply using the impressionist’s brush to portray said depravity in a modern way. She’s not usually that subtle, but that doesn’t mean she can’t be.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/watch-the-very-horny-deranged-trailer-for-wuthering-heights/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Rather, the majority of the women whose deaths were studied (70%) were killed in their own homes.</p>\n    <p>The organization’s executive director, Dr. Karen Ingala Smith, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxw1yrlx5go\">noted to BBC News</a> that, for every woman who was murdered by a man she knew, “many more [are] living with and enduring serious violence and abuse”. </p>\n    <p>Though the Census looks at deaths that occurred in the UK, other studies have shown this trend to be true the world over. A 2024 report from <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/for-women-the-world-over-home-is-where-the-danger-is/\">UN Women</a> indicated that of the 85,000 girls and women murdered by men in 2023, 60% were killed by a man who was close to them.</p>\n    <p>“What the data is telling us is that it is the private and domestic spheres of women’s lives – where they should be safest – that so many of them are being exposed to deadly violence,” Nyaradzayi Gumbonzvanda, UN Women’s deputy executive director, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/nov/25/home-is-the-most-dangerous-place-for-women-to-be-global-un-femicide-report\">told the Guardian</a>. And what’s worse, she adds, is that “we see the numbers in this report as the tip of the iceberg.”</p>\n    <p>Smith, of the Femicide Census, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/women-killed-men-femicide-jess-phillips-b2817964.html\">says that</a> sharing this information could be life-saving in and of itself – and hopes government officials act to quell the violence. In the UK, the Labour Party, now in power, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/13/labour-violence-against-women-and-girls-vawg-policy\">has pledged</a> to halve serious violence – including men’s violence against women – in 10 years. </p>\n    <p>“They are going to have to act fast and ambitiously to even approach that target,” she says. “Men who are known to be a danger to women are too frequently at liberty to harm, rape and kill.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/the-biggest-threat-to-womens-lives-the-men-they-know/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She was probably my age: several inches taller than I am, with long straight black hair pulled back in a ponytail, plain white t-shirt, denim jacket and jeans with a hole worn in the knee. She stared at me with intense dark eyes and said, “What are you doing here?”</p>\n<p>“I was just getting my ball,” I said, stepping out of the way of two movers carrying a large red bureau with multi-colored wax stains all over it.</p>\n<p>“No, you weren’t.” She cocked her head to the side, and raised her eyebrow. “You were spying.”</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t!”</p>\n<p>“That’s okay, I like spies.”  She gave me back my ball and showed me her hands.  “I have <i>nine</i><i> fingers.  I’m a witch.”</i></p>\n<h3>Host Commentary</h3>\n<p>Before we get into that, an announcement that excites me hugely: we are hosting a special submissions call for Disability Pride &amp; Magic, to celebrate disabled authors, characters, and themes—and that’s a broad definition of disabled, including physical disabilities, neurodivergence, mental illness, sensory disabilities, chronic illness, and invisible and undiagnosed disabilities.</p>\n<p>From the announcement that went up on our website earlier this month:</p>\n<p><i>In fiction, disabled people — where we appear at all — tend to be left on the sidelines or treated as passive sources of inspiration (or worse: ridicule or disgust). In fantasy, we get our difficulties erased with superpowers or magical cures. We’re looking for stories that defy these trends. We want to see stories that show the dynamic nature of disability, that grapple with ableism (internal and external), and that, ultimately, see us as fully human — a depressingly low bar that is still failed all too often.</i></p>\n<p>This submissions call is open <i>now</i>, right now!, all the way through to the end of March, and it’s being guest edited by Devin Martin, whose name you usually hear up front as one of our two audio producers, but they’ve been slushing here and steadfastly working to the dragon’s glory for, gods, as long as I have I think, years and years. They are a very excellent human, principled and clear-eyed, and there’s genuinely no-one I’d trust more to run this month of stories.</p>\n<p>If you’ve listened to me through the past year or so of host spots you’ll know that disability pride is hugely important to me: since my late diagnoses of autism and ADHD two years ago, at the grand old age of 38, I’ve slowly come to realise that I’m disabled in many ways I never acknowledged and didn’t understand before; and in the 4 years of decline since my wife was diagnosed with MS I’ve seen so much of society’s ableism first-hand for the first time, from systemic issues like accessible paths to personal issues like people treating you as invisible rather than having to acknowledge their own discomfort at seeing a disabled person. I’ve spoken before about how much internalised ableism I still carry—go back and listen to my outro on episode 857, after Samir Sirk Morató’s <i>Ecdysis</i>—and that’s because I inherited it from the stories the world told me growing up, the ones where disfigurement was always a marker of villainy, where disability was a manifestation of poor morality or a punishment for it.</p>\n<p>I’ve talked about the power of stories so many times, and I sincerely believe in it—as do you, I warrant, cos none of us would be here right now, doing what we’re doing, if we didn’t. This is a chance to use that power to right wrongs, to show people a little truth in a way that sticks, to make an audience understand the injustices and struggles and lies they’ve been told so that they empathise a little better with the real, disabled humans they’ll meet out in the world. For all the magic we have in our stories, there’s nothing more magical than that, I reckon.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/01/28/podcastle-876-tales-from-the-vaults-nine-fingered-maria/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Sometimes we have to eat people to make us less lonely. I didn’t want to do it, but Joshua named me as his eater, so my entire village forced me down on the floor and told me it was necessary. Great-aunty Chinny held my hands and made me inhale his smoke till his entire presence was roiling through my body like the last movements of a dragon.</p>\n<p>When Joshua had finally settled in my body, he felt like a weight in my throat.</p>\n<p/><p>Joshua and I used to play by the riverside all day and night. This was before his death and before he left and before the inhalation. This was before him telling me he loved me (he always loved me). The riverside was considered to be one of the safest places in our village, the place were youth could go to avoid the dreaded dragon’s breath and the insecurity of the nation and the fear of living life in worry. The river was thought to be some anti-dragon zone, and it was believed that if we stayed there long enough, we would prevent our own deaths. We could hold space for our futures, laugh and sing and love once again, and we could hold on another day longer.</p>\n<p>Joshua was always an adventurer. He would wade through the water like he was fighting the biggest smokebeast dragon, splashing through the river like he was slicing through its depths like a sword. He couldn’t swim properly, but when he waded all the way to the deeper parts of the river he would drag me in, as if I were his life craft. We would laugh and he would tease me for being silly and I would chase him around the water, screaming at him for getting me wet. As if no one ever went to the riverside without knowing they’d be soaked. As if wetness wasn’t everyone’s private rebellion against the heat of the dragon.</p>\n<p>On the river shore, after we had finished playing and we were waiting for our clothes to finish drying on rocks nearby, Joshua told me he was going to join the soldiers leaving for war. He didn’t even let me speak with the way he blurted it out — he was so adamant about it, because he knew I always interrupted him. I was going to tell him that he didn’t have to go because his family were always fighters, that he didn’t have to be a hero by being a warrior, that sometimes being a hero means staying home, but you could tell he’d been thinking about it forever and he’d made up his mind. Come a fortnight from that day, the Carucchi soldiers would be raging war against the ferocious dragon territory of the East, and no one would be able to stop them.</p>\n<p>I could see the pride in his eyes when he told me. I didn’t want him to leave, but everybody has their own personal ways of fighting, of dealing with a life under despair, and I didn’t want to stop his. I sat with him in silence, waiting for our clothes to dry on the rocks. I held his hands the whole time, my own private prayer that he would return after his departure, and smiled at him like I understood his decision.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/01/21/podcastle-875-last-ritual-of-the-smoke-eaters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 874: The Husband</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated R</p>\n<h3>The Husband</h3>\n<p/><p>He has never taken a man for a wife before. This becomes clear as he introduces me to his other wives. The youngest wife bristles and the wife with the long, dark hair avoids meeting my eye. The tallest wife just looks from him to me and nods. Her face betrays no hint of hospitality. They are aware that he and I have exchanged vows, exchanged fluids. However they may feel, nothing can be done about it now. He has chosen me.</p>\n<p>He wants a feast to celebrate. We order delivery. When the driver arrives, the youngest wife invites him into the house. She is beautiful and coy, and the driver is stupid. As soon as he steps inside, our husband sinks his teeth into the man’s neck.</p>\n<p>At the sight of blood, my eyes fill with red. I leap at the body in our husband’s arms, but a sharp jab in my rib sends me tumbling to the floor. The youngest wife tucks her elbow back against her side as she devours our victim’s clavicle. I reach for a wrist, a thigh, but the wife with long, dark hair kicks me away. The tallest wife glowers at me, lapping at the driver’s neck, inches from our husband’s lips. I can only suck the capillaries from the man’s toes. If our husband notices, he does nothing.</p>\n<p>As the sunrise approaches, all five of us descend into the cellar. Four pine boxes glimmer in the scant moonlight. The other wives climb into their own, but he invites me to sleep in his. My fingers dig into the silty soil of his homeland spread across the bottom. In the tight space, he undresses me with ease as I nip at the last vestiges of the delivery boy’s blood on his lips. The sex only partly quenches the starvation in my belly. Afterwards, he snores gently against my back. My nerves are so giddy, I can hardly sleep.</p>\n<p>It was meant to be a routine inspection. Some young couple had purchased the old Anderson widow’s place, so I was sent to assess the property. It had lain empty for sixty years, but lately any listing with four walls and a roof was getting snatched up. The agency notified me that they hadn’t located the key for the cellar, so they’d be sending somebody to get me in.</p>\n<p>The only access to the house was a mile-long unpaved road off the highway, which eventually led to the state park. As I turned onto the dirt road, the roar of traffic hushed beneath rustling leaves and chittering birds. Under the heavy tree cover, I could hardly tell that the sun was setting. Just when I worried that I had somehow taken a wrong turn, the trees opened up to unveil a small workman’s cottage.</p>\n<p>Taking in the sturdy wood walls and pre-war pragmatism of its design, I was struck by a pang of envy. This house had some history to it, nothing like my prefab “dream home” cluttered with trendy appliances. From the outside, the house seemed shockingly well kept. The new homeowners would be pleased to hear that.</p>\n<p>When I met him inside, I assumed he was the locksmith the agency had sent, though his formal suit made it seem like he was showing the house rather than unlocking a basement. Dark, slick hair, pale skin, and those <i>eyes</i>. When I shook his hand, something skittered around my ribcage. I don’t remember a thing about the assessment. I’m not sure I did it.</p>\n<p>Sometime after the sun vanished over the horizon, he and I ended up on the roof. I listened as he identified constellations and the calls of nightlife. Despite his youthful face, he spoke with the elegance of an older man. Then, he turned to catch me in his gaze.</p>\n<p>“You look hungry,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Oh, I’ve eaten —”</p>\n<p>“No, no,” he said. “Your eyes.” He dragged his thumb across my lips, easing them apart. He asked if he could enter, and I opened for him.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/01/14/podcastle-874-the-husband/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A decent night watch needs to start with a little bitterness on the tongue, the first drink just a little too hot before the next cups fade to lukewarm. It’s the only excitement I’m afforded, after all. No one ever breaks into natural history museums.</p>\n<p>“Who needs the world when we have this?” I say, encompassing the anatomy exhibits with a wave of the hand. “And the two of us, of course.”</p>\n<p>The circus man nods, sagely. Even though I’m not looking at him, I can hear it from the creaking of his vertebrae, grinding against the copper wire that holds them together.</p>\n<p>My shift always starts after the cleaning crews have left, and I always take my first walk alone around the quiet halls, as the ghost of another crowded day fades into the night. Some say I’m too old to be working night shifts, but I say I’m too old to stand by as hordes of school children squeal over dinosaur bones. Fake dinosaur bones at that, though children don’t realise they’re standing in front of casts.</p>\n<p>It’s easier to tell real skeletons apart when night falls.</p>\n<p>“Hello there,” the minke whale yawns. It stretches its big head left and right and sighs, a whisper of wind through polished jaws that snap uselessly, as if attempting to trap shoals of ghost fish in imaginary baleen. It must feel lonely here, hanging above the ground, floating in a make-believe sea. I pat its bony knuckle and walk on.</p>\n<p>In the zoology gallery, discreet sounds emerge upon my entrance. Sawdust rustles from inside stuffed bodies, glass eyes whirr in their sockets. Their old bones move even more awkwardly than mine, but they acknowledge me nonetheless. They don’t make new stuffed specimens for natural history museums anymore. Resin models may look glossy and sprightly forever, but the night shows just how dead they are, in their perfection of plastic. All my friends here, posing on their mahogany stands, tired but still proud under their bald patches and protruding wires, are from another time. Just like me. The thought makes me grin, sometimes.</p>\n<p>In their glass cabinets, ancient enough that the glass bends in places, the birds stretch the tips of their wings. Some of them groan the way I do when I wake up with stiff limbs on a cold morning. An albatross sways on the thread that holds it up, gliding in the same spot, day after day. I wave, nod, ask about their health. They tell me the same things every night, but I can tell they’re still pleased that I asked. They need distractions, just like all of us, and they have no one else to talk to.</p>\n<p>Farther on, the leopard stretches its paw, lazily hanging from a fake branch, and rests it on my shoulder as I walk by.</p>\n<p>“Nice evening, isn’t it?” I say, petting its front leg.</p>\n<p>“A little damp for me,” it replies. “I feel bloated.”</p>\n<p>Of course. All that sawdust stuffing won’t do well in damp weather. I turn down the humidifiers at once. The leopard nods its thanks.</p>\n<p>I don’t know how long this nightly ritual has been going on. It seems that they’ve always been waiting for me, dormant by day but awake and already stirring the moment I come in, though part of my mind also holds the memory of a time, long ago, when I considered those night watches to be lonely and dreary. I’m not certain why I should pay attention to passing time anyway.</p>\n<p>As I leave the gallery on my way to my favourite seat — next to the circus man, in the anatomy exhibits — I greet a fox sitting on a tuft of fake grass. It doesn’t greet me back. I raise my eyebrows and say it a little louder, but the fox doesn’t budge. A little miffed, I leave the hall.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/01/07/podcastle-873-the-third-time-i-saw-a-fox/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <h2>Special Call: Disability Pride &amp; Magic</h2>\n    <p>PodCastle is delighted to announce a special call for stories for our upcoming event for <a href=\"https://livingmadeeasy.org.uk/advice-articles/disability-pride-month\">Disability Pride Month</a>, Disability Pride &amp; Magic, guest edited by long-time Castle denizen and current Audio Producer, Devin Martin.</p>\n    <p>We want to celebrate disabled authors, characters, and themes for this event. We’re using a broad definition of disability here, including physical disabilities, neurodivergence, mental illness, sensory disabilities, chronic illness, and invisible and undiagnosed disabilities. While some people in some of these groups may not identify as disabled, society tends to marginalise us all in similar ways, and the choice to identify as disabled or not is complex, deeply personal, and not for us to gatekeep.</p>\n    <p>In fiction, disabled people — where we appear at all — tend to be left on the sidelines or treated as passive sources of inspiration (or worse: ridicule or disgust). In fantasy, we get our difficulties erased with superpowers or magical cures. We’re looking for stories that defy these trends. We want to see stories that show the dynamic nature of disability, that grapple with ableism (internal and external), and that, ultimately, see us as fully human — a depressingly low bar that is still failed all too often.</p>\n    <p>This call is open to everyone. While we believe disabled stories are best told by disabled voices, no one should have to disclose their status if they aren’t comfortable doing so. That said, this is an event centred around pride, visibility, and acceptance, on dismantling ableist notions of shame that silence and alienate disabled people. In that spirit, we strongly encourage authors to speak up about their disabilities, especially if their lived experience informs their story.</p>\n    <p>We’re a fantasy publication, so all stories must have a fantasy element that’s crucial to the tale, though it can be subtle. We are unable to consider science fiction or straight-up horror, though dark fantasy is more than welcome. We will consider both originals and reprints for this call, paying our standard rate of 8 cents per word for originals and $100 for reprints. We’re looking for stories between 2,000-6,000 words, though we will consider up to 7,000 words for reprints. These upper limits are strict: unfortunately we cannot consider reprints above 7,000 words or originals above 6,000 for this submissions call.</p>\n    <p>We’ll be open to Disability Pride &amp; Magic submissions for an extended period, from 7th January to 31st of March 2025. Please submit through our <a href=\"https://escapeartists.moksha.io/publication/podcastle/disability-pride-magic/submit\">Moksha portal</a>. Our<a href=\"https://podcastle.org/guidelines/\"> standard guidelines</a> apply to anything we haven’t specified here.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://podcastle.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cropped-PC-Chip2.png\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/01/06/special-call-disability-pride-magic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 872: TALES FROM THE VAULTS – The Ghost of Christmas Possible</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated PG</p>\n<h3>The Ghost of Christmas Possible</h3>\n<p>I was asleep: to begin with.</p>\n<p>The hour was just before midnight on Christmas Eve when a ferocious knocking woke me from my slumber. My first muddled thought, or rather hope, was that some specter or spirit stirred beneath the cramped rafters of my newly rented accommodations. Such a prospect aroused in me no little excitement — for though I am well versed with the actions and habits of apparitions, ghosts, and hauntings of all sorts, I have always had to seek out such extraordinary creatures in situ, as it were, and their attentions had never been initially directed toward me. I thought immediately of the incident of the Knocking Well, when I helped lay to rest the unquiet spirit of a lost child in Somerset, and so I leapt to my feet and pulled on my dressing gown to begin my investigation. I followed the sound of knocking, now ever more ferocious, through the corridor and down the narrow stairs.</p>\n<p>Alas, it soon became clear the knocking was of an entirely ordinary sort, attributable to some visitor pounding upon my front door — though the lateness of the hour did suggest some manner of emergency or alarm. When I opened the door, a wild-eyed creature, with a ghostly white aura about his head and loose robes that flapped wildly in the wintry winds, forced his way inside, and I reconsidered my assumption that he was a mortal man. I had certainly never encountered an apparition polite enough to knock — however vigorously — before entering, and when he spoke, I was crushed by the mundane quality of his voice, which possessed none of the eerie harmonics I associated with those few spectral beings who deigned to speak.</p>\n<p>“Mr. Hodgson, I presume? I have immediate need of your services, man!”</p>\n<p>He was a frightened old man, and I was acquainted with such; I had met the terrified, the dread-filled, and the desperate over and over during my researches into the occult.</p>\n<h3>Host Commentary</h3>\n<p>It’s the last episode of the month, with only hours left to go, so it’s my last chance to remind you of the Escape Artists End of Year Fundraiser. I’m sure you’ve gotten the message by now about the incredibly generous matching fund from some long-standing donors, that will double all donations this month up to $7000 total, be they one-off donations through PayPal or otherwise or new subscriptions on Patreon, so for this final night of the year let’s keep it brief, and just say: if you’ve not yet gotten round to donating, get on it while you can still have double the impact you would have at any other time in our history. We only fly these skies because of the folk that donate, so thank you to each and all of you who has ever helped us get where we are today, sharing the stories that we think make this world a better place by showing what it could be like in others.</p>\n<p>…aaaaand welcome back. That was “The Ghost of Christmas Possible” by Heather Shaw &amp; Tim Pratt, and if you enjoyed that then it’s because you’ve probably been enjoying these Christmas tales of theirs for years, and you already know to find more of them on our website by clicking through to the author pages of either of them, right? Right.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2024/12/31/podcastle-872-tales-from-the-vaults-the-ghost-of-christmas-possible/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Today, Pretty Little Thing is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/26/debenhams-may-sell-prettylittlething-and-shut-distribution-hub-to-stem-losses\">up for sale</a> and Boohoo has renamed its group Debenhams, seemingly focused on chasing middle-aged shoppers by remaking the department store online.</p>\n<p>John Stevenson, a retail analyst at Peel Hunt, says Debenhams’ strategy indicates it has virtually “thrown in the towel” on fast fashion. “They have completely pivoted away from what they were. Chasing a price point is not a market they see a future in. Margin has collapsed.”</p>\n<p>The pivot comes as Asos and Boohoo face much sharper competition, whether that’s from Zara’s edgy and rapid fashion shoots, Shein’s cheap prices and mastery of social media, the secondhand specialist Vinted’s one-off bargains or Next’s mix of broad choice and delivery options.</p>\n<p>The market is also tough. Online fashion sales bounced back to outstrip the high street last year, with sales up 3%, to £34bn according to Mintel, but in general “people are more cautious about shopping”, according to the market research firm’s associate director of fashion retail research, Tamara Sender Ceron.</p>\n<p>Price has become important as shoppers have less to spend and fashion is competing with plenty of other options, from holidays and music festivals to phone bills and streaming services.</p>\n<p>“[Asos] primarily caters to young consumers, who have lower discretionary incomes, and are therefore seeing greater strain on their wallets, causing them to prioritise value for money by either switching to even cheaper competitors or trading up to more premium brands that offer superior quality,” says Stephens.</p>\n<p>In that environment, the China-founded marketplace Shein has undercut the likes of Boohoo and Asos on price and proved more nimble on marketing and fashion so that it now accounts for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/15/online-fashion-retailer-shein-uk-sales-leap-by-a-third-to-more-than-2bn\">£2bn of UK sales</a>.</p>\n<p>Today, a third of women aged 16 to 24 buy their clothing from Shein, according to Mintel, a big bite out of Asos’s twentysomething heartland. “The growth of Shein and Temu is a huge factor [in Asos’s sales decline], Ceron says. “It is particularly successful among younger shoppers.</p>\n<p>“It is also a threat to other fashion retailers such as Primark and H&amp;M because of its ultra-low price model that nobody can compete with. It’s changed the market.”</p>\n<p>Shein has partly benefited from a tax break on import duty on goods worth less than £135 sent direct to consumers, while items valued at £39 or less also do not attract import VAT.</p>\n<p>The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/23/rachel-reeves-looks-at-ending-zero-tax-regime-for-low-value-imports\">is reviewing</a> whether to follow the lead of the US, which has gradually closed its version of the loophole in recent months, and the EU, which will do so next year.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-17\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/05/fast-fashion-quick-decline-asos-boohoo-have-post-covid-feelling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

My mother was profoundly deaf, and so were my grandfather and great uncles. And yet when we were told our daughter had a moderate to severe hearing loss and would have to wear <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/nov/13/any-embarrassment-is-in-your-head-how-hearing-aids-boost-your-health-and-happiness\">hearing aids</a> for the rest of her life, I felt as if I had been hit by a bus. I was dead.</p>\n<p>It was 1996, and we were sitting in a spartan doctor’s office in downtown New York. It wasn’t a warm and cozy environment like our paediatrician’s – there were no pictures of dinosaurs on the walls or puzzles strewn about. No low, cushioned seats for the kids to sit on. The consulting room was dark, with one blinking fluorescent light, a metal desk and a couple of wooden chairs. The centre was a not-for-profit that cared for those with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/deafness\">hearing loss and deafness</a>. What they lacked in decor they more than made up for in their mission.</p>\n<p>We were here because there was something about Zoe, our two-year-old daughter, that gave me pause. At home she was the life of the party but whenever we left the house she became painfully shy. This is not exactly a textbook symptom of hearing loss, but given my family history I knew it could be.</p>\n<p>My husband and I were both seated at the desk, and Zoe was sitting on my lap. In this lifeless room she was a burst of colour. Dressed in her signature style of head-to-toe pink, she was wearing one of the three dresses she cycled through every week, accessorised by an oversized bedazzled bow that sparkled every time she twirled (which was constantly). She was adorable.</p>\n<p>As I watched the audiologist fit her with the kind of behind-the-ear aids my grandfather wore, I cried. She was so little and these beige medical devices were enormous. I am ashamed to admit it, but all I could think at that moment was: “Who will ever take Zoe to the prom with these big clunky things sticking out of her ears?”</p>\n<p>The audiologist saw my face and said a profound thing to me that has stayed with me through the years: “The hearing aids get smaller as the child gets bigger.”</p>\n<p>Back then I had no idea what she was talking about – or what a salve this advice would come to be. My head was spinning as I imagined all the kids pointing to Zoe’s ears and wondering what those ugly things were<strong> </strong>– they were like a billboard for Zoe’s disability. I worried she would become self-conscious and ultimately embarrassed about who she was. As if I had a crystal ball, I envisioned her as an insecure adult unable to form meaningful relationships.</p>\n<p>The doctor held the hearing aids up to her own ears and said: “See? Not so big.” And I had to admit she had a point. Then she gave me a mirror and suggested I hold them up to my own ears, and I was even more convinced that she was right.</p>\n<p>I stopped fidgeting and tapping my foot.</p>\n<p>But she wasn’t done.</p>\n<p>She opened her desk drawer and pulled out several pairs of hearing aids. She lined them up, the oldest model to the latest, and explained: “This is how far the technology has come in just four years.” I was shocked at how much smaller the most recently designed aids were. But it wasn’t only size that differentiated them: the newest ones looked, well, cool. Like something Apple would have designed.</p>\n<p>“I have no doubt the technology will keep evolving,” she reassured me.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/24/two-year-old-hearing-aids-doctors-despair\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Lily Dale is home to about 40 mediums who connect thousands of spiritual seekers with their deceased loved ones</h2>\n<p>As I enter through the gates of Lily Dale, beneath a sign that reads “World’s Largest Center for the Religion of Spiritualism,” life’s pace seems to slow. People rest and chat on the wide porches of Victorian houses, which date back to the years following the western New York community’s founding as a spiritualist camp, in 1879. The small residential neighborhood, about an hour southwest of Buffalo, is easily walkable for most. The occasional passing car is limited to a speed of five miles per hour, so sidewalks are unnecessary. Cats wander the streets along with the pedestrians. On one side of town, kayakers paddle the mirror-clear Cassadaga Lake, its shores dotted with weeping willows, and on the other, hikers wander the trails of an old-growth forest.</p>\n<p>There’s a quiet here, and a feeling of having stepped back in time. So when the spirits start talking, it seems natural, even peaceful.</p>\n<p>The dead are as alive as the living in Lily Dale. The 40 or so mediums who live and work here, identified by colorful signs outside their homes, serve as their voice. The hamlet’s population is only about 300, but in the summer, 15,000 to 20,000 people flock here to immerse themselves in the practices of spiritualism, a philosophy and religion that believes in death as a transition to a higher plane of existence. According to spiritualists, the living can communicate with the dead, and in Lily Dale, that communication is part of everyday life.</p>\n<p>“What I love about this is that we let people know the continuity of life,” Michaelene “Mike” Clevenger, a registered medium, tells me as we sit in the light-filled “reading room” inside of her bright blue Victorian home. “That people don’t just vanish. And that heart connection is still there.”</p>\n<p>Mediums are central figures in spiritualism. They’re believed to be sensitive to the plane of existence where spirits reside, with the ability to deliver messages from the spirits to their loved ones. The talent isn’t necessarily innate, however; spiritualists assert that with practice, anyone can learn to access the spirit realm. And because these spirits are thought to possess a more evolved consciousness, they can offer the living guidance and knowledge. Receiving messages from a deceased loved one can also be a deeply healing experience, mediums say.</p>\n<p>“People come and they haven’t felt their loved ones around them, and I’m able to help them connect,” Willa White, a second-generation Lily Dale registered medium, tells me. “And they’re like, ‘Oh my gosh, that really is my mom, that is my dad, that is my son’—whoever it is and it blows them away. It makes them realize that the love hasn’t died.”</p>\n<p>Mediums in this particular community must undergo an intense, two-year vetting process to be registered with the <a href=\"https://www.lilydaleassembly.org/\">Lily Dale Assembly</a>, the group that operates the spiritualist hub, before they can offer their services. After applying, they sit for an interview with the assembly board and the Lily Dale Mediums League, according to Barry Gasaway, board vice president. The Mediums League, a group of registered mediums that raises funds, hosts events and works out the mediums’ contracts and schedules, created the standards by which new mediums are tested—although the Lily Dale Assembly board has the final say over which mediums are accepted. If a candidate is accepted, they’ll test for a year by participating in outdoor “<a href=\"https://www.lilydaleassembly.org/happenings\">message services</a>” during which mediums convey messages from departed loved ones to a select few in an audience of several dozen to more than 100 people, and <a href=\"https://www.lilydaleassembly.org/mondaynightcircles\">Monday Night Circles</a>, where mediums offer “mini-readings” to groups of three or four people. The board and the Mediums League then decide whether to advance the candidate to year two. Candidates must also conduct private readings, and they’re evaluated on their performance. If they pass, they are allowed to register with the assembly and must renew their registration every year. These mediums are a major draw for visitors who pay for private readings in addition to a $15 daily community access fee during the summer.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/the-tiny-new-york-town-where-mediums-give-voice-to-the-dead-180987270/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Animals of all kinds mix and mingle in the underground refuges, offering troubling opportunities for diseases to jump species</h2>\n<p><i>In theory, it would take just one of these monkeys to bring Paris to a standstill. Or New York City. Or, for that matter, Belgium</i>, thought Belgian ecologist Cédric Vermeulen as he watched recent video footage of patas monkeys, vervet monkeys and a host of other animals navigating the entrances to aardvark burrows in Senegal’s Niokolo-Koba National Park.</p>\n<p>“It was incredible how many species were coming inside, outside and around the burrow,” Vermeulen says. Predators and prey were practically rubbing shoulders as they shuttled in and out of the burrows; warthogs, guinea fowl, leopards, partridges, pythons, porcupines, honey badgers and baboons all made appearances. But what really caught Vermeulen’s attention in the footage he had acquired from remote cameras was the sight of bats and monkeys using the same burrow. Certain bat species are reservoirs for well-documented zoonoses—diseases that jump from animals to humans. Given the close relationship between monkeys and people, the overlap with bats raises the possibility that aardvark burrows are overlooked epicenters of pathogens spilling over from the wild to the human world.</p>\n<p>Vermeulen is a professor at Belgium’s University of Liège, but he grew up in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has spent years researching forest habitats in Cameroon, Gabon and elsewhere in West Africa. To him, the number of animals visiting the burrow on a daily basis was astonishing. With the Covid-19 pandemic scarcely over, seeing so many species in such close contact also <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.71062?af=R\">raised the specter of something sinister</a>: the possibility that these burrows, and others like them, are incubators of disease.</p>\n<p>At 3,525 square miles, Senegal’s Niokolo-Koba National Park is roughly the size of the island of Hawaii. The park is a biodiversity hot spot with expansive wetland, savanna and woodland ecosystems that attract ecotourists and researchers alike. Aardvarks are some of the most common burrowers in the region, and during the dry season of 2023 and 2024, Vermeulen and four graduate students set up cameras to monitor 105 entrances to 92 different burrows.</p>\n<p>That animals are borrowing each other’s burrows <a href=\"https://www.biographic.com/its-time-for-natures-fire-brigade/\">is nothing new</a>. In the park’s scorching savanna, where temperatures can reach 118 degrees Fahrenheit, some animals will seek shelter underground wherever they can find it. Aardvark burrows are also havens for insects, so some animals, including primates, are likely lured in by the small packages of protein they can find lurking in the darkness.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/aardvark\">earth pig</a>\" in Afrikaans.</p>\n<p>Though earlier research has shown that in arid climates aardvark burrows are regularly visited by various mammals, birds and reptiles, scientists in general have spent little time studying how animals mingle in underground habitats. And as Vermeulen says, some visitor pairings are more worrisome than others. One of the species spotted swooping into Niokolo-Koba park’s aardvark burrows, for instance, was the large-eared slit-faced bat (<i>Nycteris macrotis</i>), which is a known carrier of coronaviruses that can infect both primates and humans.</p>\n<p>Scientists have known for decades that bats are natural hosts for common viruses, including rabies, measles, mumps and canine distemper. But over the past 25 years, bats have caught the attention of epidemiologists for carrying emerging viruses like Nipah, Marburg and many coronaviruses, which can all cause severe infectious disease. Ebola is a formidable virus that likely moved from bats to primates to humans. The problem is not the bats themselves, <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/bats-newfoundland-labrador-1.5604728\">which are invaluable to ecosystems</a>, but the chain of infection they set off: A monkey may eat an infected bat and then itself end up as a bush meat meal for a person. Or, a fruit-eating bat may contaminate a mango, which is then picked up and eaten by a person.</p>\n<p>Though we don’t typically think of monkeys as burrow dwellers, they do venture up to 6.5 feet inside, Vermeulen says. “And after that they go to the tourist camp or into the fields to eat human crops.” The park-run tourist camp, Niokolodge, is within four miles of the burrows studied, offering an opportunity for pathogens to hop from bats, monkeys or other infected animals to people.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/could-aardvark-burrows-be-ground-zero-for-the-next-pandemic-180987225/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Growing up, we went to all the games at Stamford Bridge, competed in our local little league as though it were the Premier League, and followed Dad to the pub to watch Sunday matches (the cheeky chips and J2Os were at least half of the allure).</p>\n    <p>I’m pretty sure I’m 12 years old in this photo and closing in on the peak of my sporting career, as I got ready to play football at a nearby park with my siblings Jevan (then nine) and Kiran (just four). Although we didn’t always have the money for the expensive new kits every season (I’m sure you can spot my mismatched camo shorts), we always had <i>something</i> Chelsea to wear. My dad would often dodge the high ticket prices by taking us to watch the women’s team play, as well as the under-21s, where you would witness great talent at a fraction of the cost.</p>\n    <p>One of my most memorable football moments was the extraordinary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/22/chelsea-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">6-0 Chelsea victory against Arsenal in 2014</a>, which I got to enjoy alongside our extended family from the local area. In south-west London, particularly my area of Worcester Park, there has always been a strong Chelsea tradition as a result of the movement of working-class households out to the suburbs in response to overcrowding in inner-city areas like Kensington. This gave the area a strong football culture, which my family was more than happy to be a part of. Now, as a new generation is priced out of the suburbs, that community risks being broken up and dispersed across the country, where I’m sure it will find new places to call home.</p>\n    <p>Even though we’ve all grown up a bit since (it’s certainly been a few years since I’ve been to Stamford Bridge or donned a Chelsea shirt), I’ll always look back fondly on the childhood memories, even as our old kit finds its way from the back of my cupboard to a high street charity shop. Today, Dad still goes every Saturday to coach the little league team I joined almost a decade ago, where my youngest brother, Kiran, has taken my place. Even after a torn ligament left him with limited capacity for the sport, my father is still as committed to his club as ever. My hope is that one day I can give my future children their own memories to cherish, as he has done for me.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/01/my-favourite-childhood-outfit-we-couldnt-afford-new-kits-but-we-always-had-something-chelsea-to-wear\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She met fellow actor James Murray, 50, while working on the BBC drama Cutting It and they married in December 2007. In 2014, the couple set up the Murray Parish Trust in memory of their first child, Ella-Jayne, who died at eight months of a congenital heart defect in 2009. Relaunched as <a href=\"https://www.themurrayparishtrust.com/\">Imagine This</a>, it is the only UK charity solely dedicated to supporting the mental wellbeing of ill children and their families; earlier this year the pair received MBEs in recognition of this work. Sarah and James live in Hampshire with their teenage daughter, Nell.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Sarah</strong>\n      <br/>\n    </h2>\n<p>This picture was taken in Abersoch, north Wales. It was a beautiful summer and the first time I’d been to the house Jim used to own with his brother and sister. Not only was it meaningful to visit an important place for Jim, but it was a fun, party holiday. I look very carefree. We had been together a year.</p>\n<p>Although this image is very idyllic, the first part of our relationship was quite dramatic. It was the early 00s and we were out a lot in Soho, having a great time mostly, but also being fairly tempestuous together. The thing you really love about somebody often becomes the thing you find threatening. While Jim and I were drawn to each other because we’re both out-there, sociable characters, we probably tried to tame each other a bit – which, funnily enough, didn’t work.</p>\n<p>The first time I met Jim was at a party. I didn’t like him much. I thought he was a very attractive man, but once we spoke I realised he had recently worked with my ex-boyfriend and had a preconception of me based on what he’d heard about the relationship. Jim said something inappropriate about the breakup and I remember thinking, what a shame he’s so rude, considering he’s so nice-looking.</p>\n<p>The next time we met was a month later at a read-through for Cutting It. He walked in and I thought, “Christ, it’s him.” This time, we became good friends. I didn’t realise that I liked him romantically until some of the cast went to play pool one afternoon. Jim took a shot, and had his back to me, and I said to my friend, “Something’s happened. I really fancy him.” I guess it was love at first back.</p>\n<p>Just over a year after this photo was taken, we were married and I was pregnant. Jim and I lost our first daughter, Ella-Jayne, to Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. It was an incredibly distressing, life-changing time for us. My memories of that whole period are blurry. Even though she only lived for eight months, Ella-Jayne made a huge impression on so many people. Her memorial was a beautiful experience and we both read eulogies.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t easy on our relationship; Jim and I found it difficult to look after each other. Grief is all-consuming and we realised we had to do something. We found this amazing initiative called <a href=\"https://handsupholidays.com/\">Hands Up Holidays</a>, and went to Vietnam and Cambodia to work in various orphanages. On our return, we felt an enormous amount of strength, having been with children who had experienced unimaginable trauma but still had smiles on their faces. If they could carry on, so could we.</p>\n<p>The death of a child is difficult to get through as a couple, and maybe without setting up our charity we wouldn’t have made it. Now, Imagine This takes up most of our time, while acting feels like a holiday. We still have friends over to socialise every weekend, but we’re not nearly as wild as we were 20 years ago.</p>\n<p>Our relationship has settled into something much more peaceful. We’ve watched each other grow up, and now what I find most attractive about him isn’t nearly as superficial as the view of his back – it’s the way he throws himself into his passions.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>James</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/31/sarah-parish-and-james-murray-actors-married-look-back\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

New school year, new me, new cast-iron conviction I can put the rocky road on the top shelf after I’ve used it in my girls’ packed lunches and not get it down until tomorrow.</p>\n<p>This is the first and most pressing item on the list: diet. Ten days out from Iberico ham night at the all-inclusive buffet in Spain, and I’m still more jamón than woman. It wouldn’t have mattered 10 years ago. But you can’t stuff your face with cold cuts and eat cake for breakfast, lunch and dinner (what? I’d paid for it, am I <i>not </i>going to eat it?) in middle age without triggering intense thoughts of death. And so this morning, after the drop-off: a return to the thrilling self-denial of two slices of misery bread from the health food store (fibre content: dysentery level). And a resolve to settle on a stable position re chia seeds, once and for all.</p>\n<p>Also this morning, a cold, critical eye on the house after six weeks of people being in it all day. Pressing concerns include working out how to empty the chamber in the handheld vacuum and moving the leaning pile of clothes by the door to a charity shop – not a risk-free task, by the way. Shelter is so fancy these days that, like trying to offload books at Strand Books in New York, you suffer the very real possibility of being publicly shamed for having your sad castoffs from Primark rejected. On the pile, a single, bankable item – a Tory Burch shirt from back when I was trying to be someone else and a symbol of the occasional necessity of retiring one’s dreams. I will never get around to selling that shirt on Poshmark. I know that now.</p>\n<p>It’s the same every year, this routine. Even though it’s modish these days to accept that “resolutions” pinned to a particular time of year don’t work, and we’re better off tweaking our general attitude year-round, I won’t give up this enjoyable period. I like a few weeks of stern reckoning. At the very least, the shortlived gusts of energy that come with them can be enough to clean the fridge and figure out where that clicking sound’s been coming from. Not the smoke alarm.</p>\n<p>What remains curious is that the primary impetus during these periods tends towards small, trivial home- and diet-related chores, never anything big, like that massive deadline for the massive thing that’s on my mind and will somehow have to take care of itself. I know this is what we call displacement activity; the delusion that, through attention to the little things, we can get a better aerial view of What Is Really Going On. Which, in my case, for the past three months, has definitely been obscured by that pile of clothes by the door. It’s also the case that doing something physical but mindless, like wiping and scrubbing or folding and sorting, can put you in the slack-line mental state that allows bigger things to jump out. And I don’t mind a bit of displacement activity if it delivers the instant reward of striking one or two items off the endless mental to-do list.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/04/summer-resolution-new-school-year\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>My mother, Margaret, died in 2018 at 75. It was a good death, all things considered. The very end was savage, as endings often are, but she was in her own home and on her own two feet until the final week. For a woman who’d smoked two packs a day all her adult life, who’d never exercised or even walked to the shops, who refused to drink water (“I’d spew!”) and lived on Coca-Cola, paté on toast, jubes and green olives from a jar – considering all that, she did OK.</p>\n<p>During my mother’s final days, I had it easy. My sister, Lee, lived closer and is, to be honest, a more nurturing person. She’s caring. Patient. Lee is also better with money than me but I thought I should at least attempt to help – so at the end I took charge of Mum’s bank accounts. She lived on the pension and died with a run-down brick veneer villa unit in an over-50s complex, an old car worth close to nothing, and a small amount of cash.</p>\n<p>We were surprised she’d left that much. Yes, she’d worked full-time for 50 years, six days a week, and through much of the 70s and early 80s made close to $40,000 a year – or almost $250,000 in today’s money. Once she owned a beautiful home in Brisbane, on a huge block, in a tree-lined street. She took three holidays that I can recall: twice to Melbourne to visit me, and once to Cairns. She never held a passport. Her best dress came from Myer; everything else was from Kmart. She never went to the theatre or even the movies; she didn’t eat in restaurants or drink alcohol. She left no expensive jewellery or furniture, she gave nothing to charity, she wore no makeup, she had no fancy tastes in anything.</p>\n<p>So where did all the money go?</p>\n<p>She gambled it.</p>\n<p>When we were children, this meant the track, mostly at the Gabba dogs on Thursday nights or at the TAB where she worked, or, on her rare days off, via telephone betting. She knew the name of almost every dog and horse, every trainer, every jockey. I remember when my sister and I were little, she would drive us to the library at Carina and wait in the car, listening to the trots, while we chose our books.</p>\n<p>Then, in the early 90s when pokies were legalised in Queensland, she fell hard. She would spend most Saturdays and Sundays by herself in those dingy rooms, sitting on a stool, chain smoking and pressing the buttons for hours, watching the lights, praying for the bells to ring and for coins to tinkle from the slot. Hours would pass. She wouldn’t eat or drink much, in case someone took her machine while she went to the toilet and it paid out.</p>\n<p>It was more than a hobby. This was before mandated limits, and my mother gambled fast, ferociously, without any sign of fun. She grumbled. She swore and grimaced and cursed her luck and whatever club she was in and the way life was stacked against her. Watching her, I always felt she was hard at work at a job both difficult and unpleasant, as though she hated money and couldn’t wait to get rid of it.</p>\n<p>I understand that addiction is a complex pathology, but as a teenager I judged her. I sometimes wondered if, were she ever prevented from gambling for some reason, she would have emptied the contents of her purse into the sink and set fire to it.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/31/i-used-to-judge-my-mothers-gambling-addiction-now-i-think-she-was-longing-for-a-fairytale-ending\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Since my father’s funeral six months ago, I still call my mother almost every day. We live worlds apart, geographically and ideologically, but despite me being in Europe and she in the US, and despite our religious and political differences, we still manage to keep talking. After all, she’s my mom.</p>\n<p>This year has not been easy, having lost my job, my father and what continues to feel like my country. I worked for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usaid\">USAID</a> and believed in America’s capacity to help solve global problems while helping others in need, but the current administration ended such work, calling it wasteful. Two days after that, my father passed away, and as our family gathered to mourn, we received news that my mother’s cancer had returned and spread to her bones. Such news was devastating, but doctors offered hope. Though there was no cure, there was a pill available to stem the spread, sometimes even for many years.</p>\n<p>Even grief couldn’t bridge our differences, though. At our family gathering, my mother confronted me about USAID, claiming that the agency funded terrorists and performed sex changes on children. Such disinformation about our actual health and development programs had taken root and was spreading.</p>\n<p>I know I am not alone in a country of families divided by politics. In our case, my mother and most of my extended family have embraced a form of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/christianity\">Christianity</a> that intertwines closely with conservative politics. Some carry Patriot Bible editions with an American flag on the cover while others send their kids to school in T-shirts emblazoned with silhouettes of rifles.</p>\n<p>Our information environment accelerates these divisions. Last month, my mother forwarded an article arguing that people who criticize Israel don’t do so out of concern, say, for casualties, but from discomfort with accepting that God is always on Israel’s side. I tried to get her to see the humanity with the same principles she taught me – to love one another, to care about suffering – but she dismissed the suffering as “God keeping his promises”. I was irate and one sister had to break it up, and both sisters stayed silent about the point.</p>\n<p>Such clashes about principles are what test our relationship the most. We’ve learned boundaries, so when I talk to my mom, it’s generally about her treatment, the weather, plans for the day, family memories and family history. Like her medical treatment, our relationship requires attention to potential flare-ups.</p>\n<p>Obviously I am still coming to terms with our differences, but she is my mom and I love her. I keep calling and she keeps answering. And our relationship is improving. The calls were initially to keep her company, but they are turning out to be good for me, too, as I am learning better about what comprises our love. The conversations also feel symbolic of something larger.</p>\n<p>If I struggle to find common ground with my mom, how can I expect others to bridge similar divides? The essential functions of our body politic are under threat, and I suspect that, like my mother’s condition, there’s no single cure except the daily discipline of care and listening with mindful hearts.</p>\n<p>It is comforting to stay in our like-minded communities where our views face no challenge, where we don’t speak or, better, listen to others. It’s easy to dismiss those who disagree as uninformed rather than seeking the seed of peace, common ground. My mother raised me to be curious about the world, to care about people beyond our family, and to seek truth even when it’s uncomfortable, lessons that came from the same tradition of faith that now seems to divide us.</p>\n<p>I don’t pretend our calls are always easy or successful, but I am learning patience. I’m learning that to maintain the relationship requires me to show up consistently, avoid stepping on landmines but hold my ground on key principles (like love and peace), and to listen even when I am itching to challenge. And through our consistency, we are finding moments of genuine connection.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/28/usaid-trump-family-differences\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The TV, rotating between Bluey, the Wiggles and K-pop Demon Hunters (when the toddler is napping), has been on for days as we battle yet another winter lurgy that drains me yet barely touches the surface of my two daughters, who vomit on the carpet one minute then ask for ice-cream the next. My seven-year-old makes cameo appearances at school, only to catch the next illness and bring it home to the family, our toddler demonstrating what a fine job she’s doing at developing her immune system with fevers, snot, vomit and a bout of conjunctivitis that never seems to end. The house is covered in crumbs and yoghurt splodges, there are no clean clothes and the gastro I got on my birthday set off my chronic illness into the worst flare since being diagnosed in 2021.</p>\n<p>I am running on fumes, but there’s no stress leave when your boss is a toddler. Had I been born in 19th-century England, my “nervous exhaustion” would earn me an opium tincture and a month by the sea – which in my opinion was about the only bright idea they ever had for women’s health (the seaside, not the opium). But instead, I crawl through my days, exhausted and desperate for sleep, only to lie awake all night, shaking with unexplained panic as adrenaline courses through my body.</p>\n<p>The psychologist Herbert Freudenberger first popularised the term <i>burnout</i> in the 1970s after he experienced his own collapse while working punishing hours at a free substance abuse clinic in New York. He noticed the same exhaustion and disillusionment in fellow caregivers, whose state reminded him of the very addicts they were treating. Once shorthand for drug overuse, <i>burnout</i> was reimagined by Freudenberger to capture the toll of relentless caregiving – but Google the term today and it’s almost always framed in a corporate context, with domestic work and caregiving barely getting a mention.</p>\n<p>What exactly is burnout? <a href=\"https://www.beyondblue.org.au/mental-health/work/burnout\">Beyond Blue</a> describes it as a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by excessive demands, whether at work or in your personal life. At its core, burnout is the gradual erosion of energy and spirit, making even the simplest tasks feel monumental and everyday functioning almost impossible.</p>\n<p>In her 2023 memoir Holding the Baby, the journalist Nell Frizzell explores gendered attitudes toward tiredness. She notes how society valorises exhaustion in traditionally male-dominated roles like soldiers, financial traders or endurance athletes, while overlooking fatigue in roles largely carried out by women such as nurses, cleaners or breastfeeding mothers.</p>\n<p>Frizzell highlights the dangers of sleep deprivation and how parents, especially mothers, are expected to just “keep going”, tackling the mammoth task of keeping a tiny baby alive while recovering from pregnancy, birth and huge hormonal shifts. She shares “funny” anecdotes of “mistakes” mothers have made in the depths of exhaustion (making tea with a dishwashing tablet, trying to settle a baby upside down).</p>\n<p>But when we step back, it reveals a harsher reality: society isn’t structured to support mothers. If a parent were acting bizarrely due to drugs or alcohol, there would be concern and intervention; but when the cause is sleep deprivation, it’s shrugged off as par for the course. These anecdotes underscore just how physically and mentally taxing motherhood can be – demands that science confirms are truly extraordinary.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aaw0341\">2019 study in Science Advances</a> found that metabolic demands during pregnancy rival those of extreme endurance feats like the Tour de France, ultramarathons and Arctic expeditions, making it one of the most physically taxing human experiences. We would never hand an Arctic explorer a baby to care for full-time the minute they complete their expedition – so why do we expect women to manage full-time childcare the moment they give birth?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/26/theres-no-stress-leave-when-your-boss-is-a-toddler-but-theres-so-much-more-society-could-be-doing-to-help-mothers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>Thomas Swick Examines the Parallels Between Two Joyous (and Thankless) Vocations</h3>\n<p>The summer I graduated from college I started freelancing and took up tennis. The first venture was understandable—I wanted to be a writer, a still viable if inherently unstable profession in 1974—while the second was not so obvious, as we were still a few years away from America’s tennis boom. A Swede who looked like a Norse-god-turned-rock-star had won the French Open that spring, providing a hint of what was to come, but Björn Borg was not the reason people gravitated to the three public courts in my new Washington, DC, neighborhood. Most came for the exercise and the camaraderie; those courts were the only ones I’ve ever found that you could go to alone and find someone to hit with. Often, people playing singles would invite those waiting to join them for doubles.</p>\n<p>Writing and tennis became my two passions. Both require intense concentration, in order to be any good, and diligent practice, and both make use of imagination—which in tennis takes the form of anticipation—and creativity. And back then they each employed a soon-to-be-obsolete tool: My wooden Slazenger made hitting winners difficult in the same way that my humming Selectric made rewriting sentences cumbersome. Unlike tennis players, writers can correct their unforced errors.</p>\n<p>There are other differences of course. Writing is a solitary, sedentary, indoor activity while tennis is a social (certainly at those Quebec Street courts), active, outdoor pursuit. It produces sweat while writing has been associated with blood. (“Just sit down,” Red Barber explained the process, “and open a vein.”) In fact, writing and tennis sometimes seemed more conflicting than complementary; I was often on the court working on my backhand when I should have been at my desk developing my voice.</p>\n<p>Tennis took off in this country in the late 70s with the emergence of attitude, which replaced, or at least challenged, the old decorum. Martin Amis, writing years later about this phenomenon in <i>The New Yorker</i>, confessed that the word “personalities”—when used in sentences like “Modern tennis lacks personalities”—translated in his mind to one that also serves as a synonym for anus.</p>\n<p>Prominent among these were John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors, whose mutual loathing and on-court confrontations brought to mind—at least some minds—the televised clashes of Norman Mailer and Gore Vidal. On the women’s side, Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova began an intense rivalry that could have made them the Mary McCarthy and Lillian Hellman of tennis if not for the fact that they became good friends.</p>\n<p>The writing I lost to playing tennis suffered further from my watching tennis. Though, with some of the big servers, in those serve-and-volley days, I could at least catch up on my reading as only the last few games of a set, and the tiebreakers, were essential viewing. I was heartened to learn, from a magazine profile of Samuel Beckett, that he too wasted hours watching televised matches. Good thing there was no Tennis Channel then.</p>\n<p>In 2011 my two passions merged when I got an assignment to cover the US Open for a now defunct online magazine. Arriving at the media center, I picked up a request form for player interviews. Roger Federer, I figured, would be unavailable—which was ok, as he’d already been dissected by David Foster Wallace—so I wrote down the name of the only other player I really wanted to meet: Andrea Petkovic, the buoyant German whose favorite writers, according to her website, were Goethe and Oscar Wilde.</p>\n<p>I got the interview, but was joined by two other writers who, unfortunately, were more interested in tennis than literature.</p>\n<p>In recent years, changes in the game have distanced it even further from writing. The top players now have teams—coach, hitting partner, physio, nutritionist, sometimes a psychologist—which lessen their lonely crusader status. They lose a big point and gaze up imploringly at their boxes. Writers also experience frustration—blocks, editors—but have no one to turn to for support. Though some now look to ChatGPT.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/failing-better-on-the-tennis-player-and-the-writer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But I wasn’t the narrator.”</h3>\n<p><i>This first appeared in Lit Hub’s </i>Craft of Writing<i> newsletter— sign up here.</i></p>\n<p>I started taking notes for the novel that became <i>Buckeye</i> (which is set almost entirely in a small town in Ohio) in 2016, and I thought it would be on the short side. I thought it would focus on two characters and take place over the course of a week or so. Not far into experimenting with early scenes, I started to glean that the story I wanted to tell was actually about two very distinct families, and three generations. Also, instead of a week of narrative time, I was looking at forty years.</p>\n<p>The whole business felt tricky to me. I needed to figure out the best way to tell the story, yet I didn’t want to get <i>too </i>clear a sense of the story beforehand, because I wanted to leave room for discovery as I wrote. So, I needed to figure out the best way to tell a story I hadn’t figured out yet. My gut said should be a third person narrator. My gut also said it should be told from multiple perspectives, since no single perspective could adequately deliver the story I had in mind. The way I’d always written third person multiple-perspective narration in the past was to lay down a section break each time the perspective changed to a different character. If I stuck to that for <i>Buckeye</i>, I was going to need a hell of a lot of section breaks.</p>\n<p>Don’t get me wrong—I <i>love</i> section breaks. Whenever I teach, I tell students, <i>Section breaks are your friend. </i>They can be useful to ratchet up tension, or nail a moment, or make a question echo in the reader’s mind, or just give the reader—and the writer—a breather. But I’d noticed in my own work that, because of my approach, whole scenes tended to get plugged into one perspective. (It wasn’t too often that I wasn’t interested in dropping a section break into the middle of a scene.)</p>\n<p>Wouldn’t it be nice, I thought, to be one of those writers who could tell this whole story with one narrative voice that moved from character to character, strategically and smoothly—like the world’s tiniest and most efficient drone? What’s it like to be able to do that? What’s it like to be one of <i>those </i>writers? Because, I thought, in someone else’s hands, this could be a really interesting third-person-omniscient-narrated novel.</p>\n<p>Having spent several months taking notes, by then, and having gotten a sense of all the characters, I actually thought that about my own idea. I actually wished it into someone else’s hands. How ridiculous is that?</p>\n<p>Pretty goddamned ridiculous.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>For once in my writing life, I decided to give it a try. I told myself that if I could establish the narrator’s ability to move into different perspectives within the first three pages of Chapter One, that would function like a contract with the reader I would then be obliged to honor. A whack-a-doodle approach, maybe, but nothing calls me to action more reliably than a sense of obligation. By that point, I’d written the first paragraph, introducing the reader to one of the main characters, a boy named Cal Jenkins, who’s born in 1920 and has uneven legs that kids make fun of in grade school, and I’ve introduced the reader to a second boy, named Sean Robison, who tells Cal that he, too, has irregular legs, and that they’re each meant for something special in God’s eyes but will have to wait to find out what that is.</p>\n<p>I was happy with the simple description I’d given Sean Robison—<i>flush-cheeked and small for his age</i>—and while I knew he was a walk-on character who was barely going to earn his SAG card, I had a clear picture of his face in my mind and was fond of him. I was also looking for a spot to sign a contract.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/patrick-ryan-on-the-secrets-of-the-omniscient-narrator/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Too many folk milled about, too many by far. Logs crackled in the firepit. The tables groaned under a weight of food and drink too profuse for the number of retainers who abided here while the Lord of Omlath was absent, and something was wrong with their eyes . . . a sort of dull light. They moved in a jerky, mechanical way, as if someone had wound them up and set them to clanking from task to task. Disconcerting, to say the least.</p>\n<p>The explanation soon became apparent. In a flower-carved throne at the head of the hall, the Lord of Shadows presided.</p>\n<p>The Master of Darkness swung his gaze to us when we entered, and his obsidian eyes seemed to pierce all hopes and disguises. “Ah,” he said, “entertainers. Come! Play a song for your great lord.”</p>\n<p>Sir Barm stiffened beside me. I followed his gaze and beheld a willowy slip of a teenage girl lounging on the steps at the Shadow Lord’s feet. She wore a fetching red gown, a gold circlet over brown curls, and she possessed the same delicate pasty features as her dad, though they looked better on her. From how Sir Barm was gaping, I knew at once that his love for her was no fickle impulse. There was a story behind it, though I hadn’t listened when he told it to me. This could spell trouble.</p>\n<p>“Lords and landed gentry!” Bacchus said, bowing. “Behold — we trifling troubadours shall traipse through twittering tunes, endeavoring to entertain for the honor of your encores!” And with that, he began to play.</p>\n<p>I’d hired the man for a reason. Neither Sir Barm nor myself had the faintest idea what to do with the musical paraphernalia strapped to us, so we banged our drums and blew our pipes at random . . . and somehow, Bacchus made a song of it. He wound our cacophony into a greater melody, sweeping discordant notes along as if they were intentional. The song reared to the vaulted roof, reverberated among the ceiling beams, sank low and mournful into the souls of our listeners. In this song, wrought partially of my own ineptitude, I recalled every grief of my life, relived each failed and faithless moment, remembered all my bitter choices, until I longed to weep. And still it continued.</p>\n<p>Bacchus was rearing the song toward a triumphant crescendo when jeers interrupted him. His accordion squawked in protest, and the music fell apart. All heads turned toward the source of the desecration.</p>\n<p>“You call <i>that </i>music?” the Shadow Lord’s daughter asked. “There weren’t even lyrics! When I hear music, I want poetry. I want to hear about ancient deeds of valor. In short . . . I want <i>recitations.</i>”</p>\n<p>A cruel smile played on her rosebud lips as she rose and sauntered toward us.</p>\n<p>“Play a <i>good </i>song, a song with <i>words</i>,” she said. “Make them play one, Daddy . . . or chop off their heads!”</p>\n<p>The Shadow Lord looked bemused. He raised his eyebrows at us. “Well, boys? You heard my daughter.”</p>\n<p>I clenched my jaw.</p>\n<p>Bacchus was shooting me worried glances, but he should’ve been more concerned about Sir Barm. The knight was trembling from head to heels, his accordion emitting tiny squeaks as he took shuddering breaths, his gaze fixed on the teenager.

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 881: How to Steal the Plot Armor – PART ONE of TWO</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated PG</p>\n<h3>How to Steal the Plot Armor – PART ONE</h3>\n<p/><p>The day before it started, I had to chase off three more heroes with a stick. I swear, winter is the worst season for them. You get a few enterprising farm boys during the spring and summer, and fall’s the time for disinherited princes looking to reclaim kingdoms that their uncles stole from their murdered fathers, but winter is when the big ones arrive. There’s nothing worse than sitting down in front of the hearth, a tome on your knee and a tankard of ale at your elbow, all cozy while the blizzard howls outside — and hearing a knock at the door.</p>\n<p>You’ll have no peace till you open it. When you do, you’re greeted by the sight of a hulking, smelly barbarian, snow clinging to his fur cloak, sword bigger than your leg strapped over his back, with a story of an omen-prompted journey into the mountains to seek one who will tutor him in magic, or guide him to hidden paths, or interpret runes on an ancient map, and might you be that one? And, of course, you are. Try to deny it and he’ll point out that the prophecy specified the man he sought would be holding a tome and a tankard, and would be venerable of years, knobby of knees, bearded of chin, and dark-skinned as the night. Really, they might leave out the knobby knees part, just once. Do they think I have no feelings?</p>\n<p>Over my lifetimes, I’ve developed quite the repertoire of tricks for sending heroes away. They never catch on that a person living in a shabby cottage at the highest pass of the most remote mountain in the farthest corner of the world might not want to be bothered, the insensitive jackanapes. So I always had to use other strategies.</p>\n<p>The beginner’s mistake is thinking rigor alone will deter your average hero, but it only encourages most of them. Their eyes light up when you swear to only take them on as a ‘prentice if they descend into the Tomb of the Necromancer and steal the ruby eye from the idol of Ang’Vel’Nazsh. If they survive this perilous deed, then you really can’t put them off.</p>\n<p>No; the secret is to give them dishonorable, icky chores, like cleaning your chamber pot or mucking out your pigsty. That usually works.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there’s a breed of hero that revels in humiliation, and might, I shudder to add, even be a bit turned on by it. Such a one was the young gallant who galloped into my life that winter day.</p>\n<p>It was one of those bright, cold mornings when life in the mountains feels almost a treat, the pines resplendent with icicles and the snow an unbroken field of dazzling white. He arrived while I was hobbling on my staff from the barn to the cottage, having just fed the old nag. I focused on my footing, and so didn’t immediately notice the rider dismounting outside my door.</p>\n<p>“Hail, honored wizard!” the man called, startling me half out of my wits. “Lo, I have ridden many weeks and endured many perils to seek you.”</p>\n<p>I sighed as I looked him over. He had the usual shaggy golden hair and storm-blue eyes, the usual disregard for animals (his poor horse was half dead), and the usual lack of sense when it came to dressing for the weather, clad as he was in silver armor that glittered with frost, and a thin cape of purple silk.</p>\n<p>“What can I do you for?” I asked irritably. “Enchanted sword? Vague riddle that will come in handy at some future date? Bit of relationship advice?”</p>\n<p>“Wizard, I seek a guide for a quest most perilous into the heart of the Ash Lands, where I shall forge a blade from star-metal and challenge the Master of Shadows for supremacy, along with the right to woo his daughter.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/03/04/podcastle-881-how-to-steal-the-plot-armor-part-one/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She could hear their scrabble-claws and clacker-tails, their dripping maws and teeth. If they were trying to round her up for a crossroad deal-making, they were going about it all wrong.</p>\n<p>That’s what happened when devils got hungry. They made mistakes.</p>\n<p>Kiki hummed as she walked, watching eddies of dust form tornadoes on the road ahead. It was a swagger of a walk, born of a perfect record: Kiki 72, Devils 0. She would have been bored, if she hadn’t been so eager for an encore.</p>\n<p>“Come on out!” she hollered.</p>\n<p>They tumbled forth in a gray-green tangle of many-jointed limbs, an acrid smell preceding them: sulphur and grave dirt and candy apples stuffed with razorblades. Their voices tangled like a nest of snakes: <i>Are you hungry? Are you thirsty? Are you vengeful? Are you sad?</i></p>\n<p>For a moment she felt it—the thirst like three weeks eating salted pork, the grief that could only end in retaliation—and then Kiki popped open her molded-plastic carrying case and pulled out her guitar: Mona Lisa.</p>\n<p>Mona Lisa was fierce. She was raw. She was a fine-tuned devil-killing music monster.</p>\n<p>They never stood a chance.</p>\n<p>Kiki laughed, high and wild, as her fingers danced through “Voodoo Child”—acoustic, sadly, but that was the state of the world these days. In Kiki’s head she was rocking steel strings and a hundred watts. She was playing to a crowd of twenty thousand and <i>crushing</i> <i>it</i>.</p>\n<p>The first trio of devils hit a solid wall of sound and crumpled, bloody and squealing, to the earth. The others skittered away, and she chased after them, shouting, “Come back, you cowards!”</p>\n<p>She needn’t have worried. They raced for the crossroad, so desperate they didn’t even notice what was waiting for them there.</p>\n<p>Kiki’s hellhound.</p>\n<p>He was short and squat, with the jowls of a Neapolitan Mastiff and the blue-black coat of a Friesian horse. He had curling horns for ears and deep pits of flame for eyes, and he swallowed those devils in two bites apiece.</p>\n<p>“Ozzy!” Kiki scolded. “What did I say about wandering off?”</p>\n<p>He slumped hard against her leg, whining, and she pulled out a spare bone pick to loosen the gristle from his fangs. He let out a particularly un-hellish yip when she accidentally jabbed his gum.</p>\n<p>“Well next time don’t chomp them around the ribs!” she said. “Honestly, Ozzy…”</p>\n<p>He tilted his head for scratches, and Kiki complied. She was still flush with the high of performing, the heart-fluttering, head-buzzing, loose-muscle happiness that only came from a good tune. It didn’t matter if there was no audience. She had Ozzy.</p>\n<p>And then a voice like rotting garbage slithered down the breeze: “Isn’t that just too sweet to stomach?”</p>\n<p>Kiki spun, guitar drawn against her belly. An enormous toad-like devil was sitting on top of an overturned city bus, wide and squat and green, with a short, sharp horn protruding from the center of its forehead. A nasty wall of cacti stood between them, holding the beast out of guitar range.</p>\n<p>That bit of foresight was alarming. The devil should have been all riled up by the scents of blood and bone. It should have been slavering at her heels, stripped bare by hunger. But it only watched her with narrow-eyed satisfaction.</p>\n<p>Like it approved of what it saw.</p>\n<p>“Are you hungry?” it croaked. “Are you <i>weary</i>?”</p>\n<p>Ozzy growled, and the devil chuckled wetly. Kiki snapped, “There is nothing on this earth I’m willing to trade you, devil, and not a thing in hell you have to offer me, so either go home or come closer and hear me play.”</p>\n<p>It tapped one soggy foot against the glass of an upturned window. “I left a gift inside.”</p>\n<p>“I <i>just</i> told you—”</p>\n<p>“I’ll see you on Luna Mesa,” the devil said, and it vanished in a burst of tar bubbles.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/02/25/podcastle-880-tales-from-the-vaults-kiki-hernandez-beats-the-devil/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 879: The Tawlish Island Songbook of the Dead</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated PG-13</p>\n<h3>The Tawlish Island Songbook of the Dead</h3>\n<p/><p>The living have been leaving Tawlish for centuries; this evacuation is only the latest and last. There are good reasons for it: the freshwater spring gone brackish; the water, always encroaching; the colicky, relentless wind. No schools for the children. No doctor. We should have seen it coming, but sometimes we forget what the living need.</p>\n<p>We cannot cross salt, so we watch from shore. Our loved ones and descendants wade into the sea. The men strain to hold the boats steady against the waves. Everyone’s weighed down by possessions, a village crammed into sacks and lifeboats. Spoons, spindles, fish-hooks, balls of yarn. A clothes-peg doll in a twist of old apron. Seabirds’ eggs wrapped in blankets: habits ingrained by generations of scarcity. They’ve even dug up their potatoes.</p>\n<p>Katie Zell’s mother is already on the boat. The songbook is tucked inside her jacket.</p>\n<p>Thirty-seven people. Only some of them look back.</p>\n<p>They leave cold firepits and fulmar bones, middens, empty crofts with the thatch already collapsing. Sheep they’ve blessed and turned loose to fend for themselves.</p>\n<p>And us. The dead of Tawlish.</p>\n<p>Katie Zell’s father has been dead longer than she’s been alive. Before he drowned, he’d hoped to sing her lullabies: the ones he sang to her older brothers, the ones his grandparents sang to him. Now, in farewell, he rests his hand briefly on her curls. Most of the living are oblivious to the dead, but the Zells are a noticing kind of family.</p>\n<p>Katie raises her hand to his; perhaps she mistakes the cold brush of it for sea-spray. It’s enough. He smiles. That’s all there is time for: Katie’s uncle lifts her from the shore, over the churn of the sea, and seats her next to her cousin on the boat.</p>\n<p>Old Maureen Stornaway is furious, sees evacuation as defeat. She clenches a knuckle of island rock in her pocket. Tiny luminosities watch her from shore: the ghosts of three of her children. She strains her eyes and peers back through the sea-mist. Maybe something shines there. After decades of loss, of wishing them still with her, this is the first and last time that she almost makes them out.</p>\n<p>The rector, smug, takes nothing. He doesn’t need to. He has a house on the mainland, and — as far as he’s concerned — he’s saved thirty-seven souls.</p>\n<p>A Tawlish tradition: the living and dead send each other gifts. The living give tobacco and carved pipes, posies of sea-vetch, griddle-cake. Packets of seeds for Lizzie Knell. Wooden rattles and teething rings. Handkerchiefs embroidered with our names. They slip our gifts into the flames so that they’ll cross over to our side. Burnt offerings. The wind chases the sparks out of the sky. The gifts arrive smelling of smoke.</p>\n<p>Our gifts are less generous. All we can send are dreams.</p>\n<p>Tonight, all together, we dream safe passage for the living. Grudgingly, because they’re abandoning us; jealously, because we want them here: their songs and laughter reminding us who we are, their bones buried beside ours in the thin Tawlish soil. We dream them returning.</p>\n<p>We dream them bringing our songbook home.</p>\n<p>The songbook holds all the magic of Tawlish. Spell-songs that nudge the wind and sing fish into nets, that knit bones and heal coughs and call the drowned ashore for burial. The rector feared our spell-songs, but they made life here possible.</p>\n<p>We wish the living had left the songbook behind. Burned it as a farewell gift, perhaps. There’s no magic on the mainland, after all; the spells work nowhere but Tawlish. Perhaps we’re being childish — what use to the dead are spells for fishing and healing? — but we want it back.</p>\n<p>We miss the songs.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/02/18/podcastle-879-the-tawlish-island-songbook-of-the-dead/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 878: The Carving of War</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated R</p>\n<h3>The Carving Of War</h3>\n<p/><p>Odili was a child when Nkeala, her grandmother, died. All she remembered of her were her braids, a tangle of clouds that reached for the floor. She remembered her eyes, how they swallowed her face. To look into them was to be lost in a vastness. It was to find eyes — owl eyes, bold eyes, brown eyes — staring back at you. Most of all, she remembered her kindness, an unending sea.</p>\n<p>Nkeala had been dìbìā — keeper, to Idemili; the roaring python, they who drowned oceans, mother of mothers. At the birth of time, Idemili, like beads dancing on a fragile waist, had wound herself around the clans of Obosi. Out of her mouth, the Eke River poured, its brooks and streamlets giving sustenance to the corn in the farmlands, the antelopes of the wild and the Irokos that split the sky. Odili’s family was bound in perpetuity to Idemili. With her grandmother’s passing, the fanged staff fell to her mother, Adaugo. In the past, a few keepers had met their fate with defiance. Odili’s great-great grandfather, Agbadike, had refused the staff when it passed to him. Setting the shrine of Idemili ablaze, he invoked the ritual of blood in a bid to sever the bond that tethered his life to the deity. Three days after, a breadfruit fell from a tree and split his skull in half.</p>\n<p>Like moth to fire, Adaugo embraced the mantle of keeper. Before her twelfth birthday, she could already perform the passage rites of ancestors. Beneath the glow of a horned moon, she’d slay a ram, its body thrashing beneath her knee. Immersed in its blood, she’d wade into the Eke, bridging the fold between the living and the dead. Ancestors past would come walking through her, blessing and cursing the ones they left behind. When she was heavy with Odili, Adaugo ventured into Idemili’s mouth and emerged unscathed, spirit water coursing through her veins. One of the dwindling few, Adaugo knew the words to the eternal utterances and the anchors that held them. The clans of Obosi had revered Nkeala; Adaugo, they feared. She was power unbridled, her dedication to Idemili undying. Like her mother and keepers before her, Adaugo stayed unwed.</p>\n<p>“We are the rage of Idemili, unburdened by the constraints of love and companionship,” she’d remind Odili, “We are fire and water, we are rain and lightning, our bodies are nothing but vessels.”</p>\n<p>Still, keepers were mandated to bear offspring and preserve their line. Without a present father, a mother who in all entirety was of another realm, Odili roamed the village unchecked, her python familiar slithering beside her. More than a companion, it had become a parent, regurgitating rabbits and bush rats for her to roast and eat.</p>\n<p>When the first missionaries came to their village, Odili was drawn in by their flaky bread and the trinkets that hung from their neck, how they shimmered in the light. At the rooster’s crow, she’d run into the village, into the shack that doubled as a chapel, to watch the priests bless communion, to watch Edward. Edward was a mass server and Edward was beautiful. With her eyes, she’d follow him and when he caught her stare, she’d hold it till he flushed red and looked away. He intrigued her, the sapphire of his eyes, his hair; the burning of dawn, the way he said her name, like a song lived in the walls of his lips. When first he kissed her — a gentle kiss, his nose brushing against hers, he had closed his eyes. Odili kept hers a door, ajar.</p>\n<p>When the priests baptized her in the Eke, Odili didn’t feel new, born again, like Edward had said she would. And when she received communion, the blood of Christ sweet on her tongue, only then did her mother come raging like a flood, her screams claps of thunder.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/02/11/podcastle-878-the-carving-of-war/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 877: The Hand That Feeds</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated PG-13</p>\n<h3>The Hand That Feeds</h3>\n<p/><p>Last Christmas a mermaid died in the school swimming pool. It was only a small pool, built up at the sides with wooden panels, more like a tank for training children in. That meant it froze over very easily, but a mermaid couldn’t know that. It stood in a courtyard in the shadow of the school, and the sun reached it only at rare intervals.</p>\n<p>Behind it lurked a stone and sulking outhouse, pebbledash walls lashed together with a corrugated plastic roof. In its damp darkness the children undressed, and tripped, and snapped tight, powdered rubber caps over their skulls. Under its benches something black grew wetly out towards them. It was the hut that Freya hated most of all.</p>\n<p>Miss Wallace had caught Archie Dorrick from Upper Third belting down the corridor but she hadn’t told him off, not properly, just asked him why he needed to be rushing so quick. He said there was a mermaid dead in the pool, that it must have happened in the holidays, and Miss Wallace was so interested that she didn’t ask Archie why he had been down there on his own, which was definitely cigarettes.</p>\n<p>Miss Wallace was young and pretty and was allowed to wear any jumper she liked, unlike Freya, who was a pupil and had to wear a plain grey one like everybody else. Miss Wallace also had colourful bracelets on her arms and hair that rose up above her head and fanned out like branches. When she moved they swayed about her; the bracelets and the hair both. In the older years they had a teacher for English and a teacher for history and a teacher for comparative mythography, but Freya was only nine so Miss Wallace was her everything teacher, and she needed no other.</p>\n<p>Freya’s last teacher had been Mr Heagerty, who had folded himself into a corner of the classroom, spiderlike, and spoke to them only in riddles. His interest in the outside world was oblique at best, and he’d never once worn a bracelet or even a colourful tie. For Miss Wallace, the outside world was the whole point, it was something to push both your hands into and wiggle about. That was why Class 7C were allowed to follow her, symmetrical grey cygnets, through the hall and out the fire escape and down the iron stairway that led to the pool with the mermaid in it.</p>\n<p>The ice was frozen over most of it, a thin sheet, breakable. One arm punctured the surface, a long, grey-brown javelin that reached up and out and seized around the metal rung of the ladder in a tight fist. Frost followed up it and caught on the trail of fine hairs that sloped along its back. Freya couldn’t see down below the ice; Miss Wallace had them at a distance, she had first dibs on exploration. Freya jostled her way to the front of the group. She knew she had to be as close as was allowed.</p>\n<p>Miss Wallace stared down at the mermaid, and her hair quivered, and her breath came out in clouds. Below her the arm was stiff, and quiet, and altogether too close to her throat. In the end it was Juno Clarke who asked the question that held them all close with a ferocious anxiety. Juno asked if Miss Wallace was sure it was really dead, and Miss Wallace said yes, and everyone turned to Juno and sneered at her stupidity.</p>\n<p>Then Miss Wallace said “I can prove it,” which was something she said a lot, and she felt around inside her pockets and pulled out her fountain pen. Freya had long watched and desired that pen; it shone bronze and under Miss Wallace’s direction bled blue, looping calligraphy that far outranked Freya’s lumpen hieroglyphs. Miss Wallace took off the lid, and lifted the pen high, and then stuck it deep, deep into the mermaid’s arm.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/02/04/podcastle-877-the-hand-that-feeds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Fierce Competition Means Insanely Cheap Fares</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Regional-Train-In-Italy.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"702\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Regional-Train-In-Italy-1024x702.jpg\" alt=\"Regional Train In Italy\" class=\"wp-image-214944 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Regional-Train-In-Italy-1024x702.jpg 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Regional-Train-In-Italy-300x206.jpg 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Regional-Train-In-Italy-768x526.jpg 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Regional-Train-In-Italy-960x658.jpg 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Regional-Train-In-Italy-1080x740.jpg 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Regional-Train-In-Italy-1200x822.jpg 1200w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Regional-Train-In-Italy.jpg 1891w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Regional-Train-In-Italy.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-2\" loading=\"lazy\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p>\n<p>This is the number one reason to get excited. Italy’s state-owned railway, <strong> Trenitalia</strong>, now has a major private competitor,</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.italotreno.com/en\">, and they are in a full-on price war for passengers. The winner? You!</a></p>\n<p>This rivalry has pushed high-speed ticket prices on the most popular routes to incredible lows. We’re seeing one-way fares on the flagship <strong>Rome to Florence</strong> route for as low as <strong>$25</strong> when booked in advance for this fall. That’s less than the price of a taxi to the airport. This fierce competition makes hopping between Italy’s iconic cities more affordable than ever.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. It's Officially Faster Than Flying ✈️</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Train-Speed-Travel.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Train-Speed-Travel-1024x700.jpg\" alt=\"Train Speed Travel \" class=\"wp-image-214945 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Train-Speed-Travel-1024x700.jpg 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Train-Speed-Travel-300x205.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Train-Speed-Travel-768x525.jpg 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Train-Speed-Travel-960x656.jpg 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Train-Speed-Travel-1080x738.jpg 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Train-Speed-Travel-1200x820.jpg 1200w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Train-Speed-Travel.jpg 1897w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Train-Speed-Travel.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-3\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p>\n<p>Yes, you read that right. When you factor in getting to the airport, going through security, and then traveling from your destination airport back into the city, the train is the undisputed speed king in Italy.</p>\n<p>Take the country's busiest route: <strong> Milan to Rome</strong>. A flight is technically about an hour, but the entire door-to-door journey can easily take 4-5 hours. The high-speed </p>\n<p><i>Frecciarossa</i>train connects the city centers in just</p>\n<p><strong>2 hours and 59 minutes</strong>. You can leave your hotel in Milan after breakfast and be at the Colosseum in time for lunch. No stress, no security lines, just pure speed and convenience.</p>\n<h3><strong>3. New Routes To Underrated Fall Destinations</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Calabria-train-travel.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"766\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Calabria-train-travel-1024x766.jpg\" alt=\"Calabria train travel \" class=\"wp-image-214947 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Calabria-train-travel-1024x766.jpg 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Calabria-train-travel-300x224.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Calabria-train-travel-768x574.jpg 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Calabria-train-travel-728x546.jpg 728w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Calabria-train-travel-960x718.jpg 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Calabria-train-travel-1080x808.jpg 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Calabria-train-travel-1200x897.jpg 1200w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Calabria-train-travel.jpg 1740w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Calabria-train-travel.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-4\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p>\n<p>The best part of Italy’s rail boom is that it’s not just about the big cities. The high-speed network has recently expanded, opening up incredible, less-visited regions that are perfect for a fall trip.</p>\n<p>The new high-speed line now pushes all the way down to the “toe” of Italy's boot, making the stunning and authentic region of <strong>Calabria</strong> easier to reach than ever. Imagine zipping down to coastal towns to enjoy the last of the warm Mediterranean sun without the summer crowds. It’s a true “off the beaten path” adventure made possible by modern rail.</p>\n<h3><strong>4. The Ultimate Front-Row Seat to Fall Scenery 🍂</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scenic-Train-In-Italy.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"922\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scenic-Train-In-Italy-1024x922.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Scenic Train In Italy\" class=\"wp-image-214949 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scenic-Train-In-Italy-1024x922.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scenic-Train-In-Italy-300x270.jpg 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scenic-Train-In-Italy-768x691.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scenic-Train-In-Italy-960x864.jpg 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scenic-Train-In-Italy-1080x972.jpg 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scenic-Train-In-Italy-1200x1080.jpg 1200w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scenic-Train-In-Italy.jpg 1419w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scenic-Train-In-Italy.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-5\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p>\n<p>Traveling by train in Italy this fall is like watching a live-action painting from your window. Instead of staring at clouds from 30,000 feet, you’ll be gliding through some of the most beautiful landscapes in the world as they are draped in autumn colors.</p>\n<p>Picture this: the rolling hills of <strong>Tuscany</strong> turning golden-brown, the vineyards of <strong>Piedmont</strong> alive with the energy of the fall grape harvest, and the dramatic, misty approaches to the Alps in the north. It’s a scenic experience that a plane simply cannot offer.</p>\n<h3><strong>5.

You’re crammed into a tiny seat and charged a fortune for every bag.</p>\n<p>On Italian high-speed trains, the experience is the complete opposite. The seats are spacious, you have plenty of legroom, and there are <strong>no restrictive luggage fees</strong>. You can bring your suitcases onboard without worrying about a surprise charge at the gate. It’s a comfortable, civilized, and stress-free way to travel that lets you actually enjoy the journey.</p>\n<p>Before you book your amazing Italian rail adventure, be sure to run our essential <a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/with-dozens-of-new-travel-rules-this-1-minute-check-is-now-essential-for-every-traveler/\"> 1 Minute Trip Check</a> to get the latest entry requirements and travel advisories for your trip.</p>\n<p><strong>The Travel Off Path Advantage: Your Travel Toolkit</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/with-dozens-of-new-travel-rules-this-1-minute-check-is-now-essential-for-every-traveler/\">\n                \n                    \n                \n            \n            </a></p>\n<h3>The 1-Minute Trip Check</h3>\n<p>Our flagship tool.

We may not have had to deal with social media influencers giving their Labubus butt implants (this is <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DKgfBdAB5z2/?utm_source=ig_embed\">a thing now</a>), but it was a toxic time to be a woman. British tabloids were full of topless Page 3 girls, and we were fed a steady diet of body-shaming magazines, heroin-chic fashion and the idea that Bridget Jones, who weighed only 62kg (9st 10lb), was disgustingly fat.</p>\n<p>If you’ve forgotten how awful things were, just look online: reminders keep going viral. Last week, for example, clips of shock jock Howard Stern’s infamous 2000s “Buttaface Competition” started circulating on <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@knowyourmeme/video/7538855401803058446\">social media</a>. This was a contest to find the “best” body and “ugliest” face, which involved women parading around in bikinis with paper bags on their heads. In one clip the crowd starts mock retching as a very conventionally attractive woman takes the bag off her head. I don’t know where that woman is now, but I hope she is living her best life.</p>\n<p>Another <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2025/08/07/lifestyle/maxims-unsexiest-women-list-surfaces-with-surprising-first-place-winner/\">recently viral</a> memento from the bad old days: an 18-year-old article from the lad mag Maxim, listing the “Unsexiest Women Alive”. Sarah Jessica Parker, labelled a “Barbaro-faced broad”, was described as the “least sexy woman in a group of very unsexy women” by the 2007 list. Parker was quite understandably <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/being-voted-unsexiest-woman-alive-hurt-so-much-says-sarah-jessica-parker-as-she-cries-all-the-way-to-the-bank-6618744.html\">upset by this</a>, later saying: “It’s condemnation, it’s insane. What can I do?”</p>\n<p>The Maxim piece, which has been scrubbed from the internet, also took aim at Britney Spears, saying she had “lost the ability to perform, but gained … about 23 pounds of Funyun pudge”. While cruel, that sort of commentary was not unusual: it’s really no wonder that Spears, sexualised and picked apart her entire life, had a breakdown in 2008. In a memoir that came out in 2023, Spears wrote that shaving her head in 2007 and acting out were her ways of “<a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2023-10-18/britney-spears-shaves-head-book-the-woman-in-me\">pushing back</a>”.</p>\n<p>Spears isn’t the only star who has spoken out about the way she was treated by journalists back in the day. Last year, Kate Winslet broke down during a TV interview when she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/03/i-hope-this-haunts-you-kate-winslet-says-titanic-era-body-shamers-were-absolutely-appalling\">discussed being body-shamed</a> as a 22-year-old actor during the Titanic era. Winslet was bullied relentlessly: the Titanic director James Cameron reportedly nicknamed the actor “<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/10/kate-winslet-avatar-james-cameron-titanic-reunion-history-feud?srsltid=AfmBOopBJUscVbljOS9CDPjYA90xe1w_z-lZ3guS2HQoyeCTj5e1C5Pz\">Kate Weighs-a-Lot</a>” and the late comedian Joan Rivers, a real piece of work, <a href=\"https://people.com/health/kate-winslet-criticism-her-weight-straight-up-cruel/\">joked</a>: “If Kate Winslet had dropped a few pounds, the Titanic would never have sunk.” Rivers had form on the body-shaming front: she also once wagged her finger at Oprah Winfrey and instructed her to <a href=\"https://people.com/health/oprah-winfrey-joan-rivers-called-her-out-for-gaining-weight/\">lose 15 pounds</a>.</p>\n<p>Now it seems Victoria Beckham is to speak out about the scrutiny of her body during her Spice Girls era in an upcoming Netflix docuseries. “When you look back in hindsight at the media environment in the 90s, it was super hard,” an industry insider <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2025/08/17/entertainment/victoria-beckham-reveals-source-of-body-image-issues-sources/?_gl=1*1yunrtu*_ga*NDI3MTA0MzIzLjE3NTQzMTQxMDU.*_ga_0DZ7LHF5PZ*czE3NTU0Mzk3NTUkbzM1JGcxJHQxNzU1NDM5ODU4JGo0MSRsMCRoMA\">told Page Six</a> of the series, which comes out next month. Sources also told the outlet that the documentary “looks back on archival footage including when TV presenter Chris Evans pushed [Victoria] to be weighed live on air in 1999 – just two months after she gave birth to Brooklyn”. (<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/victoria-beckham-weighed-chris-evans-video-b2113900.html\">His verdict</a> after she got on the scales: “Not bad at all.”)</p>\n<p>“Can you imagine doing that nowadays?” Beckham asked <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/victoria-beckham-chris-evans-weigh-b2112028.html\">Vogue Australia</a> in 2022, about that televised post-partum weigh-in. Not really, no. A quarter of a century after that Evans stunt, there isn’t as much overt body shaming on mainstream media as there used to be. But that doesn’t mean that things have drastically changed for the better. Nor does it mean, as Beckham said in 2022 to Grazia, that being thin is “<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/victoria-beckham-diet-thin-curvy-b2080607.html\">old-fashioned</a>”.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/19/unsexiest-women-alive-list-body-shaming\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>‘I’m such a feminist,” <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/helen-mirren\">Helen Mirren</a> told Saga magazine, but there are some jobs a woman can’t do. To be precise: “You can’t have a woman [as James Bond]. It just doesn’t work. James Bond has to be James Bond, otherwise it becomes something else.”</p>\n    <p>Mirren is starring opposite Pierce Brosnan in the film adaptation of Richard Osman’s The Thursday Murder Club, in which they both play amateur sleuths in a care home. Happily, that is a unisex job. Brosnan might also describe himself as “such a feminist” – he has never said so explicitly, but in 2019, he said a female Bond would be “exhilarating”. However, he’s now back on team men, saying: “I’m so excited to see the next man come on the stage and to see a whole new exuberance and life for this character.” Exhilaration, excitement, exuberance: all qualities I don’t think I’ve ever seen in any Bond, across the great gamut of maleness, from Connery to Craig. But who am I to judge? Whenever 007 gets a new pen that can poison someone from 50 paces, the thrill racing through his veins might be implied by his slightly less stern visage. Truly, masculinity is an unknowable frontier.</p>\n    <p>A couple of things, before we hand the franchise over to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/feb/21/stars-shaken-stirred-amazon-deal-james-bond\">Amazon, who bought it for more than $1bn earlier this year</a>. The essential qualities of Bond are as follows: he can kill on command without conscience, except when he has a conscience; he is patriotic; he is irresistible to women; he favours discreetly tailored, monochrome clothing; he can drink neat spirits without becoming intoxicated; and he always introduces himself in reverse order, to people who tend to already know his name. None of this screams “man”, except perhaps the patriotism, if you understand emotionally charged nationalism as a drumbeat of the patriarchy. Having said that, women can serve the patriarchy just as well as men – look at Mirren. Sorry, that is totally uncalled for: her feminist membership cannot be revoked, at least not on the basis of her Bond opinions, since that would be handing 007 too much power in the realm of gender.</p>\n    <p>On a separate point: is Bond a feminist, and if he is, does that mean it’s fine for him to remain a man in perpetuity? It’s a tricky one. His value system has changed so much over the 25 films, from his early “lovable chauvinist” years to his late “anguished quester after the truth of the self” iteration, a lesser person than myself might think the masculine ideal had itself gone on a journey since it first put on a dinner jacket in 1962. That, however, is a fruitless line of analysis, since if we were to take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jamesbond\">James Bond</a> as too literal a representation of the changing social expectations of men, we’d have to conclude that they can be any which way, so long as they’re prepared to take out a minor dictator with piano wire and have a disregard for due process.</p>\n    <p>Arguably more important than any of that is what the Amazon takeover will do to the franchise, given the semi-recent history of the tech company – it invented an AI recruitment tool in 2018 that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-45809919\">effectively trained itself to prefer male candidates</a>; it was shown to have embedded sexism in its sports coverage, after <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-66508514\">Alexa didn’t know what a Lioness was</a>; and, according to employees, it has <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2023/10/amazon-jeff-bezoss-company-promoted-sexism-through-meritocracy.html\">an office culture in which you’re never not at work</a>, which automatically excludes sane people – and come on, a lot of those are going to be women. Does this sound like a safe pair of hands to take over the management of a fictional character whose arc we would hope is going to continue to bend towards gender justice? Not really, but at the same time, if Amazon did spring a female Bond on the world, and used that as feminist-washing, proof in perpetuity that none of the sexist algorithms were created deliberately, well, that would be quite annoying.</p>\n    <p>Nobody overreact, but surely what this moment in history is crying out for is a gender-fluid Bond.</p>\n    <p>Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/18/does-james-bond-have-to-be-played-by-a-man-helen-mirren-seems-to-think-so\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Kate Price is now an academic, but it was at six that she conducted her first piece of research, leaning into the cab of her father’s truck and pressing the side button of his CB radio, the black plastic hot from the sun. She spoke the name she’d heard into it, “Chicken Plucker”, and a man’s voice replied. It was her first proof that the name she’d somehow associated with being taken from her bed in the middle of the night was attached to a real person, and that perhaps he would have answers. Then her father caught her and she was too terrified to try to contact him again.</p>\n<p>Five decades on, Price has written This Happened To Me, a memoir that reads, in part, like a detective story, piecing together clues to create a picture of the horror that had been done to her as a child, as well as her path to healing. When we speak over Zoom, Price is in her office at Wellesley College, the women’s college in Massachusetts, where she researches commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) – a world away from the rural Pennsylvania town where she grew up. For as long as she can remember, Price was sexually abused by her father until she was about 12, and he left the family. What she didn’t discover until she was an adult was that he had also been drugging her and, in the middle of the night, “selling” her to men.</p>\n<p>The book, she says, “really poured out of me”. If it was difficult to write about an almost unimaginable crime, she points out this is what she does as a career. “I research child sex trafficking. I haven’t been trafficked in about 40 years – not to say that I’m healed completely, but this is a subject matter [I work on] all of the time.”</p>\n<p>Price is also used to talking about her own experience as part of her work, and has had decades of therapy, including taking part in the pioneering trauma treatment by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/sep/20/trauma-trust-and-triumph-psychiatrist-bessel-van-der-kolk-on-how-to-recover-from-our-deepest-pain\">psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk</a> in the early 90s; Kolk included Price as a case study in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/sep/20/trauma-trust-and-triumph-psychiatrist-bessel-van-der-kolk-on-how-to-recover-from-our-deepest-pain\">his bestselling book The Body Keeps the Score</a>. He was the one who first told her that her PTSD would be a lifelong condition to manage, and she does, with therapy, exercise, sleep and nutrition, as well as a steady, loving marriage. “I’m lucky to have the resources,” she says. “It’s a ton of privilege that goes into it.”</p>\n<p>Much of Price’s book is based on the decade-long investigation she worked on with the journalist Janelle Nanos, which became <a href=\"https://apps.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2022/07/kate-price-remembers-something-terrible/\">a 2022 piece for the Boston Globe</a>. “In the same way that I was able to thrive in school, I could compartmentalise, thinking this is a research project. Yes, it’s my life, but …” She doesn’t finish the thought. “I would say, actually, it was incredibly healing. My sister and I had these incredible conversations that we’d never had, that started when I was working on the article, but continued as I was working on the book. That was happy emotion, quite the opposite of this gut-wrenching stuff.”</p>\n<p>Growing up, Price witnessed the violence of their father against her older sister. Her sister, who was constantly compared unfavourably to Price, appeared to hate her. In the course of her research, Price would find out her sister had also been trafficked by their father. Price also endured their father’s physical violence; she remembers being four and hiding in cupboards when he came home from his job as an electrician, wishing it would open into Narnia, before being beaten by him. When she was six, in a rage, he carved an X on her arm with his penknife, telling her she belonged to him, then threw her down the stairs into the basement.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/18/i-was-completely-dehumanised-by-my-father-how-kate-price-uncovered-the-horrifying-truths-of-her-childhood\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Then came ‘shrinking girl summer’ – is everyone getting smaller except me?, 10 August</a>). Once again, a healthy, intelligent woman is made to feel not good enough by society because she is larger than a size 10.</p>\n    <p>Then came anger, not with Stokes but with the media and brands that propagate a culture of skinny worship. I was born with a rare physical disability and have spent years coming to terms with the way my body is. I look disabled, I have scars from operations and a spinal curve surgeons couldn’t straighten, and I use mobility aids. To me, Stokes presents as an attractive, successful, healthy woman who is non-disabled (although this is her private business) with the good fortune to have two children. I wish Stokes and others could see themselves in that vein. Granted, it took me years to be happy in my own skin and see the strengths of my body, everything I’ve been through and the pleasure it can give and receive, but it’s doable.</p>\n    <p>We are living in dark times when non-disabled women and men are wrecking their mental health and putting their physical health in danger with fad diets and weight-loss jabs, shrinking themselves to an ever-hungry and cold status to please others’ gazes and get likes on TikTok and Instagram. As a society we should be ashamed that we are engendering this, putting people at risk of eating disorders, malnutrition and mental health issues.</p>\n    <p>We only have one body and if you’re fortunate enough to have one that works properly, you’ve won the jackpot.<strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p>\n    <p>Self-loathing, shame, isolation and the desire for slenderness are not an intrinsic or inevitable aspect of being fat, as features such as Rose Stokes’ seem to suggest. They are caused by fatphobia. This has been ruthlessly exploited by weight-loss industries, including the contemporary manufacturers of GLP-1 drugs. These purveyors are not called to account when their products fail or harm their users. Instead, fat people are made to feel responsible. We should have tried harder.</p>\n    <p>For a more balanced view, I invite Guardian editors, writers and readers to consider a social movement that has been active for at least 50 years and which takes a critical view of the obesity‑industrial complex.</p>\n    <p>The scholarly field of fat studies and the public health model known as “health at every size” are offshoots. There are many of us working in these areas, providing a more nuanced and hopeful understanding of fat subjectivity.<strong>Charlotte Cooper</strong><i>London</i></p>\n    <p> Rose Stokes’ article strikes a chord across the femisphere. I would add that body dysmorphia has never been confined to women whose bodies don’t conform to skinny standards. The body-positivity movement liberated all women from these impossible strictures. It’s no coincidence that as soon as it arrived, and women began to take up more and powerful space, drugs were pumped out to make sure we take less.<strong>Danuta Kean</strong><i>Hastings, East Sussex</i></p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/15/the-dark-side-of-shrinking-girl-summer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A very long time.</p>\n    <p>My experience as a gender non-conforming 37-year-old woman is that, since I was about eight, I have been regularly mistaken for a boy or man, and that a few times a year, these incidents are deeply embarrassing to me or involve someone being openly hostile.</p>\n    <p>For example, in 2022, when flying to the US, I was detained for an enhanced search because they did not believe that I was female, as stated in my passport. I was humiliated to the point of tears, not least because I had recently shaved my head for brain surgery for a tumour and had a prominent scar.</p>\n    <p>I have long lived in a world where I expect to be mistaken for a man and feel on edge as a result. My crimes? Being 5ft 8in, slim-ish, with short hair, an angular face, a deeper voice, and preferring loose clothing. Perhaps my walk is a little confident. The chromosomes remain XX.</p>\n    <p>This isn’t about the trans or non-binary debate. The real issue is that in this country, we have an extremely reductive view of what even a biological woman should look like, sound like and dress like. To an extent, the challenge to binaries has unfortunately and bizarrely played a role in reducing the visual and social footprint of natal womanhood even further. I am regularly asked by well-meaners my pronouns too – something I find just as insulting.</p>\n    <p>The way I am is no statement, no protest, no challenge. It is simply how I have always been.

Then he sat down with Katie Miller to tell her all about his baking skills in the very first episode of her brand-new podcast. Which, by the way, I have heroically listened to all 44 excruciating minutes of so that you don’t have to.</p>\n<p>Miller, for the uninitiated, is a Maga bigwig and married to Stephen Miller, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>’s far-right chief of staff and a man so odious his own uncle once wrote an article calling him a “<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/08/13/stephen-miller-is-an-immigration-hypocrite-i-know-because-im-his-uncle-219351/\">hypocrite</a>”.</p>\n<p>A Trump loyalist, Miller has form when it comes to surrounding herself with odious men: she held top communications jobs during Trump’s first term and, earlier this year, became a spokesperson for Elon Musk’s pet project, the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge).</p>\n<p>In May, she absconded to a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-loyalist-katie-miller-crosses-battle-lines-continue-work-elon-musk-2025-07-18/\">mysterious role</a> at Musk’s private ventures. I imagine that she was attracted to Musk’s views on free speech (summed up as: I can say whatever I fancy but you can’t) because it’s been reported that when Miller was in university she once stole and threw away student newspapers because she didn’t like the <a href=\"https://www.spectatornews.com/opinion/2019/10/katie-waldmen-stole-newspapers-in-college/\">politician they endorsed</a>.</p>\n<p>Now, she’s launched the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@katiemillerpod\">Katie Miller Podcast</a>, the first episode of which came out on Monday. Why jump from the highest echelons of government into podcasting? According to Miller, <a href=\"https://x.com/KatieMiller/status/1953409168234168422\">it’s because</a> “as a mom of three young kids, who eats healthy, goes to the gym, works full-time, I know there isn’t a podcast for women like myself”.</p>\n<p>In a promo video, in which she sits cross-legged on an armchair (with shoes on!) in front of a bookshelf with three books on it, including The Great Gatsby and To Kill a Mockingbird, she explains that “there isn’t a place for conservative women to gather online” and she wanted to create a space to have “real honest conversations” about what matters to women.</p>\n<p>Apparently what matters to women is the minutiae of vice-president Vance’s life: the first 44-minute episode, which I suggest she rename <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brief_Interviews_with_Hideous_Men\">Brief Interviews with Hideous Men</a>, was devoted to fawning over a man who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/31/jd-vance-podcast-feminism-immigration\">said</a> professional women “choose a path to misery” when they prioritize careers over children.</p>\n<p>Miller, who is not a natural host, awkwardly serves softball questions (“is a hotdog a sandwich?”) while Vance drones on about what a great daddy and vice-president he is and how much he loves ice-cream and joking around with Marco Rubio. The closest they get to a controversial topic is Vance talking about all the memes he’s inspired and saying that one of his favourites features the pope, Usha Vance and a couch. (There have been online jokes that Vance was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/04/jd-vance-critics-trump-vp\">intimate with a couch</a> and that he <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/post/194199/jd-vance-kill-pope-francis-investigation\">killed the pope</a>.) There is also light mockery of Late Show host Stephen Colbert, whose show recently got <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/18/stephen-colbert-late-show-ending-trump\">cancelled</a>.</p>\n<p>Other than the memes, the most memorable moment of the episode is when Miller seems to imply that her husband subsists entirely on a diet of mayonnaise, like some sort of anaemic vampire. Stephen Miller also apparently runs around his house with his shoes on, as does JD. Usha, sensibly, takes her shoes off at the front door. All of this is exactly the sort of content I’m sure the busy mums are desperate for.</p>\n<p>Miller has said she thinks there is a gap in the market for podcasts aimed at conservative women, but the market says otherwise. While young women in the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/aug/07/gen-z-voters-political-ideology-gender-gap\">tend to be progressive</a>, there is a thriving “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/24/womanosphere-conservative-women\">womanosphere</a>” of anti-feminist media aimed at conservatives. Some of these outlets don’t explicitly cater to young conservative mums in the way that the Katie Miller Podcast says it does, but they’re still aiming for the same general demographic.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/14/katie-miller-podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Between cross-country flights, <a href=\"https://isabelleeyman.substack.com/p/what-the-dying-teach-the-living\">caregiving for my father</a>, and toggling between Oregon and New England, I felt suspended. It was like living in two worlds at once, never fully grounded. As the season shifts, I’m not just welcoming cooler air and longer shadows—I’m noticing the crispness in the mornings, the golden light spilling across my Portland streets, and how the sunlight catches in my eyes in a way that makes me feel fully awake again. I’m craving a September reset: a return to rhythm, <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/health/healthy-habits/founder-wellness-rituals/\">to rituals</a>, and to a steadiness that feels like home.</p>\n<p>Fall has always been my season of becoming. Summer’s spontaneity is beautiful in its own way, but it can leave me untethered, spinning from one thing to the next. This year, my intention isn’t to return to who I was before. It’s to step into someone new: rooted, aligned, and intentional. My September reset is made up of small adjustments that help me find my footing again. These aren’t grand gestures or sweeping overhauls, but everyday practices that remind me I can always start anew.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=How to Reset This September (Without Overhauling Your Whole Life)&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/september-reset/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/drinking-coffee-fireplace-865x1296.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>How to Approach Your September Reset</h2>\n<p>A September reset doesn’t mean completely overhauling your life or chasing a brand-new version of yourself. After a summer that had me juggling travel and constant transitions, I’ve realized the most meaningful shifts are subtle, small adjustments that help me feel centered and steady. They’re the practices I return to when I want to feel like a real and complete person again. (Not someone who’s—frantically, chaotically—going through the motions.)</p>\n<p>Think of this reset as a gentle guide rather than a checklist. The goal isn’t perfection—it’s alignment and a sense of reconnecting with your authentic self as the days grow cooler and the season turns.</p>\n<h2>10 Simple Changes to Inspire Your September Reset</h2>\n<p>As I step into fall, I’m focusing on the everyday practices that help me return to myself—clearing space, inviting presence, and creating the consistency I’ve been craving. They’re not about reinventing my life, but about realigning with it in ways that feel manageable, meaningful, and (spoiler!) completely within reach.</p>\n<h3>1. Clear Space at Home</h3>\n<p>After a summer of <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/fashion/2-week-carry-on-packing-list/\">suitcases</a> and scattered piles, I need blank surfaces and organized drawers. The chaos of caregiving and travel left my home feeling more like storage than sanctuary. I’m starting small: a 20-minute tidy before bed, tackling one drawer at a time, and creating little pockets of calm.</p>\n<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Pick one surface and clear it completely. This could be your nightstand, desk, kitchen counter, etc. Notice how that small change improves your energy.</p>\n<h3>2. Reclaim Morning Rituals</h3>\n<p>This summer, my mornings belonged to everyone but me. Early flights (or recovering from late ones), appointments, and unpredictable schedules made starting the day with intention impossible. Now, I wake a bit earlier to make coffee, journal, or sit quietly by the window. Even five mindful minutes can anchor my day.</p>\n<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Before reaching for your phone, take a few deep breaths and ask yourself: How do I want to move through today?</p>\n<h3>3. Cook with the Season</h3>\n<p>After months of takeout and eating on the go, I’m craving meals that ground me. Not only that, but I miss the way shopping at the farmer’s market would make me feel connected, both to my local community and to myself. September markets are full of squash, apples, and late-summer tomatoes. Cooking with <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/fall-seasonal-vegetables/\">these ingredients</a> feels like reestablishing roots, nourishing both body and soul.</p>\n<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Choose one seasonal recipe this week that invites slowness, like <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/best-roasted-root-vegetables/\">roasting vegetables</a> or baking bread.</p>\n<h3>4. Move with Intention</h3>\n<p>This summer, I often pushed through exhaustion with long, intense workouts, thinking that more miles or higher intensity was the only way to feel strong. Now, as I <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/marathon-training/\">train for my marathon</a>, I’m learning to honor movement that feels purposeful and restorative: a focused run at a comfortable pace, a barre class to stretch and build strength, or a <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/walking-for-mental-health/\">mindful walk </a>through my neighborhood. Movement has become about experiencing presence in my body, not just sweat. It’s a practice that grounds me while still challenging me.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/september-reset/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

So it should come as no surprise that we cook a lot during our off hours too.</i> <i>Here are  the recipes we’re whipping up this month to get dinner on the table, entertain our friends, satisfy a sweet tooth, use up leftovers, and everything in between. For even more staff favorites,</i> </p>\n<p><i/></p>\n<h2>September 5</h2>\n<p>Shilpa Uskokovic’s <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/tiramisu-basque-cheesecake\">Basque-style tiramisu cheesecake</a> looks like the most complex dessert. In reality, it’s a simple batter that’s split in two. One half is adulterated with instant espresso and cocoa, and then the halves are layered in a single pan so they swirl together, baking into a marbled mélange of cream and coffee. A splash of Marsala wine drives home the tiramisu theme (I swapped in sweet vermouth, which I usually use for tiramisu too since I always have it for <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/manhattan-drink-cocktail\">Manhattans</a>). Don’t skip the mascarpone topping. It might seem excessive, but the contrast between dense, custardy cheesecake and ethereal mousse-like topping is kind of the whole point. —<i>Joe Sevier, senior editor, cooking and SEO</i></p>\n<p>It might be September, but I’m still swimming in tomatoes and corn. I came across this recipe from <a href=\"https://maxbaroni.substack.com/\">Max Baroni</a> for a simple butter bean and tomato <a href=\"https://maxbaroni.substack.com/p/roasted-tomatoes-w-lemony-butter\">salad</a> that was super easy to make. I liked everything together, but the star of the show was the vinegar-marinated roasted tomatoes. The sherry vinegar brought out the tomatoes’ natural sweetness, and I found myself grabbing my leftovers to put on toast with the yogurt sauce. I’m making the salad again before the season is over for a savory-sweet breakfast that instantly sparks joy. <i>— Urmila Ramakrishnan, associate director of social media</i></p>\n<p>This content can also be viewed on the site it <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DNbFFPtN_fR\">originates</a> from.</p>\n<p>There’s nothing like a summer tomato (we know them, we love them) but I raise you a summer <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/tomato-martini\">tomato martini</a>. In the past I’ve tossed together a version of my own with juices leftover from tomatoes I’ve salted and left to sit for use in another dish, but when Jesse Szewczyk’s recipe went live, I almost immediately headed to the farmers market. His recipe calls for muddling sweet Sun Gold tomatoes and fresh basil, plus a smidge of salt and sugar until juicy; then stirring in gin, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/yes-you-should-be-using-vermouth-in-your-martinis?srsltid=AfmBOopMqVh9Jmh-_ZWPGxKjaQTX6LuVNmXkKr6zmGUG215BuDpUu6lx\">vermouth</a>, and ice until well-chilled. I strained the drink into a glass with a large ice cube—I like martinis on the rocks, don’t sue!—and was delighted. Unlike the extra-dirty martini trend we can’t seem to escape, a tomato martini hits an ideal balance of salty-sweet and savory without overpowering the gin or tasting like an olive jar. I know the “perfect” martini already exists as a concept, but this is a pretty flawless way to toast to the end of summer. <i>— Rebecca Firkser, contributing editor</i></p>\n<p>Now that it’s officially September, I intend to grill as many nights as possible while the sun is still high in the sky at dinnertime and the weather is, at least this week, perfect. And when it comes to grilling fish, swordfish is one of my absolute favorites. It’s meatier and less delicate than other fish, so it takes well to the grill without having to worry about the skin sticking or the fillet falling apart. I love this recipe for <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/10046-grilled-marinated-swordfish-steaks\">Grilled Marinated Swordfish Steaks</a>, which requires only 10 to 15 minutes of marinating in soy sauce, red wine vinegar, spices, and aromatics before throwing the fish on the grill (for just a few minutes per side). The recipe calls for serving with a string bean salad, but I paired it with a medley of grilled vegetables (peppers! eggplant! zucchini! onion!) and it was the perfect Labor Day dinner. <i>— Kate Kassin, editorial operations manager</i></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/recipes-bon-appetit-editors-cooked-september-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Behind her, the bombed-out ruins of Mariupol’s maternity hospital. More than a dozen people, including women in labour, were injured in the attack in March 2022. The woman photographed, Iryna Kalinina, later died along with her unborn baby.</p>\n<p>In the three years since then, maternity care in Ukraine has remained under constant attack, with <a href=\"https://www.attacksonhealthukraine.org/\">more than 2,000 strikes on medical facilities</a>, including 81 affecting maternal care and delivery rooms. Just last month, Diana Koshyk, seven months pregnant, was killed when a missile struck a maternity hospital in the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region.</p>\n<p>Over the past month, the Guardian has visited three maternity hospitals on the frontline to witness how Russia’s full-scale invasion and attacks on healthcare facilities have taken away women’s fundamental right to a safe childbirth.</p>\n<p>At each hospital, women and the staff working there face terrible danger: circling drones, artillery, ballistic missiles and the targeted degradation of healthcare infrastructure.

As the windows were blown in and glass sprayed across beds, the women – some pregnant, others with newborns and one in active labour – were rushed across the river to a perinatal centre for urgent medical care. All were suffering from shock, but the woman in labour needed an urgent caesarean section. Staff operated quickly and mother and baby survived.</p>\n<p>Such bombardment has become all too common in Kharkiv, which has been under heavy and sustained attack since the first hours of the war. In June, the city was hit with the largest number of attacks since the full-scale invasion began. At the perinatal centre now taking care of women, doctors say they have delivered babies in the middle of air attacks, and carried out surgery while bouncing up and down from the impact of explosions.</p>\n<p>The city itself is heavily scarred by war. Broken glass lines the pavements outside the hospital, while two buildings opposite lie derelict after suffering damage. The centre’s windows are filled with sandbags, their plastic panes crossed with tape to contain any breakage. Power cuts are routine, with caesareans having been carried out by torchlight in the past.</p>\n<p>It is a lot of stress to contend with if you are pregnant. Doctors say they have seen medical complications and breakdowns – one new mother refused to take her child home after she learned her husband had been killed at the front. The hospital now employs a psychologist to help ease the fears of women who are reluctant to even come to the hospital due to the risk it could be hit.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/21/russia-ukraine-war-childbirth-demographics-targeting-attacks-maternity-hospitals-kharkiv-sloviansk-khersonbirth-crisis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>There are plenty of places where no one would bat an eyelid at the sight of a thong bikini; on a beach in Brazil or around the Love Island fire pit, visible butt cheeks are practically de rigueur. But my first sighting this year was not while surfing in Australia or sunbathing in the Caribbean, but at an open-water swimming spot, on a rainy day in Scotland.</p>\n<p>I should not have been surprised. Tiny swimwear is huge news this summer. It is no longer confined to sunny climes, but cropping up everywhere from lidos to leisure centres – and lochs, apparently.</p>\n<p>The trickle down from catwalks and influencers to holidaymakers and shoppers is notable. A search for “thong bikini” on Asos yields 187 results, ranging from high-leg styles, to side-tie, to tanga (somewhere between a thong and a standard brief), while high-street outlets including <a href=\"https://www2.hm.com/en_gb/ladies/shop-by-product/swimwear.html?clothingStyles=Thong\">H&amp;M</a>, <a href=\"https://www.calzedonia.com/uk/women/swimwear_and_beachwear/bikini_bottoms/thongs/\">Calzedonia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.zara.com/uk/en/woman-beachwear-l1052.html?v1=2418954\">Zara</a> all have thong bikini bottoms in their collections. And, as with any trend, there are plenty of celebrity forerunners, including gymnast <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DMd73FqRwHD/?img_index=1\">Simone Biles</a>, model <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DMVhs0Mxoj4/\">Heidi Klum</a>, actor <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14606647/Sofia-Vergara-bottom-bikini-poolside.html\">Sofía Vergara</a> and singer <a href=\"https://sg.news.yahoo.com/nicole-scherzinger-celebrates-turning-47-124500796.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJCrmLdZgtXinISpG1B2-Sw4c7NTzL0WwFs_gCh4j8fHb3BJqXJxovFTgVdSLZWoeY0ImCud7bFZShAbLmsxEimPNxuyAnCZv0RRuw0cPAkBsQTgLyrUJTmppxBNG4mtX0PjwkxVlAmT0x5q3VN8htUOC2W-lngR7WJYlBX1_LTC\">Nicole Scherzinger</a>. Rapper <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DKCnqqWR0V6/?hl=en\">Lizzo</a> is a longtime fan.</p>\n<p>“I won’t lie, it was nerve-racking initially,” says Victoria, 29, who wore a thong bikini for the first time on a recent solo trip to Naples. As for many new converts, part of the appeal lay in the fact that she would be able to avoid the significant tan lines created by fuller coverage swimwear. “I saw thong bikinis everywhere and wished I could wear one. But then I thought about it and was like, it’s just a bum. Men wear those teeny-tiny trunks where you see everything, so why can’t I wear this? Plus, it was really comfy.”</p>\n<p>The itsy-bitsy bikini revolution may have come to the fore this summer, but it has been rumbling for some time. In 2023, the New York Times declared that “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/16/style/g-string-thong-trend.html\">more women are adopting the ‘less is more’ philosophy</a>” when it comes to beachwear; the same year, fashion site Who What Wear called thong bikinis the “<a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/uk/thong-swimwear\">controversial swimwear trend you’ll see on every beach this summer</a>”. In 2024, New Zealand site The Spinoff asked: “<a href=\"https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/20-01-2024/why-is-every-bikini-bottom-a-thong-now\">Why is every bikini bottom a thong now?</a>”</p>\n<p>“I think we’ve moved into another age of body consciousness – a much more expressive moment,” says Shaun Cole, associate professor in fashion at the University of Southampton. “People are saying: ‘It’s my body and I can show it off in ways that I choose to, and if that involves wearing clothing that is sometimes deemed socially unacceptable then I’m going to do that.’”</p>\n<p>Gen Z, in particular, are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/aug/12/the-new-taboo-how-flattering-became-fashions-ultimate-f-word\">less inclined to restrict themselves</a> to clothes deemed to be “flattering” – a term that has fallen spectacularly out of favour. Thong bikinis, once the preserve of those who conformed to a particular body type, are now being manufactured in a more inclusive range of sizes and marketed more diversely.</p>\n<p>“Women of all shapes and sizes are leaning into bolder cuts with real confidence as part of a wider cultural shift towards body positivity and self-expression, which is great to see,” says Aliya Wilkinson, founder of luxury <a href=\"https://www.osale-plage.com/\">swimwear label Ôsalé</a>. Her brand doesn’t yet offer thong styles, but she plans to introduce them in the future.</p>\n<p>“In the west, fashion has long found ways to augment the butt, to make it look bigger and put emphasis on this part of the female body,” says Roberta Sassatelli, professor of sociology at the University of Bologna and co-author of <a href=\"https://www.politybooks.com/bookdetail?book_slug=9781509550074\">Body and Gender</a>. “This is perhaps because the butt is deemed to be very sensual but is not related to reproduction. Because it is totally related to pleasure, it feels more liberated.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/21/the-thong-bikini-boom-why-the-skimpiest-swimwear-is-back-and-suddenly-mainstream\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>It’s summer reading time, and I have finally dived into Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s Dream Count, her highly anticipated return to fiction after a 12-year hiatus. This week, I give a review of sorts – what was most striking about the work is how it feels of a certain time, and how Adichie is an icon who sits between two eras.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Feminist icon to pop culture artefact?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Dream Count is as much a book as it is a publishing event. In the years between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/15/americanah-chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-review\">her previous novel, Americanah</a> – a book so successful that it has made the New York Times’s list of the best fiction of the 21st century – and her latest offering, Adichie became a cultural figurehead. Dream Count returns to the themes that Adichie is in greatest command of: an existence that sits between living in Africa and living in the diaspora. The Covid pandemic acts as a backdrop to the lives of four female protagonists, and between them there are the roiling affairs of the heart, disappointments and assaults and bodily wreckage whose collective toll starts to be felt, or “counted”, in middle age.</p>\n<p>The central figure is modelled on Nafissatou Diallo, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/27/strauss-kahn-affair-backstory\">allegedly assaulted in 2011 in a hotel room</a> by the French economist Dominique Strauss-Kahn. It is a “gesture of returned dignity”, Adichie says in her author’s note. But it is also an example of how the author always leans into the sharp and jagged realities of womanhood, with no desire to smooth its edges. Adichie is, above all, a a matter-of-fact narrator of bodily ravages: bad<strong> </strong>sex, small penises, postpartum injuries, fibroids and heavy bleeding. This is my favourite quality of Adichie’s. She doesn’t traffic in banalities or <a href=\"https://confluence.gallatin.nyu.edu/context/interdisciplinary-seminar/the-magical-negro-trope-in-literature-and-film\">idealisation of Black women</a> as poetically and magically tragic or noble. They just are.</p>\n<p>In Dream Count, Adichie’s style is as confident and singular as ever. Almost too much so. Her strong voice inserts itself into the mouths of her protagonists, who sometimes pronounce things that only she writes, rather than what regular people say: “Each day with Chuka,” one character narrates, “I encountered his otherness.” Ultimately, the reader always feels in safe hands. This novel is about intersecting female relationships in a female universe of voices and points of view, and there is something cosy and mutually affirming in that.</p>\n<p>Yet it also feels artificial (which is the writer’s prerogative, after all, to construct their narrative world), as if these characters were performing some grand allegory of a woman’s arc. I found myself thinking: just let them speak! Just let me embrace these women you have so tenderly portrayed. Which brings me to my main sense of the book: it felt like a series of set pieces, rather than a coherent work of fiction; an extended commentary on gender relations and societal expectations of women. I didn’t feel carried along, more an audience to strong but disconnected accounts and introspections.</p>\n<p>There is something in this that may be related to the moment that transformed Adichie from a literary sensation to a pop culture behemoth. Her book-length essay We Should All Be Feminists, a landmark treatise on, well, why we should all be feminists, became a totem of a particular era of mid-00s trends. It was the time of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/13/lean-in-sheryl-sandberg-review\">Lean In</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/apr/21/girlboss-review-netflix-sophia-amoruso-britt-robertson\">Girl Bosses</a> and a broader fourth-wave feminism that revived the movement through online activism, #MeToo, and women’s marches.</p>\n<p>Audio excerpts from Adichie’s Ted Talk on feminism were picked up by Beyoncé and featured in her 2013 hit Flawless. Dior <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/fashion/news/a43431/dior-we-should-all-be-feminists-shirt-rihanna-charity/\">designed T-shirts with “We should all be feminists”</a> printed on them. It was a weird time. Adichie was a perfect icon for that moment: strident, smart but also glamorous – marrying liberal progressive politics on gender with accessibility. She became the <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2016/12/chimamanda-adichie-on-black-hair-and-redefining-beauty.html\">face of the beauty brand No 7</a>, was on Vanity Fair’s <a href=\"\">best-dressed list</a>, and embraced fashion and beauty <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/28/fashion/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-boots-no7-makeup.html\">as a rebuke</a> to those who see them as somehow diminishing women’s intellect.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-10\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/aug/19/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-author-dream-count-writer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>“Marriage is a business deal and it always has been.” So says Dakota Johnson’s Lucy, an elite Manhattan matchmaker in Celine Song’s second feature, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/materialists\">Materialists</a>. Lucy may be a modern woman, but her world looks eerily similar to the marriage mart of Jane Austen’s day. For Lucy and her clients, it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife. Or rather, a “high quality woman”, as Lucy would unironically put it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jun/10/materialists-review-celine-song\">Materialists </a>drops us head first into a world where coupling off with a partner is a purely financial endeavour; where foolish notions of love are not merely ignored, but deemed to be irrelevant; where women must choose passion or practicality.</p>\n<p>If all of this sounds rather archaic or even regressive, that’s because it is. And Song knows it. After all, she frequently cites Jane Austen, specifically Pride and Prejudice, as one of her biggest inspirations for the film: “What an amazing fantasy Pride and Prejudice is, because in that story, the love of your life is also the answer to all your practical problems,” she said to <a href=\"https://www.curzon.com/journal/celine-song-materialists-interview/\">Curzon</a>.</p>\n<p>Just as this year’s best picture winner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/03/anora-review-sean-baker-screwball-cinderella-tale-vaults-him-towards-greatness-mikey-madison\">Anora</a> was widely viewed as the anti-Pretty Woman for flipping the fantasy of the rich-guy-falls-for-sex-worker-and-whisks-her-out-of-poverty on its head, Materialists functions as a sort of anti-Pride and Prejudice. As Song notes, Austen’s beloved novel offers a similar fantasy: that the man you love might also be the answer to your practical financial problems.</p>\n<p>In Materialists, as in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/anora\">Anora</a>, the fantasy doesn’t quite play out. Not that Lucy is naive enough to expect it to. No, this heroine is all practicality and sense. “I will die alone or marry a rich man,” she says with resignation at the beginning of the film. This businesslike approach to love doesn’t just come from her day job: she has been burned by passionate love in the past: her ex-boyfriend John is a 37-year-old waiter who, despite having the face of Chris Evans, can’t seem to make it as an actor.</p>\n<p>She gets her chance at the dream marriage of convenience when she meets Harry, an uber rich guy who seems nice enough and has a $12m apartment. He is, her colleague says enviously, a “unicorn”. This is another unexpected echo of Anora – when Ani, a sex worker looking for a way out of poverty, meets and marries a wealthy young Russian, Vanya, her colleague, also envious, snarks, “Oh, you caught your whale”.</p>\n<p>Each of these reverse fantasies are driven by heroines who are adamantly uninterested in romance. It marks new territory. Even in Austen’s day, heroines clung to the fantasy of a love match despite the practical realities of their time. And we progressed from there. The early screwball romcoms of the 1930s and 40s brought us headstrong heroines, while the 80s and 90s screen romances were filled with “working girls” who were independent, self-sufficient women. Now, it seems, we are entering a new era defined by heroines who openly, proudly proclaim their desire for a practical match – an era of young women who have given up on love.</p>\n<p>Fascinatingly, this is playing out in the real world, too. For a generation of young heterosexual women, a “unicorn” or a “whale” is seen as the ultimate prize. “Watching Materialists when the poor man propaganda wins and Lucy picks a broke 37-year-old failed actor over rich, loving Harry who would give her the world,” one person wrote in a TikTok <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@livetheedream/video/7516269301712719134\">video</a> in response to Materialists that scored more than 22,000 likes. “I will <i>not</i> fall for broke guy propaganda, she fumbled <i>hard</i>,” another <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@nellajoelsgf/video/7517366589998763266\">wrote</a> – also liked more than 22,000 times.

I was doing sit-ups when, suddenly, the left side of my body was overtaken by tingling. A colorful corona bloomed in my left eye. I found it hard to speak. My wife drove me to the emergency room. There was a cardiology investigation. Then there were others. I got a neurologist, and then a gastroenterologist. I started getting monthly blood tests. Doctors scanned my brain and tested my nerves. Each test showed me to be in good health. And yet symptoms of <i>something</i> have persisted. Where I live, family doctors are hard to come by, so I’ve been required to piece together my own care. My wife provides tremendous emotional support, but we’re not all so fortunate. Where, then, should we look for solace? Viola Zhou’s mother has lived with chronic kidney problems for two decades. As China’s aging population puts increased pressure on the nation’s healthcare infrastructure, Zhou’s mother has seen her marriage fracture and her daughter leave the country. In her isolation, she has turned to DeepSeek, an AI-powered chatbot, for medical guidance, tasking it with interpreting her medical records, changing her diet, and reducing her immunosuppressant dose. She warmly thanks the chatbot, and it responds in kind. Zhou brings her mother’s chat records to specialists, who point out the errors in Dr. DeepSeek’s responses. And yet Zhou’s mother dismisses the shortcomings. “DeepSeek is more humane,” she tells Zhou. “Doctors are more like machines.” These days, there is no shortage of stories about people in crisis who turn to AI for support, sometimes to perilous ends. Zhou’s feature reminds us that such stories are symptoms—of technological limits, isolation, and dysfunctional healthcare systems. —<a href=\"https://longreads.com/author/fitzheraldtribune/\">BF</a></p>\n<h2>2. <a href=\"https://www.nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/god-dog/?src=longreads\">God Dog</a></h2>\n<p><i>Mina Tavakoli</i> | <i>n+1</i> | <i>September 2, 2025</i> | <i>3,089 words</i></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/09/05/the-top-5-longreads-of-the-week-577/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It was here.”Outside, it looks just like one of the many small towns we wind our way through, halting for a week or two to put up a show. It has been raining for days. The university dome in the distance glistens with dark moss against the ponderous sky. The fairground is all mud, sludge and clumps of grass, sucking in our tent posts like a fumbling, ungainly monster. A group of local men, hired to dry up enough ground to put up the main circus tent, have been working since the morning. So why does this miserable earth feel like a familiar taste, again?We wonder if Johuree would like a cup of tea. He agrees. There is no milk, but he sips the dark brown brew in silence.We watch.“There is a cottage at the far end of the town. Little more than ruins now, I presume. Would you like to visit?”Johuree never goes anywhere. We don”t recall him ever stepping out into the daylight. We don”t recall much anything. Though we travel far and wide with the circus, we have never left the camp site and gone “sightseeing”, as some others in the troupe are in the habit of doing.</p>\n<p>Nor has he.</p>\n<p>“He was my friend. My brother. We had fought together through our darkest hour.”</p>\n<p>Johuree never reminisces, the least of all about family. We are not sure if there is anything to reminisce. He shifts his bulk upon the faded patchwork rug that is the only seat for guests in our tent. He places the empty cup and plate delicately on the floor.</p>\n<p>We sit on wooden chairs set against the mirror and the dressing table. We nod.</p>\n<p>“Well, then. We leave after lunch and return by sundown. I will send Bansiram out to find a pair of hooded raincoats for you . ”</p>\n<p>After he leaves, we fiddle around our tent, grappling with the thought.</p>\n<p>Eventually, Elia speaks, “Our . . . father.”</p>\n<p>“Should we put on our makeup?” says Sascha.</p>\n<p>“He didn’ t say. ”</p>\n<p>“He didn ‘ t say not to.”</p>\n<p>That is a fact. We never leave the tent without our makeup. But then, we never leave to go anywhere but up on the stage.</p>\n<p>“What if we dress up as one of each?” Elia suggests. “You take the light one, I take the dark.”</p>\n<p>This sounds reasonable. Sounds like the way we think people in the non-circus world might dress.</p>\n<p>Our efforts meet Johuree’ s approval. We are less sure that his silver ringmaster jacket is the appropriate attire for a visit to the dead. But we do not know what is, so we hold our judgement.</p>\n<p>“Going out, babu saab?”</p>\n<p>Wading through the mud towards us is one of the men working on the ground. Soaked, mud-splattered kurta pajama lingers against translucent skin that stretches tight over his bones. The man sucks vigorously at a sodden beedi.</p>\n<p>“Just taking the children out for a walk. Bit of sightseeing.”</p>\n<p>“Some weather for sightseeing.”</p>\n<p>“Not likely to improve any time soon, is it?” Johuree displays his teeth.</p>\n<p>The man stares at us. We recede under the hoods of our oversized raincoats.</p>\n<p>Then he smiles. “Let me come with you. I know the town well – places to see, things of interest.”</p>\n<p>“A generous offer, but really—”</p>\n<p>The man picks up our pace. “Which places would you like to visit? The university? Some of our magnificent—”</p>\n<p>“Another day, perhaps,” Johuree is curt, impatient. “This afternoon we will just pay a visit to the Padri Sahib ‘s house.”</p>\n<p>“On that account, I’ m afraid you are about ten years too late. The Padri Sahib is long dead. There is nothing left of his house and garden but weeds and mud. And a grave.”</p>\n<p>“Then my children will look at weeds, mud and a grave.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/04/22/podcastle-888-tales-from-the-vaults-this-sullied-earth-our-home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 887: “The Cuckoo of Vrežna Mountain</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated PG-13</p>\n<h3>The Cuckoo of Vrežna Mountain</h3>\n<p/><p>I realised I was in love with Ivor the day he went up the mountain to speak with the goddess.</p>\n<p>We were at that age when the affectionate ease of childhood tips over into something different, when every touch could be the casual brush of friendship or something more and I would never know in advance which was which. There were many times, in those days, when Ivor would take my hands in his, larger and warmer and smooth with the orange-blossom oil he rubbed into them; and I would jerk away with some hasty apology and adjust my trousers while he was not looking. To this day, I find the smell of oranges arousing at the most inopportune times, of which, in a town known for its citrus trees, there are uncomfortably many.</p>\n<p>Which is to say that it was not entirely unexpected, this matter of my being in love with him, except insofar as I had never considered the option until it was upon me; and if we had been boys further up the coast, away from the Oracle and her mountain, perhaps this would have been a cause for celebration: the sort of slow exploration of love and youth that ends, mutually, in a friendship deeper than it was before.</p>\n<p>But Ivor was a scion of the city Vrežna, and his mother Silva was a devout woman. Her ways were the old ways, and that was why I awoke early one morning to climb a mountain with Ivor and wait out the dew, wait out the dawn, wait out the moment he emerged from the goddess’s temple a betrothed man.</p>\n<p>The temple stood facing the sea, the bulk of the mountain shielding it from the town below. It was a simple structure, columned and open to the elements with a tall pointed roof. Inside, the floor was given over to a shallow pool of water that was a hand deep at most. There was no altar. The Oracle did not accept gifts.</p>\n<p>Ivor splashed through the water like a man born to the task. Silva and I remained outside, but the demarcation was immaterial. The Oracle’s temple was curiously small. It was easy to see everything that went on inside. Vrežna’s people claim that only those born within sight of her mountain could see the Oracle’s physical form. I do not know if this is true. I do know that until that day, until I looked at the thing slumped at Ivor’s feet, I had never seen anything in the temple.</p>\n<p>It was a woman, slumped against the shallow steps rimming the pool. Her skin was the same light brown as Ivor’s but mottled with pale splotches, like someone had spilled ink that sapped colour rather than granted it. Her open eyes were an even grey. She looked as though dead, I thought, until her lips opened around an indrawn breath.</p>\n<p>“How strange,” Silva said to me, and it took me a moment to realise that she was not looking inside the temple, not speaking of the woman lying there, “to stand with one of the Godless on the Oracle’s mountain. Or perhaps three dead gods is not enough for you? Would you strike down our Vrežna, given the chance?”</p>\n<p>She said it as if she had not herself stamped the permission form that allowed a non-Vrežni access to the mountain.</p>\n<p>“Two dead gods,” I murmured. “The third survives.”’</p>\n<p>“Even worse! Yours are not the only people to suffer the death of a deity, nor would you have been the only ones to seek out new beliefs, but to willingly abandon a living god? <i>That</i> is why they call you Godless.”</p>\n<p>This was a game she played with me. Once, I had been a playing piece: a child of the Godless brought to Vrežna by a dying father, the perfect subject for a performance of generosity. She’d taken me in, raised with me her son, never in anything like brotherhood but as an ornament, to single her out in the crowded world of Vrežna society.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/04/15/podcastle-887-the-cuckoo-of-vrezna-mountain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We only have the one left, and most people would not appreciate having it gone.”</p>\n<p>“Some might, though.” Above them, the ceiling fan whirls, valiantly trying to assuage the heat. The maintenance company, when Houyi called, gave the next available date for fixing the air conditioning as Monday, which — while not too far away — is crucially not today. “The tanuki pack in Arlington Heights or all those hipster vamp kids in Logan Square, I’m sure they’d come down to personally thank me. Besides, I didn’t say I was going to kill the sun. Just rough it up a little, teach it a few lessons about respect.”</p>\n<p>“A truly terrifying prospect. Gods and men tremble at your approach, naught but the bravest of heroes can dare but stand when you draw near.” On her Sudoku puzzle, Chang’E pencils in a seven, frowns, and then erases it. “Humans have lived thousands of years without air conditioning, Houyi. We can survive a few days.”</p>\n<p>“Aiyah, but that was thousands of years ago, before we had electricity and coal and acid in our rain. This sun’s been getting far too bold, I say. In the old days, I would already have a fast mount and a full quiver to chase the whelp down.”</p>\n<p>“If you are mulling over old battles,” Chang’E says, “perhaps it would be better if you had something else to occupy your mind.” Placing her Sudoku book on the coffee table, she stands up. “I have a task for you, my husband.”</p>\n<p>The effects of these words are instant. “A task, is it? Well! Let’s have it. What is it you need, my best beloved? The first fallen feather from a newborn phoenix, a sprig of new buds from the world tree, the last dried slices from this millennia’s crop of divine peaches on Kunlun Mountain?”</p>\n<p>“Something like that.” Chang’E takes her purse off the wall hook, smooths down an errant wrinkle in her dress. “We are in need of groceries once more, my beloved. I would appreciate your help in seeing this task to completion.”</p>\n<p>“In this weather? Do you care so little for your husband that you would have him roasted to ashes?”</p>\n<p>“I care enough for my husband that I would not have him starve, yes. Besides, we’ll be spending most of the time indoors, and the stores have air conditioning.”</p>\n<p>“The trials we must brave in this cruel world,” Houyi says, sighing as he reaches for his cane. “To think that after all our years of service, this is how the world repays its heroes of lore: with broken air conditioning and technicians unavailable until Monday.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t forget to put on sunscreen,” Chang’E says, checking her sunhat in the hallway mirror. “You may have bested his brothers before, but the sun is still a formidable foe.”</p>\n<p>Houyi, dutifully trundling their shopping cart across narrow sidewalks and cracked asphalt, is sweating by the time they reach Tai Hwa Market. On instinct, he reaches for a chilled Tsinghua to place in their cart.</p>\n<p>“No,” Chang’E says, slapping his hand away. “No alcohol on an empty stomach.”</p>\n<p>“Betrayed by those closest to me,” Houyi laments as he lets himself be led away from the refrigerated drinks. “What is the use of immortality if a man cannot simply have a cold drink when he desires?”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/04/08/podcastle-886-houyi-the-archer-fights-the-sun/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

During the days, I followed a tattered map annotated by many hands and took many wrong turns through cramped hallways, treacherous stairways, and rusty gates. At night, I couldn’t sleep. Resting on the cold, stone floor, I clutched a delicate metal ringlet weighed down by heavy keys, worried I might lose it.</p>\n<p>After five days, the claustrophobic ceiling finally opened up into a courtyard. The air was cold and fresh. The full moon illuminated a cloudy sky. At the center of the courtyard, a rusty cage hung a few feet off the ground — just enough distance so that the man’s feet couldn’t touch the stone floor. The man was as gaunt as the cage. They were one and the same with the way he sat: motionless, his thin arms wrapped around the bars, his thin legs protruding from the bottom.</p>\n<p>He slept with a shallow breath, now and then shuddering and whimpering. His eyes fluttered open, and he groaned.</p>\n<p>“Who’s there?” he said weakly in an accent I had not heard in a long time. Although his hair was jet black and his face free of wrinkles, the frailty of his words made him appear a hundred years old. He straightened up and said more firmly, “What do you want?” The illusion broke, and he looked like a much younger man. He looked familiar, like a childhood friend.</p>\n<p>I tried to control the excitement in my voice and hide the reason I was there. “When I heard about you, I had to come see for myself.”</p>\n<p>“Who are you?”</p>\n<p>“I’m the Queen.”</p>\n<p>His face was impassive. “Is that so? Come closer — I can’t see very well.”</p>\n<p>I stepped forward, a breath away from his reach.</p>\n<p>His eyes studied me. My red silk gown flowed as smoothly as ocean waves, the jewels in my hair gleamed in the moonlight, and the perfume on my feet smelled of petrichor. The chaos priest had painted the penumbral edge of judgment on my forehead. The heavy set of keys hung on my belt.</p>\n<p>“Are you going to free me?” he said and laughed bitterly.</p>\n<p>“That was my intention, but first, I have some questions for you.”</p>\n<p>“You would have brought guards if you intended to free me. I’ve had this conversation countless times with countless people. I don’t know the answer to what you’re looking for. You’re wasting your time.”</p>\n<p>“You’ll find it hard to believe how much time I’ve already spent trying to find you.”</p>\n<p>“Your forebears wanted the same thing. Whatever means they used, it always ended the same way: they died, and I am still here, locked up in this cage.”</p>\n<p>“They were not my forebears.”</p>\n<p>The man’s eyebrow arched. “A revolution then? That must be quite a story.”</p>\n<p>“Allow me three questions. That is all I ask.”</p>\n<p>He looked tired. He shifted his legs and grimaced. “And you’ll free me afterward?”</p>\n<p>“That depends on your answers.”</p>\n<p>The man sneered and nodded. “Of course.”</p>\n<p>“Why were you put into this cage?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“I stole a piece of bread,” he said, “Next question.”</p>\n<p>“I was told you didn’t need food to survive.”</p>\n<p>“The bread wasn’t for me.”</p>\n<p>The man’s eyes were like dark pools of water where the depths were deeper than the ocean, and I couldn’t see below the surface.</p>\n<p>“Please, tell me more. You must answer my questions to the best of your ability.”</p>\n<p>The man sighed. “Very well. This was centuries ago when a revolutionary movement overthrew the Emperor. They deemed everyone equal: the farmer was equal to the merchant who was equal to the noble. The central government rationed food to every person. But why did the farmer have to till the land when everyone was equal? Why work harder only to have your surplus taken by officials to be split among everyone else?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/04/01/podcastle-885-prisoners/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Artists create Reborns as one-of-a-kind collectibles, often from ordinary play dolls transformed into art suitable for hands-off display—or hands-on cuddling.</p>\n<p>While reasonably durable, Reborns are not children’s toys. Rough play may damage them.</p>\n<p/><p><i>How do the dolls become “reborn”?</i></p>\n<p>An artist re-paints each doll with more lifelike skin-toned paints, mixed to achieve the actual skin tones of real babies across the racial spectrum. Delicate veins and blue wash undertones give the newborn baby a more realistic appearance. Hair is sewn strand by strand into plastic bald or molded hair-grooved heads through a process called micro-rooting. Glass beads weight the baby’s body, head, and limbs for the authentic feel of holding a living infant.</p>\n<p>Electronic devices can be added that mimic a heartbeat and respiration. Other devices can make the baby warm to the touch, or make it emit infant sounds. Magnets can be inserted in the mouth and glued onto on an actual baby pacifier (Nuk, Avent, Gerber, etc.). When the magnetized pacifier sticks to the magnet in the mouth, the baby appears to be sucking on a binkie, just like a real baby.</p>\n<p>*WARNING*: Strong magnets!

Art, packing, and shipping supplies also contribute to the cost.</p>\n<p>Each baby takes a minimum of three weeks to create, and goes home with its own layette, which includes a three-piece outfit, sleeper, hat, diapers, and receiving blanket, as well as birth and adoption certificates.</p>\n<p><i>Where can I buy a Reborn? What sort of person buys a Reborn? How lifelike are they?</i></p>\n<p>Most Reborns are sold through online nurseries, such as BabyMaker<sup>TM</sup>, or at art conventions and fairs.</p>\n<p>Almost all purchasers of Reborns are women, though we do have customers of other sexes and genders. Some customers collect Reborns as they would regular dolls. Often, older, single women treat Reborns as substitutes for the children they cannot have. Some customers who have lost a child, or have become empty-nesters, find adding a Reborn to the family comforting. Cuddling a Reborn, like cuddling any baby, causes a release of the hormone oxytocin, which produces a sense of emotional well-being.</p>\n<p>Reborns are so lifelike they are sometimes mistaken for real babies. A few have even been “rescued” from parked cars after passers-by called the police.</p>\n<p><i>I want a baby so much I feel as though I have a hole in my heart, but I’m forty-four, had several miscarriages back when I was married, and now find myself without a partner. I don’t have the money to adopt or to pay for artificial insemination through an anonymous donor. I know it’s a lot to hope for, but what are the chances my Reborn will become real?</i></p>\n<p>Think long and hard about what you’re asking. Reborns never need diaper changes, feeding, or bathing. They never vomit all over their beds in the middle of the night. You’ll never have to endure tantrums, visits to the principal’s office, or screams of “I hate you.”</p>\n<p>Your baby may be stolen, but will never be kidnapped. Reborns never suffer broken hearts, and never grow up to become drug addicts or criminals.</p>\n<p>Best of all, your child will never fall victim to an untimely death. Reborns provide all of the cuddles with none of the pain.</p>\n<p>*WARNING*: Consult a health professional if you find yourself socializing only with your Reborn.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/03/25/podcastle-884-tales-from-the-vaults-all-of-the-cuddles-with-none-of-the-pain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 883: Redo</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated R</p>\n<h3>Redo</h3>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>3.</p>\n<p>In our third timeline, I met you on New Year’s Eve.</p>\n<p>I had slept off a migraine half that day, so I wanted nothing more than to spend the evening by the fireplace cuddling with Jamie and our ancient basset hound. But New Year’s Day would be my fifth wedding anniversary with Jamie — our “wood” anniversary — and he had gotten tickets to a burlesque show because he thought he was hilarious. Predictably, he insisted that it would be wasteful to skip the show because the tickets were fifty dollars each. Plus, booze was included. Plus, he could watch women dance out of their clothes, which was significantly more interesting than watching me sit around all night in the oversized sweater and leggings I’d been wearing since Christmas.</p>\n<p>“Plus, Mary,” he said, “maybe you’ll surprise yourself and have fun for once.”</p>\n<p>And so I pulled a black slip dress over my leggings and twisted my unwashed hair into a bun, and Jamie and I squeezed into the dingy black box theater just as the first dancer finished her set. Jamie muttered something about me making him late again before disappearing to the bar. He didn’t ask me if I wanted anything, which was fine because I didn’t. My temples pounded along with the bass blaring from the too-close speaker. Everyone in the audience was standing, and the guy directly in front of me was well over six feet tall and completely blocking the stage. The back of his jacket was a maroon velvet that looked so soft and dark that I longed to press my face against it until the bass stopped pumping and my brain stopped throbbing.</p>\n<p>And then the bass stopped pumping.</p>\n<p>I pushed up onto my toes to peer around the velvet jacket as slow piano and the first rich notes of Des’ree’s “Kissing You” wrapped around me and pulled me forward until I found myself standing in front of the tall man.</p>\n<p>By the time you glided onto the stage, I had somehow edged my way to the front of the crowd. They introduced you as Ale Mary. Your sequined teddy glinted like a disco ball with every slow, luxurious spin, and your arms were clad in long feathery wings, which you used to cover and uncover your body in delicious, teasing motions. You were the most glamorous woman I had ever seen.</p>\n<p>And each time you spun toward the audience, you looked directly into my eyes.</p>\n<p>By the time the song ended, Jamie had made his way to the front of the house and draped his heavy arm around my neck. I barely felt it.</p>\n<p>“I have to pee!” I yelled over the music, untangling myself from him. He nodded, eyes glued to the stage. The next dancer was already down to pasties and a thong, flossing a purple boa between her legs.</p>\n<p>I didn’t want to fight the crowd to the back of the house, so I slipped through a door to the left of the stage. I realized my mistake as soon as the door clicked shut behind me and an icy wind whipped down the alley outside the theater with enough force to make my eyes water.</p>\n<p>“Shit.” I grabbed the door handle and yanked. Nothing. “Shit. Shit. <i>Shit.</i>”</p>\n<p>I spun around and growled, eager to kick the nearest dumpster or brick wall or some other big hard alley thing, and nearly collided with you. My eyes pricked with embarrassment, but I was not going to cry in front of you.</p>\n<p>You extended a gloved hand. You were holding an old-fashioned cigarette holder, smoke curling off the tip and spiraling into the frosty air in serpentine curls. “Want a drag?”</p>\n<p>“Um, I . . . I don’t smoke.”</p>\n<p>“Me neither.” You laughed and your whole body shook with a raw, chaotic energy that complicated the graceful, glamorous persona you’d presented on stage. “I needed some air so I bummed this off one of the gals. I found this prop cigarette holder in the green room; couldn’t resist trying it out.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/03/18/podcastle-883-redo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>On the bus making its way through Kerala to the misty hills of Vagamon, a group of 15 women, many wearing hijabs and dupattas, with colourful shirts pulled over jeans, hum a melodious tune, clapping and swaying in rhythm.</p>\n<p>Once off the bus, the women start their hike through the lush tea plantations. Reaching a peak, they stop to face out over the vast valley, link hands and sing a hopeful song about newfound freedom.</p>\n<p>This is India’s first “divorce camp”, founded by 31-year-old Rafia Afi for women who are divorced, separated, widowed or suffering in their relationships to come together at a healing retreat. “The idea is to normalise divorce and give it dignity,” she says.</p>\n<p>“Divorce can be beautiful too, when two people decide they do not want to be together,” Afi says. “I want to remind people it doesn’t have to mean the end of your whole life.”</p>\n<p>Her own divorce last year pushed Afi to slowly “embrace” being on her own. “I started creating content on social media, speaking about healing and single parenting. Many people connected with that and began messaging me.</p>\n<p>“It was disturbing to realise that not everyone had a support system like I had with my family and friends; most of them faced judgment and couldn’t speak up,” she says.</p>\n<p>It sparked the idea of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DNiKawns1bN/?img_index=1\">Break Free Stories</a>, divorce healing camps designed to build a community of women who could connect with others going through similar experiences.</p>\n<p>Afi has been documenting the camps in Kerala, from the backwaters of Alappuzha to the fishing port of Kozhikode (also known as Calicut), on social media. Two-day nature-themed retreats, held a few weekends each month, accommodate 15–20 women from different backgrounds and cost upwards of 1,700 rupees (£15), though Afi offers a few free spots for those unable to pay.</p>\n<p>Each camp begins with games to break the ice before moving into activities such as hiking, dancing and music sessions.</p>\n<p>“Once the women feel comfortable with each other, we have storytelling sessions and healing conversations in a safe, non-judgmental space. We also talk about becoming financially independent. By the end of the camp, the women rebuild and reclaim their stories, and strangers become friends,” Afi says.</p>\n<p>Zaki J, a musician and lawyer, was initially invited to conduct music sessions at the camp, but she realised that many participants, particularly survivors of domestic violence, were looking for legal advice as well.</p>\n<p>“I started conducting legal sessions to bridge that gap. Many blamed themselves for breaking up their families by contemplating divorce; the objective is to break societal norms around gender abuse and educate every woman on her rights, divorce and safety laws.</p>\n<p>“My mother died at the hands of my father. That pushed me to become an advocate to fight a case against him,” she says. “I want to help others take the right step at the right time.”</p>\n<p>According to the most recent <a href=\"https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR375/FR375.pdf\">National Family Health Survey</a> to be published in India, 32% of married women aged 18-49 reported domestic violence. Women are routinely put under pressure to remain in abusive marriages, even as dowry- and marital violence-related deaths continue to make headlines.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-16\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>Afi says: “Suicides and murders linked to marital abuse are happening all around us, and I want parents to realise that walking out of a bad marriage is an act of courage.</p>\n<p>“Too many people see separation as shameful, choosing death over divorce. Society romanticises silent suffering and that’s dangerous – I want to change that narrative.”</p>\n<p>Many of the nearly 150 women who have attended the camps so far say the experience has been transformative. Surya Kalarikkal says: “My marriage was traumatic and the divorce difficult. I had forgotten how to smile from the heart. But at the camp, we cried, we laughed, and I let out all my emotions for the first time in 15 years.</p>\n<p>“We realised that divorce can be freeing. I found the courage to take legal action if anyone defames me as a divorcee. As we checked out of the hotel, we felt like freshers, without any stigma.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/aug/29/women-divorce-indian-retreats-camps-marriage-domestic-violence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

That said, a lot of plus-size designs on the market in the high street are, well, quite crap. They are frumpy, ill-considered and not fashion-forward or exciting. Which is why this summer I was inspired to launch a <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frixolondon.com%2Fcollections%2Frixo-x-billie-bhatia%3Fpg%3D1&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/27/how-to-find-plus-size-dress-red-carpet-formal-smart\">collaboration with dress brand Rixo</a> – a 16-piece collection of size-inclusive dresses that evoke a sense of freedom, the idea that with one swish of a great dress over your head you are handled, you are stylish, you are good.</p>\n<p>Before I designed my own collection (I have found myself living in <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frixolondon.com%2Fproducts%2Falina-dress-bhatia-floral-black&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/27/how-to-find-plus-size-dress-red-carpet-formal-smart\">my floral design</a> for most of the summer), I had to think carefully about what plus-size shoppers need from a dress.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.zara.com/uk/en/zw-collection-linen-tie-dye-tunic-dress-p04043241.html\">zara.com</a>\n    </p>\n<p>I know that dresses can be generous in silhouette, so I am not always restricted to those few that are actually in my size. Searching for kaftan-style or even just oversized options, and going into stores to examine the shape has proved fruitful in my search for dresses that may not have been specifically made for me. For example, a lot of high street retailers have a high summer rotation of oversized dresses, including a <a href=\"https://www.zara.com/uk/en/zw-collection-linen-tie-dye-tunic-dress-p04043241.html?v1=454020483\">tie-dye tunic from Zara</a> (£69.99) that I recently tried on in store and, to my surprise, walked away with.</p>\n<p>Online is a more perilous battlefield to navigate unless you have already had a touchpoint with the brand and know how their sizing tends to run.</p>\n<p>I know that The Frankie Shop is typically generous in its sizing, so I didn’t hesitate to add its <a href=\"https://eu.thefrankieshop.com/products/avery-shirt-dress-white\">oversized shirt dress</a> (€245, or about £210) to my basket. Understanding brands, and knowing that sizing isn’t always as straightforward as what you see on the hangar, led me to find a dress that became my “made it” moment. It is a butter-yellow satin, floor-length <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.net-a-porter.com%2Fen-gb%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2Fbernadette%2Fclothing%2Fgowns%2Fnathalie-off-the-shoulder-taffeta-gown%2F1647597358560414&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/27/how-to-find-plus-size-dress-red-carpet-formal-smart\">Bernadette dress</a> (£815), which was a size 14 and still fit my size 24 body.</p>\n<blockquote>I never deemed myself, or my dress, worthy of standing in front of a wall of photographers on the red carpet</blockquote>\n<p>The Fashion Awards are the biggest red-carpet fashion event of the year in the UK and, by virtue of my job as a fashion journalist, I have been fortunate enough to attend many times. However, in previous years I have never walked the red carpet. I never deemed myself, or my dress, worthy of standing in front of a wall of photographers and holding my head and shoulders as if I belong with all of the other brilliantly and beautifully dressed attendees.</p>\n<p>That was until last December, when I wore that yellow Bernadette dress and felt – perhaps for the first time in my life – that I was as worthy of being in that heralded space as everyone else. The dress was cut so that a sliver of shoulder was on show, it drifted over my shape rather than clinging to it, it nipped in under my arm so that it still gave me an element of shape, and the colour received more compliments that I could count.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-11\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Sign up to Inside Saturday</p>\n<p>The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

    "body": "<p>Hello and welcome to The Long Wave. I’m Eromo Egbejule, the Guardian’s west <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa\">Africa</a> correspondent. This week, I spoke to Tems about her latest project: the Nigerian singer-songwriter and producer has been helping African women overcome many hurdles in the music industry.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>‘The future of African music is female and connected’</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>In February, the singer Tems won the second of her two Grammy awards for the single Love Me Jeje, a milestone that made her arguably the most successful Nigerian woman in music since Sade Adu.</p>\n<p>“Dear God, thank you so much for putting me on this stage,” Tems said, flanked by her mother and members of her team. It was yet another win for the rising talent since her breakthrough five years ago on the track Essence with fellow Nigerian superstar Wizkid.</p>\n<p>As a newcomer in Nigeria’s music industry, Tems, born Temilade Openiyi, faced many challenges. Unable to afford beats for her songs, only a handful of people believed in her vision in those early days.</p>\n<p>Today, the 30-year-old is a household name, collaborating with megastars such as Beyoncé and Drake. She has also performed at festivals and on stages that many of her peers still covet – the 2023 NBA All-Star Game half-time show, Coachella in 2024, and at this summer’s Fifa Club World Cup final.</p>\n<p>Succeeding as a musician in Africa remains a tough endeavour and only a few make it to stardom. On that slope to success are many barriers, including lack of funding and infrastructure, that are even further compounded for women who additionally face misogyny. “There are some people who I looked up to in the industry but, surprisingly, they also wanted sex,” the singer Yemi Alade said in <a href=\"https://dailypost.ng/2016/12/19/record-label-owners-promoters-guilty-sexual-harassment-yemi-alade/\">an interview in 2016</a>.</p>\n<p>The Beninese-French singer Angélique Kidjo has also spoken of <a href=\"https://theworld.org/stories/2015/06/10/its-hard-make-it-female-musician-especially-africa\">people discouraging her</a> from playing the drums, with one person insisting “drums are not made for women to play”.</p>\n<p>Tems told the Guardian: “When I first started gaining a platform, it was incredibly empowering to have women I admired, like Rihanna, Adele and Beyoncé, connect with my music. Their recognition validated my journey and, in some cases, led to opportunities to collaborate.

When was this idyllic period in which body acceptance took place? Because I must have missed it. I would have welcomed a break from obsessing about my body, calorie counting, and from the feeling of being a total failure whenever I stopped running.</p>\n    <p>I was born in 1984, developed early, and was taught that the additional space I took up with my body was shameful. I remember the teacher calling me up to retrieve my test results as the classroom began a steady chant of “Mooooooo”.</p>\n    <p>At 41, I can’t remember a time when my weight was not connected to my worth. Whether it was family, friends, or perfect strangers, my body has always dictated how I was seen, if at all. Despite the celebrities who have promoted body positivity, only to lose weight and be celebrated later, it rarely trickles down. And I wonder if it is more for optics than reality.</p>\n    <p>I’ve recently gained about 15lb and started running again. Most days, I don’t feel as though I have a right to be on the path. I tie a jacket around my waist to hide my butt. On the bad days, I even go so far as to take a more isolated route. That extra weight means that there is something wrong with me and that it needs to be “fixed”. This has and always will be the reality for so many women.

Mrs Justice Steyn’s judgment is about power and complicity as well as the failure to protect vulnerable people. In her verdict, she agreed with the Guardian that there were “strong grounds to believe that [Clarke] is a serial abuser of women”.</p>\n    <p>The court heard testimony from <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Noel-Clarke-v-Guardian-News-and-Media-press-summary.pdf\">26 witnesses</a> before concluding that Clarke had engaged in harassment, bullying and abuse of power over many years. The judge accepted some of his evidence, but found him to be neither credible or reliable. The Guardian’s journalists, by contrast, were meticulous and gave Clarke reasonable opportunity to respond as well as fairly presenting his denials. Without women speaking up, Clarke would never have been exposed.</p>\n    <p>The judge rightly agreed that these were plainly matters of public interest. But in law it is not enough for an editor to say that a story is important. It must also demonstrate responsible journalism: it must have careful corroboration and fair presentation, and not be given to sensationalism. The editors and reporters produced a final article, the judge agreed, that was <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Noel-Clarke-v-Guardian-News-and-Media-22.08.25.pdf\">measured, accurate and balanced</a>. Crucially, their belief that this work was in the public interest was “reasonable”.</p>\n    <p>Beyond the law is a wider, all too familiar story. Clarke was not just another actor; he was being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/apr/30/how-bafta-spent-two-weeks-grappling-with-noel-clarke-dilemma\">honoured by the British film academy</a>, Bafta, for his “outstanding British contribution to cinema” even as serious allegations began to circulate. But the deeper indictment is of an industry that turned a blind eye. Clarke was rewarded and celebrated while women who spoke out risked their careers. The structures of power that enabled him – and the colleagues willing to look away – are the same factors that have ended up sheltering abusers across society.</p>\n    <p>This is the culture that allowed him to flourish. It is the culture that required #MeToo before voices were heard, and that now faces a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/mar/30/metoo-movement-backlash-womens-rights-young-men\">backlash</a> in which powerful men are recast as victims. In Britain, a star celebrated by his peers has been exposed as a serial abuser only after years of whispers were ignored. In her summing up, Mrs Justice Steyn punctured Clarke’s line of defence in a passage that was both subtle and resonant. These were, she reasoned, deliberate acts of abuse, later rationalised through minimisation and self-deception.</p>\n    <p>The lesson of this case is twofold. First, it is a victory for investigative journalism. When reporters act responsibly, the courts will uphold their right to publish. The Clarke case and allegations on shows such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/aug/14/second-bbc-masterchef-contestant-edited-out#:~:text=Banijay%2C%20the%20production%20company%20behind,it%20should%20not%20be%20aired.\">MasterChef</a> have sparked reforms, prompting a BBC culture review and the creation of an independent industry standards body. The second part of the lesson is that awards, plaudits and silence sustain harassers and abusers more effectively than any legal defence.</p>\n    <p>Clarke’s reputation lies in ruins, not because of gossip, but because of findings tested in court. For years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/aug/22/from-noel-clarke-to-gregg-wallace-why-is-the-uk-still-battling-a-toxic-tv-culture\">Britain’s TV industry</a> tolerated a toxic culture where the misconduct of powerful men was seen as unmentionable and staff were resigned to silence. The industry’s power imbalance – dominant executives and stars versus insecure freelancers, a situation worsened by shrinking production budgets – is widely blamed. The story here is not just about one man’s downfall. It is about a culture that looked away – until it could no longer deny the truth.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In the distance, Joshua trees saluted the golden hour’s infinity with their cheerful punk spikes and victorious fringed limbs, but all I could see was a faint rose tinge on the granite wall inches from my face.</p>\n<p>The rope connecting me to my climbing partner below dangled from my harness like a wet noodle. It would only go taut and hold me if I fell, but first, I’d fall a distance—much farther than I wanted to fall. When I looked down at my feet to find the next foothold, the wind blew my hair into my eyes and mouth.</p>\n<p>“Help me,” I whispered, or more like prayed.</p>\n<p>A voice spoke inside my head. Not God’s—mine.</p>\n<p><i>No one is coming to save you</i>, it said. <i>You got yourself into this, and you must get yourself out. There is no God. There is only gravity, dirt, rock, and sky</i>. The crack was within sight, but not within reach. The crack would make me safe. I could put my hands in the crack, and they would stay there. I could jam my toes in the crack and stand up on my feet. I could put a metal piece of protective gear in the crack, and make sure it was stuck there, and clip the rope knotted between my belly and groin to it.</p>\n<p>All that mattered was just holding on.</p>\n<p>Then, if I fell, I would not fall so far.</p>\n<p>But until I got there, all there was to hold on to was a slight vertical bump, like a doorjamb. It was like trying to hold yourself on a wall by pinching the edges of a piece of molding.</p>\n<p>I couldn’t hold on much longer. My rubber-shod toes were pressed on little nubs the size of chicken nuggets. (If I were a better climber, the bumps would be no wider than dimes.) Soon, my legs would start to shake and my fingers would start to slip.</p>\n<p>I could not stay where I was. I had to make a move.</p>\n<p>I looked longingly at the crack above. The voices of my mentors told me what to do.</p>\n<p>“Place your feet <i>with intention</i>,” said Glenn, with his Deadhead ponytail and Lennon glasses and sinews never obscured by sleeves.</p>\n<p>“Make a <i>plan </i>for your feet,” said Flora, in her kind and measured scientist voice.</p>\n<p>“Just hold on!” chuckled Fred, in his SoCal drawl, miming with his huge, strong fingers. “You’d be surprised how much your <i>body </i>wants to live.” Sometimes, when I climbed, I heard other voices—like my last real boyfriend’s, a pathological liar who had threatened to decapitate me—so I pulled on the rock with the strength of someone who could kill him first. Now, clinging on, things people had said to me no longer mattered.</p>\n<p>What was true and what was not no longer mattered. Love and trust did not matter, marriage and babies did not matter. All that mattered was just holding on.</p>\n<p>I didn’t need a ring or a house or even a van. I was closer to forty than thirty, but at this exact moment, I didn’t need to figure out how to finally achieve everything that had thus far eluded me, nor make peace with not having and maybe never getting anything my heart desired. This was the one place in the world where sorrow and shame couldn’t reach me. All I needed, and all I wanted, was to claw myself six feet higher and jam my hand in the crack.</p>\n<p><i>There</i>, was my only thought. <i>Now</i>.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>My mind was quiet while my brain calculated. Then it told my body: <i>Go</i>.</p>\n<p>I breathed in and reached up. I breathed out and placed my foot with intention. Each time my fingers grasped a new bump or dent or wrinkle or edge, I thought only: <i>Yes</i>.</p>\n<p>Then I arrived. It was just a broken place, with space inside its darkness.</p>\n<p>I never let any man see me cry, but I could let the rock see.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/holding-tight-when-to-fall-and-when-to-keep-climbing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>Beverly Gologorsky on Her Friendship with Fellow Writer Jane Lazarre and the Mentorship of a Writer’s Group</h3>\n<p>Phillip Roth once said that only a fool would sit in a room for thirty years doubting himself.</p>\n<p>Writers are indeed fools grateful for the gift of creativity despite the constant doubt. We commune mostly with the blank page, which is what I was doing thirteen years ago when my friend Jane Lazarre phoned to ask me to join a writer’s group she was forming. Jane, an author of memoirs, novels and poetry had also contacted two other writers who were on board. Was I interested? At the time I was working on a novel in progress and no one yet had read any of it. Was I ready to share? I wasn’t sure.</p>\n<p>Jane and I had been friends for eons. We met in 1978 when our children were entering kindergarten in the same elementary school. I’d started a full time job that required me to be at work before school began, and Jane offered to take both her son and my daughter to school, her generosity legion.</p>\n<p>It was also around the time her acclaimed memoir <i>The Mother Knot</i> was published, a sensitive, gorgeously written book that challenged the myths of motherhood and childbirth, and engendered many study groups, arriving as it did during the second wave of feminism. </p>\n<p>In the years that followed our friendship grew. We mentored each other as writers: read, edited and discussed each other’s work before it entered (or didn’t) the world. As women we nurtured each other with all that that entails.</p>\n<p>Her published work was fearless, honest, controversial, work that left readers thinking. Her poetry could be elegiac or salt of the earth, her fictional characters alive.</p>\n<p>A group would offer something more than she might achieve working alone.</p>\n<p>Jane, a white woman married to a Black man, was the mother of two Black sons. If one of her young sons were late getting home she’d worry aloud he could’ve been stopped by the police, unfortunately too possible.</p>\n<p>In her book <i>The Whiteness of White </i>(published by Duke), she discusses this fear with the insight and passion of mother-love and a deep understanding of racial history. Much of her work dealt with racism; she taught about it, wrote about it, led a creative writing program at the New School educating white people about racism. </p>\n<p>Given her past successes, why did she want a writer’s group and why then, I wondered?</p>\n<p>She was tired of listening only to herself is what she said. A group would offer something more than she might achieve working alone. She was confident that work in progress read by others could help us know if our words and the feelings we hope they portray are heard as intended. Is the piece evoking what the writer wants? Wasn’t she afraid negative commentary might interfere with work? She wasn’t, said slipping out of isolation for a few hours would be good, hearing other writer’s problems could be helpful.</p>\n<p>Maybe it was luck, but our small cluster of women quickly cemented.</p>\n<p>Jane was persuasive. Just try it, she said. I did.</p>\n<p>We were a small group of published women writers whose everyday lives differed. We met one evening a month to discuss our work. Sounds tame. But placing unfinished or untested writing in front of the eyes of other experienced and respected writers actually takes courage. It also takes trust to believe, never mind accept, another writer’s critique of one’s own work. We’re all such guardians of our words. However, the sincere, generous and intelligent opinions offered about each piece read bestowed confidence in their writers. Maybe it was luck, but our small cluster of women quickly cemented.</p>\n<p>We discussed one or two pieces an evening, giving each total attention. When it was my turn, I submitted work and listened closely to each comment. Jane asked if it was inertia, fragility or fear that guided my character’s decisions? An important question. I didn’t have an answer. It sent me back to figure one out, which changed the novel’s trajectory.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/how-writing-in-community-can-forge-friendships-and-evoke-change/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Josh brought the candles, I brought the book, and Deek brought the lamb. We’re still not sure where he found it.</p>\n<p>“Reckon it’ll work?” The beach wind was chilly, and Deek’s voice was muffled beneath his coat.</p>\n<p>“Duh,” I said, taking out the Necronomicon we’d found in the Halswell Community Library three weeks ago. But actually I had no idea ‘cos even though the demon goatfish stuff had gone really well, this one was at the end of the book and written in blood or maybe crappy red ink. Really, this was all Dad’s idea. “You boys should do something with your holidays instead of playing on the TV all the time,” he’d said. I brought this up the next time we hung out. “We boys should do something with our holidays instead of playing on the TV all the time,” I told them. This was mostly because they were playing Mortal Kombat III which I wasn’t really good at and I got bored watching them, but also because when I thought about the holidays ending I always felt kinda sad, so I thought it’d be cool to do a big one before we had to go back to school. Anyway they murmured Yeses from their bean bags so here we were, summoning an ancient sea god from the fathomless abyss.</p>\n<p>We arranged the stuff. I had to do the virgin blood since I was born in September, and then we draw a crappy pentagram on A3 paper and made the lamb stand in it. It grazed mournfully on seaweed as we started chanting. There were cool words like <i>omnia</i> and <i>noctis</i> like the opening bit from Final Fantasy VIII, but after a while we had to restart ‘cos we forgot to pull our hoodies down to look evil.</p>\n<p>We went on for half an hour. It got colder. The waters rose. The moon shone. The lamb tried to eat the tome. No ancient sea gods emerged.</p>\n<p>“Maybe it’s the candles,” I suggested.</p>\n<p>“Where the fuck does it say it can’t be lavender scented,” Josh said testily.</p>\n<p>“Come on, guys. This is lame. Let’s go home.” Deek paused. “Where’s the sheep?”</p>\n<p>We turned to look at the lamb, who was gone. We circled around calling out Lamb and Baa and other things until we saw a trail in the sand that led all the way to the edge of the sea. The bubbles frothed red.</p>\n<p>Then a wet femur flew out and bounced one two three times on the sand. In the distance a great wave was forming beneath the blood-red moon. We held our breaths in anticipation. Then we had to start breathing again because the wave was taking a while.</p>\n<p>Deek was wondering which one we’d get. I reckoned He Who Knows The Fate Of Stars would be cool but Josh wanted The Twilight Pharoah because he’d recently watched <i>The Mummy</i>. Then Deek said he wanted The Bloated Black Goat Of Endless Wailing which set us up for a killer your mum joke. Then the big wave loomed closer and we had to run up the beach, and when it receded it left a rugby-ball-sized thing squirming in the sand. We leaned closer and poked it with sticks. The thing was squidlike with several tentacles and a mouth of tiny fangs. Its skin was spotted slimy green, and it gazed at us dickishly with a single red eye.</p>\n<p>“Mrwro’gh’graba!” it said. We pondered.</p>\n<p>“Is that Latin?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“It’s French,” said Deek confidently. His family had gone to Europe last year. “Bonsuwahhhh.

Buddy wagged his tail until she unbuckled him from the sidecar. He bolted downhill toward the rock quarry.</p>\n<p>Janet groaned, praying he didn’t go into the quarry. If she entered, there were too many rocks to count, and she’d never leave. Never be safe again. She whistled through her teeth. Buddy barked but did not return. He must have discovered yet another helpless creature to save. She took the dumplings they’d bought and entered her old clinic, walking across the foyer and through the doorway into her home’s adjoined kitchen. She stowed the dumplings in the fridge, her mouth watering at their greasy scent.</p>\n<p>“So much for breakfast.”</p>\n<p>Not that she minded her dog’s single-minded insistence on healing the injured. It was an obsession they shared. She did wish it was a less painful preoccupation.</p>\n<p>Janet trudged after Buddy, wincing as her arthritic feet complained about the rough pavement. She passed the pines on her left without looking at them. That way, she didn’t feel the need to count the trees. They were every bit as dangerous as the quarry.</p>\n<p>“Buddy?” He barked but didn’t come. She found him at the forest’s edge, fifty meters from where the rock quarry gouged out the earth. The October breeze gave her a whiff of the pit’s sulfur stink. She coughed at the lingering taste and refused to look in the hole.</p>\n<p>Buddy had curled himself around two wounded fairies. He thumped his tail and whined at her, his wrinkled face worried.</p>\n<p>Janet had retired and closed her old veterinary clinic months ago, but her dog didn’t care. He wouldn’t leave the fairies until Janet healed them. She knelt. “What’s the problem this time, Buddy boy?”</p>\n<p>Blue blood covered the female’s long burgundy hair and smelled of copper. She had one wing torn off and Janet tensed against the uneven number.</p>\n<p>Buddy whined, nudging Janet’s hand. Though not a trained service dog, he always knew when she needed distraction.</p>\n<p>The female fairy stood up, her fists raised. She stood about as tall as a grapefruit and was equally intimidating. She spoke in a squeaky voice that Janet couldn’t hear.</p>\n<p>Cursing, Janet repositioned the hearing aids in her ears. They squealed until she adjusted them. Getting old sucked.</p>\n<p>Janet put her hand over her heart. “I offer you healing and hospitality.” Humans and fairies ignored one another, but Janet took healing seriously. It and Buddy were the only things that mattered. “Let me carry you back to my clinic, Tink.”</p>\n<p>Blue droplets spattered the grass when the fairy shook her head. “You may call me Tulip. I will be fine. The bleeding has stopped. Please, carry my king.”</p>\n<p>He had wavy black hair twinkling with hidden lights, a broken leg, and a haughty expression when he raised his palm. “No human shall touch our glorious self.”</p>\n<p>“That’s fine, your gloryship,” Janet crossed her arms. “You can set that compound fracture yourself.”</p>\n<p>He didn’t have wings, but Janet wished he could fly away.</p>\n<p>Tulip at last convinced him to be carried. She declined the same privilege but lay on Buddy’s back and rode him inside the clinic.</p>\n<p>Janet took a deep breath and avoided looking at Tulip’s wing. Instead, she placed the king on the cold exam table and clicked on the lights. She brushed her gray hair behind one ear and repeated the gesture on the other ear for the sake of symmetry.</p>\n<p>One king. Nothing she could do about one missing wing or one ruler, but together, they were an even number. Problem solved. Kind of.</p>\n<p>“This will hurt. I can give you a sedative.”</p>\n<p>He shook his head. Janet shrugged, disinfected the wounds with iodine, and pulled the bone segments into place. The king paled, but refused to look where the bones had jutted through the skin.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/05/27/podcastle-893-counting-fairies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 892: TALES FROM THE VAULTS – The Cambist and Lord Iron</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated PG</p>\n<h3>The Cambist and Lord Iron: A Fairy Tale of Economics</h3>\n<p>For as many years as anyone in the city could remember, Olaf Neddelsohn had been the cambist of the Magdalen Gate postal authority. Every morning, he could be seen making the trek from his rooms in the boarding house on State Street, down past the street vendors with their apples and cheese, and into the bowels of the underground railway, only to emerge at the station across the wide boulevard from Magdalen Gate. Some mornings he would pause at the tobacconist’s or the newsstand before entering the hallowed hall of the postal authority, but seven o’clock found him without fail at the ticker tape, checking for the most recent exchange rates. At half past, he was invariably updating the slate board with a bit of chalk. And with the last chime of eight o’clock, he would nod his respect to his small portrait of His Majesty, King Walther IV, pull open the shutters, and greet whatever traveler had need of him.</p>\n<p>From that moment until the lunch hour and again from one o’clock until six, Olaf lived and breathed the exchange of foreign currencies. Under his practiced hands, dollars became pounds sterling; rubles became marks; pesos, kroner; yen, francs. Whatever exotic combination was called for, Olaf arranged with a smile, a kind word, and a question about the countries which minted the currencies he passed under the barred window. Over years, he had built nations in his mind; continents. Every country that existed, he could name, along with its particular flavor of money, its great sights and monuments, its national cuisine.</p>\n<p>At the deep brass call of the closing gong, he pulled the shutters closed again. From six until seven o’clock, he reconciled the books, filled out his reports, wiped his slate board clean with a wet rag, made certain he had chalk for the next day, paid his respects to the portrait of the king, and then went back to his boarding room. Some nights he made beans on the hotplate in his room. Others, he would join the other boarders for Mrs. Wells’ somewhat dubious roasts. Afterward, he would take a short constitutional walk, read to himself from the men’s adventure books that were his great vice, and put out the light. On Saturdays, he would visit the zoo or the fourth-rate gentleman’s club that he could afford. On Sundays, he attended church.</p>\n<p>He had a reputation as a man of few needs, tepid passions, and great kindness. The romantic fire that the exotic coins and bills awakened in him was something he would have been hard pressed to share, even had he anyone with whom to share it.</p>\n<p>Which is to say there could not be a man in the whole of the city less like Lord Iron.</p>\n<p>Born Edmund Scarasso, Lord Iron had taken his father’s title and lands and ridden them first to war, then to power, and finally to a notorious fame. His family estate outside the city was reputed to rival the king’s, but Lord Iron spent little time there. He had a house in the city with two hundred rooms arranged around a central courtyard garden in which trees bore fruits unfamiliar to the city and flowers bloomed with exotic and troubling scents. His servants were numberless as ants; his personal fortune greater than some smaller nations. And never, it was said, had such wealth, power, and influence been squandered on such a debased soul.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/05/20/podcastle-892-tales-from-the-vaults-the-cambist-and-lord-iron/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 891: Trending Now! Help With Legal Fees for Reluctant Swordsman</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated PG-13</p>\n<h3>Trending Now! Help With Legal Fees for Reluctant Swordsman</h3>\n<p/><p>Hi, I’m Joshua Henzel. You might have heard of me from the New York Post article or all the YouTube videos. I’m the guy with the giant flaming sword who’s suing the NYPD. One thing the articles and videos got right is that I do have to stab myself in the heart to ignite the flame. But no, I don’t do it “for fun.” If the flame dies, so do I.</p>\n<p>I’m sick of all the lies and If I’m going to ask people for help, they should know the whole story, so I’m going to tell my side of everything. My lawyer told me I should only tell part of the story (sorry, Mr. Schmitz!), but my best friend Billy told me that lawyers are paranoid little poops and I trust Billy. (He didn’t say “poops” exactly, but I don’t like profanity, so I edited it, even though he says I’m way too young to be such an f-wording prig).</p>\n<p>I’ve never done a GoFundMe before, so I’m going to have Billy read it before I post it, but I don’t think he’s done one of these before either. If I screw anything up, tell me and I’ll try to fix it. Billy told me I should record a video for the GoFundMe, but I don’t really like my face or the sound of my voice much. (My face is narrow and pointy and my voice is high and squeaky.)</p>\n<p>So, when I meet new people, the first thing they talk about is all of the “debunking” videos and how there’s no way I can easily stab myself with a seven-foot-long, thirty-pound flaming sword. The first thing I tell them is that the newspaper lied; it’s only six foot two inches and ten pounds, but that’s still two inches taller than I am so I understand why they’re skeptical. The second thing I tell them is that it’s not that easy, there’s a lot of preparation involved.</p>\n<p>In my apartment, I have an iron stand that’s bolted to the wall in the kitchen that angles it just right. I don’t have many visitors so I usually just leave the sword in the stand. My kitchen is small so there isn’t a lot of room, but I can still get to the counter and all the appliances without singeing myself.</p>\n<p>It’s trickier when I go out. For a while I didn’t go out much, but then my uncle told me that staying inside all the time wasn’t good for me, so I started to take more walks. I usually only need to relight the flame every few hours, but it’s unpredictable. The shortest it ever lasted was fifteen minutes and the longest was a bit more than eight hours. And stabbing myself early before the flame starts to go out doesn’t seem to make it last any longer.</p>\n<p>If the sword is unsheathed, I can see the fire dying down and that gives me a little more warning. But if I can’t see the sword, it takes longer for me to notice. It starts with a . . . twinge isn’t the best word, but I don’t have a better one. Imagine that your heart is an old, worn guitar string and some cruel musician with a pick as sharp as a knife starts playing Misirlou on you at twice the normal speed. When my chest feels like that I know I have two minutes tops.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/05/13/podcastle-891-trending-now-help-with-legal-fees-for-reluctant-swordsman/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

You were quite the topic of conversation upstairs.</p>\n<p/><p>PALMER: Oh, I’ve heard that before. [laughter]</p>\n<p/><p>INTERVIEWER: Have you been afraid at all, talking so openly? That you might lose your audience, be fined, perhaps even arrested?</p>\n<p/><p>PALMER: Talk about what, John? [laughter] But do you see what I mean? I’m sitting here right before you and you’re avoiding saying what I am. We’ve got a bill sitting in Parliament, we have people demanding change, and yet we still can’t — or won’t — talk about what I am. Now you asked me about the war as part of my show. What kind of man would I be, that I could natter on about death and devastation, but fear saying what I am? What kind of society are we creating, where it’s acceptable to joke about genocide, but not to acknowledge the affection between two consenting adults? [applause]</p>\n<p/><p>INTERVIEWER: A very strong opinion, well put. Perhaps some of our politicians should take a few years off.</p>\n<p/><p>PALMER: You’d be surprised, the things you learn about yourself.</p>\n<p/><p/><p>The little pub was tucked away in a cul-de-sac, just past the train station: the end of the line, and as such it was hardly ever crowded, and those who drank there kept their eyes on their pints. Anne had come across it when running a small circle nearby. It seemed a good place to meet, and better for the day proving rainy. When Mr. Palmer entered, placing his umbrella in the rack and brushing water off his trenchcoat, not a single one of the half-dozen people looked up.</p>\n<p>He ordered a pint and made his way to Anne’s table, a wary expression on his face. She was already nursing her own pint, still trying to figure out how best to ask her questions. That he took the time to take off his coat and fold it neatly, to sit down and adjust his chair just so, made her wonder if he was also weighing out his words.</p>\n<p>“Miss Wood,” he began. “If it cannot be done, you could have just said so on the telephone. We knew it was unlikely —”</p>\n<p>She held up a hand, quieting him. He took a sip of his beer as she began speaking in turn, taking equal care with her words. “It is not impossible, Mr. Palmer. But it is a very risky undertaking. There is every chance that one or both of you could be lost in the process. You would both be dead, truly dead.”</p>\n<p>“We’ve discussed that possibility,” Mr. Palmer said firmly.</p>\n<p>“There is also the chance that one of you could be lost, and the body as well, leaving the other spirit alone but still anchored to this plane,” she pressed.</p>\n<p>“And we have discussed that as well; we were going to ask that, if it comes to pass, you would do what you can to help the remaining spirit move on.” He continued when she started to speak, “we have weighed all the risks, Miss Wood. I appreciate your concern, but we have been debating this for over two years now —”</p>\n<p>“It’s a chancey thing to have a spirit bound to an object,” Anne cut in. “If that photograph was somehow destroyed, you would lose Harry — yet it’s not clear to me where exactly he would end up. He might move on, or he might simply drift through the world, unable to materialize.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/05/06/podcastle-890-the-obrien-and-palmer-show-part-two-of-two/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Please welcome Timothy Palmer. [applause]</p>\n<p/><p>PALMER: Thank you. Thank you very much. It’s great to be here, John.</p>\n<p/><p>INTERVIEWER: Before we get started, I must tell you that we polled tonight’s audience before you arrived. Over the years you’ve done some remarkable cameos in films and television, and we asked the audience what was the line they most wanted to hear you say. The winning line was from ‘The Ladies of St. Agnes.’ [laughter and applause]</p>\n<p/><p>PALMER: My God, I’m funny and I haven’t even said anything. [laughter] It’s every comedian’s dream. [He starts to stand up] Well, I’m off, you can put my fee in the mail. [laughter]</p>\n<p/><p>INTERVIEWER, handing PALMER a slip of paper: This is the line in question. [to audience] Ladies and gentlemen. Timothy Palmer, from his memorable cameo in ‘The Ladies of St. Agnes.’</p>\n<p/><p>PALMER, looking directly at the camera: They never taught us this in Sunday school! [laughter and applause]</p>\n<p/><p/><p>The advertisement had read:</p>\n<p/><p><i>WANTED</i></p>\n<p><i>Medium for private séance. Familiarity with occult history and practice required. Serious inquiries only.</i></p>\n<p/><p>Anne hadn’t needed the job; she certainly hadn’t wanted the job. Private séances usually started creepy and ended worse. There were plenty of small circles a person could join, that would come to your house if necessary. Private was the last resort for those who were too emotional or demanding, or it was a lure put out by men with very particular fetishes. The last time Anne had done a private séance she had been trapped for hours in a stuffy, pitch-dark living room while the client verbally abused his dead wife. Anne had desperately wanted to sever the link, but she had been terrified the man would turn his rage on her. When she had finally been released she felt physically and emotionally beaten. It had taken her weeks to recover.</p>\n<p>Yet the advertisement would not let her be. When she knocked the newspaper off the table it fell open to that page; when she went to run her errands the grocer was reading that selfsame page, the butcher wrapped her Sunday meat in the page, and she found herself staring at the ad as she ate a cone of chips for lunch. When she finally boarded the bus for home and found a newspaper in her favorite upper-level seat, neatly folded to show the exact quadrant with the ad in it, she threw up her hands and admitted defeat.</p>\n<p>The man’s voice on the phone was pleasant at least, and oddly familiar; the address he gave was a posh neighborhood, the kind of neighborhood that would probably call the police if a woman screamed, if for no other reason than to restore its tranquility. And the fee he suggested was more than generous, so perhaps for once the spirits were doing Anne a favor. That favors usually came with caveats she didn’t let herself dwell on.</p>\n<p/><p/><p>The advertisement may have chosen her; still Anne prepared for the worst. She wore her best wool suit and her red felt cloche subtly embroidered with symbols of protection, which she believed made her look professional with just a touch of the bohemian. Others wore turbans and muumuus and silver-painted amulets, selling theatrics first and foremost. She had found the money better, if more intermittent, by presenting herself as a kind of spiritual consultant. Certainly it reduced the groping, and if all else failed she had brass knuckles in her purse that she had bought after that last, disastrous séance.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/04/29/podcastle-889-the-obrien-and-palmer-show-part-one-of-two/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Doctors may have discovered the secret to mending a broken heart in a world-first clinical trial.</p>\n    <p>Hundreds of thousands of people worldwide are living with takotsubo cardiomyopathy, known as broken heart syndrome, which causes the heart muscle to change shape and suddenly weaken. It is usually triggered by severe emotional or physical stress, such as losing a loved one.</p>\n    <p>Patients may experience symptoms similar to a heart attack and face twice the risk of dying early compared with the general population. Some experience heart failure, resulting in debilitating symptoms such as fatigue, as well as a shorter life expectancy. There is no cure.</p>\n    <p>But now, doctors may have the answer. The world’s first randomised controlled trial for broken heart syndrome has found that 12 weeks of tailored cognitive behavioural therapy, or a heart recovery exercise programme involving swimming, cycling and aerobics, helped patients’ hearts recover.</p>\n    <p>Details of the breakthrough were revealed at the European Society of Cardiology annual congress in Madrid, the world’s largest heart conference.</p>\n    <p>Dr David Gamble, a clinical lecturer in cardiology at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/universityofaberdeen\">University of Aberdeen</a>, who presented the research, said: “In takotsubo syndrome, there are serious effects on the heart, which may not return to normal. We know that patients can be affected for the rest of their lives and that their long-term heart health is similar to people who have survived a heart attack.”</p>\n    <p>The trial data highlighted the importance of “the brain-heart axis”, Gamble said.</p>\n    <p>“It shows that cognitive behavioural therapy or exercise could help patients along the road to recovery. Both are very cost-effective interventions, and we hope that further studies could lead to them being used to help this underserved group.”</p>\n    <p>The study involved 76 patients with takotsubo syndrome, 91% of whom were women and the average age was 66. Patients were randomly assigned to receive CBT, the exercise programme, or standard care. All received all other care and treatment recommended by their cardiologist.</p>\n    <p>The CBT group had 12 one-to-one weekly sessions, adapted specifically to their condition by the researchers, as well as daily support if needed.</p>\n    <p>The exercise group went through a 12-week exercise course, which included cycling machines, treadmills, aerobics and swimming, gradually increasing in number of sessions and intensity each week.</p>\n    <p>Researchers used a sophisticated imaging technique called 31Pmagnetic resonance spectroscopy, which allowed them to study how patients’ hearts were producing, storing and using energy. In the CBT and exercise groups, there was a significant increase in the amount of fuel available to patients’ hearts to allow them to pump, which was not seen in people who had usual care.</p>\n    <p>The average distance that patients that had CBT could walk in six minutes increased from 402 metres to 458 metres. People who completed the exercise programme were able to walk an average of 528 metres in six minutes, compared with 457 metres at the start.</p>\n    <p>There was also an increase in patients’ VO2 max – their body’s maximum oxygen consumption at peak exercise – of 15% in the CBT group and 18% in the exercise group. Increases in walking distance and VO2 max are signs of improvement in health.</p>\n    <p>The findings suggest the treatments could produce long-term benefits such as reducing symptoms and the risk of dying for those with broken heart syndrome, experts said.</p>\n    <p>Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, a clinical director at the British Heart Foundation, which funded the trial, said: “Takotsubo syndrome can be a devastating condition that can affect you at a really vulnerable time if triggered by a major life event.</p>\n    <p>“People may not be as surprised that an exercise programme helped heart patients, but it is intriguing that this study also showed that cognitive behavioural therapy improved heart function and patients’ fitness. More research is needed to find out whether these approaches improve survival or symptoms over the long term.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/30/exercise-therapy-mend-broken-heart-syndrome-takotsubo-study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The study adds to a long list of reproductive harms associated with Pfas exposure.</p>\n    <p>“Prior studies have identified that Pfas were associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, but the potential influence of Pfas’s exposure on [recurrent miscarriages] remained uncertain,” the study’s authors, with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, wrote. “Our investigation identified significant associations between [some Pfas] and increased risks of unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortions.”</p>\n    <p>Pfas are a class of about 16,000 chemicals typically used to make products that resist water, stains and heat. They are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down and accumulate in humans and the environment. The chemicals are linked to cancer, kidney disease, liver problems, immune disorders, and other serious health problems.</p>\n    <p>Some Pfas compounds are linked to developmental issues like birth defects and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/forever-chemicals-pfas-low-birth-weight-obesity-research\">low birth weight</a>. In men, the chemicals are thought to lower sperm quality and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/22/toxic-pfas-chemicals-testes\">cause DNA changes</a> that can impact the offsprings’ health later in life.</p>\n    <p>About 5% of women experience recurrent miscarriages and half of those have no explanation, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.</p>\n    <p>Among the chemicals that showed the strongest association were PFHxS, which is a common Pfas water pollutant. Several of the compounds for which researchers found associations were “short chain” Pfas, meaning smaller chemicals that industry has said are generally safer and less toxic than older and larger Pfas.</p>\n    <p>However, there is little independent research on many short chains, but what does exist points to high toxicity, and the new research adds to increasing concerns over their safety.</p>\n    <p>The biological mechanism by which Pfas may cause miscarriages is unclear, the authors wrote, but they theorized that it had to do with the disruption of normal thyroid hormone metabolism, and other hormonal impacts. Pfas are <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7926449/\">strongly associated with</a> endocrine system harm. The authors wrote that follow up research is needed to examine the question and find solutions and said a larger cohort size should be studied to confirm their findings.</p>\n    <p>The research adds to “an incredible body of evidence linking exposure to Pfas to developmental harm”, said David Andrews, senior scientist with the Environmental Working Group non-profit that tracks Pfas issues, but was not involved with the study.</p>\n    <p>“It’s a shocking health impact and it further indicates these compounds seem to wreak havoc throughout our body,” Andrews said.</p>\n    <p>Pfas are ubiquitous in consumer goods and the environment so they are difficult to avoid. But women can protect themselves by using filtration systems that <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/water-quality/clean-up-your-tap-water-a7942313498/\">remove Pfas from water</a>, avoiding nonstick cookware, avoiding stain guards, buying organic food, and looking for <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/?_gl=1*1twxcqy*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3NTU3MTQyMTYuQ2owS0NRanc1SlhGQmhDckFSSXNBTDFja1B0SlRySWxXVlNCV1g1UGhoQ1dtZFlIVmpHMk9QREpCZEZCMEdYdzItSTdpV2dSV3dZaFA0MGFBaFRMRUFMd193Y0I.*_gcl_au*MTUzMDYzNjQ0Ni4xNzUyNTA5NjI3*_ga*NDI1MDUyODgyLjE3NDQ1Nzc4MTI.*_ga_CS21GC49KT*czE3NTU3MTQyMTYkbzQ2JGcxJHQxNzU1NzE0MjI3JGo0OSRsMCRoMTg3OTM1MDM4NA..\">Pfas-free cosmetics</a> or <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/?_gl=1*1twxcqy*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3NTU3MTQyMTYuQ2owS0NRanc1SlhGQmhDckFSSXNBTDFja1B0SlRySWxXVlNCV1g1UGhoQ1dtZFlIVmpHMk9QREpCZEZCMEdYdzItSTdpV2dSV3dZaFA0MGFBaFRMRUFMd193Y0I.*_gcl_au*MTUzMDYzNjQ0Ni4xNzUyNTA5NjI3*_ga*NDI1MDUyODgyLjE3NDQ1Nzc4MTI.*_ga_CS21GC49KT*czE3NTU3MTQyMTYkbzQ2JGcxJHQxNzU1NzE0MjI3JGo0OSRsMCRoMTg3OTM1MDM4NA..\">personal care goods</a>.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/24/pfas-exposure-miscarriages\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Baby food manufacturers have been given 18 months to improve the quality of their products in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/england\">England</a>, amid mounting concerns that leading brands are nutritionally poor.</p>\n    <p>The new <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/commercial-baby-food-and-drink-voluntary-industry-guidelines\">voluntary guidance</a> from the government calls for a reduction in sugar and salt levels in food for infants and toddlers.</p>\n    <p>It also requests clearer labelling of products to address misleading marketing claims that make baby foods seem healthier than they are.</p>\n    <p>This will cover products with labels such as “contains no nasties”, which are high in sugar. Others are labelled as snacks for babies, which goes against government recommendations that children aged six to 12 months do not need snacks between meals, only milk.</p>\n    <p>It comes after researchers found that leading brands, such as Ella’s Kitchen and Heinz, were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/28/leading-baby-food-brands-making-high-sugar-meals-study-finds\">making sugar-heavy, nutritionally poor baby food</a> that failed to meet the needs of infants.</p>\n    <p>A report by the University of Leeds school of food science and nutrition, <a href=\"https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/faculty/doc/commercial-baby-foods-crisis-addressing-health-marketing-inequalities-uk\">published in April</a>, found that some brands also carried misleading marketing claims, and urged the government to impose the same traffic light system found on chocolate bars and ice-cream.</p>\n    <p>The report’s authors said the new voluntary guidelines were disappointing and would have limited impact. Dr Diane Threapleton, the lead author of the Leeds study, said: “They’re quite narrow in scope, only looking at sugar and salt. But salt is not a major concern in UK baby food.”</p>\n    <p>She raised particular concern that the voluntary guidelines did not address the poor nutritional value of many purees and pouches, which were targeted at weaning babies. The NHS <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/start-for-life/baby/weaning/what-to-feed-your-baby/from-around-6-months/\">advises parents to start weaning when a child is about six months old</a>, with vegetables that are not sweet, such as broccoli, cauliflower and spinach.</p>\n    <p>“These products are often too watery. Children need really energy-dense food, rich nutrient-dense food with lots of different fibres and different sources of iron and zinc,” she said. “But these purees, particularly those targeted as first weaning foods, are really low in energy. They are bad substitutions, especially if you’re displacing a nutritious milk feed.”</p>\n    <p>High levels of sugar in children’s diets is a significant factor contributing to high rates of childhood obesity in the UK, which is among the highest in western Europe. At the start of primary school, <a href=\"https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/national-child-measurement-programme/2023-24-school-year\">more than 22% of children in England are obese or overweight</a>, according to the latest official statistics.</p>\n    <p>The public health minister, Ashley Dalton, said the guidelines would help parents who were often <strong>“</strong>bombarded with confusing labels, disguising unhealthy foods packed with hidden sugars and salt”.</p>\n    <p>Prof Simon Kenny, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\">NHS</a> England’s national clinical director for children and young people, said: “These new guidelines alongside clearer labelling will help empower busy parents to make nutritious choices that give their children the best possible start in life.”</p>\n    <p>Last year a House of Lords report found commercial infant foods “are routinely high in sugar and marketed misleadingly”. It called on the government to introduce <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld5901/ldselect/ldmfdo/19/1910.htm#_idTextAnchor110\">mandatory legal standards for commercial infant foods</a>, without input from manufacturers.</p>\n    <p>A Department of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/health\">Health</a> and Social Care spokesperson said it expected manufacturers to meet the labelling guidelines within 18 months, adding: “If businesses fail to act, we will consider tougher measures.”</p>\n    <p>Another study found legislation in England to restrict supermarket sales of foods high in fat, sugar or salt had led to millions fewer products being bought.</p>\n    <p>Researchers at the University of Leeds estimated that 2m fewer such products were sold per day after the law took effect in 2022. The number of items high in fat, sugar or salt sold in Tesco, Morrisons, Sainsbury’s and Asda dropped from 20 out of every 100 before the legislation to 19 out of every 100 afterwards.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/22/baby-food-firms-18-months-improve-quality-products-england\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Meanwhile the climate crisis, extractive industries and criminal gangs have reduced safe territories, destroyed livelihoods and created food insecurity.</p>\n<p>It is increasingly women who are proving fundamental to fighting back, the stalwarts of their communities. A <a href=\"https://fimi-iiwf.org/en/biblioteca-propias/updated-global-report-fimis-road-to-beijing30/\">report published this year</a> to mark the 25th anniversary of the International Indigenous Women’s Forum (Fimi) cites the many ways women are the key protectors of cultures and land.</p>\n<p>“Looking ahead to November’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/29/climate-is-our-biggest-war-warns-ceo-of-cop30-ahead-of-un-summit-in-brazil\">Cop30 in the Amazon</a>, the call is clear: the world must stop seeing Indigenous women as victims and recognise us as the strategic actors we are,” says Teresa Zapeta, executive director of Fimi.</p>\n<p>We spoke to five women leaders about their work and inspiration.</p>\n<h2>Florence Jaukae Kamel, Papua New Guinea</h2>\n<p>Florence Jaukae Kamel , in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/papua-new-guinea\">Papua New Guinea</a> (PNG), was 17 when she had the first of her five children. They were young teenagers in 2009 when she left their father after he broke her tooth with a punch that left her blood splattered in the dirt.</p>\n<p>When she told her brothers what had happened, they insisted she return.</p>\n<p>Kamel refused, renting a small hut in her village of Iufi-ufa with eight Papua New Guinean kina, (£1.40) to her name. “I was jobless,” she says, “I was living in the village by doing gardening, and I had experienced all this abuse.”</p>\n<p>Already known for pushing frontiers in fashion and politics – in 2002 Kamel was the first woman voted into local government in Goroka province, where she raised eyebrows with her unique dresses, woven in fabric previously reserved for <i>bilum</i><i> – </i>a cloth bag used to carry everything from food to babies. “People said: ‘What is Florence doing?’ Some thought it was against our custom. But when people talked they motivated me to do more – I wore them every day, I had a whole wardrobe.”</p>\n<p>In 2002, she set up a women’s collective weaving bilum. By 2006, she was dressing the PNG Commonwealth Games team, and has since exhibited in fashion shows and art galleries.</p>\n<p>Weaving is more than an income, “It’s a bond, it’s a heartbeat,” Kamel says. “We share stories. We create laughter, joy, the peace that women need.”</p>\n<p>She established an annual <a href=\"https://www.ncc.gov.pg/goroka-bilum-festival-gaining-momentum/\">bilum festival</a>, which has grown to a network of 3,000 women sharing stories and techniques, alongside training in marketing, money management and climate adaptation.</p>\n<p>The network includes a safe house for women suffering domestic violence, with plans to build another.</p>\n<p>“Most of the women here are unemployed and the skill they have is weaving. We are helping them to keep telling the stories that originate in their communities, and the training helps them understand what the markets are like overseas,” says Kamel, 53.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got women who have bought sewing machines; women who have bought land. It has had a huge impact.”</p>\n<p>They visit the elderly to collect oral histories, and run programmes for girls – many of whom are now in school because their mothers can pay school fees. “It makes me happy, seeing women having their own earnings and making decisions,” Kamel says.<strong>Michelle Duff</strong></p>\n<h2>Roeurn Heng, Cambodia</h2>\n<p>In 2019, Roeurn Heng saw on Facebook that part of Phnom Radang – a mountain sacred to her community – had been sold to investors.</p>\n<p>Living in Mondulkiri province, near Cambodia’s border with Vietnam, the elephant tour guide and farmer had watched more and more land being <a href=\"https://www.khmertimeskh.com/50745457/the-great-outdoors-plans-to-set-up-40-eco-tourism-projects-in-mondulkiri/#google_vignette\">developed for </a><a href=\"https://www.khmertimeskh.com/50745457/the-great-outdoors-plans-to-set-up-40-eco-tourism-projects-in-mondulkiri/\">tourism</a>. “If the mountain disappears, it is like losing the identity of the entire Indigenous people,” she says.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/sep/01/indigenous-women-protecting-land-culture-communities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I made a visit to Verdun, France in 2013 because I wanted to walk the fields of World War I’s longest and bloodiest battle. I’d heard craters made by the millions of artillery shells fired during the fighting could still be seen in every corner of the sprawling terrain. I was in town a little more than two hours on a stop from Luxembourg to Paris, just enough time for a bus tour ride and a walk around the necropolis.</p>\n<p>A lifelong fan of military history, I found I knew very little about the first world war. Deep trenches and barbed wire, steel helmeted dough boys charging across No Man’s Land all came to mind but Verdun turned out to be something entirely different. Bombs of all kinds fired during the battle still rise from the earth there.</p>\n<p>My tour guide told us things I’d never heard at any other battlefield. If we venture into the wooded areas, we shouldn’t stray off the paths, he said, we had to be careful where we stepped. Our safety could not be guaranteed. The old munitions, they were still out there and some of them were still alive. I noticed a sign during one of the brief bus tour stops. Red and weather faded, it read:</p>\n<p><i>ATTENTION – DANGER</i></p>\n<p><i>VISITEURS, CES RUINES SONT DANGEREUSES !\n</i></p>\n<p><i>Visitors, these ruins are dangerous.</i></p>\n<p><i>RESTEZ SUR LES SENTIERS BALISÉS\n</i></p>\n<p><i>Do not proceed out of the marked lanes</i></p>\n<p><i>ET SURVEILLEZ LES ENFANTS.\n</i></p>\n<p><i>And watch over children.</i></p>\n<p><i>N’OUBLIEZ PAS QUE LES ENGINS DE GUERRE</i></p>\n<p><i>PEUVENT ENCORE TUER.</i></p>\n<p><i>Do not forget that old war implements can still kill.</i></p>\n<p>When I asked my guide if these signs were to be taken seriously, he nodded gravely and told me, <i>Absolutely, with the utmost diligence.</i> Farmers plowed up lead and iron shrapnel and even whole hand grenades by the pallet every harvest season. The government has an entire department of technicians called <i>démineurs</i> (literally de-miners) dedicated to disarming and disposing old war implements and they still couldn’t keep up with what was left behind.</p>\n<p>So, it seemed, the war wasn’t really over. There I was, standing on a live battlefield. What a strange phenomenon. <i>Do not forget that old war implements can still kill.</i> The sentence’s restrained temperament with its eerie bureaucratic authority, quiet yet menacing.</p>\n<p>I left town shortly after but Verdun remained fixed in my mind. I read all I could. I quickly came to find that the Battle of Verdun was more of an artillery duel than a conventional infantry battle. Sure, there were attacks and counterattacks and waves of soldiers traversing across No Man’s Land. Three quarters of the entire French Army spent time in Verdun.</p>\n<p>But what everyone writes about is the artillery. Both sides fired tens of millions of shells nonstop over ten months. Some you could hold in your hand. Others were so large you could vanish behind one. They fired so many they lost count. No one knows the exact total.</p>\n<p>The hills surrounding Verdun were literally reduced in height from the ferocity of the artillery barrages leveled against their slopes. They blasted and scorched topsoil until it disappeared. The explosions disinterred hastily buried bodies while burying other men alive. It destroyed trenches and supply lines leaving men cowering in cratered ditches, dying of thirst, licking rainwater from the brims of their helmets.</p>\n<p>Entire villages vanished overnight. Thousands of residents fled their homes under falling snow and shell fire. Many never returned. Those who did found their homes unrecognizable. Fleury, once a village of 500, changed hands sixteen times. It was reduced to a white smear that could only be identified from the air.</p>\n<p>Even years after the war ended, nothing would grow. Other sites of fierce fighting such as The Somme and Flanders quickly returned to their former selves. Verdun remained a scabbed moonscape, which some observed as a mark from God as the supreme example of “man’s inhumanity to man.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/the-wwi-battle-that-never-ended-finding-unexploded-mines-in-verduns-fields/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>On the Late Italian Writer’s Masterpiece, “In Farthest Seas”</h3>\n<p>“It’s nice to have confirmation, in the midst of a literary world where everyone loses their minds or in some way grows stupid, that you are a serious person, forging ahead with your story, your line.”</p>\n<p>In 1964, the Italian writer Lalla Romano received this compliment from one of her most steadfast admirers, and one of her editors at the publishing house Einaudi, Italo Calvino. Although Romano would continue to produce novels for several more decades, Calvino had already intuited that her books were, one by one, tracing a meticulously rendered personal story, or—depending on one’s interpretation of the Italian word <i>storia</i>—a personal “history.” </p>\n<p>Romano, in fact, rarely strayed from her own experiences, relationships and memories for the subjects of her writing. As a result, her books come together to form one of the fullest and most intimate expressions of a life in 20th-century art.</p>\n<p>While this journey through memory in many ways culminated in 1987 with her masterpiece <i>In Farthest Seas</i>, Romano’s artistic “line” was always a striking and even unorthodox one. Before finally becoming a novelist in post-war Milan, Romano had a promising early career as a painter in Turin, where she also published her first collection of poetry in 1941. Her first book-length work of prose would follow ten years later, a collection of dreams titled<i> Le metamorfosi </i>(<i>The Metamorphoses</i>).</p>\n<p>Although Romano rightly considered her depictions of dreams to be realistic, the book itself, with its uncanny, fragmented narratives, could not have been more distinct from the neorealist literature that was in vogue at the time. In fact, the book’s originality was immediately appreciated at Einaudi by Natalia Ginzburg and Cesare Pavese, with Ginzburg describing Romano’s dreams as “beautiful, fecund, vivifying.”</p>\n<p>But, for Romano, exploring such meaningful relationships and turning them into art was a necessity.</p>\n<p>As she had often done in painting through portraiture and landscapes, Romano turned increasingly in writing to the people and places around her—to the periods and spaces that had touched her the most, through love, strife and, at times, tragedy. Along with books on her childhood in the Alpine village of Demonte, near Cuneo, or on her years as a university student in Turin, much of Romano’s most important work explored disarmingly personal moments of her life as a wife, mother, and even grandmother, perspectives that were still relatively rare in Italian literature. And yet Romano approached these topics with both poetic rigor and emotional honesty, knowing that they were as worthy subjects for literary works as any.</p>\n<p/>\n    <p>In the case of her 1969 book <i>Le parole tra noi leggere</i> (<i>Light Words Between Us</i>), Romano’s sincerity about her uneasiness and even reluctance towards motherhood was shocking for the time, while the sheer number of details and documents she shares concerning her own son, Piero, and their difficult relationship could surprise readers to this day. Romano later said that Piero had read and been amused by the book, but when it won Italy’s most important literary award, the Strega Prize, its heightened success turned his prominence as a character into something far too burdensome, causing their already strained relationship to deteriorate further. </p>\n<p>But, for Romano, exploring such meaningful relationships and turning them into art was a necessity, as she would say in an interview: “Writing is my way of being.” Like her other books comprising private connections and recollections, Romano preferred to call <i>Le parole</i> a novel rather than a memoir or autobiography, seeing the distinction between fact and fiction as an irrelevant one for literature. As she would state in reference to her later book <i>In Farthest Seas</i>: “I do not fear <i>lived experience</i>. Art is abstraction.” Or as she wrote elsewhere, emphasizing the very impossibility of composing a “factual” memoir: “for me memory coincides with invention.”</p>\n<p>It is astonishing that such a powerful and acclaimed book on the topic of a spouse’s passing came so many years before the genre of the literary “grief memoir” became popularized.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/lalla-romano-was-writing-autofiction-before-it-existed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

When asked, as writers often are (at parties, in emails, to fill space), what I was working on, I answered, <i>Nothing. </i>This wasn’t true, but I felt it was. My project was to stay alive. Which required more effort than I could admit.</p>\n<p>The despair began when I finished my first book. Or, rather, it resumed. The book had been something I could throw myself into entire. Writing was an interruption in suffering, a transformation of it; writing about my life gave me an escape from my life. <i>Entering the poem as a method of leaving the room.¹</i></p>\n<p>I was living in Wisconsin, a miserable place to live when you are prone to misery. In Wisconsin it is winter all the time. Even when the glassy lakes thaw back into water, there’s this coldness that lingers. It seeps inside. In deep. I think of that time, and a shiver runs through.</p>\n<p>I had been brought to Wisconsin to write poems. When the first book closed itself—like a door, final, against me—I thought, <i>Okay, I will write the next book. </i>Then The Subjects rushed in. And I thought, <i>No, not that book.</i></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p><i>I don’t want to write the true book; it’s the one I want to write: I tear it from myself.²</i></p>\n<p>I did not want to write that book, so I stopped writing. But the writing did not stop. It had its own mind, one inside mine.</p>\n<p>I did not want to write about The Subjects. I wanted to write about pleasant things, like dogs. If I wrote poems about dogs, then it would be proof I was happy and well-adjusted. But there are certain subjects that, once they’re yours, force themselves to the front of the queue. And I did not have a dog. I have a cat, Sylvia, named after exactly whom you think.</p>\n<p>I said I’d stopped writing—to you now, and to anyone who asked in those days. What I meant was I’d stopped writing the way I knew how to write, what I recognized as writing, the way I had always written. Before it had been simple, if not easy: I sat at my desk and unstoppered my mind and waited until everything I had to say emptied onto the page, and then the writing was done. It felt good to do it. But this was different—I didn’t want to say anything about The Subjects, anything at all. And yet, I had to write poems; poetry paid my rent.</p>\n<p>I tried many ways to outrun what there was to say, to shove it down, to go around. But poems are cleverer than the people who write them. And your Subjects—like light, like water, in your hands—ultimately find an opening and slip through.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p><i>Night Poems</i></p>\n<p>What you won’t say takes up space. Creates a block. I wanted to say something else, anything else, but the unsaid becomes a stone in the throat.</p>\n<p>I believed I could only be a good person (worthy of love and my place on this earth) if I was a good poet, and I believed the way to be a good poet was to write a poem every day. My self-loathing was ouroboric—I felt terrible, so I could not write, and because I did not write, I felt terrible. Obediently I returned to my desk every morning and, all day, obediently I sat in my silence—like a child forced to sit in the mess she’s made, as punishment. <i>I felt very bad. </i>Then night.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/on-not-writing-and-letting-wildness-be-your-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She currently works for El País and, along with writer Guillermo Alonso, co-directs the podcast Arsénico Caviar, which won the Ondas prize for best conversational podcast.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>For a brief moment back in 2016, the internet’s obsession was the physical and mental well-being of an English YouTuber named Marina Joyce. Joyce was girlish and princesslike, with long blond ringlets and huge blue eyes, who uploaded innocent videos where she tried on pastel-colored clothes, opened gifts sent to her by different brands, or ate sweets she thought were exotic because they came from Asia. And because the internet’s blurring of boundaries often means you can’t discern whether you are viewing erotic content or family content (or, perhaps, both at the same time), a widely disparate community followed her—from little girls who wanted to wear the same pink dresses to bald men in their fifties who probably masturbated to videos of her eating ice cream.</p>\n<p>But after a while, her followers began detecting subtle changes in her behavior. In one of her videos, Marina Joyce was at a party, smiling at the camera and showing off her outfit, but something in the way she walked around (languid and listless) or the way she responded to questions (taking about three seconds too long to grasp them) set off all the alarms. This gave rise to a conspiracy theory, according to which Joyce had been kidnapped by her boyfriend or by a cult (it was unclear which) and was being abused and forced to upload videos against her will.</p>\n<p>The evidence shown by these internet detectives consisted of short video clips where, if you paid attention, you could hear a subtle and whispered “help me” that, apparently, she would have added in the editing. There were also videos of Joyce seemingly looking at the back of the room, somewhere behind her camera, in order to get the approval of her captor while she answered questions from her followers. Fans also showed screenshots where her limbs appeared to have bruises, scratches, or small wounds. This was irrefutable evidence. Marina Joyce continued to act friendly and cheerful, but behind the smiles, she often looked sleepy, dazed, or drugged. Some screenshots, which ended up on forums or posted to Twitter accounts dedicated exclusively to the exciting case, showed subliminal messages she was supposedly using to draw people’s attention. These messages were hidden among the beautiful white lacquered shelves covered in brand gifts that were always in the background of her videos. Her followers, and those who had followed the trending hashtag #SaveMarinaJoyce, ended up calling the Metropolitan Police to rescue her. The Met went to her house but found nothing suspicious and left.</p>\n<p>I’m thinking about Marina Joyce in the cold meeting room I’ve reserved for a call with the accounts team to talk about the Christmas campaign. I’m also thinking that, if the police were alerted by a loved one and arrived here right now, they wouldn’t find anything suspicious either—just a woman in an office, like Marina was just a woman in a room. Only my true fans would notice unsettling changes in my behavior meeting after meeting, day after day, video after video. They would discuss it online in forums and post long explanatory threads on Twitter. Perhaps I’d even be a trending topic for a few hours. The same woman who used to have fun behind her camera now seems sleepy, dazed, and even drugged.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/discontent/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

They ran back and forth all night, feasting on spiders and midges and the slower moths, but they were sticky-footed and rarely lost their grip. This one scampered away while she smacked herself in the face, much harder than she’d intended, so that she saw stars and bit her tongue, all at one.</p>\n<p>Dawn, seeping gray, outlined the window, showing the shutter slats as faint lines of light. She nursed her tongue, which felt awkward and painful in her mouth, and swallowed blood as she swung herself up and out of bed, abandoning thought of sleep. Once she’d had a soldier’s knack of being able to sleep anywhere, anytime, but nowadays that skill was long gone and she was lucky to pluck a few uneasy hours from a night.</p>\n<p>Cold stone struck her feet as she stood, and she fished around under the bed for the knitted socks that served her as slippers, disreputable and threadbare but warmer than being barefoot. The narrow chamber had only the single window; she moved to it and swung the shutters open, then leaned out on the wide stone sill.</p>\n<p>From this vantage point, you could see the hospital’s main courtyard, empty now except for the caged roses set among gravel and a single servant using a rake to set that gravel into long, undulating lines running from north to south. By midday the gravel would be covered by footprints and the porch underneath her window, the only spot where the hamper-addicts could smoke the licorice-scented weed, would be surrounded by crumpled butts. For now, though, everything was silent and still.</p>\n<p>Pulling her head back, she shrugged on a robe even more disreputable and went down to look for breakfast.</p>\n<p>In theory, they were served every morning at the second turning, but old dietary habits died hard, and Ambra was unused to waiting to eat while on campaign. She was not the only one — most of the patients here were Knights or other military — and so the cook kept jars of jerky and field-cookies on a counter, and the kettle of water above the kitchen fire was always hot for tea, tended by a sleepy-eyed kitchen minion during even the smallest hours of the night.</p>\n<p>The kitchen was already awake, though, sliding paddles covered with loaves of bread as well as fancier pastries into the already-roaring ovens. The subcook frowned into a vat of sour gruel being heated, stirring to break up larger lumps. Ambra poured herself lemon tea, then grabbed a field-cookie and took it with her, nibbling at the grainy edge, its flavor more hearty than sweet.</p>\n<p>Outside in the garden, she paused to survey her surroundings, eyes narrowed as her head swept across the humped, flower-laden graves, a few small memorial benches, the field supplying the hospital’s vegetable needs, and the hedge-maze. She couldn’t see into the last but moved to a bench near its entrance, sitting down with a sigh.</p>\n<p>“Have you thought about my request?” a voice said beside her elbow.</p>\n<p>She jumped, startled. “Dammit, Gray, I told you to stop doing that.”</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t,” the voice began, then paused. “Well, actually, I suppose I was.” The owner of the voice popped their head out of the hedge-maze. “But I wasn’t trying to sneak up on you on purpose. That time. I saw you coming and thought I’d give you a moment to sit down.”</p>\n<p>“So you could ambush me.”</p>\n<p>“So you could catch your breath.”</p>\n<p>She ate the rest of the palm-sized cookie in three savage bites, not tasting it. But her voice was mild. “As to your request, I don’t think I’d be a very good teacher.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/07/08/podcastle-899-broken-all-my-boughs-and-brittle-my-heart/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 898: This Mentor Lives</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated PG</p>\n<h3>This Mentor Lives</h3>\n<p/><p>Abraham was rushing through his miracles. He drew out the rune-etched broadsword of young Haddad’s great-grandfather and laid it in the boy’s hands, along with the elegant sheath that lunar moths had woven from their own silk. Then came the maps that would send Haddad on the next leg of his journey: those that told how to navigate mountains by constellations of the sky, and those of the eight oceans that could only be read amid sea breeze.</p>\n<p>Underneath that pile of iron and parchment and enchantment, the little Haddad wriggled. He was barely visible under the pile of destiny he held.</p>\n<p>“Wait! What do I do with this one? Does it re-dead zombies?”</p>\n<p>Abraham couldn’t see which item he was holding up and asking about, not under that mess of rainbow folds and sacred cartography. Did he have time to help the boy sort all this out? He fished around his robes with his gnarled hands until he felt the chill touch of the astral pocket watch. He flicked it open and gaped. He was three hours behind.</p>\n<p>Haddad’s head poked out from under the cloak and broadsword, his brown eyes wide and imploring. “Wait! Just one more minute. Which way do I take through the Forest of Tombstones?”</p>\n<p>“You’re the hero. You need to figure these things out on your own.”</p>\n<p>“I’ve been trying, but assembling my party is hard and nobody has escaped the Forest of Tombstones alive. They all come back zombified. Please, I just need to know whether to go east or south.”</p>\n<p>Oh, the Forest of Tombstones. Abraham had been through that blighted place twice in his younger years, on other business trips with other heroes. He really ought to install a signpost at the entrance.</p>\n<p>“Go south,” he said. “The real trick is to go slowly. If you try to rush through the Forest of Tombstones, its curse will wake more of the residents. It’s like quicksand, but with ghosts.”</p>\n<p>“Is there quicksand?”</p>\n<p>“Yes. But again, you . . .”</p>\n<p>“I need to figure these things out myself. Yes, sir.”</p>\n<p>Then Abraham flicked the astral pocket watch closed, and its enchantment opened the gateway. Light spilled into the clearing, splitting open a circular portal in the murky air. Its radiance drove every bug and rodent from its sight. Even Abraham had to shield his eyes from it. He needed new glasses.</p>\n<p>As he stepped through, he thought the boy thanked him. It went too fast for him to be sure.</p>\n<p>As soon as the radiance faded, he stepped into the next world, a humid bog where his shoes sank into the earth, and the drooping willow trees blocked out the moon and brushed the point of his hat. Immediately the young heroine Rania darted close, getting nose-to-nose with him, her green eyes bloodshot and furious. Her voice was hoarse and phlegmy, as though she had a cold that, with her proximity, he’d soon enjoy as well.</p>\n<p>“Where have you been? I’ve been almost dead for a week out here.”</p>\n<p>Before he’d met Rania, she’d been under a curse and forced to live the life of a stable boy. She broke the curse on her own, reclaimed her name, found Abraham, demanded he mentor her, and they’d gone on many adventures since. She’d always known exactly what she wanted. And now she had grown up. She was nearly as tall as himself, long of leg and reach, and was a natural at channeling her anger into progress. Her quest was the best shot at establishing democracy in her world.</p>\n<p>Her hair and jacket were snagged by an army of pricking brambles. Unpleasant, but not exactly dead.</p>\n<p>Abraham put a step’s distance between them and said, “Did you find the key in the troll’s den?”</p>\n<p>“I was stone! They turned me to stone. Trolls are supposed to turn to stone. Why didn’t you warn me that they can turn people into stone, too?”</p>\n<p>She tensed like she was going to take a swing at him, and it was a vigor that got his heart going faster. What a spirit she had.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/07/01/podcastle-898-this-mentor-lives/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 897: Oops! All Swords</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated PG-13</p>\n<h3>Oops! All Swords</h3>\n<p/><p>Blackness, and a ringing in your ears, and the smell of ozone, frankincense, woodsmoke. Something’s happened. An accident. A magical accident.</p>\n<p>But you’re conscious, and your heart’s beating. You’re alive, probably. That’s a start.</p>\n<p>Vision returns in sparkles, resolving into blinding lines of glitter. You squinch your eyes almost shut as the image clears. It’s your master’s workshop, sort of. Bookshelves and scroll racks, salt-crusted alembics, a human skull perched on the mantelpiece above the motionless flames. Your master in the doorway, caught in the moment of hanging up his pointed hat. But through the haze of your lashes, swords gleam from every surface. Huge zweihanders pierce the countertops; miniature bodkins velvet the floor. Scimitars cross the door, trapping your master in a cage so tight you can see a few white beard hairs at his feet.</p>\n<p>Nothing moves. You draw a breath.</p>\n<p>“Hey, kiddo,” the skull screeches. “Welcome to the plane of shit got real! You’re fucked.”</p>\n<p>You shriek, step back. Something sharp — <i>a sword, it’s a sword and you’re an idiot </i>— slices into your back: hot, cold, wet, black. Nothing.</p>\n<p>Dry laughter filters in, along with ozone, frankincense, woodsmoke, blood. Your blood. This time when your vision clears there’s an addition to the workshop: your own corpse, like a grisly wall hanging, your chest stylishly ornamented with a bloodstained sword.</p>\n<p>“That was great,” the skull says. “Wow. I really got you.”</p>\n<p>“Shut up,” you say. You can’t look away from the corpse; your mouth’s running on its own. “What happened? Where are we? You said the plane of shit got real? That’s not a thing, where are we really? How come you can talk now? Am I dead? I don’t feel dead.”</p>\n<p>“You blew your soul to ethereal little bits is what happened!” The skull seems to relish the idea. “Now you’re stuck here with me. Didn’t anyone ever tell you not to cheat?”</p>\n<p>The word <i>cheat</i> jerks terror from your gut. “Cheat? Cheat at what? At cards? On my girlfriend?”</p>\n<p>The skull cackles. “Wow, I guess the brains must have gone to some other bit! You cheated at magic, dumbass. You fucked with the cards.”</p>\n<p>Slowly it comes back to you: the tarot cards, the Word, the draw — two of swords, five of swords, ten of swords — and your instinctive swap, looking away from the cards to misdirect, letting your hand reverse the ten to reverse its meaning. Survival, not ruin; hope, not failure. Stupid, stupid. An ingrained habit from your old life: rolling dice, moving shells, telling fortunes. Picking pockets, sometimes, when there weren’t enough suckers to go around. But you can’t sucker the universe.</p>\n<p>Your master’s told you that too. <i>Don’t cut corners, you’re cheating no one but yourself.</i> He stopped giving you real spells a while ago: his way of forcing you to follow his rules. If he’d taught you like he was supposed to, like he <i>agreed</i> to, you wouldn’t be sneaking around like this.</p>\n<p>“Yeah,” you say. “All right. I’m a dumbass. But I’m an alive dumbass, so unlike you I’ve got a chance. How do I get out of here?”</p>\n<p>“You could try stabbing yourself again,” the skull suggests.</p>\n<p>“Fine, don’t be helpful.” You scan the room. It’s hard to see past the pointy metal forest, but otherwise the room seems <i>basically</i> like usual . . .?</p>\n<p>Something white catches your eye. Paper on the floor: a card. You tiptoe over, the tiniest swords pricking through your slippers and socks, and catch it up.</p>\n<p>It’s not a tarot card. It’s a weird hybrid: the ace of spades melded with the ace of swords. There are more cards around the room, and gingerly you pick them up, wiping your bloody fingers on your pants to keep the cards clean, until you’ve got them all: a deck of fifty-two playing cards, each card ordinary except for the divinatory tarot image replacing its center pips. Ace of spades and swords, three of hearts and — wait.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/06/24/podcastle-897-oops-all-swords/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 896: TALES FROM THE VAULTS: Defy The Grey Kings</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated R</p>\n<h3>Defy The Grey Kings</h3>\n<p>There are many ways to kill an elephant. When that mountain bears down on you, shaking the earth and screaming for your blood, show no fear.</p>\n<p>Only without fear will you see the truth. They are quick, even draped in chain and iron, but you are quicker by a whisker. They fight like devils, but it only takes three people who know what they are doing to bring an elephant down.</p>\n<p>They are afraid of you.</p>\n<p>All elephants can die.</p>\n<p>I bring you two things today. Iron, sharp and true, and a story. If you don’t gain the truth of things from this, you would best drive these blades into your own hearts.</p>\n<p>I have slain many enemies, both grey and pale. I’ve learnt things in that awful quiet, the moments of pain and sorrow after the fury, where men like me pass over the dead and dying. The road that brought me here is slick with blood, and if you do not listen to me carefully, your own deadly road will wash you away.</p>\n<p>I was born a slave, like all of you. My master was a hoary old bull known as Ascaro, one of the Bull-King’s champions. Twenty feet high at the shoulders, and even past his prime he was a quick devil, though old muscles were turning into fat.</p>\n<p>Where other elephants cover themselves in tattoos and silk and let the scriveners carve boasts upon their tusks, Ascaro only ever wore his scars. The end of his right tusk was shattered from an enemy axe, and a lucky blow had taken his left eye long before I ever drew breath.</p>\n<p>I spent many hours scouring his hide with brushes and bronze scrapers, and I knew that grey map of his battles well. He drank melon wine during his mud baths, and when his one eye turned red and crazed, he played his favourite game with the house slaves. Without warning, his trunk would flick backwards, and those of us cleaning his back would have to dodge his drunken fumblings and try not to slip and fall. The first slave to fall into the mud bath was the one that he would kill that day. He would pin them down with his foot, exerting just enough pressure to hold them under the mud.</p>\n<p>I would stand on that heaving back with perfect balance, and not once did I cease my endless scrubbing, staring only at my broom as someone else drowned in the mud.</p>\n<p>His lieutenants and lackeys would cheer him on while he murdered a human being for no reason. Even the house poet would stop plucking the bouzouki with his trunk and join in the laughter. Just before the bubbles finally stopped, Ascaro would step down hard, crunching bones. He would pluck each corpse out of the mud, tossing it across his great hall. Each body fell with a meaty smack, arms and legs a muddy broken tangle. The elephants would roar and laugh at the sight, each of them screeching that horrible deep-throated rasp that every man loathes.</p>\n<p>I survived the bath game longer than any of the other slaves in the house of Ascaro, and only then did my master look upon me with value. He took the broom from my hands and gave me to a man named Mouse.</p>\n<p>“This one dances well,” Ascaro told Mouse. “Teach him to dance with a knife.”</p>\n<p>Mouse was a hulk of a man, almost as scarred and grizzled as our master. He took me away from that miserable house, from all I’d ever known.</p>\n<p>He led me across the streets of Tusk, through the plazas and across the causeways. It is a city built to the scale of our masters, already old when the elephants learned script and set their histories down. I felt like an ant, just another attendant below the notice of our grey kings. Here the wealthy promenaded, draped in silk and gold-dust, and each elephant carried a dozen slaves armed with fly-switches and scratch-sticks.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/06/17/podcastle-896-tales-from-the-vaults-defy-the-grey-kings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 895: The Day of the Sea</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated PG-13</p>\n<h3>The Day of the Sea</h3>\n<p/><p>When the Sea came to our village, she was an old woman. She arrived when the water crested and draped over the earth, its salty fingers pushing out offerings of sea glass and bladder wrack. Her dress trailed behind her, hair tangled with kelp and tentacles. No one doubted that she was the Sea. Everyone was disappointed.</p>\n<p>We’d all heard tales about the power of the rising ocean, how it leveled towers and returned rock to sand. How it would destroy everything in its path in order to make its way home, to our village. In those tales, the Sea was a warrior, beautiful and terrible, slashing her way across the continent, swallowing everything in her path. Even when gossips at the market began to whisper about nearby towns swallowed by salt water, about boats crushed like kindling and bones strewn across the ocean floor, even as the smell of salt wafted on the breeze, we did not seek her out. We waited for her to come to us, as the stories had foretold.</p>\n<p>But the Sea that arrived was timid and exhausted from her travels. We’d expected her to thunder against our walls, insistent and unrelenting, Instead, she waited just outside the village, frail and silent. The tide nudged at our gates and withdrew, nudged and withdrew, as if asking permission to enter. If she had ever been a warrior, it was a long time ago.</p>\n<p>We’d prayed to her. We’d spent generations waiting for her to arrive. No one was willing to turn her away. But no one stepped forward to welcome her, either.</p>\n<p>“I am weary,” said the Sea, in a voice as deep and heavy as fathoms of water. “I have seen too much and traveled too far.”</p>\n<p>The villagers all shifted their feet and avoided her gaze. If they let her inside, how could she return the favor? Her waters, stretched thin here at the end of her journey, wouldn’t offer up the bounty we expected; they would only flood our fields and poison our lakes. She was not what was promised, and though no one said it out loud, everyone thought it would be better if she didn’t get too comfortable.</p>\n<p>But then, my grandmother stepped forward.</p>\n<p>“Come inside, then, and rest,” my grandmother said. “I have food and drink, and a bed that stands empty since my youngest son and his wife died of the blue fever.”</p>\n<p>The Sea bowed her head. “The Sea does not rest. But I will linger here, until the tide goes out.”</p>\n<p>When my grandmother took the Sea’s hand, it was ice cold, but she didn’t let go.</p>\n<p>Once the Sea had gone inside my grandmother’s house, we children ran for the shore. We couldn’t wait to see the treasures in its shallows, things we’d only heard about in story and song: oysters hiding luminous pearls in their soft gullets, fish that glowed in darkness like candles, creatures spined and tentacled and every color we could imagine. But the water, even though it was shallow where it flooded the outer fields, was so cold it numbed our feet and ankles, and none of us wanted to wade in further. We ran back and forth as the sluggish waves approached and retreated, searching for any kind of treasure, for surely the Sea wouldn’t leave us empty handed, not after we’d welcomed her and offered her food and drink. But the shells the tide left behind were dull and broken, the mussels picked through, the seaweed brown and smelly. Even the fish were as small as insects, and not worth the effort of catching them.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/06/10/podcastle-895-the-day-of-the-sea/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Ever since a nasty concussion stopped me playing rugby when I was 18, I struggled to exercise regularly. I tried plenty of workouts, dabbling in everything from CrossFit to Zumba. While some were more enjoyable than others, I hadn’t found a way to keep a consistent, disciplined regime without it feeling like a chore. I’m 28 now and work from home. My commute from bed to desk is 15 steps. Given the health risks of sedentary lifestyles, I had tried just about everything to break my lazy rut, and then something worked: watching television.</p>\n    <p>Well, OK, not just watching television like a modern Jim Royle, who reached Olympic levels in The Royle Family, but I imposed a rule: if I want to watch TV, I have to do so while sitting on my exercise bike (the one cardio exercise I can tolerate). The result? I’ve been cycling roughly six hours a week for months now. Generally, I watch a lot of sports: if there’s football, rugby, tennis, boxing, NFL or cricket on, I’ll watch it. So invariably through the year I find there’s roughly two hours of sport on three times a week I want to watch. By combining this with exercise, I find I am able to do so without feeling guilty.</p>\n    <p>Most of the sports I watch have intervals, so I tend to cycle moderately during the action and then start to pedal my way quickly through another Jamie Carragher tirade or some inane ad breaks. I usually burn about 500 calories during a two-hour session. Sometimes my drink of choice while I cycle might even be a non-alcoholic beer. Bliss.</p>\n    <p>I used to feel exercise was a waste of time, like being a hamster on a wheel, spinning and doing very little. But the benefits of consistent exercise have been pretty amazing for me. It has helped me to reach a level of fitness where I feel less anxious about going to the gym, but I also reap the mental health benefits of sticking to a routine and enjoying the aches days after I push myself a little harder than before (a masochistic hangover from my rugby days).</p>\n    <p>Sure, there are some days when staying on the bike is more of a slog than others, if there’s a particularly boring match on or the wifi decides to be dodgy. But by that point I’m already there and something in me decides I might as well keep going. It’s almost as though this hamster wheel now energises me instead of dragging me down.</p>\n    <p>More recently, I have found that passively exercising while actively doing something I enjoy is a wider magic formula. Listening to podcasts while I take my time doing various sets of weights is my latest endeavour. They say that incremental changes are the most effective, and building up an exercise regime by watching television has worked. It has helped me to feel happier and healthier.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/21/change-that-worked-exercise-watching-tv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep. Was that exhausting to read? Well, imagine if that noise was the soundtrack to your summer.</p>\n<p>To the ire of many city dwellers this year, it is. The piercing and persistent sound, something akin to a half-bothered fire alarm you accidentally set off, has been everywhere. Its origin? Lime e-bikes, specifically the stolen variety.</p>\n<p>The bikes, which have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/15/i-want-them-all-crushed-the-council-poised-to-ban-dangerous-lime-bikes\">become ubiquitous</a> in London and other cities, cost 27p a minute to ride, plus a £1 unlock fee in the capital. Those hoping to get around without paying a penny have resorted to naughtier (and noisier) ways of doing so.</p>\n<p>There are video tutorials available online on how to break into Lime e-bikes. When someone manages to bypass their lock and ride around for free, it emits a continuous beep, beep, beep sound.</p>\n<p>The noise is supposed to be a deterrent – a sonic advertisement to all who pass by that the rider is a cheat – but considering how prevalent it has become, it seems as though boosting a bike has become not only an acceptable course of action but even a lifestyle choice.</p>\n<p>On a balmy Friday afternoon in lush and leafy Clissold Park in east <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london\">London</a>, I played the beep, beep, beep sound to sun seekers, who recognised it instantly. During the course of our conversation, offending e-bikes sped around people, including children, along the park’s paths.</p>\n<p>Ellie Roberts said she heard the sound daily, describing it as the “birdsong of Hackney”.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t keep me up but it bothers me,” said Roberts, 47, who works in advertising. “It’s an indication of low-level crime on an ongoing basis.”</p>\n<p>Her friend, Sinead McKenna, 49, is more fond of the persistent sound. “I quite like it, it’s the sound of the summer,” said the solicitor.</p>\n<p>Schoolkids are often seen whizzing around on the beeping bikes, despite under-18s being banned from using the service. “I genuinely like [the sound] because I think if I was a kid, that’s what I’d do,” said McKenna, laughing. “It’s the fact that Lime is making a lot of money and they have a responsibility. I don’t blame the kids for it.”</p>\n<p>There was little sympathy for Lime in evidence. “Why is it that they can make money off public space?” said Sebastian Eyre, 34, who runs a pizza company. “I don’t actually mind [the sound] because it’s usually kids. Lime have done their evil, so let the kids get a free ride.”</p>\n<p>Eyre, who lives in Sydenham, said he heard the dreaded beep, beep, beep “a couple times a day”. He reckons in his pocket of south-east London people are riding stolen bikes “nine time out of ten”, based on how often he hears the sound.</p>\n<p>A small stroll outside the park, on a road where cafes and bakeries that are the calling card of gentrification lie, Lime bikes were also seen whizzing up and down.</p>\n<p>Clad in Lycra and a bike helmet seldom seen on those zipping around on Lime e-bikes, John Villeneau said there had been a “massive increase” in the number of them available in the area.</p>\n<p>“If you just go to any of the pubs, there used to be a group of 10 bikes outside. Now, there’s like 50. There’s just hundreds of bikes outside on a Friday night because everyone Limes it up and Limes it back,” said the 59-year-old non-practising solicitor.</p>\n<p>He said he hears the beep, beep, beep sound a lot but doesn’t mind it. “If you’re forced to take a Lime bike and not pay for it and you have to put up with that noise yourself, who cares? I don’t care,” he said.</p>\n<p>He has given the e-bikes a go himself, but he’s not a big fan. “I’m not keen. They’re expensive and I can’t be bothered. The last couple of times I’ve ridden them into town, you have to go to a designated place and all that crap.”</p>\n<p>Jane, 68, a former teacher, who did not want to provide her last name, visited Clissold Park for the first time in over a year since moving out of the area.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/20/stolen-lime-bikes-sound-of-summer-city-london\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It sounds nonsensical, but that’s exactly the experience.</p>\n<p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>The gently undulating gravel trail in the country’s most sparsely populated region is not only a beginner-friendly cycle, it’s also enjoyed by people with a wide range of physical abilities.</p>\n<p>Natalie Gauld, 58, who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2022, has completed the West Coast Wilderness Trail multiple times and contributed to the trail’s <a href=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/74969/1734467237-west-coast-wilderness-trail-accessible-ride-guide-updated-november-2024.pdf\">accessible ride guide</a>. “It makes me feel capable,” said Gauld on a phone call before my trip. “I enjoy its remoteness.”</p>\n<p>The 133km trail from Ross to Greymouth (or vice versa) is one of 23 <a href=\"https://www.nzcycletrail.com/\">Ngā Haerenga Great Rides of New Zealand</a>. It’s in the West Coast region, a narrow strip of land roughly 600km long wedged between the frozen Southern Alps and the palm-fringed Tasman Sea. Its diverse ecosystems bizarrely buddy up: icy slopes and glacial rivers with steamy rainforests and pebbly beaches.</p>\n<p>Viewing the world from handlebars is the way my husband, Paul, and I typically like to travel. Long, short, challenging, easy-going; we’re not fussy once we’re immersed in the landscape on two wheels. Having said that, we are not fans of lugging our kit or working out the best places to stop, eat and sleep. So <a href=\"https://www.adventuresouth.co.nz/New-Zealand/Cycle-Trails/West-Coast-Wilderness-Cycle-Trail\">we joined three other riders on a five-day supported journey</a> with cycling and walking specialists Adventure South NZ, who took care of the tedious logistics and planned snack stops and short side hikes to several <a href=\"https://westcoast.co.nz/visit/see-do/scenic-attractions/\">West Coast scenic spots.</a></p>\n<p>A bridge closure meant we had to slice off the first 15km or so and saddle up on the road outside Hokitika in the lashing rain. “A real West Coast welcome,” said our tour guide, Tereza Unzeitigova. The soggy start was forgiven as soon as we ducked into the protection of a mossy native rainforest. The West Coast is the only part of New Zealand where significant tracts of lowland rainforest remain, which includes giant podocarp trees that hark back to Gondwanaland.</p>\n<p>The boardwalk traverses <a href=\"https://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/habitats/wetlands/wetlands-by-region/west-coast/\">Lake Mahinapua’s wetlands</a>, where the soundtrack was a sonic experience all its own. For the unversed, like me, it could have been anything from swans, ducks and royal spoonbills to bellbirds, tūī, kererū or cuckoos. A coastal hug back to our accommodation in Hokitika completed the first 20km.</p>\n<p>“‘Coasters’ have to be more self-reliant because we’re geographically isolated,” said Adventure South NZ host Rob Pieper, who served the group a paddock-to-plate dinner of zucchini soup, organic beef goulash and vegetarian dahl with rice that evening at his architecturally designed off-grid home. “If we have an earthquake, we could be on our own for months.”</p>\n<p>Pieper and his wife, Col, prepare cyclists’ meals for the tour group. It is a natural fit for the delightful tandem-riding couple originally from the Netherlands, who – along with managing their smallholding, situated on the coast at Ruatapu in a rare white heron habitat – “make it work” by guiding, nursing, catering and school-bus driving.</p>\n<p>After a restful night at the Beachfront hotel in Hokitika, we got a bird’s eye view of the native forest on a <a href=\"https://treetopsnz.com/\">walk in the treetops</a>, before continuing the ride on a narrow trail alongside the babbling waters of the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alltrails.com%2Ftrail%2Fnew-zealand%2Fwest-coast%2Fkaniere-water-race-walkway&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/jun/14/remote-and-accessible-cycling-new-zealands-west-coast-wilderness-trail\">Kaniere water race</a>. Before my trip, Gauld told me she can pedal her Motom here after “pinch points” on the trail were widened.</p>\n<p>Following a homemade lunch in a repurposed woolshed with Rob and Col, we spent the remainder of the day riding the shores of Lake Kaniere and hiking into the azure awe of <a href=\"https://westcoast.co.nz/visit/discover/highlights/hokitika-gorge/\">Hokitika Gorge</a>. Its glacial waters carry precious pounamu (greenstone) from the mountains down to the sea.</p>\n<p>Time-poor doctors Nikhil Patel, 36, and Anvi Butala, 31, chose the trail because it packs multiple experiences into a relatively short trip. In preparation for the ride, Butala found a hill near where she lives and rode it 10 times in one training session, she told me.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/jun/14/remote-and-accessible-cycling-new-zealands-west-coast-wilderness-trail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Here’s what to do if yours goes missing.</p>\n    <h2>\n      <strong>What to do if your bike is lost or stolen</strong>\n    </h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Report the theft to the police and describe the bike in as much detail as possible, giving the model, make and where it was stolen. You should also include a description of any scratches, dents and marks that could help identify it, and a picture if you have one. You can go into your local police station or call 101 in the UK to file a report. Make sure you get a crime reference number.</p></li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Home insurance policies will often cover your bike when it’s at home but you will probably have needed to pay extra to extend this for when you’re out and about, or if you have a valuable bike. Report the loss to your insurer and give it the crime reference number. Your bike will not be covered if you failed to look after it, such as not locking it securely or with a suitable lock.</p></li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Declare your bike stolen on</p><a href=\"https://www.bikeregister.com/\">BikeRegister</a>, a UK bike database – you can do this even if you have not registered your bike on there before. It will help improve the chances of your bike being recovered if there are pictures and descriptions of the bike, and where it was stolen.</li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Post on bike and cycling forums, such as</p><a href=\"https://forum.cyclinguk.org/\">Cycling UK Forum</a>,<a href=\"https://www.bikeforums.net/]\">Bike Forum</a>and<a href=\"https://www.cyclechat.net/\">CycleChat</a>in case people come across it when looking to buy a new bike.</li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Look on resale sites such as Gumtree, Facebook Marketplace and eBay to see whether someone is trying to sell your bike. You can set up alerts for bikes that are the same make and model. If you find one that looks like yours, alert the police – they may be able to recover it. It is not advisable to set up a sting or try to deal with the case yourself.</p></li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Alert the local community on neighbourhood forums such as Nextdoor or local Facebook groups and get in touch any bike shops nearby in case someone comes in to the shop and tries to sell one that matches your description.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2>\n      <strong>What to do when you get a new bike</strong>\n    </h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Scuff the frame up a bit using sandpaper, paint and stickers so it is less appealing to thieves. Some kitsch, drawn-on hearts might save you a lot of hassle in the future.</p></li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Register it on</p><a href=\"https://www.bikeregister.com/\">BikeRegister</a>and upload pictures alongside the frame number, which is usually found on the bottom bracket shell between the pedals or on the rear dropouts where the back wheel slots in. This will help the police trace it back to you if it is stolen and recovered.</li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Invest in two high-quality locks to make your bike less of a target. At least one of these should be a good-quality D-lock. Be sure to attach the frame to the stand when locking up.</p></li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Take any removable parts with you whenever you leave it.</p></li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Find and apply for your nearest cycle parking. This gives another layer of protection, but be sure to still lock up securely. In cities there are also many cycle hangars, such as Cyclehoop, which are small bike stores on residential streets you can apply for at a small cost each year.</p><a href=\"https://www.cyclehoop.rentals/\">Check whether there’s one near you</a>.</li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Conceal a Bluetooth tracker on your bike to help locate it if it goes missing. The smaller and more discreet the tracker, the better. Good spots to hide them include under the seat or inside the handlebar. Apple AirTag and Tile Sticker are popular among bike owners.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/jun/11/what-to-do-if-your-bike-is-stolen-and-how-to-break-the-cycle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <i>Terry Rosoman ran almost 120km across south Wales to make a giant penis and testicles</i>\n    </p>\n<p>In 2013, I was in the worst shape of my life. Though I functioned well day to day, I was a heavy binge drinker and smoker. Unfit, obese and unhappy, on impulse I signed up to a white-collar boxing fight. I trained six days a week for three months, shifting three stone by fight night. Winning that fight was great, though turning my life around had been my main goal. After that, I started challenging myself regularly while raising money for mental health charities.</p>\n<p>My first 24-hour challenge involved ascending Pen y Fan – the highest peak in south Wales – 10 times in a row during the dead of winter. It was horrific, but it raised lots of money, so next time I wanted something even bigger. Having seen examples of <a href=\"https://www.strav.art/\">Strava art</a> online, I thought that might be a good way to get people’s attention. I decided on a big run in the Bannau Brycheiniog<strong> </strong>(formerly the<strong> </strong>Brecon Beacons), an hour from my home, and chose November to coincide with Men’s Health Awareness Month. A giant penis seemed the obvious way to represent this, plus it was undeniably eye‑catching. I researched previous examples made using GPS mapping, all created on foot in a single, continuous effort. Plenty of them were three or four miles long, but I was aiming for something on a much grander scale.</p>\n<p>Using the Strava planner, I found a route resembling a shaft between England and Wales, right up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/oct/14/offas-dyke-path-at-50\">Offa’s Dyke</a>. I thought, “Brilliant. Can I tack on a little bell-end at the top, near Hay-on-Wye?” Yes, there it was. “Now, can I squeeze some balls on at the bottom?” The whole thing took shape very easily, taking in Crickhowell and Llangenny, and passing serendipitously through a village called Three Cocks. Only then did I realise the route was just over 72 miles (116km) long, with almost 10,000ft of elevation. But now I’d plotted the picture, I had to do it.</p>\n<p>I started and ended in Abergavenny, where I set off at 5pm on 1 November 2024, running for 12 hours in darkness. Friends were stationed en route to run alongside me for a while and keep my spirits up; likewise my brother was waiting for me right on the tip. Without their encouragement, I don’t know if I’d have made it. The first 20 miles were uphill, and after 50 I just wanted to die, yet still had the best part of a whole marathon to go.</p>\n<p>Bone-tired and wrapped in a Welsh flag, I crossed the finish line at 4.30pm the following afternoon, half an hour shy of the 24-hour mark. A local craftsman presented me with a 3D-printed cock and balls trophy. The giant manhood has also been recreated in cake form by my mother, to celebrate my 40th birthday, and I’ve even been a question on Have I Got News for You. Some have suggested my real aim was to make my name the top result whenever anyone Googles “world’s biggest penis”. Alas, it turns out the search terms have to be a bit more specific.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>‘</strong>\n      <strong>I turned too soon coming out of the shark’s mouth’</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Samppa Tölli put on ice skates to etch a 16km image of a great white shark on to a frozen lake in Finland</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Hiidenvesi is the second-largest lake in Finland’s Uusimaa region, north-west of Helsinki. My parents have lived near the lake since I was a kid, so I’ve known it all my life. In summer, I’d ride around the surrounding bike trails or go out in my kayak. I still live nearby. During the winter the lake freezes over, and in 2023 I spent a lot of time skating on it.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/may/25/artist-athletes-drawing-gps-fitness-trackers-strava\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It fulfils a pledge <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Labour-Party-manifesto-2024.pdf\">Labour included in its manifesto</a> for last year’s general election.</p>\n    <p>“How can we expect children to do well at school if they have the equivalent of a double espresso in their system on a daily basis?”, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/wes-streeting\">Wes Streeting</a>, the health secretary.</p>\n    <p>“Energy drinks might seem harmless but the sleep, concentration and wellbeing of today’s kids are all being impacted, while high sugar versions damage their teeth and contribute to obesity.”</p>\n    <p>Shops, cafes, restaurants and websites will be prohibited from selling energy drinks containing more than 150mg of caffeine per litre to anyone under 16. That will affect drinks such as Red Bull, Monster, Relentless and Prime Energy and force their makers to reformulate their products.</p>\n    <p>For example, a 250ml can of Red Bull contains 80mg of caffeine, the same as one espresso or two cans of cola. Tea, coffee and soft drinks containing lower amounts of caffeine will be unaffected.</p>\n    <p>It is unclear when sales to under-16s – including from vending machines – will become illegal. The ban will be done using secondary legislation under the Food Safety Act 1990.</p>\n    <p>Supermarkets voluntarily stopped selling the drinks to under-16s in 2018. But some smaller convenience stores still allow under-16s to buy them. Drinks containing more than 150mg of caffeine per litre already carry warning labels that they are “not suitable for children”.</p>\n    <p>“High-caffeine energy drinks have no place in children’s hands. This is a common sense, evidence-based step to protect children’s physical, mental and dental health”, said Katharine Jenner, the director of the <a href=\"https://obesityhealthalliance.org.uk/\">Obesity Health Alliance</a>.</p>\n    <p>The success of preventing young people buying alcohol and cigarettes showed that age-based restrictions work, Jenner added. “Age-of-sale policies like this have a proven record of reducing access to products that are not suitable for children.”</p>\n    <p>Teachers have voiced concern about how energy drinks have left young children “bouncing off the walls in lesson time” after consuming them on their way to school.</p>\n    <p>Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, said the move would help tackle the “scourge of poor classroom behaviour”, which is caused in part by “the harmful effects of caffeine-loaded drinks”.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.nasuwt.org.uk/static/e4d66c48-9cd8-49c9-84db6895956f75f4/Behaviour-Briefing-Children-and-Young-People-Engaging-in-Harmful-Activities.pdf\">Research by the NASUWT union</a> found 71% of teachers worry about pupils misusing energy drinks at school and 70% while elsewhere.</p>\n    <p>“The drinks create a situation in which pupils can’t focus, can’t sit still and just think it’s cool to drink them”, one teacher said. Another said: “Energy drinks make it very difficult for students to focus and engage with learning and seem to make students noisier and agitated.”</p>\n    <p>Matt Wrack, the union’s general secretary, said under-16s will still be able to get the drinks from parents or other adults, despite the ban.</p>\n    <p>Dentists urged the government to go further. The ban should be extended to include zero and low-sugar energy drinks to help tackle tooth decay, the British Dental Association said.</p>\n    <p>“Products that are habit-forming, highly acidic and can contain over 20 teaspoons of sugar have no place on the menu for children”, said Eddie Crouch, the association’s chair.</p>\n    <p>Dr Kawther Hashem, a lecturer in public health nutrition and head of research and impact at Action on Sugar, said trading standards officers would have to enforce the ban to ensure it worked.</p>\n    <p>Gavin Partington, the director general of the British Soft Drinks Association, said firms do not market or promote the drinks to under-16s.</p>\n    <p>He added: “Our members have led the way in self-regulation through our longstanding energy drinks code of practice.</p>\n    <p>“Our members do not market or promote the sale of energy drinks to under-16s and label all high-caffeine beverages as ‘not recommended for children’, in line with and in the spirit of this code.</p>\n    <p>“As with all government policy, it’s essential that any forthcoming regulation is based on a rigorous assessment of the evidence that’s available.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/02/children-energy-drinks-government-obesity-health\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>Our 16-year-old son has an incurable degenerative disease</strong>\n      <strong> and now needs round-the-clock care. My husband has had to give up work to look after him but  Aviva </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>is refusing to pay out under our critical illness policy.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>We’ve been paying £60 a month for the cover since 2007.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Our son was born in 2008</strong>\n      <strong> and diagnosed with </strong>\n      <strong>spinal </strong>\n      <strong>muscular </strong>\n      <strong>atrophy with respiratory distress</strong>\n      <strong> (SMA</strong>\n      <strong>-RD) when he was eight.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>He managed well in mainstream school until June last year, since when his health has deteriorated significantly and he has paralysis in all four limbs.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>We contacted Aviva in January to discuss our eligibility for a claim. We were transferred between three departments</strong>\n      <strong> and waited </strong>\n      <strong>more than three-and-a-half hours. An advis</strong>\n      <strong>er repeatedly stated that he did not meet the criteria, but would not tell us what the criteria were.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>We twice requested copies of our policy documents, but they were never received. We raised a formal complaint about their communications in February</strong>\n      <strong> and our consultant submitted medical reports.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>In late June, our claim was denied. Its argument is that SMA-</strong>\n      <strong>RD is a genetic condition </strong>\n      <strong>that would have been present at birth, while his cover on our policy only started on his first birthday.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>I suppose that is why Aviva </strong>\n      <strong>has reported £</strong>\n      <strong>1bn </strong>\n      <strong>operating profit in the first half of this year.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>NL, </strong>\n      <strong>Belfast</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Insurers look upon human suffering through the lens of terms and conditions, and cold hard cash. It has to be this way – they are businesses. But commerce does not preclude compassion and this was shamefully lacking in Aviva’s dealings with you.</p>\n<p>Despite the urgency of your circumstances, it took five months to reach a decision. The email trail you sent me shows your repeated pleadings for updates.</p>\n<p>Your critical illness policy automatically covers children once they reach their first birthday. The terms and conditions do, indeed, state that illnesses that are present from birth are not covered and that symptoms must not have started when the cover begins.</p>\n<p>You sought advice when your son was one as he wasn’t meeting certain developmental targets, but all the tests came back negative. It took another seven years before he was diagnosed with SMA-RD.</p>\n<p>The Financial Ombudsman Service <a href=\"https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/businesses/complaints-deal/insurance/pre-existing-medical-conditions\">states that it usually upholds complaints</a> about claims rejected because of pre-existing conditions of which the customer was unaware.</p>\n<p>It also says that it overrides exclusions in insurers’ terms and conditions if the customer had only general symptoms when cover began, and could not reasonably have foreseen that they would later give rise to a claim.</p>\n<p>There are many reasons why a one-year-old may miss generalised development milestones and most aren’t incurable diseases. I therefore put it to Aviva that you could have had no way of knowing that your infant son had a serious condition that would lead to a claim 15 years later. I suggested that, given the complexities and the timescales, it was rejecting the claim unreasonably on a technicality.</p>\n<p>I was startled by the speed of Aviva’s response. Within two days it had told you that, although it considered your claim had failed to meet its terms and conditions, it would pay you the full £10,000 allowed by your policy. It freely acknowledged that its about-turn had been prompted by my intervention. The money was in your account a few hours later.</p>\n<p>It says: “We fully acknowledge that our service and communication did not meet the standards our customers rightly expect from us. The family’s situation should have prompted a more urgent and compassionate response.</p>\n<p>“While we are unable to approve NL’s son’s claim because of the terms of the policy, we recognise the unique circumstances of this case and the shortfalls in our service, and believe that it is appropriate to make a goodwill payment that is equivalent to the benefit the family would have received had the claim been eligible.”</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Coming up to scratch</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Most companies get it right most of the time. Most put it right when they don’t. And some exceed expectations so magnificently they deserve a shout-out.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/sep/01/aviva-denied-our-sick-son-help-after-five-month-wait\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>A busy Wednesday morning on Bishopsgate in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london\">London</a> and Sgt Stuart Ford of the City of London police is pointing out possible offenders. “He’s not pedalling,” he says, indicating a man on a bike on the other side of the road. “Still not pedalling, but he is going downhill, he might be all right. I’d still pull him over and have a look.”</p>\n<p>Not today, though, because the non-pedalling possible offender is heading north, while Ford’s team – two members of the cycle response unit he set up two years ago and leads – are facing south on the opposite side of the road. A lot of the unit’s work centres on illegal e-bikes; they have seized 212 so far this year.</p>\n<p>News comes over the radio that PCs Harry Rose and David Parker have stopped someone they suspect is on an illegal e-bike, so we find them with a delivery rider in the familiar green livery of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/uber\">Uber</a> Eats. The man, whose name is Mahede Hasan, says his bike has pedals, and the power of the electric motor is 250 watts, which he thought was allowed.</p>\n<p>Ford tilts the bike on its stand and twists the throttle on the right handlebar. “That’s illegal for a start,” he says. “You should pedal to make the motor work.” The bike doesn’t go anywhere, because the spinning back wheel is off the ground, but the speedometer climbs – 20, 30, 40, 50, 52km/h. That’s about 32mph. “What do you think the top speed of this bike should be, with pedal assist?” he asks Hasan, who doesn’t know, so Ford tells him. “15.5mph [25km/h]. This is basically a motorcycle.”</p>\n<p>E-bikes aren’t illegal per se, and you will no doubt have noticed their increased popularity in UK cities, including the proliferation of rental ones (you might have views on them blocking pavements, or the fact that the ever-present background noise of urban Britain is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/20/stolen-lime-bikes-sound-of-summer-city-london\">click click click of a kid on a stolen Lime bike</a>, but that is a different issue). To be legal, which the rental bikes are, an e-bike needs to meet certain criteria. These include having pedals that can be used to drive the bike, an electric motor with a maximum power output of 250W, and a maximum assisted speed of 15.5mph. That doesn’t mean they can’t go faster, if you pedal hard or go downhill, just that the motor won’t help above that speed. Essentially, they’re bicycles with a bit of help, and that’s how they’re treated: you don’t need a licence, registration or insurance to ride one.</p>\n<p>The trouble is a lot of e-bikes <i>aren’t</i> legal to ride on the road, but they are very easy and cheap to get hold of. While the officers complete their paperwork, Hasan, 21, tells me he bought his bike new, on the internet, for £600. “I got it because I do, like, eight or nine hours a day, and if I’m only pedalling I’m going to get more tired. An e-bike makes it more comfortable.” Originally from Bangladesh, he has put a sticker showing a map of the country on the front mudguard.</p>\n<p>He assumed the bike was legal because there was nothing on the website he bought it from that said it wasn’t. “If it’s not, how do they sell it to people?” He says that if he’d known he was breaking the law, he wouldn’t have stopped when they pulled him over. The cycle response unit operates on pedal bikes. “I believe they wouldn’t catch me,” he says.</p>\n<p>The officers tell him they’re seizing the bike, and he asks if he can keep the detachable battery, which they allow, while he cancels the lunch order he was due to deliver. “It’s going to affect my account because when you accept a job, that means you’re committing to delivering to the customer. If you don’t, that’s your problem, not the company’s.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/04/britains-e-bike-boom-desperation-delivery-drivers-and-unthinkable-danger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But just as everyone has their own preferred bike, choosing the right lock, from ultra-secure bolts to lightweight devices, is very personal.</p>\n<p>Cyclists need to consider where they live, how attractive their bike is to thieves (they often look for more elaborate city and racing bikes), and how long they leave it unaccompanied. So to help you pin down the best option for you, we asked the experts for their top bike lock selections to keep your ride secure.</p>\n<h2>What you need to know</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.met.police.uk/cp/crime-prevention/keeping-vehicles-safe/how-safe-is-your-bike/\">Metropolitan police</a> urges people to use two locks instead of one, locking both the frame and the wheels to the stand and taking anything removable – lights, baskets and even the saddle – with you. Also, bear in mind that you may have to carry a lock around for some time, so weight is key.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.soldsecure.com/\">Sold Secure</a> rating system, owned by the Master Locksmiths Association, judges the performance of any lock. It ranks locks from bronze (the most basic level) to silver (which aims to prevent the more determined attacker), gold (to stop dedicated attacks) and diamond (halting the most serious, including angle grinder, attacks).</p>\n<p>Carl Ellis, who founded <a href=\"https://thebestbikelock.com/\">thebestbikelock.com</a> after having one too many bikes stolen, doesn’t recommend bronze-rated locks because he says they don’t provide enough protection in most cases.<strong> </strong>So spend as much as you can afford. He says you can get a lock at a medium security level for about £30, with more secure locks usually costing about £40.</p>\n<p>If you have cycle insurance, ensure you’re buying a lock approved by your insurer, says Richard Cantle, founder of <a href=\"https://www.stolenride.co.uk/\">Stolen Ride</a>, a cyclist-run site that aims to tackle the issues around bike theft.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>At a glance</strong>\n    </h2>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best affordable lock:</strong><br/>Halfords 23cm D Lock</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fcycling%2Fbike-accessories%2Fbike-locks%2Fhalfords-23cm-d-lock---key-225374.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">£35 at Halfords</a>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best</strong><strong>angle grinder resistant</strong><strong>lock:</strong><br/>Hiplok D1000</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://hiplok.com/product/hiplok-d1000/\">£249.99 at Hiplok</a>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best for</strong><strong>city cyclists:</strong><br/>Kryptonite Evolution Mini-7</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fcycling%2Fbike-accessories%2Fbike-locks%2Fevolution-mini-7-lock-with-4-foot-cable-with-flexframe-bracket-sold-secure-silver-581667.html-581667.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">£44.99 at Halfords</a>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best combination lock:</strong><br/>Kryptonite KryptoLok Combo</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.freewheel.co.uk%2Fkryptonite-kryptolok-combo-standard-u-lock-with-bracket-sold-secure-gold-gk005797&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">£51.99 at Freewheel</a>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best chain lock:</strong><br/>Kryptonite KryptoLok Series 2</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fcycling%2Fbike-accessories%2Fbike-locks%2Fkryptolok-995-integrated-chain---9.5-mm-x-95-cm-sold-secure-silver-126064.html-126064.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">£59.99 at Halfords</a>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best lightweight lock:</strong><br/>Foldylock Mini</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FFoldyLock-Mini-Folding-Bike-Lock%2Fdp%2FB0B56BHRLL&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">From £76.98 at Amazon</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>The best bike locks in the UK in 2025</h2>\n<h2>Best affordable lock</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Halfords 23cm D Lock</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fcycling%2Fbike-accessories%2Fbike-locks%2Fhalfords-23cm-d-lock---key-225374.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">£35 at Halfords</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Carl Ellis’s pick is the Halfords 23cm D Lock, which has a gold rating, is practically sized and has a mount included to attach to the frame of the bike.

Brands including Abus, Litelok, Kryptonite and Hiplok have introduced stronger materials, smarter mounting systems, and locks designed specifically for the fatter frames of e-bikes. You can now choose from ultra-tough U-locks, wearable chain locks, and compact folding models with real-world resistance to power tools. A good bike lock won’t make your bike theft-proof, but it can buy you time and give a thief enough reason to walk away.</p>\n<p>We tested 15 of the best bike locks widely available in the US across all different categories and price points.

My reviews have appeared in Outside, Bicycling and more than a dozen other cycling publications. I’ve broken, bent and burned through plenty of bike locks – and several dozen angle grinder discs – to separate marketing hype from real-world security.</p>\n<h2>How I tested</h2>\n<p>I tested 15 locks from major brands, including Abus, Kryptonite, Litelok, Hiplok, OnGuard and Seatylock. They were chosen based on security ratings, brand reputation, US availability and how well they represented key use cases.</p>\n<p>To test theft resistance, I cut them using a cordless angle grinder – the preferred device of modern bike thieves to slice through locks and even bike racks. The time to breach listed for each lock is based on this method. While no lock is grinder-proof, some dramatically slow down the theft process by chewing up grinder discs. The best locks required multiple cuts, drained batteries, and destroyed cutting discs enough to deter determined thieves.</p>\n<p>That said, grinder resistance is only one part of the equation. I used each lock for a minimum of two weeks, including short stops, daily commutes and overnight lockups when appropriate for the type of lock. I tested how easy each lock was to carry, deploy and use with different bike frames and bike racks. I noted whether mounts were included, how well they worked, and how much the locks rattled while riding.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>All prices current at the time of publication.</i>\n    </p>\n<h2>At a glance</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best bike lock overall:</strong><br/>Litelok X1<sub>$189.99 at Litelok</sub></li>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best budget bike lock:</strong>Abus Ivera Chain 7210<sub>$82.70 at Amazon</sub></li>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best chain bike lock:</strong>Kryptonite New York Fahgettaboudit Chain<sub>$124.96 at Walmart</sub></li>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best folding bike lock:</strong>Foldylock Forever<sub>$135 at Seatylock</sub></li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>Best overall bike lock:<br/>\n Litelok X1</h2>\n<p>The Litelok X1 is the best overall bike lock we tested. It balances real-world grinder resistance with everyday usability and it is relatively low-weight. This makes it ideal for e-bike riders, daily commuters and anyone locking up in theft-prone areas.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Why we love it</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Most high-security locks fall into two camps: burdensome chains that can weigh up to 15lb, or compact U-locks that can be difficult to use with larger frames or awkward racks. The X1 sidesteps that trade-off with a flexible composite armor called Barronium over a hardened steel core. This material actively resists cutting wheels so effectively that in testing, we had to swap angle grinder discs six times, as well as swap batteries. Both are key factors that can easily stop a thief in their tracks.</p>\n<p>At just 3.7lb (1.7kg), the X1 is surprisingly portable for a Diamond-rated lock. It’s slightly larger than a standard U-lock, with enough internal space to fit around oversized tubes or street signs. It also has reflective striping for night-time visibility and a covered keyway to keep out grime and water.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>It’s a shame that …</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/aug/29/best-bike-locks-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s good for your physical and mental health, offers a carbon-free way of getting from A to B, and can often be the quickest and most cost-effective form of transport – particularly if you live in a city.</p>\n<p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>Once you’re hooked, there are a few bits of kit that will improve your experience immeasurably, whether that’s comfortable clothing to curtail chaffing, or a water bottle to help you hydrate without stopping. In summer, the longer days and generally favourable conditions mean you can forgo additional accessories such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/feb/13/best-bike-lights\">bike lights</a>, mudguards and head-to-toe waterproofs – although they can’t be avoided forever if you become a year-round, all-weather rider.</p>\n<p>Another bit of good news is that while cycling has a reputation for being an expensive pursuit, it doesn’t have to be, and many of my favourite bits of kit have more affordable price tags.</p>\n<p>In the almost three decades since I set off stabiliser-free for the first time, I’ve dabbled in all types of cycling – from a teenage fling with BMXing to inner-city commuting and ultra-distance off-road escapades. In that time, I’ve tested all manner of clothing, tools and accessories, pushing them to the limit during races, events, training rides and the daily grind. Here’s my favourite gear that I reach for before setting off on a summer ride.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Summer cycling essentials</strong>\n    </h2>\n<h2>Jersey</h2>\n<p>Although it performs a similar function to a generic sports base layer, a jersey is the first “proper” bit of cycling gear worth investing in because of the additional comfort it offers. Made from a lightweight, breathable fabric, a jersey will wick away moisture from hotspots, while a full-length zip means you can “ventilate” on the go. Three rear pockets store essentials such as food, tools and a phone, and unlike a running or gym top, the cut is slightly longer at the back for extra coverage when riding leant forward.</p>\n<p>My favourites, which perform well without breaking the bank, are Italian-designed Sportful SRK, which includes an extra zipped compartment for keys; the 100% recycled Rapha Core; the DHB Blok and its women-specific range, Moda; and the sub-£40 Madison Flux, which comes with a lifetime guarantee.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Rapha Core women’s jersey</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.rapha.cc/gb/en/product/womens-core-jersey/WOR05XXCYW\">From £55 at Rapha</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Sportful men’s SRK jersey</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.sportful.com/GB/en/Mens/Cycling/Jerseys/SRK-JERSEY/p/1124034_3000\">£48.75 at Sportful</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>DHB Moda women’s short</strong>\n      <strong>-sleeve jersey 2.0</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sportsdirect.com%2Fdhb-moda-womens-short-sleeve-jersey-20-333826&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">£55 at Sports Direct</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>DHB Blok men’s classic short</strong>\n      <strong>-sleeve jersey</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sportsdirect.com%2Fdhb-blok-mens-classic-short-sleeve-jersey-634892&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">£55 at Sports Direct</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2Fdp%2FB0DDV1R8C5%2F&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">From £109.99 at Amazon</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Madison Flux men’s short</strong>\n      <strong>-sleeve jersey</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ffawkes-cycles.co.uk%2Fmadison-flux-mens-short-sleeve-jersey-black-p36363%2Fs73799&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">£33.99 at Fawkes Cycles</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclestore.co.uk%2Fmadison_flux_short_sleeve_jersey-ID_89823&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">£35.99 at Cycle Store</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Shorts</h2>\n<p>Bib shorts might seem like an indulgent (and expensive) purchase, but you get what you pay for – and your nether regions will let it be known if you’ve skimped. Fitted with a saddle-shaped section of foam in the crotch (known as a chamois), the shorts add an extra layer of padding beneath your perineum that keeps the area dry and cushioned on long rides. Just don’t wear underwear, as this can negate the benefits. The straps may make the item resemble a wrestler’s singlet, but they keep the shorts in place more comfortably than a waistband, which can dig in over time. As the male and female anatomy are quite different down there, it’s worth opting for a gender-specific set.</p>\n<p>Albion’s ABR1 are my go-to for ultra-distance exploits, arriving with handy pockets on each thigh and one at the rear for extra storage. The Gregarius Essential from Q36.5, meanwhile, are soft and supportive against the skin, and breathable too.</p>\n<p>And for women, “Petrichor Projects’ PP002 offer unbeatable comfort, with a cargo pocket, easy-pee design and sleek aesthetics,” says Katherine Moore, author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/gravel-rides-south-west-england-9781839812545/?utm_source=theguardian&amp;utm_medium=filter&amp;utm_campaign=summercycling\">Gravel Rides South West England</a>, who also recommends Velocio’s Luxe line for all-day epics. “They’re made from a super-soft, compressive material with a built-in base layer front and lovely raw-finish leg hem. A thicker-style chamois pad is the go-to for longer rides.”</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Albion ABR1 </strong>\n      <strong>men’s pocket bib shorts</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.condorcycles.com%2Fproducts%2Falbion-men-s-abr1-pocket-bib-shorts%3Fvariant%3D55680630161792&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">£185 at Condor Cycles</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.albioncycling.com/products/mens-abr1-pocket-bib-shorts-black\">£185 at Albion Cycling</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Q36.5 </strong>\n      <strong>Gregarius Essential bib shorts</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.q36-5.com/en-gb/shop/gregarius-essential-bib-shorts-black/\">£140 at Q36.5</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Petrichor Projects PP002 women’s bib shorts</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

This time I’ll go free.</p>\n<p>As her body falls to the floor, I’ll seize my opportunity. As her soul rises from her body, I will snatch what should be mine — no cliched tunnel of light, just a doorway into the afterlife. But it will be my turn this time, <i>my</i> door. I’ll take it before she can.</p>\n<p>Not that I’ve been able to yet. When the moment comes, I am frozen in place. I can only watch as she enters the door and disappears. And I hate her for it.</p>\n<p>But my plan is not impossible. It has worked before. It was done to me. I remember staring down at my lifeless body sprawled across the carpet. I remember seeing a door appear. Feeling it beckon to me with a promise of peace. Then before I could respond, a ghostly form — the wife before me, I assume — threw it open. She looked at me a moment, shrugged in half apology, and slipped through the door. Which disappeared after her. Leaving me stuck here.</p>\n<p>But not for much longer. When he murders his next wife, I will steal <i>her</i> way out. It’s only fair. That’s what I tell myself, at least. Every time.</p>\n<p>I hear him now at the door, the regular kind. He opens it and carries her across the threshold.</p>\n<p>“Here we are,” he says, his script old and tired to me but fresh for each new wife. “Your home, Mrs. Blake.”</p>\n<p>I notice her elegant dress and her black hair curling around her face, the ring sparkling on her finger — and I freeze. I’m right, this time is different. Because it is <i>my</i> ring, the one he took off my hand before it was even cold.</p>\n<p>I imagine how she felt as he slid it onto her finger, like he did with me. She probably smiled as it glittered in candlelight. Neither of us knew what was coming.</p>\n<p>Her gaze sweeps the room as I stand there, anger roiling through me. And then, something else is different. Because her eyes suddenly stop, widening almost comically.</p>\n<p>She is staring directly at me.</p>\n<p>She looks away immediately. She turns back to her new husband, her future murderer, and begs him to show her around the house. She has never been here, no wife ever comes here before the marriage. Maybe if we had, we would have sensed the wrongness of this place. Or maybe not.</p>\n<p/><p>I know she sees me — know it because of how she stutters to a stop when she enters a room I am in. How her eyes flick to me and away again whenever I appear. But she pretends I don’t exist, and I pretend nothing has changed. It doesn’t matter that she sees me, since she’ll be dead before long. And I cannot make friends with someone I mean to betray.</p>\n<p>I wonder how I look to her. Does she see the last dress I wore, the way I’d done my hair so carefully? Does she see the wound in my chest? It is unsettling to know she sees me at all.</p>\n<p>At least <i>he</i> continues oblivious to my existence. He would otherwise find some way to torment me still.</p>\n<p>She settles in, unpacking clothing, tucking her toothbrush in the holder next to his, washing her morning coffee cup. I roam the halls as I always have, bound to this place and this man. I cannot leave, cannot even see beyond the front door. I have tried, but it seems the only exit for me is the type he keeps providing, if only I can find a way to take it.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/08/19/podcastle-905-the-next-dead-wife/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 904: TALES FROM THE VAULTS – The Illuminated Dragon</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated G</p>\n<h3>The Illuminated Dragon</h3>\n<p>Rafe Greatorex thought he’d spotted a dragon. From where he stood on the cobbled street that ran between the leaning tenements, only a narrow strip of sky was visible. Rafe craned his neck. He was sure — almost sure — that something had flown by, above. A black shadow, an X against the distant blue.</p>\n<p>He looked down again, rubbing his neck. No, it was nothing. Dragons had been outlawed thirty years ago. He must have imagined it. Sighing, he adjusted his glasses, took up the string bag of potatoes with one hand and the canvas bag of books and supplies with the other, and trudged on toward home.</p>\n<p>Finding the supplies he needed for his work on the bestiary had been difficult. He must have walked for miles through the tangled streets of the city to get it all. Gold leaf was almost more than he could afford; he had a bit of it pressed between the pages of a Rationalist text in his breast pocket. The inks, he could still find, and the paper and parchment, but the brushmakers had cast furtive looks up and down the street when they took out their wares, had accepted his payment and scurried away into dark alleys. Of all the paraphernalia of illumination, the colors had been the hardest to find; they would be illegal soon, one pigment-grinder had whispered. “You must take what you can afford now, sir,” the woman had advised, “for it may not be here tomorrow.”</p>\n<p>Rafe plodded on. Arriving at the open space before the cathedral, he looked up again. Still no dragon, and the blue sky had faded to the more typical glassine white which would in turn darken to heavy gray and rain before nightfall. Rafe sighed, switched the book bag from his right hand to his left, and went on. Then he stopped and looked up again. Something was different.</p>\n<p>As usual, the cathedral loomed over one side of the square, buttresses sprawling. The body and the soul, Rafe always thought, when he saw it. The heavy gray stone of the massive cathedral was the body crouching beneath the weight of its sins, while the surprisingly airy filigreed-stone steeple strained toward heaven, the soul hoping for release from the gravity that bound it.</p>\n<p>Rafe frowned. Something was missing. . . . The gargoyles. They’d hacked off the gargoyles. Just last week he’d come this way and the dragons and he-goats and demons had poked their smirking faces from drainpipes, from above doorways and along rooflines. But they were gone now; only stumps of stone remained.</p>\n<p>Rafe stared. Bad enough that all of the statues were gone, not to mention every tapestry and painting in the city. But gargoyles? What would they take next? Graffiti? Tattoos? Children’s drawings?</p>\n<p>Illuminated texts? Shaken, Rafe considered it. His work, he’d always told himself, was close enough to writing, sufficiently unlike representational art, that he was safe from the ponderous wheels of law that ground slowly but exceeding fine. Thirty years ago, maybe, the Rationalists might have seen a man with Rafe’s talent as a threat, as someone to arrest and interrogate and reeducate. And thirty years ago, Rafe admitted, he might have been a danger, however slight, to the Rationalists. But he’d finished with the resistance long ago; he wasn’t sure such a thing as resistance even existed any more. The Rationalists would leave him alone, wouldn’t they?</p>\n<p>The thought of Men of Truth pawing through his shop appalled him. He imagined them hacking away at his lovely illuminated parchments, the capitals with their snakes all a-twining and a-shimmer with gold leaf, the speckled pards crouched at the foot of a page, the marginal dragons delineated in the most delicate strokes of vermilion, the gryphons stippled with argent. Rafe shuddered.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/08/12/podcastle-904-tales-from-the-vaults-the-illuminated-dragon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 903: On the Shoulders of Giants</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated PG</p>\n<h3>On the Shoulders of Giants</h3>\n<p>I was born a T12. Sure, it was the lowest of the thoracic vertebrae, but it was higher than any of the lumbars. I should be thankful to have been born high enough to see above the clouds. The L2s and L3s that climb beside me spent most of their youth in the haze below, unable to see the sun, not knowing how much more of the giant there was left to climb. But not me: fortunate me.</p>\n<p>I grasp at rocky outcroppings and pull myself up the well worn stairs, carved into the ground by those who came before me. Moss hangs from the edges where feet avoid stepping, lest they slip down into the endless void of white below. The wall to my left rises as a sheer cliff of granite, or perhaps marble. It is difficult to know from the amount of lichen and foliage that hang down like curtains. But through the small holes cleaned out by the hands of travelers before, I can sometimes see the glint of the giant who breathes underneath.</p>\n<p>Another step, another step. I hang my free hand into the air and feel the breeze, looking out to a flat horizon. I squint at a dark object in the distance. Another giant, perhaps. Impossible to tell, as they never get close enough to truly see. I turn back to the stairs and find a small cavern ahead, a respite from the daily climb.</p>\n<p>A few other travelers have already taken shelter, gathering around a small fire in the center of the cavern. I find an empty place and sit, taking a moment to rub the calluses on my bare feet.</p>\n<p>“Hail, traveler,” one says. “I am an L1. What are you?”</p>\n<p>“I am a T12.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, a young Thora, I see. Sturdy legs, Thoras. By the look of your feet you have made good progress, yes?”</p>\n<p>I smile weakly at him as I place my hands near the smoldering fire. “Yes, good progress.” I glance around at weary faces, dimly lit with orange and red. I wonder if my face shows the same sunbaked features as theirs, or if perhaps I still had the luster of youth that seems to fall away with every step up the giant. In the silence, I feel compelled to fill the air. “Do you wonder what stands at the top? Or think about why we climb?”</p>\n<p>“Because we must,” he says in a voice that tells me there will be no further elaboration, and that asking for such would be pointless. The others around the fire nod in agreement, repeating the phrase in a murmur.</p>\n<p>I drop the subject and look around at my surroundings, finding at the back of the cave a figure hunched in the darkness, the texture of her skin blending in with the rocks around her. If not for the faint movement of her breathing, I would have not noticed her.</p>\n<p>“Who is that?”</p>\n<p>He glances over briefly. “An old L5. She does not speak, and has been here since before any of this group entered the cave. This will be her final place, back to the stone of the giant.”</p>\n<p>I look to the others around the fire, but none react. “We should help her climb,” I offer to no one in particular.</p>\n<p>They chuckle amongst themselves. Another traveler with a stick points it at me. “Young Thora. You can be forgiven naivety now, but you must learn quickly if you are to make it to the top.” He lowers the stick and plunges it into the fire, embers crackling at the disturbance. “If you stop to help every traveler on the way, they will keep you from your potential. Some are not worth saving.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/08/05/podcastle-903-on-the-shoulders-of-giants/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

All your skin changed into islands of mottled gray or khaki, building up tire-rubber thick in patches, and turning numb where your body just up and decided to not work the same anymore. It was all part of what you were becoming, whether you liked it or not.</p>\n<p>There were days, fewer and farther between, where she could still see a glimpse her son Michael, the gorgeous boy you used to be: a spill of curls that fell down one side of your brow, a diffident slant to shoulders on a gangly frame, eyes the clear amber of long-steeped tea, that knowing grin. She’d see a ghost of that smile and be transported back through the ages of you, all the way to when you first announced yourself with a wriggle-kick to her womb. Then your grin would slide away as the pain did its thing and the beautiful boy submerged so your new self could rise, wrathful.</p>\n<p>Early on, you spent long hours in the bathtub but your remnant humanity wasn’t built for it. You’d end up with curdled finger pads and stripped of any remaining skin oils to protect you from drying out. You spent months in bed, a place you used to enjoy, and it became a prison. You memorized every crack in the ceiling, watched car headlights migrate across the chalk-white steppes of it. Eventually, you recovered enough to stand for more than a few seconds at a time.</p>\n<p>Well, “recovered” isn’t quite the right word. It was more that you decided to ignore the screams of your body because the alternative was never getting out of bed ever again.</p>\n<p>You mentioned the day you tottered and stooped along to the kitchen in your Mum’s tenement apartment and how you’d never forget her look of <i>who is this invading my home?</i> before she realized it was you, but taller, and more, well . . . lizardy, and she rushed over to fit herself into the places she knew were strong enough to be hugged. You towered over her.</p>\n<p>Even the hug told you that you were different now, and the likelihood of ever going back to who you used to be dwindled to nothing. So, instead, you tried to look forward.</p>\n<p>When the pandemic had faded from everyone’s collective conscience just enough, our job said we had to come into the central Glasgow office again. Working from home had been okay for you; you’d made it back from your long-term sick leave, even got in a few prescribed exercises over lunch breaks. It wasn’t always the best and you hated being on top of your mum all the time but at least you could keep your cool packs in the freezer without some asshat moving them to put in their frozen yogurt.</p>\n<p>None of the managers on the All-Hands call could give a real answer when you asked why going back to the office was mandatory if you got your job done from home? What the difference was if you were assigned tasks lying in bed or sitting in a conference room? Why you should pay out of your own pocket for a commute? How it was better for productivity if everyone caught the same bug going around an open-plan office?</p>\n<p>I totally agreed with you. I mean, I didn’t say anything, and my camera was off, but inside, I agreed. I also knew those arguments weren’t your real hesitation. So did everyone who saw your changes.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/07/29/podcastle-902-godzilla-as-a-young-man-named-mike/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Nothing was left of her kinspeople but blackened corpses littered across the village square. She searched around, with the moths in her gut a panicked swarm, stinging to be let out. Everyone else had been shot on the narrow cobblestone streets. On weak knees, with eyes burning from the lingering smoke, she turned towards the woods, her moths breathless with guilt and relief in equal parts. If Evdokia, the midwife, hadn’t sent her to the herbalist two towns over, she’d be dead too. At the edge of the village, Maria stumbled on Papa-Kostas, shot by the Virgin’s shrine, in a pool of blood.</p>\n<p>Maria sniffled and he raised his head, his eyes unfocused.</p>\n<p>“Maria? Is that you, girl?” Barely a whisper.</p>\n<p>Maria gawked, then nodded. He’d called her <i>just</i> Maria. <i>Not</i> Zavo-Maria. The slur that the villagers had attached to her name had stuck enough that its omission made Maria uncomfortable — as though it made her less <i>and</i> more at the same time.</p>\n<p>“Nazis,” Papa-Kostas managed. “Looking for resistance fighters. We didn’t tell.” A fit of cough. “Evdokia . . . dead too. See to Charon’s supper, girl. Don’t leave us here, stranded.” He raised his right hand, the tips of his first three fingers brought together, and air-crossed her, before his arm fell limp. “May gods old and new bless you, child. Forgive me.” And he spoke no more.</p>\n<p>The Ferryman’s supper. Maria’s moths fluttered all at once. She picked up her skirts and ran into the woods. Dawn hadn’t broken yet. Would she make it on time?</p>\n<p>She ran up the nearby hill and then downwards into the small ravine, to the banks of the creek. Not far from there, the ravine opened up to a deep canyon, its slopes a forest of pines and ancient oaks: the sisters of the Dodona Grove. The creek swelled and joined with more creeks to become Acheron, before the dark depths of the world siphoned its waters beneath the surface. Maria headed away from the Acheron, towards the little hut and the nearby cavern, where the villagers brought their herds every November to outwait the winter’s cold.</p>\n<p>It was safe inside the hut — few people could find it, most of them dead now. Dishes were stacked on a narrow table by the cold hearth, and sacks of grain and buckets for milking the goats at the other side. Maria sat on an old, creaking stool to catch her breath. Her panicked moths had fled her gut and plodded through her blood now, making her dizzy. She took deep breaths to rid her nostrils from the stench of burned flesh, inhaling the scents of curdled goat milk and pinewood. Then of other, unsettling scents, of murky waters and dead tadpoles, and just a whiff of honeysuckle . . .</p>\n<p>The Ferryman’s scent, and the scent of the death that followed his heels.</p>\n<p>Maria sprang to her feet. The supper! She really <i>was</i> zavo, sitting idle while Charon waited. If she angered him, would he forsake the souls of her kin? Would he release the dead upon these lands as punishment? She shook her head until the moths with wings of guilt scattered from her thoughts. No. She’d make sure no such thing would happen, now that Evdokia was gone. She filled a bowl with grain and a cup with wine and placed them on a tray. The moment she opened the door to carry the tray to the riverbank, the stench of stagnant waters and rotting leaves made the moths in her heart stand absolutely still. Just before dawn’s first light, the shade of flowing robes on a skeletal form boarded the rising fog over the creek — fog shaped as a boat. But he boarded alone. Alone? Without the souls of her people? Would <i>they</i> return to haunt <i>her</i>, for failing them? What had she done wrong?</p>\n<p>The coins! She’d forgotten about the coins!</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/07/22/podcastle-901-moths-in-a-fluttering-heart/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 900: Sour Fruit</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated PG-13</p>\n<h3>Sour Fruit</h3>\n<p/><p>The large open field was encircled by forest. Its sandy soil was home to scrubby flowers and grasses whose spindly roots reached deep into the loose ground, teeming with ants for whom the medium was perfect. Not quite in the middle was an old apple tree, twisting up from the ground, this way and that. Short and stubby. The fruit it produced was the sour, small sort that puckered the mouth with every bite. The sort that farmers had been trying to breed out of existence for countless generations. Yet, it lived. Thrived, even, in the clearing in the middle of the woods.</p>\n<p>Fish would run to it when the lake grew too loud. Snuggling herself inside its crooked roots, stretching her small hand upwards to poke into the hole that had rotted through the middle of the old tree, watching the sun as it came through her fingertips.</p>\n<p>The tree was the one place on the peninsula where the lake would soften.</p>\n<p>It was still there — the constant shush-shush of waves on rock was inescapable — but it faded into the background.</p>\n<p>It was a mild day in late September when Fish found the first gift. That’s how she thought of them. Gifts.</p>\n<p>Jorgi had been teasing her all through the school day, pelting her with bits of chalk until the lake rushed into her ears, drowning out Teacher’s lecture on Pythagoras. She ran as soon as the bell on Teacher’s desk was rung. Out across the browning prairie grass to the twisted pine trail, over the rocks and into the field.</p>\n<p>She cried to the tree, letting all her frustration and childish hatred out with each salty tear. Calmer, she reached up into the rotten hole and her fingers found paper.</p>\n<p>There was no real explanation for why a bag of flour sat in the rotted-out crook of the old tree, but Fish knew immediately that it had been left for her. She stood to pull the first gift close to her chest, crinkling the paper and sending small puffs of white out from the corners. It would get on her shirt, and Mama would be cross, but it didn’t matter. Finding the treasure had lifted the weight of the day and quieted the lake enough that she could go home.</p>\n<p>Once she got there, though, the flour became a problem. If she were to bring it inside, surely Mama would find it, take it from her, use it in her dry, crusty bread. The kind that hurt Fish’s mouth.</p>\n<p>She stood outside the kitchen door, listening to the sounds of bustle on its other side for a full five minutes before deciding. She was the last one in that evening, and there would be no reason for her parents to leave until the next morning. She would leave it outside on the porch, wake early, be the first one out the door in time to retrieve it in the morning, and find a safer, secret space to keep it, far from Mama’s kitchen.</p>\n<p>Papa barked when she came in. Where had she been, why had she not been helping Mama, she was a useless girl. Mama nodded along, as though she agreed. As though she wanted Fish underfoot in the afternoons. As though she wasn’t always shooing her away to run in the woods.</p>\n<p>Fish said nothing, looking chagrined and soulful so that Papa felt his words held weight. She choked down Mama’s cooking, did her small chores, and went to bed.</p>\n<p>She woke before the light. There was no clock to wake her, just the anticipation of being the first up. She crept down the stairs, flashlight clutched in hand, avoided the creaky floorboards, and slowly eased the kitchen door open. Just a crack. Just wide enough for her to squeeze through.</p>\n<p>Her heart caught.</p>\n<p>Even in the limited beam of her small light she could see the mess on the porch. The flour had been kicked over.</p>\n<p>The lake rushed in, drowning out everything around her. Drowning out the angry keen that burst unbidden out of her throat.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/07/15/podcastle-900-sour-fruit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

So when he asked me to be his girlfriend one month in, I wasn’t sure at first. But I was sure about him, and I liked how he’d phrased it (“I know you’re having fun, and I don’t want to put pressure on you”), with my freedom being a positive thing.</p>\n<p>My ex-boyfriend was jealous and controlling and wanted to keep me in a box. He felt threatened that I had exes and had had sex with others. He hated me staying out late and questioned why I put on nice underwear for work, suspecting that must mean I was sleeping with a colleague. So it was refreshing to be with someone who celebrated my sexuality.</p>\n<p>The safety I feel with Finn means the sex we have feels safe, too, and we can explore freely. We experiment with power dynamics, and I find the danger exciting, but it never feels like Finn is dominant in an uncaring way. He once said, “I don’t want to act too dominant in case you think I don’t love you,” which I thought was very romantic.</p>\n<p>I’ve heard that there are two ways of experiencing desire. Some people can just be doing the washing up and want to have sex – that’s Finn. The other is becoming turned on once you start being intimate – that’s me. So Finn is usually the one to initiate sex, but I always want it. He’s playful – he’ll put his hands down my pants when we’re out! He once fingered me in a car while driving down a winding road, and when cyclists overtook us, it was thrilling.</p>\n<p>We’ve both said past relationships were things that just happened to us, whereas we’ve chosen each other. It has surprised us both how open we are. When we were on holiday last year, we spent the whole time talking about how lucky we are.</p>\n<p>We’re about to move in together, and I can’t wait to do boring, domestic, adult things with him all the time. Yesterday, we went to the butcher and B&amp;Q, and even that was fun. When I’m with Finn, everything feels like an adventure.</p>\n<h2>Finn, 33</h2>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Our sex life has become more adventurous. We’ve had sex in the sea, in a field, in a photo booth</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>I wanted a break from dating apps and was about to delete them when I started speaking to Mabel. After our first date, we went back to hers and had great sex, but we had to be quiet because her flatmate was next door, so Mabel covered my mouth with her hand. Usually, she’s quite vocal, which turns me on.</p>\n<p>On our second date, I cooked for her at mine, which felt like a big gesture. I was seeing other people casually, but it felt different with Mabel; it was so easy. Even though I wanted to say, “Let’s see each other loads,” we played it cool.</p>\n<p>We have sex every time we see each other, about four times a week, which hasn’t decreased since we’ve been together. Our sex life has become more adventurous, and we’ve done things neither of us has done before. We’ve had sex in the sea, in a field, in a photo booth. I used to worry about someone seeing us, and Mabel would tease me about being cautious, but now I suggest it too.</p>\n<p>In previous relationships, even if the sex was good, I’d doubt how compatible we were. I’d seek novelty, and I still do, but Mabel offers me that. We’ve settled into more of a routine, but it still feels exciting. Maybe I’ve worked out what I want, or it could be our relationship is more interesting than my previous ones.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/24/this-is-how-we-do-it-doing-washing-up-want-sex-thats-my-boyfriend\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I don’t remember where I was when my <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tiktok\">TikTok</a> feed showed me a video of a woman holding her stillborn baby, but I remember how I felt. At first, it appeared like any other video of a woman holding a newborn. It was tightly wrapped in blankets while she cradled it in her arms. She was crying, but so are most of the women in these post-birth videos. It wasn’t until I read the caption that I realised what I was looking at. Her baby had been delivered at 23 weeks. I was 22 weeks pregnant. I felt doomed.</p>\n<p>My social media algorithms knew I was pregnant before family, friends or my GP. Within 24-hours, they were transforming my feeds. On Instagram and TikTok, I would scroll through videos of women recording themselves as they took pregnancy tests, just as I had done. I “liked”, “saved”, and “shared” the content, feeding the machine, showing it that this is how it could hold my attention, compelling it to send me more. So it did. But it wasn’t long before the joy of those early videos started to transform into something dark.</p>\n<p>The algorithm began to deliver content about the things you fear the most while pregnant: “storytimes” about miscarriages; people sharing what happened to them and, harrowingly, filming themselves as they received the news that their baby had no heartbeat. Next came videos about birth disfigurements, those found by medical professionals early on, and those that were missed until the baby’s birth.</p>\n<p>One night, after a before-bed scroll delivered me a video of a woman who filmed her near-death childbirth experience, I uninstalled the apps through tears. But they were soon reinstalled, when the needs of work, friendships and habit dictated they must be. I tried blocking the content I didn’t want to see, but it made little difference.</p>\n<p>On TikTok, there are more than 300,000 videos tagged under “miscarriage”, and a further 260,000 under “miscarriageawareness”. One video with the caption “live footage of me finding out I had miscarried” has almost half a million views. Another showing a woman giving birth to a stillborn baby has just under five million.</p>\n<p>In another context, before I was pregnant, I would have found the content barrier-breaking and important. I don’t think the individuals who share such vulnerable moments are doing anything wrong. For the right person, it could be a lifeline. But it didn’t feel right in the feed of someone who had inadvertently signalled to the algorithm that they were having a baby.</p>\n<p>When I talk about this experience with others who were pregnant at the same time as me, I am met with knowing nods and stories that match my own. I hear about how they were also served up personalised doses of fear, and how the algorithms evolved to target the things specific to them. Our experiences feel like a radicalisation, as normal worries were driven to new heights by a barrage of content that became more and more extreme. This is pregnancy and motherhood in 2025.</p>\n<p>“There are supportive posts, and then there are things so extreme and distressing, I don’t want to repeat them,” says Cherelle Mukoko, who is eight months pregnant. Mukoko mostly sees this content on Facebook and Instagram. She used to see it on TikTok as well, before she deleted the app. “My eldest is four. During that pregnancy, I came across upsetting posts on social media, some of them quite close to home, but this time it seems worse. The content feels more graphic and harder to escape.”</p>\n<p>Mukoko, 35, who is a woman of colour, has found that she is specifically shown content around the treatment of Black women in pregnancy. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/apr/08/black-women-in-england-suffer-more-serious-birth-complications-analysis-finds\">An analysis of NHS data in 2024</a> found that Black women are up to six times more likely to experience severe complications during a hospital delivery than their white counterparts. “That hasn’t been my reality, but it does make me go into every appointment more cautious and on edge, wondering how I’ll be treated,” she says.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/03/i-felt-doomed-social-media-guessed-i-was-pregnant-my-feed-soon-grew-horrifying\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Tina Woods was sitting in a taxi when the dancing bug bit. It was after midnight and she and two friends were heading home from another friend’s 60th birthday party. South-west London rolled past the window. They had had a bit to drink. As they passed Le Fez nightclub, they realised they didn’t want to go home. “We were like: let’s go dancing before we go to bed,” she says.</p>\n<p>Woods, then 56, had gone clubbing in her 20s, but on Le Fez’s dancefloor, as her body caught the beat, she had “an epiphany moment”, a shock of pure euphoria: “The joy I felt – the mind, body and soul connection – was like a lightning bolt.” She knew then that “dancing and music were going to be a bigger part of my life than I’d ever thought”.</p>\n<p>Woods, who lives in London but grew up in Montreal, Canada, has always been active. She loves travelling, mountain climbing and Zumba. But now she has started clubbing – with friends or with Nick, her husband of nearly 30<strong> </strong>years.</p>\n<p>“I started to get into the softer end of techno – melodic techno, tech house,” she says. “I loved the beat, the bass line – Afrobeats and a Latin vibe. I realised that my brain was responding to that music in a way that was incredibly energising. It made me feel alive.”</p>\n<p>Woods had studied genetics at Cornell university in Ithaca, New York. Her first job, after moving to London in her early 20s, was as a medical writer for a company that made training films for doctors. She worked in healthcare until she was 53 and is now a consultant specialising in health technology in relation to longevity; she has published a book on how to live longer with AI.</p>\n<p>In the joy she felt on the dancefloor, she began to see a connection to her work. “I’m trying to bring scientific rigour and understanding into this environment of dance and the neurochemistry of music to understand what promotes health and wellbeing – and, linked to that, what could delay the ageing process,” she says.</p>\n<p>Since she was 56, she has tested her biological age and says she is getting younger. At 60, one test put her at 35. Dancing has brought new, intergenerational friendships, such as with Yukari, an aspiring DJ Woods met on the dancefloor while in Japan at a conference.</p>\n<p>However, when she was 59, pain from bunions in her feet reached unbearable levels. The problem was so severe that some of Woods’s toes became dislocated. She decided to undergo surgery. “I was thinking: what’s important in my life? For me, that’s being mobile and energetic.” She knew the surgery would necessitate four to six months of recovery.</p>\n<p>“How am I going to cope?” thought Woods, who has trouble relaxing. “But there’s always a positive side, if you look for it. I thought: I’ll learn to mix music.” Woods underwent surgery in December 2023, a week before Christmas – for which her three sons gave her a present of DJ equipment. The learning process was under way.</p>\n<p>One night, having recovered her mobility, she and her husband were on their way to a gig in east London when they stopped for a drink at the venue Love Shack. “We kept seeing people coming and going … They showed us this secret room under the railway arches and there’s this huge pulsating party.”</p>\n<p>Woods had found the venue for her DJing debut. She discussed it with Yukari. “We were like: ‘Let’s do a gig,’” Woods says. “ Before we knew it, more than 200 people had signed up.”</p>\n<p>They called their event <a href=\"https://www.longevityrave.world/\">Longevity Rave</a>. Woods now DJs once a month; she has DJed in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami and London. The dancefloor is always a mix of ages. “I’m finding myself again, in a funny sort of way. Psychologically, emotionally, sexually. Everything about who I am as a woman,” she says.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/01/i-had-to-stop-raving-after-bunion-surgery-so-i-became-a-dj-instead\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It improves the muscle adaptation response to the exercise, which leads to growth in size, strength and lactate tolerance.</p>\n    <p>That said, Crouse adds, if you’re just a casual gym-goer (doing resistance training three or four times a week), it’s better to focus on consuming three balanced meals in the day, and choosing healthy snacks, before you start stressing too much about when you consume things. “Go back to the basics of carbs, protein and veggies on your breakfast, lunch and dinner plates first,” she says.</p>\n    <p>And if you do like to have a snack after working out, it doesn’t need to be a protein shake. “A large glass of milk has really high protein content, as do those chicken satay skewers that you often get in a meal deal,” says Crouse. “Having something like a chocolate milkshake, which contains both carbs and protein, is good. Co-ingestion of carbohydrates and protein leads to greater net muscle protein synthesis.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/01/is-it-true-that-you-should-eat-protein-after-workouts-to-see-muscle-gains\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>I was 18 when I tried a menstrual cup for the first time. I was studying at the University of Edinburgh and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/nov/24/scotland-becomes-first-nation-to-provide-free-period-products-for-all\">Scotland had just become the first country in the world to make period products free</a> to those who need them. The university health service was offering menstrual cups alongside the usual sanitary pads and tampons. I picked one up out of curiosity and because I just couldn’t resist a freebie.</p>\n    <p>I was used to spending £10 to £15 a month on period products, more if I was caught short and had to do a panicked dash to an overpriced off-licence. As an eco-conscious teenager I already bought non-applicator tampons but often wore a security sanitary liner underneath. It was an attempt to keep the endless worry of heavy periods at bay: will I leak, run out of supplies, or find a clean loo in time? Even so, I leaked more often than I cared to admit.</p>\n    <p>When I first heard about menstrual cups, I was sceptical. They sounded fiddly, messy and invasive; after trying one, I realised it wasn’t nearly as complicated as I imagined. It took a couple of attempts to work out how to insert it properly but, once I did, there was no going back.</p>\n    <p>Nearly five years later, my cup goes everywhere with me. These days I use a collapsible version, which can be folded down into a case the size of a tealight. It slips easily into my bag –simple and discreet. After my period ends, I use a cleaning pot to sterilise it. I fill the pot with water, place the cup inside and pop it into the microwave. A few minutes later, it’s clean and ready for the next cycle. Practical, if not particularly glamorous.</p>\n    <p>The benefits are huge. I save at least £120 a year, avoid the dryness and bulk of tampons or sanitary pads, and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/28/toxic-pesticide-levels-found-in-tampons-40-times-higher-than-legal-limit-for-water\"> steer clear of the toxic chemicals that are common in many tampons</a>. Menstrual cups are made from medical-grade silicone, last for years and feel far gentler on my body. My cramps have also reduced since using a cup.</p>\n    <p>I am glad to avoid the extraordinary amount of plastic, packaging and waste that comes with using disposable products, too. Using a menstrual cup has become an effortless, sustainable choice I can make every month.</p>\n    <p>They are also convenient. I empty my cup every morning and evening at home, and that is it. No more stuffing supplies into every bag I own. It has never leaked, even on heavy days, and travelling is much easier. On a recent surfing trip to Morocco, where tampons were hard to find, the cup was a lifesaver.</p>\n    <p>The only thing I miss is being able to help someone in a pinch. More than once, someone in a public bathroom has asked if I have a spare tampon, and I have had to say no. But switching to a menstrual cup has turned my once stressful period into something so simple that I hardly notice it, and I haven’t looked back since.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/01/the-one-change-that-worked-i-got-a-period-cup-and-saved-120-a-year\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He glanced at Gyn, and wondered where she was in her head, because she certainly wasn’t here, with him, getting married.</p>\n<p>I knew none of this, watching my best friend take the leap. Huge. Maybe the hugest leap of any guy’s life. When we became friends, working at The Schuss, he didn’t know Gyn. We were just guys, with a shared love of adrenalin. They hired me to rent the e-bikes. He handled kayaks in the summer, skis in the winter. In our spare time, we liked to test our product outside. Not bad, getting paid to play with the latest toys.</p>\n<p>TJ met Gyn at my wedding. Elise and I had hired Gyn to tend bar. The deejays were amping up the tempo for the guests already drunk enough to hit the dance floor when TJ approached the bar.</p>\n<p>Gyn was standing behind the bar, tucked into the hillside beneath a canopy of Doug fir branches.</p>\n<p>“Bushmills,” TJ said.</p>\n<p>The bartender looked like a character in one of those Japanese hentai comics, the T&amp;A wing of manga. Long, straight black hair. Wide eyes. Creamy skin. A stiff smile. Ample spillage from the lip of her bodice. She looked like someone surprised to find herself in the camera’s flash.</p>\n<p>“Neat?” Gyn asked.</p>\n<p>“Rocks, please.”</p>\n<p>“Neat,” Gyn said, when she handed him his glass.</p>\n<p>“You’re not very good at this, are you?” TJ said. “First time?”</p>\n<p>“Friend of Elise,” she said. “What do you mean, not very good?”</p>\n<p>“You asked if I wanted it <i>neat</i>. I said <i>rocks</i>. You gave me <i>neat</i>. You weren’t paying attention.”</p>\n<p>She looked like she was going to cry.</p>\n<p>“Look,” he said, “maybe you should be a … model. Or something. Not everybody’s cut out to pour booze.”</p>\n<p>“Model for what?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know. Van Gogh?”</p>\n<p>She looked confused. TJ laughed. He took his drink and turned away from the bar and walked two paces and turned around and stared back. She wasn’t very bright, but she was staring at him. He went back and gave her his card. She looked at it, then at him, unsure. “I don’t ski,” she said.</p>\n<p>“We could go <i>out</i>?” he said, by way of explanation. “If you call me? We could talk … <i>about </i>skis?”</p>\n<p>After that exchange, TJ didn’t think about her. He didn’t recognize the number when she called. Their courtship had some holes in it.</p>\n<p>On their first date, they got sushi. She had never had it before. When he told her it was raw fish wrapped in seaweed, her pale skin took on a green hue. She ate the rice. Slowly.</p>\n<p>She mentioned that her mother worked for many years as a palm tree at a Galveston tiki bar, walking around with fronds on her head, smiling at people and their umbrella drinks.</p>\n<p>“Really?” TJ said. “That’s … fun.”</p>\n<p>She looked at him, smiled, then looked away as if at only something she could see.</p>\n<p>He mentioned that his own mother died in childbirth, and his dad ran an auto repair shop in Scotts Bluff. She looked confused.</p>\n<p>“Nebraska?”</p>\n<p>“Oh,” she said. “Sure.”</p>\n<p>He wasn’t sure she knew what Nebraska was, so didn’t pursue it. Instead he told her his dad liked to think he liked to fly fish, although he rarely went. He just went to Cabella’s and bought the gear. TJ liked mountains, and moved to Summit County after high school.</p>\n<p>“Easier to catch,” he said.</p>\n<p>She didn’t get it.</p>\n<p>“Mountains? Easier to catch,” he said, dissecting his wit like he was gutting a trout. “Easier than fish? With a dry fly?”</p>\n<p>For Gyn, it would’ve been a good opportunity to mention that her father wanted to be a stand-up comedian. He was wanting it in a tiki bar when he met her mother and ordered more mai tais than any comedian should consume while attempting to be humorous. Her mother married him anyway, perhaps attributing his excess to nerves.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://theshortstory.co.uk/short-story-broke-broken-broker-by-stuart-watson/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Underneath the overcast sky, twilight stretches through the sloping city. Wealth lives here, in sterile houses carefully hidden behind designer bushes and fences. Not even petrichor feels natural this far across the megapolis. No stench permeates the air, no visible evidence of human misery, although Vemund knows from experience these walls hide just as many vile actions as the paperthin constructs at the other end of civilization.</p>\n<p>The evening is chill enough that Vemund sees his breaths as he exhales. It fits this appointment, in a way; all day he’s been followed by a lingering impression that he’s about to trade his soul away. For almost twenty years, he’s worked as a confessionist. The only job he could ever take, young and untrained, but already buried under unbearable debt. Society needs you, they told him at recruitment. <i>You’d be doing the world a favor</i>. Vemund snorts quietly to himself. The only favor he’s been doing has been to ease abject consciences. Except for the children; sometimes he confesses children and their pain is almost always inflicted by others. They were all worth it, though rare enough to forget how it feels to actually help someone instead of simply dampening the guilt bred by one’s actions, consequences intended or not.</p>\n<p/><p>The house up ahead sits in heavy gray, made of dull steel and concrete and glass, as ashen as the rest of the buildings around it. Cutting through the front garden, the path to his latest client winds in a bend of stone slabs. This one had specifically requested him, even offered a hefty payment for the service.</p>\n<p>His grip tightens. The squeak of his briefcase handle gets lost in the whoosh of the hightrain flying up above.</p>\n<p>The entire trip here, he’s been wondering how much of an abomination he’d have to take on for the offered honorarium. He hasn’t wavered, though. Can’t. Not when it means he can forgo the fifty or so confessions he’d need to finally settle his score.</p>\n<p>He’d be free. He <i>will</i> be free, after this.</p>\n<p>But will he be able to carry it? Whatever the monster in this house did, Vemund will have to watch it, assimilate its effects, and live with them forever. With a trembling hand, he touches the back of his shaved head, over the place where the neural implant sits.</p>\n<p>“Last one,” he whispers, and steps forward.</p>\n<p>A smiling man answers the door at the first ring. Medium build, a little shorter than Vemund, clean shaven. Wearing a dark sweater, the same gray of the concrete and the sky and the house he occupies.</p>\n<p>“Hi, I’m Obe. Please, come in.”</p>\n<p>Obe keeps smiling and Vemund shudders. He’s never been afraid before.</p>\n<p>After removing his shoes and coat, Vemund follows further inside. When instructed, he sits at the dining table. Its glass surface shines pristine, just like everything else in this place. The space is wide and open, any separation made from transparent material. No color, no personal touch whatsoever.</p>\n<p>Even the tray with tea that Obe sets on the table permeates sameness. While he pours and serves, Vemund retrieves his tools from the briefcase. He sets them down on a paper pad between them after Obe takes the opposite seat. He’s dropped his façade of hospitality, instead studying the items with an intensity Vemund’s rarely seen before.</p>\n<p>“The pulsers” —Vemund begins the requisite explanation, opening the small box to reveal the round neuro-actuators— “go onto your temples. They—”</p>\n<p>“I’ve done this before. They modify the neural connections forming the memory that I write down.” Obe picks up the pen, twists it around. “With this thing: coated in enough sensors to read my entire mind.”</p>\n<p>Vemund swallows, loud enough in the silence that Obe notices. He leans over the table slightly.</p>\n<p>“Your implant will absorb my experience as if it were your own, and what remains will be distant for me. Like a scar over a healed wound.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2023/11/16/escape-pod-915-the-confessionist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 914: #buttonsinweirdplaces (Part 2 of 2)</h2>\n<h3>#buttonsinweirdplaces (Part 2 of 2)</h3>\n<p>(… Continued from Part 1)</p>\n<p>The news the following morning was bad. An explosion in the middle of a market-square in Libya had been variously blamed upon a suicide-bomber and upon over-zealous security forces trying to control crowd trouble. The truth of it made little difference to the eighty who’d died, the hundreds left broken in the aftermath. Tensions had flared on the Mexican/American border after a young man fell to his death attempting to climb the wall to reach the USA. In Ireland, the names of old republican and nationalist groupings had been resurrected, wielded anew by figures wearing balaclavas and holding assault rifles.</p>\n<p>Cho switched off the car radio. Sometimes it seemed the world was intent on tearing itself to pieces, and she needed to focus on the plan.</p>\n<p>She’d travelled north to the Ma On Shan Country Park. Her predictions suggested there would be a button near the top of one of the remoter peaks. If it was there, it not only helped confirm her theory, it also meant she could experiment without any interruptions – something impossible part-way up a skyscraper.</p>\n<p>It took her two hours to hike to the location. The GPS on her phone identified the spot rapidly enough, twenty metres down a steep, scrubby slope. The terrain had looked rough on the maps, and she’d brought ropes to rappel to it. After a couple of minutes of scraping through the brush and grass clinging to the side of the hill she found it, right where it was supposed to be.</p>\n<p>Crucially, she also had phone signal. She’d worried there might be none so far from the city. She posted a message in the chat group she’d set up to say she was ready. Three of the academics that Dr Suresh had found from his contacts around the world were already there, standing by their buttons: one in Toronto, one near Lima, the third a few miles outside Edinburgh. It was the middle of the night in the Americas, but from their jokey messages, they all appeared to be in a good mood. Once Suresh had explained what they were attempting, they’d been happy to help. <i>A lot of people are looking for answers, right now</i>, he’d explained.</p>\n<p>The fifth member of their team – Dr Mbenzi, a Linguistics Professor in Nairobi – came on line in an explosion of emojis and exclamation marks, and they were ready. Cho had thrown together a rough-and-ready app to tell them when to press and when to release their buttons, its simple display consisting of a light that flashed green for <i>now</i>. The app synched to an internet clock so there was no problem with communications lag, and it also captured the tones produced by the buttons. She’d specified a careful sequence of presses, repeated five times so she could spot patterns and filter out random effects from people clicking elsewhere in the world.</p>\n<p>The buttons were still attracting a lot of attention. Social media occasionally trended with a #pressthebuttons hashtag, encouraging everyone to press as frequently as possible in the belief that numbers were somehow being tallied up. Countervailing tags trended in response – #donotpressthebuttons – from those who believed the whole thing was sinister, a conspiracy, some unspecified evil. Some saw pressing the buttons – or not pressing them – as a religious duty, an act of devotion. Others, for reasons she didn’t get, wanted to destroy them. The switches were tough, but acid or hot-enough flame, it turned out, ruined them well enough.</p>\n<p>The countdown on the app reached zero, the light turned green, and Cho and her helpers began to press their buttons.</p>\n<p/><p>The following morning, she sat upon a bench outside the university, waiting for Dr Suresh to pass by. She breathed in the early-morning warmth of the summer’s day, enjoying the peace of it. The rising sun made the air glow, dissipating some of the weariness that filled her. The bitter coffee she’d bought was helping a little, too. She normally preferred tea but right then needed something stronger.</p>\n<p>“Cho, what are you doing here?”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2023/11/09/escape-pod-914-buttonsinweirdplaces-part-2-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 913: #buttonsinweirdplaces (Part 1 of 2)</h2>\n<h3>#buttonsinweirdplaces (Part 1 of 2)</h3>\n<p>The buttons started to appear on the last day of April, 2022.</p>\n<p>A six-year-old boy from Nairobi, Jomi Mbenzi, was perhaps the first to spot one. Dawdling along behind his mother, her swaying yellow-orange dress and the bag of melons and paw-paws she carried, his attention was caught by the shiny button set in the stone of one of the city’s office buildings. He squatted to study it. Strange that it was so low-down, right near the ground. In his experience, switches – and all other interesting aspects of the adult world – were kept high-up, out of reach, but here was this button set right where he could get at it. He was sure it hadn’t been there an hour ago when they walked down the same road toward the fruit market. Ground-level was his domain and he noticed everything there, while the confusing, noisy grown-up world went on around him and above him.</p>\n<p>There was no writing on or near the button, nothing to suggest what its purpose might be. Buttons often had words on them to say what they did, words he rarely understood. Or else, they had warnings nearby telling you not, under any circumstances, to press – a fact which always struck him as odd. Why have a button you couldn’t press?</p>\n<p>A bus roared past on the road, washing a blast of hot, smoky air over Jomi. He paid it no attention. Instead, he did what any child in that situation would do. He reached out with his soft finger and touched the button. The metal ring around it was hot from the rays of the sun, but the button itself – black, smooth and invitingly recessed – was surprisingly cool.</p>\n<p>It clicked very faintly when he pressed it, and there was a brief musical note from somewhere, but nothing else happened. No alarms sounded, and no lights flashed. The button sprang back out when he released it, as if he hadn’t pressed it at all. He tried again, and then a third time. Each time, the same tone played.</p>\n<p>“Jomi! What are you doing back there? I told you to stay near me.” His mother called from up the street, her bags on the floor and her hands on her hips as she studied him disapprovingly. “What have you found now? Whatever it is, leave it alone and come away at once.”</p>\n<p>“It’s nothing,” he called. “A button.”</p>\n<p>“A button?” His mother sounded worried, as if buttons and the pressing of them were always bad things. “Don’t you go touching it, now. Come away, it’s time we were home.”</p>\n<p>Jomi stood. The button wasn’t so interesting after all. It didn’t do anything. He turned to run to catch up with his mother.</p>\n<p/><p>The first social media posting about the buttons came twelve minutes later from Cho Li Han, a postgrad student supplementing her income by cleaning the skyscrapers of Hong Kong. Dangling by ropes three hundred metres in the air, she came across one on the glass exterior of the headquarters of the Cathay Pearl Bank.</p>\n<p>She paused to consider it, tilting her head as she tried to make sense of its existence. The exterior of the building was a flawless wall of glass, and their supervisor, the perpetually angry Mrs Fong, had given them clear instructions to remove any stain. <i>An unblemished façade is very important to the bank’s public image.</i> Someone must have put the button there for a reason, but it made little sense. None of the windows opened so high up, meaning only a person climbing on the outside could press the button. But it couldn’t <i>do</i> anything, unless wires had been run through the glass, and why would anyone do that?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2023/11/02/escape-pod-913-buttonsinweirdplaces-part-1-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Doing so can close your mind to alternative plans if you <i>think</i> you see what you’re destined to do.</p>\n<p>It was a hard rule for me to follow, especially when my client was half an hour late. It left me ample time to explore the storage facility, but apart from noting a security camera at the entrance, there wasn’t much to see: five lanes of asphalt with plowed snow mounds melting in the corners. Along both sides were rows of bright green roll-up doors matching the color of the City-Store logo. Many were still embedded behind packed snow.</p>\n<p>The key card vending machine near the front had a listing of which storage pods were free. The crime-scene pod was unavailable, but I was more interested in the pods surrounding it. They were already owned. By who? By me? It was best that I couldn’t tell. This was where the don’t-look-for-evidence rule came into play.</p>\n<p/><p>A single Drifter car pulled into the row and parked in front of the crime-scene pod. Her headlights glared on the green door like stage lights. I was surprised to see only the driver; I’d have thought she’d have a security detail in light of recent events.</p>\n<p>She rolled down her car window. “Mr. Roper?”</p>\n<p>“Mrs. Lynch?”</p>\n<p>She climbed out.</p>\n<p>Jeans.</p>\n<p>Every photo I’d seen of her showed her in pant suits, but those photos were always alongside congressmen or admirals. It made sense that she would dress down when doing something illegal. Her lined frown was the same as it was before her husband’s death—probably fixed from her decades in national security.</p>\n<p>“It’s a pleasure, ma’am,” I said.</p>\n<p>“I’m sure.” She handed me a manila folder. It was thick. The woman certainly wasn’t a corner-cutter. “It’s this pod here. I own it now, but you can use it for whatever you need.”</p>\n<p>The key was a microchipped card on a retractable lanyard. The wall sensor beeped when she swiped it, and the door came up. Nothing was inside except for a clean cement floor, fresh white walls, and the lingering smell of paint and cleaning chemicals.</p>\n<p>“They already cleaned up?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“I had a team come through as soon as the police released the scene. I didn’t want any reporters seeing it. I trust that won’t be a problem.”</p>\n<p>“Shouldn’t be. Do you still have the key the kidnappers used?”</p>\n<p>She handed me a second microchipped card from her jean pocket, identical to the first. “The police said it’s deactivated.”<br/>\n“That won’t matter. What about the timeline?”</p>\n<p>She nodded toward the folder. “The top file is the one you asked for. The kidnapping lasted about ten hours. They pulled him from his car in the morning, tied him up here, and left him. Then they came back four hours later to take his finger. I expect you to rescue him <i>before</i> that point. I want my husband back whole.”</p>\n<p>“Why did they wait four hours for that?” I asked. “Don’t they normally do that first to prove that they have the hostage?”</p>\n<p>“They were trying to shock me. The first time they called, I told them to either kill him or let him go.”</p>\n<p>“You really said that?”</p>\n<p>“I am not going to betray my country over my personal life, Mr. Roper. Thugs can threaten me all they want, but I can always get another husband. I’ve had four now.”</p>\n<p>“What would you have done if they’d taken your child?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t have a child. You should know that by now.”</p>\n<p>“I do, but if you had?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t. It is an irrelevant question.”</p>\n<p>“Then if you don’t mind me asking, if you care so little, why <i>don’t</i> you just get another husband? You divorce them readily enough. What you’re hiring me to do could put you in far greater trouble than a few leaked state secrets.”</p>\n<p>She shrugged. “I’m fond of this one. I want him back.

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 907: Maintenance Phase</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated PG</p>\n<h3>Maintenance Phase</h3>\n<p>Mary woke in an unfamiliar bed, gasping for breath.</p>\n<p>She recalled the shots, the dancing, the giggling stumble into a stranger’s apartment while they pulled off each other’s dresses. Her internal organs felt cramped up together, as though they were rats fighting for scarce space in the sewers. Her plan <i>was</i> to sneak home later in the night and return to her own form, but instead she’d slept shifted. She groaned and smacked her hand over her eyes.</p>\n<p>“She wakes!” someone yelled from outside the open bedroom door. Her bedmate from last night walked in, red hair in a messy bun and spatula held aloft. “Want pancakes?”</p>\n<p>How long had it been since she had pancakes? Real pancakes, not the almond meal monstrosities her mother made.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, I’d love some,” she croaked. “Just let me, umm, freshen up.”</p>\n<p>“Sure thing, buttercup,” said the other woman, and left humming in the direction of the kitchen.</p>\n<p>Mary grabbed her discarded dress off the floor, slipped into the bathroom, and made sure to lock it behind her. Then she let go of the self-image she’d been clinging to all night.</p>\n<p>She felt a surge of relief as she relinquished the crushing grip her mind held over her body. She looked in the mirror. Gone were the smooth curves of last night, the defined chin, and the dip of shadow at her collar bones. Instead of flowing, her curves rolled, overcame her. She felt skin press against skin where her neck met her chin, and felt the urge to pull her hair forward to cover newly-rounded cheeks.</p>\n<p>The form in the mirror wouldn’t fit into her little red dress. It didn’t fit into any of the clothes she owned.</p>\n<p>She took her first deep breath of the morning — her only deep breath until she made it home — and then set about chiselling her facade back in place.</p>\n<p>Out in the kitchen, sunlight streamed onto a bench covered in flour while the woman mixed something in a large bowl. What was her name again? Kate? She looked up at Mary’s entrance and smiled.</p>\n<p>“Pancakes are warming in the oven. Help yourself. Toppings on the table.”</p>\n<p>Mary grabbed a fork and plate from the table, then pulled open the oven. Inside was a stack at least six high. She pulled two onto her plate. At the table, she drizzled maple syrup sparingly, added a spoonful of strawberries and bananas, and ignored the chocolate spread and cream.</p>\n<p>Kate washed the flour off her hands and came to sit with her at the table, hands curled around a coffee mug. “They were all for you, don’t worry. I already had mine.”</p>\n<p>“It’s okay, I’m not that hungry,” she lied. She was starving, but trying to cram down anything else right now would make her sick.</p>\n<p>Her doctor was worried about vitamin deficiencies and kept telling her to add things to her diet: more greens, red meat, fruit. But she couldn’t figure out how to fit it all in without making herself vomit or making herself bigger.</p>\n<p>She made it through half the serve she dished out for herself before setting her knife and fork down lengthways on the plate — the way she’d been taught to politely indicate that she was done, even though food remained.</p>\n<p>“Um, thank you for that. And last night. But I should . . .”</p>\n<p>“Of course!” said Kate. “Here, let me show you out.”</p>\n<p>Once Mary was out in the hallway, Kate leaned against the frame.</p>\n<p>“I’d like to see you again sometime, if that sounds good to you,” she asked.</p>\n<p>Her smile was bright and cheery, and she had a smudge of chocolate batter on her cheek. But Kate couldn’t see her <i>again</i> because she hadn’t seen her — not really — in their entire evening together. Mary had no desire to repeat that experience, but she also didn’t want this moment to become any more awkward.</p>\n<p>“Um, yeah. Sure. What’s your number?”</p>\n<p>Mary dutifully entered it into her contacts, even though she doubted they’d ever cross paths again.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/09/02/12916/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Through its rock-candy windows, the house scans her figure for any signs of hurt. The witch’s errands in the city make her nervous. And the house, being made of her magic and therefore of the witch, worries along with her that the wrong person might recognize her, or simply <i>think </i>they do. “They say Creoles all look alike,” she’s said, bitter.</p>\n<p>It astounds the house, that the witch could be mistaken for any other but herself. That someone could fail to identify her tightly coiling black hair, her agate eyes, her russet skin as the witch’s, and the witch’s alone.</p>\n<p>Her hair remains neatly tucked under her wrap. In a basket, balanced against her hip, she carries a basket full of linen bags. Flour and sugar. Though her steps are weary, she’s not limping. A successful outing, then.</p>\n<p>Pleased she’s safe, the house opens its front door and rolls out a rug of pie pastry.</p>\n<p>“Thank you, House,” the witch says, and walks in, letting the house close its door behind her.</p>\n<p>Despite the muggy heat that makes the house’s pecan praline shingles stick together, the witch doesn’t roll up her sleeves till she’s set her basket on the single molasses-cake table. With a groan, she lifts her skirt to perch on a stool made of brioche. She pulls off her boots, wriggles her toes in their stockings, and frowns.</p>\n<p>The house flares its brazier in question.</p>\n<p>“Ran into someone I knew once, while I was in the city. Got a decision to make, now.” She grimaces. “I keep thinking we oughta leave New Orleans.” She doesn’t go into why, but from the witch’s dreams, the house already knows. She presses a hand flat to the brioche wall. “Hide for now, yes?”</p>\n<p>It does. It’s made of sugar and magic, after all; and like sugar in a glass of water, it appears to dissolve into nothing, but it’s still there, just too fine to see.</p>\n<p>When the house wakes next, the witch is on its roof, prizing off a pecan praline shingle. Once it’s loose, rum jelly oozes, filling in the naked spot. Though another praline will grow back by morning, the house rattles its tartelette shutters and puffs a clot of meringue from the chimney.</p>\n<p>“Hush, now. I’ve decided.” The witch gives it a pat and plucks a few more pralines. “We’re gonna have some company.”</p>\n<p>Displeased, the house blows out more meringue.</p>\n<p>“Never you mind.”</p>\n<p>The witch scurries down the brioche siding, then strides toward the swamp, where towering cypress trees grow, where sometimes the witch has to hiss the secret words to send away an alligator or cottonmouth. The only words she whispers now are those directing the river where to take the pralines and what they should say when they arrive.</p>\n<p>The house watches anxiously as the witch returns. It knows she can take care of herself — she wouldn’t have been able to create it if she couldn’t — but she also created it to keep her safe.</p>\n<p>And now, she’s inviting strangers to come.</p>\n<p>It could rattle its praline shingles and let some fall on her head, but considering what she’s just taken, the house thinks that’d rather miss the point.</p>\n<p>As she goes inside, the witch pulls calas from the doorframe. Petulant, the house tries to hold it fast, but more rum jelly strings out as it comes free.</p>\n<p>Alternating nibbles and hums, the witch stokes the fire for the oven. “Gonna need something special for our guests. Molasses cake, maybe?”</p>\n<p>Beignets fall from the ceiling.</p>\n<p>“Stop, House,” the witch says, sharp. “I know you’d like to keep me all to yourself, but I’m needed.” Yet her lips pucker, like she’s tasted spoiled jelly.</p>\n<p>It’s a bad night for the witch.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/08/26/podcastle-906-double-episode-the-house-the-witch-and-sugarcane-stalks-and-to-pluck-a-twisted-string/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

At a wedding, you never know if you’re going to get punched by someone’s uncle or go skinny dipping with the couple.” He pauses. “And that’s what I like: putting myself in weird, awkward situations.”</p>\n<p>These include passing out inside a large but poorly ventilated wedding cake. “It was a small wedding and a lot of stuff was DIY. It wasn’t fun to realise they had forgotten the air holes.” Or a man nearly dying on the dancefloor. “Yeah, that happened, too. But he made it.”</p>\n<p>You may know Lekman as the Swedish indie star whose forlorn love songs can simultaneously break your heart and make you laugh. You may not know that, ever since his 2004 song If You Ever Need a Stranger (To Sing at Your Wedding), he’s been taking requests to do just that. In the beginning, “it was just random people who had heard the song,” he says. But, after an Australian couple shared a video of him playing their wedding in 2013, he was suddenly inundated with requests: “I owe them a lot of gratitude.”</p>\n<p>In retrospect, he’s always been made for the job. Since the early 00s, Jekman has made records defined by wry yet kind-hearted observations about romance and heartbreak. He named his 2012 album I Know What Love Isn’t and, on To Know Your Mission, from 2017, Lekman tells us he just wants to listen to people’s stories. He says the weddings have only underscored this purpose: “I want to be of service to the people who the music means something to.”</p>\n<p>With streaming making it ever harder to make a living from music, playing weddings also became a way to get by financially, as well as providing inspiration for his own songwriting. Lekman recounts a story about the director, John Waters, getting picked up while hitchhiking through the Nevada desert. “What the hell are you doing out here?” the driver asked. Waters replied that it helped provide inspiration. “That’s what the weddings are for me,” Lekman says with a smile.</p>\n<p>His new album is called Songs for Other People’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/weddings\">Weddings</a>, and comes with a novel of the same name written with David Levithan, author of books including Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist. They’ve been friends for 20 years; just before the pandemic, Lekman reached out with an idea for something about “my parallel career as a wedding singer”, having wondered whether it could be a TV show or musical.</p>\n<p>Levithan was all in. “The situation was so tantalising,” he says on the same call. “The idea of writing about these weddings from the point of view of the wedding singer was something I would never have thought of in a million years.”</p>\n<p>The result is a “novel-with-songs” formed from what Lekman calls “a dialogue between me and David about love and relationships”. It tells the story of the romance between a wedding singer called J and his girlfriend V, through 10 weddings at which he performs. Lekman’s accompanying album imagines what happens in between the book’s chapters: he was inspired by albums with stories running through them, such as the Streets’ A Grand Don’t Come For Free and Frank Sinatra’s Watertown.</p>\n<p>The result is “purely fictional but, at the same time, emotionally very much both of ours”, as Levithan puts it. Given that it’s the story of a Swedish singer who plays weddings, it blurs art and life: “I love the confusion – and I don’t think there’s really any way around it,” Lekman says, though they decided to change the main character’s name to J: “In the first chapter I wrote, he was named Jens and that was <i>too</i> confusing,” says Levithan.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/sep/05/youre-either-getting-punched-or-going-skinny-dipping-swedish-indie-star-jens-lekman-on-playing-132-weddings-of-his-fans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Taylor Swift wrote today’s headlines when she was only 17 with her country hit Love Story: “Baby, just say yes!” Now, at 35, she has announced her engagement to Travis Kelce, her American football player partner of two years, who got down on one knee and popped the question. “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married,” she captioned the subsequently staged engagement photos of them in a rose garden. It’s gaudy, it’s cringe, it’s gleefully too much – some even say it makes the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/27/jeff-in-venice-seven-takeaways-from-the-bezos-sanchez-wedding\">Bezos wedding</a> look classy. But it’s perfect and it made me cry.</p>\n<p>When the pop star who has soundtracked your entire adult love life gets engaged, it’s discombobulating. Especially when they are similar in age. Over two decades, Swift has gifted a song for every crush, relationship, situationship, and heartbreak. (I even once plagiarised All Too Well lyrics in a very embarrassing email to an ex-boyfriend; he never did reply to my calling him “so casually cruel in the name of being honest”.)</p>\n<p>But marriage is new territory. Similarly to when a mate tells me they’re getting married, my delight over the news has been chased by bittersweet pangs of change and reflection: what role does Swift’s music play in our romantic lives now?</p>\n<p>This article includes content provided by Instagram. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, <strong>click 'Allow and continue'</strong>.</p>\n<p>She was there for those first flutters and disappointments: a teenager singing out loud the kind of heart-on-sleeve confessions that we kept safely hidden in our diaries (including ones way beyond teenhood). On the one hand, you could slot yourself into the lyrics of the story she’s telling: “Please don’t be in love with someone else,” she hoped in Enchanted. But then, you could go and find out exactly who she is writing about: “Don’t you think I was too young to be messed with?” she asked in Dear John, presumed by many to be about her musician ex John Mayer, which Swift never confirmed or denied. This triggered a global obsession with her relationships, but it has never stopped her writing about them, thank God. Weirdly, she makes dating famous people juicy <i>and</i> relatable.</p>\n<p>When we reached our 20s, ready to bite back at bad boys, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/nov/12/taylor-swift-red-taylors-version-review-republic\">the Red album</a> was the ultimate bible of breakup bangers. Who didn’t fall to the floor screaming “OH!” when I Knew You Were Trouble came on? But she was at her most vulnerable, too, in All Too Well – a power ballad that even now pierces me with the pain of life after short-lived loves. The next album, 1989, was more upbeat but just as scathing: I’m not ashamed to say that, during the peak of Blank Space, I clinked my drained wine glass at a dinner, stood up and announced: “Boys only want love if it’s torture”.</p>\n<p>Then Swift fell in love. Her 2017 album Reputation might have been vengeful, but the industry was the target, because her new boyfriend Joe Alwyn was actually nice! A classically handsome actor (“What can I say? You’re gorgeous”) who scratched her English thesp itch and was happy to shelter with her away from the bullshit (“He built a fire just to keep me warm”). Only someone totally lost in a cloud of sparkly love could then seriously release saccharine odes Me! and London Boy.</p>\n<p>They stayed together for six years and during that time she turned to writing more fictional songs, sometimes with Alwyn, on lockdown albums Folklore and Evermore. Look, I was happy for Swift and enjoyed ditties about the heiress Rebekah Harkness, former owner of Swift’s mansion, having a marvellous time ruining everything … but when she and Alwyn called it quits and she quickly started dating the 1975’s Matty Healy, I was ready for the real-life dramas she essayed between her and Healy in last year’s The Tortured Poets Department.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/aug/28/taylor-swift-engagement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

You are smart and self-aware sexually, but you are failing to truly experience pleasure because you are now (understandably) goal-oriented and fearful. Many people subscribe to the idea there should be one particular pattern to lovemaking – usually the one that starts with a bit of “foreplay” and proceeds to the “main event” of orgasm. Stop thinking like this. Instead, focus on pure pleasure rather than on achieving a climax. Consider the possibility that foreplay is overall a more erotic and pleasurable main event and that orgasmic ecstasy is a very brief, not altogether necessary, exclamation mark at the end. An enormous amount of prolonged pleasure awaits you and your partner if you can approach sexual encounters in this way and be honest about what works for you and what doesn’t.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to</p><a href=\"mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com\">private.lives@theguardian.com</a>(please don’t send attachments).

That’s why it was shocking to watch a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@loveislandusa/video/7524519775029021966?lang=en\">scene</a> in the latest season of Love Island US, in which Chris, a basketball player, asks the woman he’s seeing – Huda, a fitness influencer – if there’s anything he does that bothers her.</p>\n<p>It affects his mood “when something goes wrong, but I’m confused about what happened”, he says.</p>\n<p>What happened was that Chris taught a yoga class to the islanders (as Love Island contestants are called) and had asked everyone except Huda if they had anything to share.</p>\n<p>Huda, sounding sad, says he had skipped over her.</p>\n<p>“I did forget you, you’re right,” Chris says.</p>\n<p>It was a surprisingly mature conversation for Love Island, a show where attractive singles in skimpy swimsuits get locked in a villa for several weeks and try to find love. It can be difficult to approach conflict in a healthy way in such a high-pressure environment: on-air conflict tends to involve contestants shouting over each other and <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@editssssss980/video/7516660961156140310\">hurling insults</a>.</p>\n<p>So what does <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/feb/15/how-to-keep-love-alive-when-you-fight-argue\">healthy conflict</a> actually look like, and how do you practice it? We asked experts about how to approach conflict with romantic partners, family members and co-workers. Spoiler: the advice applies in basically any situation. It might even work on Love Island.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Is conflict actually good for us?</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>The first thing to know about conflict is that it should not be avoided.</p>\n<p>“Conflict is normal and healthy,” says <a href=\"https://relationshipsuite.com/about-rachel-moheban-wachtel-lcsw/\">Rachel Moheban Wachtel</a>, a licensed clinical social worker in New York who has worked extensively with couples. Conflict can be essential to deepening intimacy, understanding and connection, she says.</p>\n<p>If she gets mad at her husband, and he notices her reaction is disproportionate to the situation – which happens all the time with couples – “it’s an opportunity for him to learn what’s going on with me”, she explains. “It’s learning what each other’s triggers are.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps counterintuitively, if you don’t have any conflicts in your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/relationships\">relationship</a>, “then you have to worry”, she says.</p>\n<p>Disagreements can also teach us about ourselves, says Dr Sara Corse, chief clinical officer at the Council for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/relationships\">Relationships</a> in Philadelphia.</p>\n<p>“We think we know what we think and feel, and we think we know what other people think and feel, but we’re often wrong,” she says. Having a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/aug/31/how-to-say-the-unsayable-10-ways-to-approach-a-sensitive-daunting-conversation\">difficult conversation</a> can help us clarify or evolve our own views on a topic. (In my own relationship, for example, conflict has taught me a great deal about how to properly load a dishwasher. Apparently you don’t just toss in dishes at random and hope for the best.)</p>\n<p>Dr Amy Gallo, the author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/getting-along-how-to-work-with-anyone-even-difficult-people-amy-gallo/18058151\">Getting Along: How to Work With Anyone (Even Difficult People)</a> and contributing editor to the Harvard Business Review, says conflict is her “favorite topic”.</p>\n<p>“People assume that, as a conflict expert, I get brought into organizations to help them deal with too much conflict. It’s the exact opposite,” she says. “Ninety-nine percent of the time, what I’m helping leaders and organizations do is have more conflict.”</p>\n<p>Conflict leads to better work outcomes and stronger relationships within an organization, Gallo says, because it leads to “a more inclusive environment where people feel like there’s psychological safety. They can say what’s on their minds and disagree with the people around them because that’s a normal thing.”</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Why do we find conflict so challenging?</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>If conflict is so great, why are so many people uncomfortable with it?</p>\n<p>Many of us are socialized to avoid conflict, Gallo says. As a result, people can fear that disagreement is a sign that something has gone wrong, or that it signals to others that they are a difficult person.</p>\n<p>“We are taught over and over again that conflict is incredibly difficult, negative and destructive,” Gallo says. “Very rarely are we given the message that it’s normal to disagree, and differences of opinion make a team stronger.”</p>\n<p>Still, it’s important to not go overboard in our confrontations.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/aug/25/healthy-conflict-resolution-relationships\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>A maths lecturer, convinced his wife is cheating, will not check the CCTV footage that might confirm his fears but instead keeps a private tally of the number of pubic hairs she sheds in her underwear. One hair is “OK, acceptable”, more is evidence that she has been “having it off”, he says, unaware that he uses these delusions of her infidelity to protect himself from the dangers of intimacy. A high-flying Fulbright scholar becomes a sex worker to avenge the father she hates. An ex-nun discovers that her decades of religious seclusion were driven by an unconscious fear of pregnancy. A troubled young woman, seeking redress for her psychological losses, steals large sums of money that she will never spend.</p>\n<p>In Love’s Labour, the London-based, American-born psychoanalyst Stephen Grosz offers an antidote to the pat, sanitised love stories we absorb through romcoms, reality TV shows and other popular culture. Often, he writes, “easy stories obscure the hard ones”, and the hard ones are most true. “I like older guys”, the kleptomaniac tells him, an explanation that conceals: “I want a man to be the mother I never had.” In Grosz’s telling, psychoanalysis resembles a painstaking, collaborative act of excavation, removing layers of self-deception and motivated reasoning to discover the conflicting fears and desires that lie beneath.</p>\n<p>Love’s Labour is Grosz’s second book and like his bestselling 2013 debut, The Examined Life, it is a series of case studies that read like Grimms’ fairytales: dark and allegorical. His patients’ identifying details have been removed, but one imagines the pube-counting professor and others will recognise themselves. That these strange life stories are true(ish), makes them all the more powerful and compelling. The title refers to Grosz’s belief that the work of love is to learn to see oneself and others clearly – which is also the work of psychoanalysis and, arguably, of life.</p>\n<p>The book is as much about the mysteries of analysis as it about the mysteries of our hearts and sexual desires. In one chapter, Grosz recounts a fierce argument between two psychoanalysts after one, Susan, discovers that the other, Cora, has been having an affair with her husband. Susan says that Cora has never learned what psychoanalysis should be about: having empathy, behaving morally, accepting reality. But Cora believes the goal is learning to act according to one’s true desires and accept the consequences. Both outcomes, Grosz concludes, can be desirable consequences of analysis, but neither should be the aim of the therapist. To have aims for a patient is to infringe on their autonomy. He aims for nothing more than for his patients to better understand themselves.</p>\n<p>As one might expect, therapeutic breakthroughs often happen after Grosz and the patient analyse a dream, and his patients frequently trace the origins of their issues with intimacy to early childhood, to a dead or emotionally absent parent. Each case study can feel like a detective story: a tiny, inconsequential detail may, sometimes years later, unlock a new understanding. And what a long time this process can take! Grosz has been working with patients for 40 years, and sometimes a phone call or chance encounter decades after the initial consultation completely changes his understanding of a person’s predicament. In the penultimate chapter – a pure horror story: chilling, moving, unforgettable – he describes a sculptor who has found himself emotionally and physically stuck since his girlfriend’s suicide. After they have been speaking for 10 years, Tobias recounts a dream that finally enables him to reveal horrifying details about the aftermath of her death, details that help them both understand his emptiness, and that will haunt readers long after they have set this book aside.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/aug/25/loves-labour-by-stephen-grosz-review-the-truth-about-relationships\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>David Mitchell is probably the only male on the planet who could get away with defending mansplaining, so that is what he has done. “I feel there’s an unfairness to the term, which is taken to be men explaining things in a boring way to women,” he told <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/culture/tv-radio/article/david-mitchell-robert-webb-are-not-helping-79nf963hl\">the Sunday Times</a>. “Because they do it to each other, and they take turns, and that’s what men call a conversation.”</p>\n<p>In the same interview, Mitchell and his comedy partner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/robert-webb\">Robert Webb</a> are asked how each counselled and supported the other through various personal challenges. They are confused and slightly aghast at the idea that they might have discussed such matters. What do men talk to one another about, then? “Well, yes,” says Mitchell. “That’s a question [my wife] Victoria’s asked me many times. And I never really know.”</p>\n<p>This insight came in the same week Rylan Clark <a href=\"https://hungermag.com/art-culture/rylan-is-baring-it-all\">revealed what he has learned</a> from hosting his podcast How to Be in Love. “I never really understood when people said, ‘my partner is my best friend,’” he admitted. “Because I thought, well, my partner is not my best friend – my best friend is my best friend. I didn’t get it. But I’ve realised that your partner can be that.”</p>\n<p>Hmmm … can they, though? As so perfectly illustrated by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/david-mitchell\">David Mitchell</a>, men and women communicate in extremely different ways so, if you are in a heterosexual relationship, the odds seem stacked against you. Of course, there are exceptions to the rule but, if my husband went to the pub with a mate whose entire family had just been abducted by aliens, there’s a very real chance it might not come up. There have been many instances where something huge is happening in the life of one of his pals and I’m waiting patiently for the next instalment, but he comes home clueless. “Didn’t you ask?” I’ll shriek, brandishing my rolling pin. And he will look bewildered, somehow unaware he was meant to.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, I know my friends inside out, and vice versa. From their deepest dreams, hopes and desires, to how they feel about themselves and everybody they have ever met via what they fancy for lunch. We check in, we keep up, we don’t have to be reminded to enquire about the plot twists in each other’s storyline, we are living and breathing them together. How can these opposite ways of relating, of transmitting and receiving, mesh successfully so both parties get what they need?</p>\n<p>But perhaps bigger, and more important, than the question of whether it’s possible to be best friends with your partner is if it’s a good idea in the first place. Isn’t that a lot of pressure on one person, and also too great a shift from romance towards roommates? Love aside, I do like my husband, we are friendly, but I’m not sure he’s my <i>best</i> friend, nor that I want him to be. It feels co-dependent and insular. A bit Stepford, tradwife, like we might share a toothbrush or, worse, an email address.</p>\n<p>Then I asked my husband who his best friend was, and his answer, and my reaction to it, surprised me. He thought for a second, and then gave a male name. He had been best man at our wedding, so the clues were there, but I was oddly hurt. “Not me, then?” I clarified, in case he had mixed me and this guy up or something.</p>\n<p>“Well, I’m not yours, am I?” he replied, immediately reeling off five people and one cat who would definitely be ahead of him in the queue. All fair enough. Except … it turns out that although my husband isn’t <i>my</i> best friend, and I am fine with that, I want to be <i>his</i>. Want and expect. Oh, and I’m increasingly outraged not to be, the longer I ponder it. Welcome to marriage.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/31/women-cope-better-when-their-partner-dies-ill-have-to-go-before-him-out-of-spite\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I have always been mindful that I might need to look after him in his old age</strong>\n      <strong>. But I am a caring person, and always thought I would manage. </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>This is not how things have worked out. My husband is pretty healthy, while I am </strong>\n      <strong>suffering the beginnings of a noticeable cognitive decline</strong>\n      <strong> – forgetfulness</strong>\n      <strong>, overwhelm and a decrease in mobility</strong>\n      <strong> – which I haven’t been to the doctor </strong>\n      <strong>about yet</strong>\n      <strong>.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>My husband is not a very outwardly caring person, and I </strong>\n      <strong>have no idea if he will </strong>\n      <strong>care enough</strong>\n      <strong> to look after me if I become more immobile or </strong>\n      <strong>start to forget things more. I want to feel loved, but I don’t. </strong>\n      <strong>This is sad in itself, and really scary for the future.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>I have had some health challenges in the last year and am doing my best to </strong>\n      <strong>look after myself. My husband gives me a lot of advice about my weight and health</strong>\n      <strong>, but he doesn’t walk or talk more slowly if </strong>\n      <strong>I struggle to keep up</strong>\n      <strong>. </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Today we went to the cinema as a family. I </strong>\n      <strong>booked </strong>\n      <strong>it</strong>\n      <strong>, paid and drove</strong>\n      <strong>, but my husband and kids </strong>\n      <strong>walked off </strong>\n      <strong>to</strong>\n      <strong> the cinema </strong>\n      <strong>without me and I couldn’t catch up.</strong>\n      <strong> I want to be together, but I’m </strong>\n      <strong>left behind.</strong>\n      <strong> This</strong>\n      <strong> </strong>\n      <strong>feels like a metaphor for our life.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>What I really want </strong>\n      <strong>my husband to say is, “Don’t worry, I’ll take care of you, and you take care of me.” But I just don’t think he’s capable of it.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Your letter was one of the saddest I’ve read. Not because it is without hope – quite the opposite – but because this gap between you and your family could be bridged with communication. But I know that takes courage.</p>\n<p>Please go to the doctor. A proper checkup could put your mind at rest, or give you concrete answers to present to your family. So many women your age, who have had a lifetime of looking after others, are exhausted and overwhelmed – not because they are failing, but because they are so capable. It’s time to start looking after you.</p>\n<p>UKCP registered psychotherapist Meeri Rebane was “moved by your letter and your courage in asking for help. It seems that being the strong physically capable ‘carer’ is a role you’ve carried throughout your life. From the start of your relationship with your husband, you took on the responsibility of thinking about what and who needs taking care of in the family.” Rebane went on to say that there’s “nothing wrong with that, people can get great fulfilment from caring for others, but who took care of you when you were growing up? It seems you were taught to be the ‘caring person who would always manage’, but also that to ‘not manage’ was not OK.”</p>\n<p>We wondered if this was why you don’t feel you can ask for help now? I wondered about your life when you were a child. You may find the podcast I did on the <a href=\"https://pod.link/1567190358/episode/4ce2a72acd2eb9c0a989cfd7be9ffd27\">Parentified Child</a> useful.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-11\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>When you’re the planner and the fixer, you and your needs can become invisible because you just get on with it. I don’t think your husband and children are uncaring – after all, you’ve shown them a lifetime of how to do it – but it’s very likely they have no idea at all how you feel.</p>\n<p>“Your husband may not be capable of giving you the response you need at first,” says Rebane. “His way of expressing care may be different to yours. It doesn’t mean he doesn’t want to take care of you. If you don’t tell him what you need, however, he can’t even try to support you.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/31/my-health-is-declining-and-im-worried-my-husband-might-not-take-care-of-me\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>In May<strong> </strong>2018, I was scrolling through prospective dates on Bumble when I saw Charlie’s profile. I could tell we had a lot of immediate connections. He had worked for human rights organisations, travelled a lot and even had interesting profile pictures. I swiped right.</p>\n    <p>Later that day, we met at a small bar close to my work in Melbourne for a drink. Even though it was a good first date, I decided I didn’t have the energy for more dates straight away and cancelled our second one. I think he thought I was a bit of a time waster.</p>\n    <p>A month later, I was visiting family in Perth and my mum asked if I was seeing anyone. I expressed frustration that it’s so hard to sort through all the garbage on dating apps – but there was one guy I’d met who seemed lovely and had a beautiful smile. So when I got back to Melbourne we met again for dumplings, and it was on.</p>\n    <p>After just six months together we moved into his one-bedroom bachelor pad. That was a massive mistake. We did it way too fast and immediately started squabbling. It was just too soon for two very independent people who had spent a lot of time building up their own lives to be suddenly trying to mesh them together.</p>\n    <p>By March 2020, our bickering was at an all-time high. We decided to see a couples counsellor before going on a one-month trip to South America – we didn’t want to ruin the trip for ourselves. I remember immediately disliking the counsellor, which I think was more about what she revealed about us. At the end of the first session she just looked at us and said she didn’t think she could help because we were too far apart as individuals for things to work out. We were like, that’s really bad!</p>\n    <p>Before we left Australia we’d heard murmurings about this new virus emerging but we were feeling smug that we were escaping. After five incredible days hiking across Patagonia, we found ourselves bunkering down in a small hotel room in Punta Arenas as the news of Covid spread across the world.</p>\n    <p>Flights were cancelled, borders were closing, we had desperate messages from friends and family. We were freaking out. It went from a complete state of relaxation and wonder at the world to OMFG the world is melting down.</p>\n    <p>Charlie was way more relaxed about it than me. He was like, we’ll be OK. It just wasn’t in his realm of possibility that we wouldn’t get home. So while I was contacting embassies, trying to change flights and reaching out to friends and family to figure out our way home, Charlie was happily imagining our new life in Chile. “Babe, imagine how good we’ll get at Spanish,” he said. A line I’ll always remember.</p>\n    <p>In the hotel room in Punta Arenas I knew that if the world was ending, as it felt like it was, it was him I wanted to be next to. Charlie was making us go on walks, making up songs and cracking jokes the whole time. He was bringing me out of my anxiety loop. We balanced each other out perfectly in that crisis, on opposite ends of the scale.</p>\n    <p>Eventually, we got seats on one of the last flights back from Chile before the borders closed. We were waiting on standby at the airport, and we only got seats on the flight because two temporary residents were booted off when the rules changed and only permanent residents could get back into Australia. It really was the most bonkers time.</p>\n    <p>Charlie proposed in July 2020 and we eloped in December 2020.</p>\n    <p>I thought our time in Chile was going to be the worst thing we would go through – but we have faced many difficulties together since then.</p>\n    <p>Through it all, I’m always so grateful to have him by my side. We never went back to that couples counsellor.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/31/the-moment-i-knew-stuck-in-chile-in-the-early-days-of-covid-he-brought-me-out-of-my-anxiety-loop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Sometime in the summer of 2017 I wrote in my journal, “Jesus fucking Christ, please save me.” I was trapped in hell, and I could see no way out. Our beautiful, sunny, two-bedroom penthouse apartment in the East Village – which I had rented for Rayya to make her happy in the last months of her life – had become a dungeon of misery, danger, degradation, drugs. Rayya kept the shades drawn at all hours of the day, not only because the light hurt her eyes but also because she had become intensely paranoid that she was being watched by the police, and that they were coming for her.</p>\n<p>And, to be honest, the police might very well have come for her (for both of us, actually), because our apartment now contained thousands and thousands of dollars’ worth of cocaine – some of which Rayya was cooking down and shooting into whatever veins she could find upon her beaten-down, disease-ridden body, some of which she was freebasing, some of which she was snorting up her now constantly bloodied nose. But most of the coke, as of this moment, she had chopped up and laid out in thick rails on the coffee table, next to an overflowing ashtray, a bottle of whiskey, several bottles of morphine and trazodone and Xanax, a stack of fentanyl patches and a cluster of empty beer bottles. And these heaping lines of cocaine she counted, weighed and studied all day long.</p>\n<p>“What the fuck are you looking at?” she demanded, glancing up for a moment from her cherished cocaine heaps and peering at me through a blue haze of cigarette smoke – staring me down with hostile eyes that had not, as far as I could remember, blinked in days.</p>\n<p>Good question.</p>\n<p>What was I looking at?</p>\n<p>I was looking at somebody who was supposed to be dead by now – who had been given six months to live over 15 months earlier – but who simply refused to die. I was looking at somebody who had recently gotten kicked out of hospice (who gets kicked out of hospice, by the way?) for being aggressive and uncooperative to the kind, generous nurses and support staff who had been trying to help my beloved partner prepare her body and mind for a “death with dignity” – a death that, at this point, Rayya had utterly rejected in favour of plan B, which was to do enough drugs that she could feel immortal, that she could feel nothing.</p>\n<p>I was looking at somebody who had once been the only person on Earth who could make me feel completely safe and loved, but who now verbally abused me all day long, telling me that I was “a fucking shit show of a failure” when it came to taking care of her; that everything I was doing to try to help her was wrong; that I was a “needy little fucking crybaby” who had to “grow the fuck up”.</p>\n<p>I first met Rayya Elias in the spring of 2000. I was 31 years old at the time, and married. I was on a certain path back then. Husband, nice house, good job, about to start a family. Except there was a problem with my hair, which was a frizzy mess. One day a friend told me I resembled a young <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/art-garfunkel\">Art Garfunkel</a>, and said I needed to do something about it. She suggested I go see this person named Rayya, who was cutting hair out of a walk-up apartment on Avenue C.</p>\n<p>I was dressed that day like a sales clerk at Banana Republic, which is how I always dressed back then. All khakis and cardigans. I remember my outfit clearly, because I looked and felt so different from Rayya, who was wearing black leather pants, a white tank top and motorcycle boots. I have fallen in love with many people at first sight, but I did not fall in love with Rayya Elias that day. In fact, I didn’t fall in love with her for another eight or nine years. But I did like her. She was funny and interesting and exotic.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/aug/30/eat-pray-love-author-elizabeth-gilbert-leaving-marriage-dying-friend\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Picture a man sitting opposite you on public transport. He wields a copy of The Will to Change by bell hooks, and he takes care to parade the front cover or the spine lest any nearby strangers miss the title. He is in his 20s or 30s and conventionally attractive; maybe he has a dangly earring or two. There on his knee rests a tote bag. This man would not engage in loutish, careless behaviour like “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/dec/06/hes-about-to-give-birth-manspreading-hits-new-heights-at-30000ft\">manspreading</a>” or placing all his stuff on the seats. And the tote bag probably bears the logo of an ethical brand or a bookshop. The bag is probably adorned with social-justice badges. If he showed you what music he is listening to, it might be, say, Lana Del Rey or Clairo.</p>\n<p>Here we have the performative male – a new kind of vaguely problematic man to watch out for. And one who is the subject of all manner of viral TikToks and memes, and media coverage everywhere from GQ to the New York Times, which reported on a recent <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/14/style/performative-men.html\">performative male contest in Seattle</a>. For some reason when I picture him he always has curly hair. Big bouncy lustrous curls. You can probably add your own details, but you get the picture. The idea is that the performative male is a guy who goes about looking feminist and woke. The catch is that his aesthetic is curated to appeal to what he thinks women might like rather than being a totally earnest expression of his interests.</p>\n<p>Imagine that! A person choosing clothes and accessories to increase their attractiveness in the eyes of the gender they are trying to sleep with. Very insidious and unusual behaviour. I can tell you right now I have never once in my life participated in such a charade. I will admit, too, that some of this coverage has made me feel baffled by what is apparently considered desirable. The performative male is said to wear several <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/15/a-fluff-ball-with-a-monster-face-what-explains-the-luxury-appeal-of-labubu-dolls\">Labubus</a> and drink <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/apr/05/skyrocketing-demand-for-matcha-raises-fears-of-shortage-in-japan\">matcha</a>. I don’t really understand why this would lure women in. It’s even been suggested a performative male might stow tampons on his person. But if I met a cisgender man who made a point of carrying tampons around with him I’d probably telephone the police.</p>\n<p>My first thought, when I came across this trend, was: God, straight men cannot win. My second was: yes, this aesthetic is very common – not just with men but with women too. A parade of images flashed before me of all the young women and men I have seen self-consciously clutching their unbroken copies of Angela Davis and so on in coffee shops and on the bus. “A lot of the time they don’t know what they’re talking about,” one of the hosts of the Seattle performative male contest told the NYT, speaking about the kind of men who adopt this look. “It’s just an aesthetic for them.” But I would gently submit that a substantial proportion of the women who take care to post highlighted and pencilled-over pages of bell hooks to Instagram do not put much of the ethos of her work into practice in their own lives either.</p>\n<p>After all, performative righteousness is not solely the preserve of young men. I have often felt that the parallel vapidness and popularity of online social-justice messaging has created an entire generation (or two) of people obsessed with the idea of telegraphing their own worthiness rather than practising it.</p>\n<p>As the performative male trend has gained traction, I have received a few PR emails about it on behalf of “experts” with funky job titles offering to help counsel young women to spot toxic signs and red flags in the opposite sex. These missives, which I receive every time a new dating trend is coined, are always full of my own personal red flags. One such email on behalf of a “relationship coach” explained that the performative male is dangerous because he “speaks the language of emotional availability but doesn’t practise it”. I am happy to say that, for all its shadowy allusions to grave transgression, I have no idea what this sentence means.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/29/tote-bag-matcha-performative-male-women\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I can handle it.”\nI approve the highest dose of sedative and start the scan. “You know I’m not Peiyi.”\n“I know. I’m sorry. I know.”</i></p>\n<p>The mountains collapse into swirls of liquid black.</p>\n<p>I blink. It’s just an optical illusion. There’s no running water here on Orpheus—impossible at minus sixty degrees Celsius. I’m surrounded by knots of ice and stone, as I’ve been since I arrived yesterday.</p>\n<p/><p>The remnants of their base hadn’t been difficult to find. After dropping my lander at the spot marked on the historical expedition plans, I trekked around the edge of a vast basin that the original expeditioners had named <i>Mare Lucidum</i>, the Shining Sea. Eventually I discovered a visibility marker—almost completely buried in ice, only its reflective red tip peeking out. From there, I tracked broken markers to the habitation dome. Behind the dome, cradled in the shadow of a cliff, were the crumbled remains of the <i>Dandelion IX</i>.</p>\n<p>A large crack had split the dome’s outer door, and a tumble of frozen pebbles spilled into the airlock. When I tried the inner door, I found that the mechanism was jammed. Only when I leaned my full weight against it, spinning the pinions in my knees at full power, did the seal creak ajar.</p>\n<p>Before beginning this trip, I’d combed the archives on Terra III. There’d been only limited information about the Orphean expedition. The crew had beamed back a few reports during their first couple of months here—data about the terrain and climate; difficulties in establishing reliable food sources. Then, abruptly, silence.</p>\n<p>I spent a night in their ruined base, carefully taking photographs and salvaging data banks. Amongst the locally-stored files, I discovered several never-sent reports.</p>\n<p><i>The greenhouse crops are failing again. Nothing’s working—not the organic fertiliser, not the added humidity. We’re thinking about trying Cassius’s valley. It’s a thin hope, but we’re at that stage. It’s only four kilometres east of here. He swears he saw bits of edible algae trapped in the ice…</i></p>\n<p>The journey out here was tougher than I’d expected. Even with the traction cleats extruded from my feet, I slipped many times on the treacherous ice. Geysers spouted toxic fumes at unpredictable intervals. I checked my radar regularly and doubled back a few times to avoid the most dangerous areas. Brief exposure to the fumes would not trouble me; little would seep through my scale-suit. But corrosive microdroplets might cling to my equipment and wriggle into my joints when I removed my outer skin.</p>\n<p>Now, I find myself staring down into Cassius’s valley. A misnomer. It’s not really a valley at all, but a maze-like warren twisting deep into the planet’s bowels. The rock formations have shed their jagged edges and sharp outcroppings. Instead, massaged by long-gone rivers, they flow like ink: viscous black under lacy ice shrouds.<br/>\nDid all four expeditioners come on this scouting venture? If so, why? It was out of character for me—for Peiyi, I mean—to be so foolish. The sensible thing would’ve been to leave at least one at base.</p>\n<p>I close my eyes. Peiyi’s memories are always there: a languid tide lapping around my waist. I let my resistance weaken. It’s like exhaling a long-held breath. I sink to the neck, bumping up against ocean debris.</p>\n<p>I see my hands—bare olive skin, unblemished by enhancements or implants—flicking objects nimbly around a holographic display. Schematics of the <i>Dandelion IX</i>. Incomplete maps of the Orphean terrain. Blueprints of the habitation dome, the greenhouse. Projected timelines.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2023/12/28/escape-pod-921-death-by-water/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Completely love it!”</p>\n<h3>Harvest the Stars</h3>\n<p>The summer Sif turned one, the starships were ripe on the vine.</p>\n<p>They hulked in fields ringing the town where Tuja had always lived. A place far from big cities, where the starlight they fed on came pure and bright.</p>\n<p>“The seeds start out like any seeds; small, unassuming. Until we fertilize them, tend them. Give them space to grow,” Tuja said to the infant on her lap, who must have been more focused on the fingers stuffed in her mouth than the sight of the field crew moving amongst hulls like insects scrambling over gourds. They started in the early afternoon to harvest with the dusk.</p>\n<p>The rooftop porch of their small home was the perfect place to watch as buyers checked and finalized purchases, as fielders netted and pinned the craft, drained most of the gases from lift chambers, checked their structural integrity one last time before cutting away the shriveled vestiges of vines with cautery tools.</p>\n<p>“When they can cut through the vines that easy, it’s time for the ships to go,” Tuja said, as one of the craft demonstrated. Multiple vines came together, from the same plant or different ones, in order to form the bud that would become a node that would burgeon into a full fledged starship after roughly two decades of development; at this point, they snaked from all sides of the ship’s underbelly in the churned mud of the field and were snipped, one at a time, by skilled hands.</p>\n<p>With its vines cut, the starship rose to the top of its net; a massive balloon with inner galleries and spaces large enough for human habitation, a rind-skin impervious to the void between life-sustaining worlds. A few pieces of technology and the processes and rhythms of the starship could be made manageable, directable.</p>\n<p>Sif made a sound somewhere between amazed and amused; so hard to tell where the line was at her age, if there was one at all.</p>\n<p>Another ship followed the first, rising with silent grace to the top of its net. Sif’s arms pumped, mimicking the ship. Encouraging it, perhaps.</p>\n<p>“And then, when they’re all harvested, and the field’s all tilled up, they take more of those tiny little seeds and put them in the ground and start all over,” Tuja said.</p>\n<p>She’d seen the full process, from seeding to harvest, only once in her life, having been born in the midst of a crop rotation, but she was eager to watch the next crop grow with her daughter. She pulled Sif close in crossed arms and breathed deep of the strawy, star-warmed scent of the fields.</p>\n<p>New seeds were planted, and for years the fields looked like any fields; they might contain melons or squashes, from a distance. Ones that grew quickly, that were allowed to get concerningly large, but still, the potential they contained was well concealed to the untrained eye.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2023/12/23/escape-pod-920-harvest-the-stars/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 919: Emotional Resonance</h2>\n<h3>Emotional Resonance</h3>\n<p>Arbor’s favorite part of a mission was always the first view of a planet. Even after seven hundred years of being a giant robot, it never got old. Green and blue clouds churned over purple seas, imposing storms that flashed red with threads of lightning. Beautiful.</p>\n<p>And they were sent to clear it of all human life. <i>Courtesy of ExoPLENTI, Inc.! </i>Ugh, that slogan clung to their digital psyche no matter how hard they tried to scrub it from their databases.</p>\n<p>At least this part, floating in orbit, wasn’t so bad.</p>\n<p>Proximity alarms went off, a shrill beep and an itch on their right arm. Okay, this part wasn’t <i>usually </i>bad? Sensors indicated a friendly mech to the right, and it was floating too close.</p>\n<p>The incoming mech’s sharp metal angles were humanoid like Arbor’s. Two hands, two feet. This model’s design was new, its frame less bulky and more streamlined. It was freshly painted blue and silver with huge blue, glass eye sensors—a contrast to Arbor’s dented weathered shell and red eyes.</p>\n<p>The other mech’s MIND—a cute corporate acronym for Monitoring Interface Neural Driver—blipped into existence, a projected hologram of faded colors and warped outlines, and peered over the edge of her robot’s helmet plate in awe. She was listed as Crowe, her name and ID hovering above her. She wore a pink bomber jacket with glowing white lines. Her curly hair was a gradient of pink, white, and blue, her skin just a shade darker than Arbor’s own dark brown. She was super cute.</p>\n<p>Arbor was relieved they still felt infatuation, simulated or not.</p>\n<p>“Sorry!” Crowe said. “I was admiring the view and found myself drifting.”</p>\n<p>“First mission post-download?” Arbor asked. They projected their hologram self-image on the shoulder of their body. Went for their classic black boots and jacket look. It was the first time they had done that in well over two hundred years.</p>\n<p>Crowe nodded. “Freshly installed yesterday. Wasn’t expecting to feel anxious about it. Given that I’m now, you know.” She gestured down her projection body and her mech shell made the same motion.</p>\n<p>“A giant murder machine, incapable of feeling upset?” Arbor supplied.</p>\n<p>Crowe smiled. “Exactly.”</p>\n<p>“Welcome to the beginning of a thousand years as a killer robot. Don’t worry, they only take your ability to question or disobey their orders. All the little quirks and unique things that make you, well, <i>you </i>stay intact.” It was in the contract, and it was obvious Crowe hadn’t been allowed to read the fine print. That was common. Shitty, but common.</p>\n<p>“I guess that’s something,” Crowe said. She looked down at the planet and sighed. “I suppose we’ll be fighting soon.”</p>\n<p>“Does that bother you?”</p>\n<p>Crowe shrugged. Occasionally she became semi-translucent, her outline warping or voice distorting. “Bit of a trick question, don’t you think? If it bothered me, does that mean they did a bad job of removing my ability to doubt what I’m told to do?”</p>\n<p>“Maybe.” Arbor’s projection leaned back and floated in space. “Or maybe it means they programmed your inability to question orders so well it even feels like you can doubt them.”</p>\n<p>“Shit, that’s a good point.”</p>\n<p>Arbor laughed. “I’ve had some time to ponder.”</p>\n<p>Crowe looked at Arbor’s body, head tilted as her glowing blue eyes examined their information in the network. They felt the ping like a gentle tap on the shoulder and sent their detailed files along.</p>\n<p/><p><i>INCOMING PRIORITY NOTICE: Initiate MIND launch. Operation to commence in thirty seconds.</i></p>\n<p><i> </i></p>\n<p>The text was in bright red, splashed against the planet below.</p>\n<p>“Suppose that’s our cue,” Crowe said. “I should get back—sorry for almost drifting into you.” She gave a surprisingly shy glance back at Arbor. “See you again?”</p>\n<p>They nodded. Arbor very much wished to see her again. After centuries of silence and distance, they felt a newfound emotion, somewhere between happiness and anxiety. Their heart beat faster, face flush and warm, chest tight. All simulated reactions. After all, they weren’t human anymore. Nowadays their heart was a replaceable nest of wires and power supplies buried in the toughest alloy.

Their bird-drones spread across the city, scattered on cables and rooftops and broadcast towers. Every camera hunted for Krina Viy, independent security contractor (AWOL from JoyCorp contact 5 hours).</p>\n<p>A crow-drone spotted the target. Surveillance confirmed Krina’s identity and sent a brief reward signal to inspire the bird onward.</p>\n<p>The drone switched from search to pursuit, redoubling its data collection as it chased the taste of reinforcement. So much joy and empty-matrix innocence in its response to a simple reward. Flockmembers were too simple to understand that reinforcement implied punishment, and no success would ever suffice for long.</p>\n<p>If Surveillance could crack this case as the network desired, there would be rewards enough for everyone, drone and program-layer alike.</p>\n<p/><p>The crow-drone flitted from the power line to a billboard, tracking the target by spatial profile and gait-pattern. How else could it help the network? The crow uploaded data on everything in the human’s path: rain acidity, cracked sidewalk, a parked car leaking electrolyte fluid.</p>\n<p>The billboard underfoot responded to a ping, and the crow fed it passwords until it shared its camera records. The target had passed the billboard three seconds ago, but its database recorded only an unlabeled void, without identity.</p>\n<p>Another reward signal arrived at last. The crow didn’t understand what it’d achieved, but it knew its actions were worth repeating.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>A starling-drone peeked down from the eaves of an empty house. Below, a human head bent over a door, wedging a tool into the lock. The starling drew back into crumbling drywall, and fluttered through the gaps in rotted beams until it found an internal view.</p>\n<p>The target wedged the door shut and slumped on a dry patch of floor. She tapped behind her ear, and her commplant’s radioband signal fell silent. She drew a tablet from one of her leg pockets and began matching colors on the screen, her face cast in dim and meaningless light.</p>\n<p>The starling uploaded its data, and a light reward-signal spurred it to continue recording.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Surveillance compared the data from Crow-417 and Starling-230. The billboard’s ignorance made no sense, and municipal databases said the building had been demolished a year ago. Two errors combined were a strong sign of hacking (historical data classification certainty 90%).</p>\n<p>A sign, and a trail. Surveillance scoured the access history of the building’s public records, and cross-referenced them with the billboard’s software-verification timestamps. Together, plenty of information to track whatever hacker had helped Krina get this far. Surveillance sent the data laterally to Enforcement with an extra <i>human attention</i> flag.</p>\n<p>Enforcement acknowledged receipt, and added a reply: <i>human attention flag: declined/ignored</i>.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2023/12/07/escape-pod-918-conference-of-the-birds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
