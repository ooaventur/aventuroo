    "body": "<p>Ojos del Salado rises more than twenty-two thousand feet above sea level, on Chile’s northeastern border. It is the world’s tallest volcano, towering over the world’s highest desert: an ash-and-scree-covered behemoth that exceeds Elbrus, Kilimanjaro, and Denali in size, if not renown. Its name means “sources of the salty river,” or, possibly, “eyes of salt,” which is what the brackish lagoons on its lower reaches resemble when your brain is starved of oxygen. The wind and cold are trouble, too. Hypothermia and high-altitude pulmonary edema invisibly patrol the peak, which a pair of Poles were the first to reach, in 1937. Nonetheless, Ojos is what mountaineers call a “walk-up.” There are no crevasses or technical features on its standard route, just a relatively simple rock scramble beneath the summit block.</p>\n<p>I gathered this much from reading trip reports, back in 2016, while planning an Ojos expedition of my own. One particularly memorable <a href=\"https://publications.americanalpineclub.org/articles/12195707400/Ojos-del-Salado\"> account</a> of failure there described temperatures of twenty degrees below zero and winds that drove “head-high icy particles which cut our faces like sandpaper.” At the time I encountered that chilling sentence, I was a thirty-five-year-old freelance writer living in Atlanta. When asked why I wanted to climb this volcano—rather than a slighter one, or maybe a ski hill—I sometimes lazily cited George Mallory. “Because it’s there,” the English mountaineering legend said, before one of his pioneering attempts at Mt. Everest, where he would die in 1924.</p>\n<p>I did not want to die. I just wanted to kick my tires a bit, to let nature throttle me again. When I was twenty-one and meandering through college, I completed a two-thousand-mile hike of the Appalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine. After four and a half months, I emerged emaciated, emboldened, and in need of a root canal from my daily Snickers dipped in Nutella. A few years later, I traced a two-hundred-mile loop through the mountains encircling <a href=\"https://www.backpacker.com/stories/tahoe-rim-trail-above-it-all/\"> Lake Tahoe</a>, wearing a silver Speedo urged upon me by my younger brother, Rob, who donned a floral number. I bagged a bunch of fourteen-thousand-foot peaks out West, while working for </p>\n<p><i>Outside</i>magazine, and I even topped an eighteener, the Pico de Orizaba volcano, in Mexico, on a newspaper</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324503204578318550468753438\">. Climbing that one with Rob had entailed just a few days of discomfort, though. A properly acclimatized expedition up Ojos would require living above fourteen thousand feet for a week, including at least one night past nineteen thousand—two-thirds the cruising altitude of a commercial airplane—where there is approximately half as much oxygen as you enjoy at sea level.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Three friends and my brother agreed that Ojos offered a “Type 2 Adventure.” That is, a perversely painful undertaking that we would fondly remember forever. Hundreds of planning e-mails followed. It wasn’t enough to merely climb the volcano: we had decided to bring along mountain bikes. Only <i>a few</i><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/115747377\"> other</a> humans had apparently done so. Why not “catch a small plane into the mountain region, unload our equipment, ride into the mountain, summit that beast, ride down and out. . . . Would be so sick!” Chris, a lawyer at the time, who became our fantasist-in-chief, wrote. Justin, a commercial photographer, had never been much higher than fourteen thousand feet, but he was a strong and dependable cyclist. Doug, a fastidious videographer, who planned to bring along his drone, was also inexperienced at elevation; to train for the trip, he slept, often joined by his wife, inside an altitude-simulation tent for two weeks. “She’s cranky this morning and not happy after our first full night at 10,000,” he told us at one point.</p>\n<p>Rob was by then a junior-high-school English teacher in San Diego. He had graduated from the National Outdoor Leadership School, and had survived multiple summers climbing and slacklining around Yosemite Valley, where, in keeping with his aversion to constraints, he frequently “raged off-trail.” He was also the only one of us who had ever climbed above twenty thousand feet: on Chimborazo, in Ecuador, and Stok Kangri, in India. He was the closest thing we had to a real mountaineer—and, with his beard grown bushy and his glacier goggles strapped on, he looked it. Rob said that he would climb Ojos without the help of altitude-simulation tents or drugs such as Diamox, a pill that can prevent some symptoms of altitude sickness. This had been his position—which I had adopted, too—when we climbed the Mexican volcano a few years earlier. “I’m not taking any pills to circumvent Mother Nature,” Rob had said. “If I can’t handle the altitude, then I’m not meant to climb the mountain, and I’ll turn around.” He felt the same about Ojos. “You think Messner used painkillers?” Rob asked.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-weekend-essay/what-its-like-to-get-really-really-high\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>“I think there’s so many stories and images ingrained in people’s minds about the concept of me,” the actor Charlie Sheen tells the camera in the new two-part Netflix documentary about his life, “aka Charlie Sheen.” “It’s not even like they think of me as a person. They think of me as a concept, or a specific moment in time.” This assessment, though probably true of celebrity figures in general, strikes me as especially apt in Sheen’s case, if only thanks to his constancy in our media landscape over the past four decades. Especially to a viewer in her late forties, such as myself, it seems that Sheen has always been around: a show-business soldier never far from the reach of a camera, ready to embody a mood or an era.</p>\n<p>In the nineteen-eighties, when Sheen was in his early twenties, he followed his father, Martin Sheen, and his older brother Emilio Estevez into the family business, as the leading man in Oliver Stone’s “Platoon” and “Wall Street,” each role some version of a young, go-getting buck. In the aughts, he became Hollywood’s highest-paid male TV actor when he starred on the blockbuster sitcom “Two and a Half Men”—playing a bacchanalian bachelor suddenly saddled with fraternal and avuncular responsibilities—a cheering if somewhat bland mainstay of the George W. Bush years. And, in between these high-profile gigs, there always appeared to be some diverting, though often middling, Sheen fare to amuse audiences. (His IMDb page lists a staggering eighty-six acting credits, among them offerings like “Scary Movie 3” and “Major League II.”)</p>\n<p>Mostly, however, what grabbed the public’s attention over the decades were the scandals Sheen was involved in: the arrests for drugs and for assault; the rehab stays; the liaisons with porn stars and prostitutes; the quick marriages and the even quicker divorces; and, of course, in the early twenty-tens, the frenzied period in which, after being fired from “Two and a Half Men,” Sheen overtly embraced his role as a proudly drugs-and-sex-obsessed rebel with “tiger blood” pulsing through his veins, touring the country with a retinue of adult actresses to proclaim his rejection of polite society’s pieties, and braying the catchphrase “Winning!” at seemingly anyone and everyone he came across.</p>\n<p>The professed aim of “aka Charlie Sheen,” directed by Andrew Renzi, is to give viewers a peek at the person behind the persona. This coördinated push arrives accompanied by a memoir, “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Book-Sheen-Memoir-Charlie/dp/1668075288\">The Book of Sheen</a>,” published a day before the documentary dropped. “The stuff that I plan on sharing, I made a sacred vow years ago to only reveal to a therapist,” the actor tells the camera. In other words, it’s revelation and introspection time for Sheen, who, at sixty, has now been sober for eight years. But, as I watched, I felt that though the series certainly delivered on its promise of revelation, there wasn’t nearly as much introspection, leaving the viewer with a sense not of a deeper understanding and connection but of glimpsing, from a distance, at a life made almost entirely of the “stories and images” that Sheen claims to want to get past.</p>\n<p>In a way, though, this is perfectly fitting. It shouldn’t be surprising that Sheen himself sees his life as a mediated one, considering the environment he grew up in. When he was eleven, he joined his father in the Philippines on the set of Francis Ford Coppola’s Vietnam War masterwork, “Apocalypse Now” (in which Martin Sheen played the beleaguered Captain Willard), and, influenced by the sights and sounds he experienced, became increasingly interested in making dramatic and violent Super 8 movies at his family’s Malibu home along with his siblings, as well as their friends from the neighborhood, like future actors Chris and Sean Penn. “We kind of grew accustomed to watching our father die on film,” he says. “We recognized early on that those kind of plotlines are compelling.” Another compelling plotline emerged for Sheen in the early eighties, when Estevez rose to fame as a member of the so-called Brat Pack. Dazzled by his older brother’s newfound status as a media sensation, Sheen decided to try acting, too, and was immediately enchanted by the cinematic qualities of being a celebrity. (In his memoir, he remembers going to see a packed screening of “Platoon” with a <i>Penthouse</i> Pet named Lisa: “Walking with her on my arm past the fired-up catcalling line that circled the block was like being in a movie on the way to the movie.”)</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/critics-notebook/the-strange-cinematic-life-of-charlie-sheen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>During the three years of \"zero-COVID\" lockdowns, analyst Dan Wang emerged as one of the most astute observers of China's rapidly shifting domestic dynamics. Wang witnessed how the stringent COVID measures sparked <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/11/29/1139509250/china-lockdown-protests-xi-jinping-zero-covid-policy\">rare protests</a> and the government's eventual change of course in late 2022. His annual letters from China remain widely read and praised by those looking to make sense of China.</p>\n<p>But Wang's work goes beyond helping Western readers decode China. He wants to challenge them to think whether China's triumphs and missteps might also offer lessons for the United States. \"For decades, it was right and good for China to learn from the United States,\" he tells NPR in a recent interview, \"it is now time for the United States to learn a few things from China.\"</p>\n<p>It is a provocative proposition in today's political climate in Washington. Yet, Wang insists that the U.S. and China \"are fundamentally alike: restless, eager for shortcuts, ultimately driving most of the world's big changes.\" <a href=\"https://danwang.co/breakneck/\">He goes on to say</a>: \"both countries are tangles of imperfection, regularly delivering — in the name of competition — self-beatings that go beyond the wildest dreams of the other.\"</p>\n<p>There are many thought-provoking observations like these in his book, <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/465161/breakneck-by-wang-dan/9780241729175\"> Breakneck: China's Quest to Engineer the Future</a>. For example, Wang notices that Chinese leadership is dominated by engineers, while America's governing class is the preserve of lawyers — with a few generals and a handful of businessmen in the mix.</p>\n<p>This contrast, therefore, raises deeper questions in what some see as a \"new cold war\" between the world's two largest economies: Are these two societies, one led by lawyers the other by engineers, destined to clash? If so, what will it look like? And if not, can they ever learn from each other's strengths?</p>\n<p>NPR recently spoke with Wang to learn about his thinking on the current state of play between the U.S. and China.</p>\n<p><strong>NPR: You use \"engineering state\" vs. \"lawyerly society\" to explain how China got ahead and America stagnated. But there was a period during China's reform era that some pro-reform intellectuals admired the fact that America's ruling class was proficient in procedures. Are they proven wrong? </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Wang:</strong> For decades, it was right and good for China to learn from the United States. It is now time for the United States to learn a few things from China. Some of China's most remarkable successes shine a way towards solving many of America's present problems. China has built vast numbers of new homes, expanded the scale of its mass transit infrastructure, has become the world's leader on the construction of clean technology deployment, and maintained a robust manufacturing base. By contrast, America looks physically stagnant, as if so many cities are only the remnants of a formerly great industrial civilization. It is fine and proper for China to celebrate many of its achievements in physical dynamism and for America to study the good parts of China's successes.</p>\n<p>\n                President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. The two leaders spoke on Friday.\n                <strong>\n                    \n                    Ahn Young-joon/AP\n                    \n                </strong>\n                <strong>hide caption</strong></p>\n<p><strong/></p>\n<p>President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. The two leaders spoke on Friday.</p>\n<p><strong>NPR: China's economic growth has slowed down and many young Chinese now complain about not having enough opportunities. Can China's \"engineering\" ability help it regain growth? </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Wang:</strong> The policies of China's engineering state are one of the major reasons that youth unemployment has been so high today. Starting in 2020, top leader Xi Jinping decided to initiate a crackdown against some of its biggest internet platforms. At a stroke, many of China's most vibrant companies had to lay off workers, especially those involved in online education and e-commerce. This was also a time when Xi's insistence on \"zero-COVID\" strangled many service industries, especially those that catered to tourism. </p>\n<p>The engineering state is much more attentive to advanced manufacturing than the sorts of service jobs that young Chinese are more attracted to. That's another indication that the Chinese state is more interested in national power than the happiness of its people.</p>\n<p>\n                Workers wear protective gear in a Beijing neighborhood placed under lockdown during China's \"zero-COVID\" policy, which ended in late 2022.\n                <strong>\n                    \n                    Bloomberg via Getty Images\n                    \n                </strong>\n                <strong>hide caption</strong></p>\n<p><strong/></p>\n<p>Workers wear protective gear in a Beijing neighborhood placed under lockdown during China's \"zero-COVID\" policy, which ended in late 2022.</p>\n<p><strong>NPR: There seems to be a convergence in thinking on economic governance in America and China today, for example over industrial policy. Is this evidence that America's lawyers are learning the lessons of Chinese engineers? More crucially, can America outcompete China with China's ingredients for success? </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Wang:</strong> Unfortunately, President Trump is learning some of the worst elements of China. Trump and Xi are visiting misfortune upon the downtrodden, expect all of their policies to be defended by vocal loyalists, and play fast and loose with economic data. But America isn't learning some of the more useful lessons from the engineering state. China became a major manufacturing power in part by welcoming a lot of foreign engineers (especially American ones) to train up its industrial base; by contrast, ICE has <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/11/nx-s1-5537811/south-koreans-arrested-immigration-us-raid-sent-home\">deported hundreds of South Korean engineers</a> attempting to build an advanced factory in Georgia.

And those aren’t even all the art forms he practiced. He was also, after a fashion, a writer.</p>\n<p>That’s right<span>—t</span>he Spaniard took up poetry in his mid-50s. To some degree, this might not come as a surprise; he had had been moving in literary circles since he first moved to Paris in his early 20s. Counting among his closest friends the poets Guillaume Apollinaire, Paul Eluard, and Max Jacob, Picasso had been socializing with those at the heart of European Modernist poetry for three decades.</p>\n<p>Picasso’s poetry period began in 1935, following an emotional crisis sparked by the beginning of his separation from his first wife, the Russian <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/exhibition-picasso-marriage-olga-khokhlova-paris-899762\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ballet dancer Olga Khokhlova</a>, and the birth of his daughter Maya by his mistress Marie-Thérèse Walter, which saw him put down his paintbrush and pick up his pen.</p>\n<p>By the end of 1935, Picasso’s friend André Breton, poet and founder of the Surrealist movement, was <a href=\"https://www.cipherjournal.com/html/picasso.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">translating Picasso’s poems into French and publishing them in the magazine <em>Cahiers d’art</em></a>. Breton compared the experience of reading Picasso’s poems to “being in the presence of an intimate journal, both of the feelings and of the senses, such as has never been kept before.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2673840\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/07/pablo-picasso-signs-book-1926-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"A photo shows Pablo Picasso signing autographs\" srcset=\"https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/07/pablo-picasso-signs-book-1926-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/07/pablo-picasso-signs-book-1926-300x300.jpg 300w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/07/pablo-picasso-signs-book-1926-150x150.jpg 150w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/07/pablo-picasso-signs-book-1926-768x768.jpg 768w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/07/pablo-picasso-signs-book-1926-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/07/pablo-picasso-signs-book-1926-2048x2048.jpg 2048w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/07/pablo-picasso-signs-book-1926-50x50.jpg 50w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/07/pablo-picasso-signs-book-1926-256x256.jpg 256w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/07/pablo-picasso-signs-book-1926-220x220.jpg 220w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/07/pablo-picasso-signs-book-1926-1920x1920.jpg 1920w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/07/pablo-picasso-signs-book-1926-96x96.jpg 96w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-2673840\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pablo Picasso signs autographs on December 24, 1956 at the opening of an exhibition. Photo: Pierre Meunier/AFP.</p></div>\n<p>Picasso’s poetry was, in several ways, like his paintings. Firstly, it featured strange metaphorical imagery, like in one excerpt describing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/oct/01/poetry.art\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a bizarre chain of consumption</a>:</p>\n<p>“the street be full of stars<br>\nand the prisoners eat doves<br>\nand the doves eat cheese<br>\nand the cheese eat words<br>\nand the words eat bridges<br>\nand the bridges eat looks<br>\nand the looks eat cups full of kisses in the <em>orchata”</em></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2673874\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/07/picasso-portrait-dora-maar-1024x607.jpg\" alt=\"Visitors admire Picasso’s colorful cubist portrait of Dora Maar displayed in a modern art museum.\" srcset=\"https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/07/picasso-portrait-dora-maar-1024x607.jpg 1024w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/07/picasso-portrait-dora-maar-300x178.jpg 300w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/07/picasso-portrait-dora-maar-768x455.jpg 768w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/07/picasso-portrait-dora-maar-1536x911.jpg 1536w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/07/picasso-portrait-dora-maar-2048x1214.jpg 2048w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/07/picasso-portrait-dora-maar-50x30.jpg 50w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/07/picasso-portrait-dora-maar-1920x1138.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-2673874\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Picasso’s portrait of Dora Maar on view at the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, Australia, 2006. Photo: William West / AFP via Getty Images.</p></div>\n<p>Secondly, like his visual art, his poems are often inspired by the women in his life. For example, <em>Her Great Thighs</em>, about his mistress and muse, the artist <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/dora-maar-amar-gallery-2471279\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dora Maar</a>, begins with a lengthy inventory of body parts:</p>\n<p>“Her great thighs<br>\nHer breasts<br>\nHer hips<br>\nHer buttocks<br>\nHer arms<br>\nHer calves<br>\nHer hands<br>\nHer eyes<br>\nHer cheeks<br>\nHer hair<br>\nHer nose<br>\nHer throat<br>\nHer tears”</p>\n<p>And lastly, as he did with his Cubist visual artworks, he also sought to change the way the art form was fundamentally structured. Picasso eventually gave up on the use of punctuation altogether, describing it as a “cache-sexe [a G-string] which hides the private parts of literature.”</p>\n<p>The artist’s efforts at poetry didn’t go down well with all of his critics. In her book <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/everybodysautobi0000stei_z7s3/page/25/mode/1up?q=picasso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Everybody’s Autobiography</em></a> (1933), writer Gertrude Stein (Picasso’s first patron) recalled, in her distinctively unconventional style, the Spaniard begging her for feedback on the poems he had written while he had been “leading a poet’s life.”</p>\n<p>Stein made a damning comparison to the artwork of another of Picasso’s friends, the poet Jean Cocteau: “You see I said continuing to Pablo you can’t stand looking at Jean Cocteau’s drawings, it does something to you, they are more offensive than drawings that are just bad drawings now that’s the way with your poetry it is more offensive than just bad poetry I do not know why but it just is.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2673873\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/07/gertrude-stein-1936-1024x741.jpg\" alt=\"Black-and-white portrait of Gertrude Stein seated at desk, writing with a pen, looking forward.\" srcset=\"https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/07/gertrude-stein-1936-1024x741.jpg 1024w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/07/gertrude-stein-1936-300x217.jpg 300w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/07/gertrude-stein-1936-768x556.jpg 768w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/07/gertrude-stein-1936-1536x1112.jpg 1536w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/07/gertrude-stein-1936-2048x1482.jpg 2048w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/07/gertrude-stein-1936-50x36.jpg 50w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/07/gertrude-stein-1936-1920x1390.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-2673873\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Gertrude Stein, 1936. Photo: Hulton Archive / Getty Images.</p></div>\n<p>When the artist fought back against this critique, she wrote that she told him, while “catching him by the lapels of his coat and shaking him,” that “you are extraordinary within your limits but your limits are extraordinarily there.”</p>\n<p>Stein even wrote her own poem about Picasso, <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/55215/if-i-told-him-a-completed-portrait-of-picasso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>If I Told Him, A Completed Portrait of Picasso</em></a> (1923), in which the author abstractly associates the artist with Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>\n<p>Years later, in 1949, Stein’s partner, the writer Alice B.

    "body": "<p>RoseLee Goldberg, the founding director of Performa, the nonprofit organization that runs New York’s performance art biennial, is an enigma —at once regal and impish, unchanging yet constantly evolving. Performa, which celebrates its 20th anniversary this year, has brought unforgettable experiences to New York audiences.</p>\n<p>Its galas are legendary for bohemian extravagance and art historical themes, from the Renaissance to Russian Constructivism. Who could ever forget the chocolate replicas of Jeff Koons’s <em>Rabbit</em> (1986) by Jennifer Rubell for the 2009 edition?</p>\n<p>The historical anchor for the upcoming biennial, which runs November 1–23, is the beginning of sound in film. The gala on November 1 will honor artist Julie Mehretu and take place at the Harlem Parish, a decomissioned church.</p>\n<p>Over the years, Performa has presented 850 artists at more than 250 venues, which have included a burlesque theater (Francis Alÿs, 2005), Times Square (Robin Rhode, 2015, and Arto Lindsay, 2009), an East Village bathhouse (Rashid Johnson, 2013), and churches around town (Kelly Nipper, 2007, and Francesco Vezzoli and David Hallberg, 2015).</p>\n<p>In the process, it has redefined how performance art is made and experienced, and developed its own brand and method, which is now replicated by other groups around the world.</p>\n<p>The driving force behind Performa is Goldberg, 78, who is instantly recognizable on the international art circuit thanks to her signature chic style of black (and occasionally white) attire and matching low bangs. Born in South Africa, Goldberg moved to New York in 1976, after studying art history at the Courtauld Institute in London. She cut her curatorial chops at a gallery at the Royal College of Art and the Kitchen, a performance and visual art nonprofit in New York. She spent the ’80s and ’90s writing, teaching, and raising children. In 2004, she founded Performa, and its first biennial followed a year later, just as the market was becoming a dominant force in the art world.</p>\n<p>Our conversation has been edited for clarity and length.</p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-2690950\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mike Kelley, Extracurricular Activity Projective Reconstruction #32. A Performa Commission for Performa 09 Biennial. Photo © Paula Court. Courtesy of Performa</p>\n<p><strong>Katya Kazakina: Congratulations on the 20th anniversary! You look exactly the same, by the way. I want to know your secret. But first, can you take me back to the beginning? You are an art historian, a published author, a professor at New York University. Your role in Performa is so much more public. How did this happen?</strong></p>\n<p>RoseLee Goldberg: When I left the Kitchen in 1980, a lot of people said, You should start your own place. And I said, I could never figure how to do that, how to raise money and all of that. And I just decided one day, much later, it’s time to face this reality, the idea of a biennial became too strong. I thought it’s now or never.</p>\n<p><strong>Just like that?</strong></p>\n<p>There’s always a prequel, the origin story. In 2001, I produced the very first artist commission of Shirin Nishat, called <em>Logic of the Birds</em>. I saw this incredible piece that she had done in Venice. It’s called <em>Rapture</em>, and I came back to New York and said, Would you ever consider doing a live performance? You have all the ingredients, you have this cinematic choreography, you have East and West politics, film, sound, music, you know, all these elements. And she said, What a great idea!</p>\n<p>I invited Nigel Redden from Lincoln Center Festival to come see the workshop at the Kitchen, and he said, We’re taking it. So that was pretty exciting for the first production.</p>\n<p><strong>What were you hoping to accomplish at the time?</strong></p>\n<p>The idea was to invite artists, most of whom had never done performance before. I wanted to provide a place for artists to dream big.</p>\n<p>It was 2004, and I felt that New York needed something that was about artists, about that Downtown sensibility that we loved when we moved to New York in the ’70s —not about the marketplace. That was the starting point.</p>\n<p>I also wanted to create an organization where we can show the history of performance because people just don’t recognize it as being central to the history of art for the last 100 years.</p>\n<p><strong>And how did you get it off the ground?</strong></p>\n<p>The real magic happened when I met Toby Devan Lewis.</p>\n<p><strong>You are talking about the Cleveland philanthropist, who died in 2022?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. I went to see her and told her about my idea. And she said, How can I help? And I said, I need an assistant. She wrote me a sizable check right there. Throughout this period, she was the champion of Performa. She brought her enthusiasm, friends, and associates. And she was the key for continuing and growing the way we did.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s fascinating that Performa was fully formed and amazing right out of the gate.</strong></p>\n<p>From day one, it was always going to be a kind of world-class biennial. This was not going to be a small alternative to anything. And the way I did that is I went to speak with all the people I’ve grown up with in New York. People at the Kitchen, people at Art in General, people at Participant, friends at MoMA, friends at the Guggenheim. And basically, I said to everyone: Let’s make this about New York City.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/market/shoptalk-how-performas-roselee-goldberg-wields-soft-power-on-a-shoestring-budget-2688522\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Faced with a surplus of dairy products in the 1970s and 1980s, the U.S. government opened a number of government \"cheese caves,\" especially in Missouri, to hold its ballooning supply.</h2>\n<p>Springfield UndergroundThe Springfield Underground, one of many “cheese caves” in Missouri, today.</p>\n<p>Stories have long spread that somewhere far beneath the United States, the U.S. government is hiding mountains of cheese. While some internet retellings of the story may get some details wrong, there’s more than a kernel of truth in the story of U.S. government cheese caves.</p>\n<p>Indeed, there are cheese caves far beneath the ground — largely in states like Missouri — and they do hold over a billion pounds of cheese. However, these “cheese caves” are really more like warehouses, converted from old limestone mines. Most of them are now rented out to private companies.</p>\n<p>It may sound strange at first, but the reasoning behind government cheese caves is actually pretty sound. These caves are located so far below the surface that the facilities are naturally cool, meaning private companies — and at one point, the American government — could save a lot of money and energy to preserve their products.</p>\n<p>So why did the government decided to repurpose these old mines in the first place? It all started in the 1970s — when economic policies out of Washington inadvertently created a surplus of cheese.</p>\n<p>This is the true story behind the U.S. government cheese caves.</p>\n<h2>How The United States Government Ended Up With Millions Of Pounds Of Cheese</h2>\n<p>The story of the U.S. government cheese caves really began back during <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/world-war-2\">World War II</a>. At the time, wartime rations and food shortages create fears about future food supply issues, especially when it came to dairy.</p>\n<p>So, after the war, the government took steps to prevent any future dairy supply scarcity. The Agricultural Act of 1949 guaranteed a minimum price for milk and, if market prices fell, the government would buy surplus dairy products in order to stabilize prices.</p>\n<p>But this policy went into overdrive during the 1970s, under <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/jimmy-carter-facts\">President Jimmy Carter</a>. </p>\n<p>RBM Vintage Images/Alamy Stock PhotoPresident Jimmy Carter on his peanut farm. His background as a farmer inspired some of his policy decisions, such as subsidizing dairy farms in the 1970s.</p>\n<p>During <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/iconic-pictures-1970s\">the 1970s</a>, dairy farmers struggled with inflation and rising costs. Carter, a peanut farmer by trade, was sympathetic to their plight and oversaw an infusion of $2 billion dollars to the ailing industry.</p>\n<p>Dairy farmers then started producing more — and the government continued to buy up any dairy surpluses. To extend the shelf life of the dairy supplies it purchased, the government also began to use the excess milk to make products like cheese, butter, and dehydrated milk powder. Before long, the U.S. government had 500 million pounds of dairy on its hand.</p>\n<p>But now they had another problem. Where was the government supposed to store all this excess dairy?</p>\n<p>The answer, it turned out, was in government cheese caves in Missouri.</p>\n<h2>The Birth Of Missouri Cheese Caves</h2>\n<p>Beneath Missouri is an extensive series of limestone deposits which have been mined thoroughly over time. The mining industry left behind broad, dry caverns where, because of their subterranean nature, the air is naturally cool. And in the 1980s, the U.S. government realized that these caverns would be the perfect place to store dairy products like cheese.</p>\n<p>Springfield UndergroundFood storage at the Springfield Underground.</p>\n<p>“Once the mining operations played out, the remaining system of caverns were recognized as an opportunity for climate-controlled storage with massive holding capacity and access,” Andrew M. Novaković, professor of agricultural economics at Cornell University, explained to <i> Food &amp; Wine</i>. </p>\n<p>Though government cheese caves also popped up in Wisconsin and Kansas, two sites in Missouri became particularly well-known: the Springfield Underground in Springfield and SubTropolis in Kansas City, which each held millions of pounds of dairy products. <a href=\"https://www.springfieldunderground.com/\">Springfield Underground</a> alone offers around 3.2 million square feet of subterranean space. </p>\n<p>“The caves are actually man-made mines from which millions of tons of limestone were extracted for gravel,” <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/06/us/warehouses-bulge-with-surplus-cheese-butter-and-dried-milk.html\"> The New York Times</a> reported in 1982. “One corridor, which twists among the supporting pillars for more than 200 yards, is now filled to its 17-foot ceiling with sacks of dried milk. In another, the four-foot high cheese barrels are stacked four barrels high into the ceiling’s gloom. And in one vast anteroom, kept at zero degrees Fahrenheit, are frozen boxes of butter, piled to the chamber’s frigid top.”</p>\n<p>Wikimedia CommonsThe five-pound blocks of “government cheese” that were stored in the underground facilities.</p>\n<p>The cheese caves gave the government a place to store excess dairy products, but as the surplus grew into the millions — and even billions — of pounds, American policymakers also started looking for ways to get rid of it.</p>\n<h2>Inside The Creation Of ‘Government Cheese’</h2>\n<p>“We’ve got 60 million of these that the government owns,” Agriculture Secretary John R. Block <a href=\"https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/12/02/President-Reagan-was-shown-a-chunk-of-rotting-cheese/7189376117200/\">told reporters</a> at a 1981 press conference, a moldy brick of cheese in his hand. “It’s moldy, it’s deteriorating… we can’t find a market for it, we can’t sell it, and we’re looking to try to give some of it away.”</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/government-cheese-caves\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Ilove​ Gertrude Stein but I find it very difficult to think about the way I love her, to be precise about what’s so charming and also valuable in her writing, because everywhere you look there is her image and it can monopolise the attention. Not that I don’t love her image too. The problem is in working out what’s important, the image or the work or the way of living – or even whether these can be or should be separated out at all. Often she is pictured as part of a couple, usually with her partner, Alice B. Toklas, hovering watchfully in the background, or with one of her poodles, but sometimes she is simply herself: a presence in brown corduroy. Or there is the famous portrait by Picasso from 1905, with the face he added in later, not so much a face as a mask, and her joke about it, in Toklas’s voice: ‘After a little while I murmured to Picasso that I liked his portrait of Gertrude Stein. Yes, he said, everybody says that she does not look like it but that does not make any difference, she will, he said.’ She made many jokes, in fact: Stein’s are perhaps the only modernist works that make you laugh. I don’t mean laughing at them, which is what most people did with Stein. She became a kind of clown princess, which is unfair, but then almost all the attention directed at Stein has been unfair or misplaced, even from her admirers. It’s as if her brilliance is always quivering and in doubt, something that exists only in an endless process of attack or defence, which can make trying to think about her very tiring.</p>\n<p>One thing I am sure of is her value, even if the map of literary history that displays her influence seems very local, mostly confined to the New York poetry of John Ashbery and Frank O’Hara or the writing of Andy Warhol, though in fact so much of Hemingway’s manner of writing – the short, paratactic sentences, the use of repetition, the idea of removing the obvious subject – was taken from her, so the whole sequence of writers that came out of Hemingway’s style is arguably Steinian. But this occlusion shouldn’t be so surprising, because it took Stein herself a long time to catch up with her writing, to work out how to use her intuitions.</p>\n<p>She was born in 1874, which makes her one of the oldest modernists, and unusually for the modernists her greatest works were made in the last decade or so of her life, in the 1930s and early 1940s. The best is also the most famous, <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i>, the only book of hers that actually sold, but I think those that followed it – <i>Picasso</i>, <i>Paris France</i>, <i>Wars I Have Seen</i> – are wonderful too. Of course, I also love her more far-out earlier works, like <i>Tender Buttons</i> (1914) and the prose portraits and also many of the lectures, but not everything, not at all – one achievement of a true reading of Stein would be an assessment of how uneven she is as a writer – and the works I love exist for me more as a kind of abstract pattern, like some grammatical primer which acquires a graver beauty when finally submitted to the weight of the world. In a note Toklas wrote to Stein after typing up one of her manuscripts, she said: ‘It’s such very orderly literature. Much more so than Pablo’s. <i>La Jolie</i> is quite messy compared to this. You never were messy lovie but it’s more crowded now &amp; I like it. You can almost say anything you please can’t you.’ That note is much more insightful than most of what has passed for criticism of Stein in the last century, in its vocabulary of the ‘orderly’ and the ‘messy’ and the ‘crowded’, and that final sense of liberation. Because one delight of Stein’s way of writing is the way she explored what it might mean to speak with impunity – unpoliced and malicious and exuberant.</p>\n<p>Another delight is her openness about the conditions of domestic intimacy in which art is created. In <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i>, Stein has Toklas say: ‘You cannot tell what a picture really is or what an object really is until you dust it every day and you cannot tell what a book is until you type it or proofread it. It then does something to you that only reading never can do.’ I suppose you could irritably dismiss this kind of observation as the caprice of a rich collector, someone with their own private MoMA, but in fact it’s ruthless and original in its sense of pleasure as minute and daily and careful, just as this little observation about Matisse is so precisely poised: ‘He used his distorted drawing as a dissonance is used in music or as vinegar or lemons are used in cooking or egg shells in coffee to clarify. I do inevitably take my comparisons from the kitchen because I like food and cooking and know something about it.’</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v47/n17/adam-thirlwell/devotion-to-the-cut\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>At two o’clock​ in the morning on 23 October 1731, ‘a great smoak’ began to pour from the rafters of Ashburnham House in Westminster. The library was on fire, which meant that English history was on fire. Ashburnham held the many rare manuscripts that had been donated to the nation by the antiquarian Robert Cotton, as well as the treasures of the royal manuscript collections. The flames from a fireplace had caught on the wooden mantelpiece and spread to the wainscoting. Hapless librarians were throwing water on the blaze; the city fire engines were nowhere to be seen. Eventually Mr Casley, the deputy librarian, dashed out of the building cradling the <i>Codex Alexandrinus</i>, a fifth-century Greek Bible. Others remained, throwing books out of the windows as fast as they could. The next day, with Ashburnham in ruins, boys from Westminster School were picking up charred manuscript fragments as souvenirs.</p>\n<p>There were almost a thousand manuscripts in the collection, organised into a series of ‘presses’ or shelving units, each one taking its name from the bust of a Roman emperor that stood on top. Vitellius A.xv, the only copy of <i>Beowulf</i>, was scorched and damaged. Otho A.xii, a unique exemplar of the Old English poem <i>The Battle of Maldon</i>, was completely destroyed. Another volume pressed with Otho, an eighth-century Northumbrian Gospel, was mostly gone; the cataloguers remarked hopefully that ‘Some Pieces of the Leaves of this old Book are preserv’d.’ In many cases, the fat from the lambskin vellum had been drawn out by the heat, so that the pages were roasted in their own juices. One unsalvageable codex, in the words of a modern librarian, resembles ‘an irradiated armadillo’. Though conservation efforts succeeded with a good number of the manuscripts, about a fifth of the collection was deemed to have been ‘lost, burned, or entirely spoiled’.</p>\n<p>None of the manuscripts in the Nero press was harmed. Among them was the most mysterious volume of medieval English literature. Cotton Nero A.x is a small miracle: a quarto volume, about the size of a paperback, consisting of just 92 leaves. It contains four untitled English poems – 20th-century editors named them <i>Pearl</i>, <i>Cleanness</i>, <i>Patience</i> and <i>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</i> – written in the alliterative style in a dialect of the West Midlands. The first and last of these poems are among the greatest poetic works written in Middle English. The author is unknown, the patron is unknown, the original owners of the manuscript are unknown. All we do know is that Cotton acquired the volume from another antiquary, Henry Savile, in the late 16th century. It contains twelve bizarre illustrations, added by another anonymous individual some time after the texts were completed. The Pearl Manuscript, as it is usually called, is the only surviving anthology of alliterative poetry, and the sole exemplar of the poems it contains.</p>\n<p>There is no getting around the weirdness. We don’t really know what it is or what it was for. In his new study of the manuscript, Arthur Bahr embraces the mystery, spiritedly chasing after a book that will never let us catch up. He suggests that it is ‘a pedagogical compilation’, cleverly designed to provoke readers into reflecting on the limits and possibilities of meaning-making itself. It is not ineffable but ‘supereffable’, proliferating interpretations over the centuries. He has spent years wrestling with the damn thing and is still deeply in love with it: the book is dedicated ‘to the makers of the Pearl Manuscript’.</p>\n<p>In <i>Pearl</i>, the narrator is beset with grief for a two-year-old child, his precious Pearl (the Latin for ‘pearl’ is <i>margarita</i>, leading many commentators to assume that the child’s name was Margery or Margaret). He can’t even bring himself to say that she was his daughter, just that she was closer ‘than aunt or niece’. He is obsessed with his loss and has come to visit her grave. ‘Allas! I leste hyr in on erbere [a grassy plot]/My privy perle withouten spotte.’ The burial mound is covered with aromatic flowers and he can’t avoid the thought that their sweet scents have sprung from her mouldering body. Overcome by sadness and the odours of the flowers, he falls into a reverie, waking to find himself in paradise. There, just across a stream, he spies a beautiful girl: ‘I knew hyr wel, I hade sen hyr ere.’ He is overcome with joy at seeing his Pearl again, but feels more intensely than ever the pain of their remaining apart. The maiden rebukes him on both counts: he can’t stay in paradise, and in any case, he is foolish for grieving something so fleeting as human life, compared to the everlasting joy of heaven.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v47/n17/tom-johnson/supereffable\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Like​ the Wallace Collection in London, the Frick began life as a family house. In 1915, Henry Clay Frick bequeathed his Beaux-Arts limestone mansion on Fifth Avenue, along with its contents, to the city of New York. The Frick opened to the public as a museum in 1935, sixteen years after Frick’s death at the age of 69, and four years after that of his wife, Adelaide, at the age of 71. Although the museum’s holdings have nearly doubled in the decades since (partly through purchases but mainly through gifts), few public collections are so imbued with the taste and personality of a single individual.</p>\n<p>Frick was determined to acquire nothing but the finest surviving works by the best artists and he amassed significant pieces by Holbein, Bronzino, Bellini, Titian, Veronese, El Greco, Bruegel, Van Dyck, Rembrandt, Vermeer, Hogarth, Reynolds, Gainsborough, Turner, Manet, Degas and Whistler. He wasn’t just a collector of paintings, however, and left substantial holdings of drawings, Italian Renaissance bronzes, Limoges enamels and Meissen porcelain, among other objects.</p>\n<p>The record-breaking prices he paid for many of the works in the collection often made the front page of the <i>New York Times</i>. In 1911, he spent $475,000 on a portrait of Philip IV by Velázquez. But, as Frick noted to a fellow industrialist in 1895, the year he began collecting in earnest, there was ‘more real pleasure’ to be derived from buying works of art than from anything else outside of business: ‘It seems to me better to have a certain amount of such things than the same value in bonds in the Safe Deposit Company, as you can draw your dividend daily.’</p>\n<p>Frick was born in rural western Pennsylvania in 1849 and started his coking business at the age of 21. By thirty, he had made his first million and was living in Pittsburgh, a prosperous and fast-growing city characterised in an <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> article from 1868 as ‘hell with the lid off’, due to the clouds of soot that billowed from the smokestacks of its many factories. How and where Frick first encountered art is unclear. But paintings – or perhaps, in the first instance, prints and reproductions – seem to have attracted him from a young age. When, in the early 1870s, Frick applied for a loan from a Pittsburgh bank, the partner who authorised it noted in his report: ‘Maybe a little too enthusiastic about pictures but not enough to hurt; knows his business down to the ground; advise making loan.’</p>\n<p>Frick’s earliest known painting purchases date from 1881, the year he married Adelaide Howard Childs. He acquired a landscape by the French-born, Pittsburgh-based George Hetzel (1826-99) and a genre piece by Luis Jiménez Aranda (1845-1928) depicting fashionable ladies distracted by a nude statue in the Louvre. His decision to buy the Aranda (now in the Frick Pittsburgh, the museum’s sister institution) may have been sparked by his first visit to Europe, undertaken the previous year with Andrew Mellon, who would go on to form another of the great American art collections of the early 20th century.</p>\n<p>If Frick’s trip to Europe opened his eyes to the possibilities of collecting, so, too, did his purchase in 1884 or 1885 of <i>Mr Vanderbilt’s House and Collection</i>: an illustrated account of the mansion erected on Fifth Avenue, between 51st and 52nd Streets, by William H. Vanderbilt, then the richest man in America. Known as the Triple Palace, the Vanderbilt mansion included a three-storey art gallery (measuring 28 by 36 feet and more than 35 feet high), which was lit during the day by skylights and at night by 169 gas jets. Shortly thereafter Frick acquired a set of twenty satin photogravure reproductions of paintings in Vanderbilt’s collection. These he hung on the walls of Clayton, the comparatively modest Italianate house he had bought in Point Breeze, eight miles east of Pittsburgh.</p>\n<p>The mid-1890s marked a turning point in Frick’s collecting. In 1895 alone, he bought 25 paintings from Knoedler and other (mainly New York-based) dealers, spending nearly $80,000 on new acquisitions. Clayton was running out of wall space and Frick – perhaps inspired by Vanderbilt’s example – seems to have considered building an extension that would take the form of an art gallery, though he ultimately rejected the idea. Dealers, often from Knoedler (which, thanks chiefly to Frick’s patronage, opened a branch in Pittsburgh in 1897), now started accompanying the family on what had become regular expeditions to Europe. Over time, Frick gravitated from the work of 19th-century artists – such as the French landscape painters of the Barbizon School, whose works were much sought after by Pittsburgh’s smart set – to Old Masters. On one or more trips to Europe in the early 1900s, he visited the Wallace Collection, which had been bequeathed to the nation in 1897 and opened as a public art museum three years later.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v47/n17/elizabeth-goldring/at-the-frick\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>One​ morning in early spring, I dreamed about Brian Eno’s head. It was night-time in a deserted garden centre. At the entrance a sign proclaimed: ‘Twenty Thousand Brian Enos!’ Row upon row, little plant-pot bulbs of his smiling face, pegged out to the horizon. There was transparent sheeting as a guard against the frost, played about by a shimmer of soft artificial lights. What was this? Was it Art? Nature? Some kind of installation? And what did all those identical Enos <i>smell</i> like?</p>\n<p>Eno has haunted me for more than fifty years, ever since I first saw Roxy Music on <i>Top of the Pops</i> in 1972 playing – what’s her name? – ‘Virginia Plain’, the band’s first single, released two days before my 13th birthday. There are few enough of my teenage heroes still alive and working, never mind any who retain the ability to surprise and provoke; or really annoy, for that matter. Eno is a conundrum: impish disruptor and happy polymath, he can also be a bit of a tech prig lecturing us from on high, dropping serene apothegms that turn out on closer inspection to be vanishingly banal. It’s as if there are two of him: Brian has a great sense of humour, Eno can be suffocatingly precious; Brian picks a brilliant selection of <i>Desert Island Discs</i>, Eno nominates for his beach read Richard Rorty’s <i>Contingency, Irony and Solidarity</i>; Brian is all weird eros, Eno makes music that can be oddly clenched or wafty; Brian is inspiringly playful, Eno writes software to systematise (and cage, and kill) that playfulness.</p>\n<p>Now aged 77, the two of them together make an almost venerable figure – recall his brief cameo in the last episode of <i>Father Ted</i> as ‘Father Brian Eno’ – and unlikely national treasure. At his best, Eno is a model of how to inhabit this role with verve and mischief; at other times you may wonder how exactly he went from playing Cornelius Cardew to producing Coldplay, and what had to be left out to achieve such a grand synthesis, or so disquieting a compromise.</p>\n<p>He was born in 1948 and grew up in a small Suffolk backwater. This was a world closer to the 19th century than it was to our own dully fractious era. No global hullabaloo of youth culture: impossible to imagine Altamont or Live Aid, Michael Jackson on the Thames, Bono cold calling George Bush mid-gig, Katy Perry in orbit. No personal touchscreen beckoning itchy fingers. Just gazing dreamily into the distance or cycling about aimlessly on long summer afternoons. Boredom and its cloud-drift antidotes. Boredom as something almost erotic.</p>\n<p>Eno’s young life was lived between flat countryside and the beckoning sea, but he had other horizons too: Catholicism (he attended the Convent School of Jesus and Mary in Ipswich and his confirmation name was St Jean-Baptiste de la Salle); imported American music (hymn-like doo-wop, carnal R’n’B); and the spare modernism of Piet Mondrian, to which he was introduced by his uncle Carl (Mondrian, notice, not Picasso or Bacon or Pollock). There was also a family friend with an eclectic record collection, and Eno fell especially hard for the Ray Conniff Singers and their ‘lush, soft, silky quality’. Muzak raptures! US cool entwined with European abstraction, brash spontaneity folded into systematic grids: everything here is a seed.</p>\n<p>Eno’s male relatives were happy tinkerers, bricoleurs, amateur musicians – modest, helpful, community-minded. Uncle Carl painted landscapes, repaired porcelain, gardened. One grandfather ‘built and repaired church organs, mechanical pianos, music boxes and hurdy-gurdies’, David Sheppard records in his biography of Eno, <i>On Some Faraway Beach</i> (2008). Eno’s father, William, was a postman who repaired clocks and watches for pennies. Eno came of age at a time when you could still get a decent higher education without taking on crippling debt. The future members of Roxy Music, born into working or lower-middle-class families, would metamorphose into literate exquisites, seriously arty poseurs, in a way previously unthinkable. As happy beneficiaries of postwar social mobility, Eno later recalled, they each brought with them different experiences and different sensibilities. Pop music was part of it. Kids from housing estates took their music into the art colleges, and it came back out with a fresh vigour and shot through with a lot of new ideas.</p>\n<p>Bryan Ferry was taught by Richard Hamilton, whose mentor was Marcel Duchamp. Pop art took the capital of popular culture and reinvested it; pop culture took Pop art as its exemplar and reapplied it: a marvellous feedback loop. ‘Virginia Plain’ was based on one of Ferry’s own paintings: ‘It was a watercolour or a painting on paper. It was just like a surreal drawing of a giant cigarette packet with a pin-up girl on it.’ This was a different model of what modern art might encompass. Who made it, who judged it, who was excited by it. What it might look or feel or sound like.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v47/n17/ian-penman/infinite-wibble\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Whenever Britain​ is about to bomb another country, or is openly considering it, an old video will start doing the rounds on social media. It’s a clip a couple of minutes long from a speech by Tony Benn in the House of Commons in 1998, back in the distant days of New Labour, of which he was a frequent critic. Tony Blair’s government was seeking parliamentary approval to ‘use all necessary means’ against Iraq, which for years had been accused by Britain and its allies of developing weapons of mass destruction. Benn did not believe the situation justified a military response. ‘War is easy to talk about,’ he said.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>There are not many people left of the generation which remembers it … I was in London during the Blitz in 1940, living [in Westminster] … Every night, I went to the shelter in Thames House. Every morning, I saw docklands burning. Five hundred people were killed in Westminster one night by a landmine. It was terrifying. Are not Arabs and Iraqis terrified? Do not Arab and Iraqi women weep when their children die? Does not bombing strengthen their determination? What fools we are to live as if war is a computer game for our children or just an interesting little Channel 4 News item. Every Member of Parliament who votes for the government motion will be consciously and deliberately accepting responsibility for the deaths of innocent people.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>These are standard enough anti-war arguments, but the speech is still remembered because of the intensity and economy with which Benn delivered them, the resonant historical reference, rhetorical gear changes and repetitions, and the personal element. His appearance and manner in the clip also have an effect. Wearing a black waistcoat under a grey suit, silver hair immaculately smoothed and parted, one hand slashing the air faster and faster as he speaks, the then 73-year-old Benn seems like a symbol of political principle transported from a bygone era.</p>\n<p>He was born a hundred years ago – an anniversary this pithy collection of speeches, letters, articles, book extracts and pamphlets celebrates – and died in 2014. By then, he had long since been regarded by most journalists, fellow politicians and voters not as a feared and loathed disruptor but as a cosier figure, a dissident with no real power who wore a cardigan, smoked a pipe and liked a mug of tea. An MP for almost fifty years, a minister in four governments, a smooth centre-left prodigy in the 1960s, a prickly middle-aged radical in the 1970s and 1980s, and someone who abandoned Westminster, in 2001, for full-time activism and protest, Benn lived a very full political life. Yet there is a sense in which he died too soon. A year later, his protégé Jeremy Corbyn – who is sitting just behind him in the video of the Iraq speech – was elected Labour leader. The year after that came the vote for Brexit, one of Benn’s longstanding causes. With these two shocks British politics burst open, releasing such forces and ideas as populism, protectionism and nationalisation, which Benn had advocated, almost alone, for much of his career. Meanwhile, other forces that had often defeated or frustrated him, such as free-market Conservatism and Labour centrism, fell into a decline from which they have yet to emerge.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, Benn is both remembered with reverence and increasingly forgotten. Once charged political words such as ‘Bennite’ and ‘Wedgie’ (a nickname, usually derisive, taken from Wedgwood, which was part of Benn’s surname before his move to the left) are likely to get a blank look from most people under the age of fifty. What exactly was his significance? He was certainly an unusually clear analyst and critic of the distribution of power in Britain. ‘We live in a strange country,’ he said in his final Commons speech, in 2001. By that he meant a country where power is often hidden, expressed in code or euphemism, or slyly shifted from one section of the establishment to another. ‘Although the person of the monarch has no political power,’ he writes in the opening piece in this collection, one of many letters about politics he wrote to his grandchildren, ‘the Crown has great powers and these … are exercised in practice by the prime minister.’ Another piece summarises the political influence of Britain’s oversized financial sector: ‘The judgments of financiers and City bankers on economic issues are … adopted as an established orthodoxy rather than as reflecting a particular interest.’ Another sums up the British constitution as an ‘untidy and developing collection of compromises, the consequence of sullen responses to pressure’. These compromises, he warns, are often only temporary: ‘When powerful and undemocratic groups are forced to retreat, they wait for the time when they can regain their superiority.’</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v47/n17/andy-beckett/almost-alone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>It​ was immediately clear when Martha, my 13-year-old daughter, died of septic shock that serious errors had been made. She died at Great Ormond Street Hospital, where a last-ditch attempt to save her proved futile, but the mistakes were made at King’s College Hospital in South London, where she had been treated over the previous five weeks. Before my wife, Merope, and I left Great Ormond Street early in the morning on Tuesday, 31 August 2021, the consultant in charge of Martha told us he had been alarmed by her condition when she arrived and wasn’t prepared to sign a death certificate. In such situations, the case is reported to a coroner and a postmortem arranged.</p>\n<p>Nine hours earlier, Merope and I had been in the ambulance that sped north through the city to GOSH. I held Martha’s head in my hands; her eyes were taped shut, her body was swollen and discoloured. Now we took a taxi back to King’s to pick up possessions from her cubicle on Rays of Sunshine ward – presents she’d been given, her pyjamas, her books. They were already in plastic bags in the office; another child was in the cubicle. The nurses asked us how Martha was and were shaken when we told them she was dead.</p>\n<p>A couple of days later we spoke on the phone to one of the consultants at King’s. ‘This was a totally preventable death,’ Merope said. ‘I don’t disagree,’ he replied. On 7 September we received a call from the clinical director of child health at King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, a paediatric consultant who hadn’t been involved in Martha’s treatment. He had attended a ‘rapid review’ meeting at which her death was discussed, and told us it warranted a ‘Serious Incident investigation: red level’ – the highest category. The purpose of such an investigation is to establish causes and contributory factors, and to recommend improvements. (NHS England provides a list of ‘serious incidents’; at the top is ‘unexpected or avoidable death’.)</p>\n<p>At the end of July, Martha, completely healthy and riding a bike on a family trail near a beach, had skidded on sand, fallen and lacerated her pancreas: she landed with force on the end of the handlebar and her pancreas was pushed against her spine. It is a nasty injury, but far from unknown in children, and is treated in hospital by liver specialists: she was taken to King’s because it has one of the three paediatric liver units in England, and is in London, where we live. Children with pancreatic trauma have been referred there for decades from all over the country; the director of child health told us that no other paediatric patient on record had died of the injury at King’s. We asked him why she was the exception, and he spoke of missed ‘opportunities to intervene … There were signs.’ He acknowledged that Merope and I hadn’t been listened to when we told staff we were concerned that Martha’s condition was deteriorating. ‘I am truly sorry,’ he said. Lessons would be learned. He told us the Serious Incident (SI) investigation would give us answers, but afterwards it was open to us to take the matter further, to the General Medical Council (which considers individual doctors’ fitness to practise) and the Care Quality Commission (which inspects, and occasionally prosecutes, hospitals). There was, he went on, ‘a full set of escalations’ we could make. Welcome to my last four years.</p>\n<p>At the time, I paid little attention to what he said about escalations. I was in a stupefied state, and remained so for many weeks. I grasped that an unthinkable injustice had been done to my daughter, but had no thoughts about the possible consequences for the hospital or the doctors involved. What I wanted was a detailed explanation of what had happened to her. The director of child health told us that the SI investigation wouldn’t ‘gloss over anything’. ‘We will share everything with you,’ he said. It didn’t end up that way. Much of the work to get a full explanation would be mine.</p>\n<p>During the nearly five weeks Martha spent in hospital, I had never once conceived of the possibility of her death. The doctors assumed she would recover and the question on ward rounds was how many weeks of school she might miss. She was in pain, but was visited by friends, watched TV and played video games. Rays of Sunshine was never hectic or a place of chaos with beds in corridors: the nurses told me it was well-funded and prestigious. We knew that the paediatric liver service at King’s was the largest in Europe and that the trust publicised it as ‘world class’; Martha seemed to be in safe hands. The most serious consequence we had in our minds was that she might become diabetic, but the doctors said her treatment would almost certainly avoid that.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v47/n17/paul-laity/after-martha\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Reform UK​ held its first conference in October 2021. The party was polling in the low single digits. Only a few hundred people turned up. Richard Tice, who had replaced Nigel Farage as leader seven months earlier, had chosen to hold the event on the same day – and in the same city, Manchester – as the Conservative Party Conference. He hired a battle bus with a sound system to drive past the Tory event. But Reform hadn’t factored in traffic restrictions. ‘Lots of the roads were shut off. We got stuck down this narrow side street,’ Adam Wood, a Reform activist, recalled. ‘The police weren’t too happy with us.’</p>\n<p>Wood, a business development manager from Rotherham who joined Ukip aged eighteen, stood for Reform in local elections in Yorkshire in May 2022. He got 89 votes. In the Wakefield by-election the following month, Reform received less than 2 per cent of the vote. ‘There were only five of us working on that,’ Wood told me. ‘A lot of us were clamouring for Nigel to come back. We knew we could never do what we wanted without him.’ As we spoke outside the main auditorium at Reform’s conference earlier this month, three middle-aged men walked past. All were wearing turquoise Reform-branded football strips with the same name on the back: Farage. He’s number 10. The playmaker.</p>\n<p>Reform has just four MPs but the party has dominated the political narrative since last year’s general election. It is now consistently polling at around 30 per cent, well ahead of Labour. In May’s local elections, Reform won 677 seats, two mayoralties and outright control of ten councils. More than five thousand people bought tickets to the conference at Birmingham’s National Exhibition Centre, a cavernous space tacked onto the city’s international airport. The ‘momentous event’ had many familiar trappings: a busy fringe programme, a smattering of business sponsors, ambitious young men in sharp suits. But it also felt different from any party conference I’d attended before. The queue that snaked around the conference perimeter on the first morning had a giddy, almost nervous energy. It was overwhelmingly, if not exclusively, white. The biggest constituency, men in jeans and T-shirts, wouldn’t have looked out of place at one of the rock concerts advertised on the NEC’s hoardings.</p>\n<p>Inside the main hall, the queue for the bar was already twenty people deep at 10.30 a.m. Senior executives stayed away but a phalanx of lobbyists and VIPs milled around the Heathrow Airport Lounge. JCB, the construction equipment manufacturer and longstanding Conservative donor, had brought its latest model, the Pothole Pro digger. A cranky campaign group opposing Covid vaccines had a stand. The most prominent display in the hall was selling gold bullion. A photograph of a beaming Farage loomed over it: ‘Protect your wealth in uncertain times.’ Last year, Direct Bullion paid Farage £280,000 to record a handful of promotional ads that ran on GB News. Nearby a firm was selling cryptocurrency. Another stand selling gold gave me a chocolate coin and an invitation to ‘explore the opportunity’. The co-owner, a burly white Zimbabwean, told me gold was ideal for hiding money ‘from the prying eyes of banks’. When I said I was a journalist he quickly started talking about Know Your Customer checks. ‘We take compliance very seriously,’ he assured me.</p>\n<p>Lee, an IT contractor from Kent, had taken the day off work to come to his first party conference. He had been out the night before, drinking with a right-wing vlogger he had met online. The former prime-time comedian Jim Davidson was at the same bar. ‘Reform does the best parties,’ Lee told me. He used to vote Conservative but ‘never Ukip’. So why Reform? ‘Immigration. It’s out of control.’ He was heading to his first fringe event of the day, on ‘securing the borders’. I tagged along. On a makeshift stage, James Frayne, a Conservative strategist, was explaining to a full house that Reform’s stance on immigration aligns with public attitudes. In recent YouGov polling, 38 per cent of respondents rated Reform ‘best at handling asylum and immigration’. Voters, Frayne said, were ‘coming round’ to the idea of leaving the European Convention on Human Rights and introducing caps on immigrant numbers, but Reform’s language ‘needed to be more careful’. Frayne’s fellow panellists were not exactly circumspect: a feverish <i>Telegraph</i> journalist called the BBC ‘the belly of the beast’ and rejoiced that ‘things that might have been impossible to discuss a year ago are now being discussed by the man who will be our next prime minister.’ Matthew Goodwin, a presenter on GB News, read off a litany of violent crimes committed by asylum seekers and implored the audience to ‘take back your country’, promising to ‘weaponise these issues all day long’. It was time to ‘start putting the security of the British people and our children first’. Lee, sitting a few rows from the front, was nodding along furiously.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v47/n17/peter-geoghegan/short-cuts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The​ sociologist Monika Krause, in her book <i>Model Cases</i> (2021), shows that social scientists have tended to base their concepts and theories on a surprisingly limited range of shared empirical instances. Images of the modern metropolis, for example, have been excessively shaped by studies of Chicago and Berlin. Political theories of populism have been heavily indebted to cases in Latin America, in particular Argentina. The sociology of work developed as a study of car manufacturing. And our thinking about professions relies on the examples of doctors and lawyers. Krause doesn’t seek to challenge this partiality (the natural sciences also use ‘privileged material research objects’, such as fruit flies) but to understand what it tells us about the practices and knowledge claims of the social sciences.</p>\n<p>Political economists, too, have their model cases, in particular the crisis of the 1970s, which involved the end of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates, the demise of full employment as an aim of economic policy and the turn towards conservative and neoliberal arguments in favour of tax cuts and financial deregulation. In the space of a decade, one worldview was seemingly discredited and another took its place. While historians may baulk at the tidy chronology, the idea that there was during this period a paradigm shift in capitalist regulation has proved seductive, and scholars in many fields have busied themselves describing how the ideological wheel turned. An enormous amount of attention has been paid to the intellectuals and ideas of the New Right, which thrived in the 1970s; the New York City debt crisis of 1975, which afforded an early glimpse of the neoliberal world to come; the decline of Fordist methods of mass production and the rise of superior just-in-time rivals; the industrial disputes that came to a head; and so on.</p>\n<p>There is another, less obvious, reason that the crisis of the 1970s appeals to academics: the story of ideological regime change grants a prominent role to academics themselves. The economic model that was abandoned in the crisis is usually referred to as ‘Keynesian’. Keynes himself could be described as a ‘model case’ member of the liberal elite (in a non-pejorative sense of the term), a man whose moral, intellectual and cultural passions drove him to rethink the basic principles of economic policy. The paradigm that succeeded Keynesianism was scarcely less scholarly in its provenance. Many of the intellectuals who forged the political economy of Thatcher and Reagan were also tenured academics, first in Vienna, Freiburg and London, and later in Chicago and Virginia. Its most visible representative, Milton Friedman, may have been a media polemicist and fearsome debater, but his academic credentials were impeccable. And while think tanks, foundations and business lobbies played their role, scientific credibility and respectability were vital as the new ideas gained ground, especially when it came to influencing the technocrats at the World Bank, the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and central banks.</p>\n<p>The model case of the 1970s played a significant role in interpretations of the 2008 global financial crisis and its aftermath, especially on the intellectual left, which has often longed for a crisis in which fresh ideas might get a hearing. Over the last fifteen years, I’ve lost count of the number of calls I’ve heard for a ‘Mont Pelerin of the left’, a reference to the international network first convened in 1947 by Friedrich Hayek to lay down the intellectual building blocks of a neoliberal future (the Mont Pelerin Society still meets to this day). Hayek had in turn been influenced by the example of the decidedly elitist Fabian Society, which aimed to put advanced social science in the service of social engineering. The most ambitious recent attempt to overturn Hayek’s legacy was made by the Hewlett Foundation, which pledged $20 million in 2018 and a further $50 million in 2020 to research projects, largely based at US universities, engaged in mapping out a post-neoliberal future. This was one response to the shock of the first Trump victory in 2016, which brought home the need to tackle the economic, social and political decay that was eating the US from within.</p>\n<p>It seemed to liberals that Trumpism arrived in 2016 without any intellectual backing or much of a policy script. Trump, like Brexit, was treated as a symptom of sustained economic dysfunction rather than the harbinger of a new future. The subsequent fiscal largesse of the Biden administration, partly influenced by the intellectual fruits of the Hewlett investments and heavily watered down by deal-making in Congress, was an attempt to draw a line under both neoliberalism and its apparent Trumpian death rattle. But the second Trump administration has destroyed such illusions, not only because of Trump’s own extraordinary political tenacity and reach, but because of the wealth of ideas that accompanied his revival. The notorious 900-page Project 2025 document, produced by the Heritage Foundation, collated the ideas of 350 conservative thinkers and 45 organisations to create the outline of a vision and a plan for the second Trump term.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v47/n17/william-davies/repeal-the-20th-century\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Three of​ Rachel Ruysch’s paintings feature pineapples. In <i>Still Life of Exotic Flowers on a Marble Ledge</i> (<i>c</i>.1735), the fruit is hidden in a chaotic mass of stems and blooms, easy to miss behind an immense white flower head. In <i>A Still Life with Devil’s Trumpet Flowers, Peonies, Hibiscus, Passion Flowers and Other Plants in a Brown Stoneware Vase</i> (1700), you can see it clearly in the centre of the bouquet, its dark green leaves lit up and framed like a halo by the addition of a curved stalk at either side. You have to look twice to realise it’s floating in mid-air, supported by nothing sturdier than the stems and heads of the flowers beneath. Ruysch’s pyramidal bouquets often require some suspension of disbelief. The vases never seem large enough for the splendid, voluminous arrangements that loom over them. But a balancing act composed of flowers – lightweight, long-stemmed, delicate – is one thing; putting a pineapple in there is another. How would the fruit not topple the whole thing over? What would happen to the fragile-looking butterfly circling the base?</p>\n<p>Ruysch was a meticulous observer of nature, an artist whose insects seem real enough to buzz out of their frames. But her most innovative compositions have an unlikely aspect, a touch of the improbability that comes from throwing lilies and cabbage roses together with fruit from halfway around the world. The retrospective organised by the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, and currently at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston (until 7 December), locates her work in a specific intellectual milieu. Her father, the anatomist and botanist Frederik Ruysch, taught at the Hortus Medicus in Amsterdam, one of the largest collections of rare and exotic plants in Europe. The garden boasted specimens shipped from the Dutch colonies: pineapples from Brazil, prickly pear cacti from Curaçao, banana trees and jasmine from Suriname. A network of enthusiastic horticulturalists grew up around it, competing with one another to cultivate the most difficult species on their estates. As a young woman in the 1680s and 1690s, Ruysch was exposed to their collections, as well as those of local entomologists and herpetologists. One of her early influences, the painter Otto Marseus van Schrieck, known for his moody pictures of plants, worms and reptiles writhing on the forest floor, was nicknamed <i>Snuffelaer</i>, ‘the sniffer’, because of his fascination with what went on in the undergrowth.</p>\n<p>Ruysch’s work was distinctive in the world of flower painting because it absorbed and projected this knowledge. According to the art historian Marianne Berardi, she wanted to impart ‘something about <i>the nature of the nature</i> she was painting’. Her only picture that doesn’t primarily feature flowers or fruit is of a fat Surinam toad, a creature much studied by contemporary scientific societies for its curious reproductive process. Ruysch painted a female of the species with three little toadlets popping out of its back. In her still lifes of the 1690s, she incorporated many rare, non-native plant species, deviations from the roll-call of roses, poppies, peonies and lilies. Her <i>Still Life with Cactus in a Blue Vase</i> (1690-95) is cool-toned, with petals in shades of white, blue, mint green and greyish purple (no conventional pinks in sight). Its focal point is a white devil’s trumpet, native to Mexico, which Ruysch crowns with a corkscrewing, blue-tinged snail vine from Brazil. Beneath the devil’s trumpet is an African pumpkin from Sri Lanka, slit open to reveal large glossy red seeds; above, extending diagonally into the top-left corner, is a three-armed Mexican cactus, its fine, tapering prickles just visible against the dark ground.</p>\n<p>In the 17th century, flower painting could serve a variety of ends. The still lifes of Ruysch’s teacher, Willem van Aelst, in which expensive-looking vases are arrayed next to gold pocket watches on silk ribbons, were designed to flatter the social aspirations of their buyers. Maria van Oosterwijck, before Ruysch the most celebrated female practitioner of the genre, painted a <i>Vanitas Still Life</i> (1668) in which the flowers, some withering and collapsing, are flanked by a skull, an hourglass and a manuscript with the title <i>REKENINGH</i> (‘Reckoning’). It’s like being smacked over the head with your own mortality. There was an uneasy need to make flowers stand for something or risk being frivolously decorative: lilies for chastity, sunflowers for devotion to God, and so on.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v47/n17/clare-bucknell/on-rachel-ruysch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>There’s​ a phenomenon, perhaps magnified in the internet era, of an otherwise serious artist earning enduring notoriety for the stupidest thing they ever did. Alec Guinness was embarrassed by his turn in <i>Star Wars</i>; Luciano Pavarotti is popularly identified with his smarmy easy-listening trio. Sometimes I fear that Elmore Leonard, the American crime writer with more than forty novels to his name, will end up being most powerfully associated with his ‘rules for writing’. Published as a slim book in 2007, they’re usually read in an abbreviated form excerpted in the <i>Guardian</i>. The rules don’t really tell you how to write a good book and have probably led to more than a few bad ones. They encourage a specific kind of minimalist approach (‘If it sounds like writing, I rewrite it’), and tend, in rarefied writing circles, to inspire indignant counter-examples rather than praise. They also give the incorrect impression that Leonard was a hack, the kind of writer you’d be happy to watch a film or television adaptation of, but wouldn’t waste time actually reading.</p>\n<p>It used to be hard to avoid reading Leonard. In the 1980s, he was a staple of the supermarket checkout line and you could count on finding a few paperbacks at any holiday rental. I don’t think there’s anyone on today’s bestseller lists as accomplished on the page as he was; he had the extraordinary ability to evoke a place with the sparsest of descriptions and fill in a character with just a few lines of dialogue or a seemingly inconsequential gesture. He did more with less than any crime writer I can think of. In other words, though his ten rules aren’t particularly instructive if you aren’t him, they provide an insight into the creative process of a stylist who exhibited the kind of sentence-level mastery you rarely see paired with the nuts-and-bolts rudiments of plot and action.</p>\n<p> Penguin recently added three of Leonard’s novels to their Modern Classics: Crime and Espionage series, with several others set to follow. The initial trio – <i>Swag</i> (1976), <i>The Switch</i> (1978) and <i>Rum Punch</i> (1992) – are all very enjoyable and give the uninitiated reader a taste of Leonard’s style, characters and preoccupations. I will complain about the covers, however. The simple elegance and familiar livery of Penguin’s paperbacks are meant, I’m sure, to reassure the doubtful reader that Important People have approved of these books – in this case, we get tasteful monochrome images of a gun, a martini and a sack of cash. But I miss the brash ugliness of Leonard’s US editions, particularly Delacorte Press’s offerings from the 1990s, with their gigantic dayglo text (Gill Sans Condensed Ultra Bold, baby!) that hints at the maximalist style and big talk of the characters within.</p>\n<p><i>Swag</i> is the earliest of these three novels and one of the first that Leonard set in contemporary America (most of his previous books were Westerns). A couple of ne’er-do-well playboys embark on a crime spree through greater Detroit and live high on the hog until a job goes wrong. Frank J. Ryan is a used-car salesman. Ernest Stickley is a petty criminal. They meet (or, more precisely, meet cute) when Stick tries to swipe a Camaro off Frank’s lot. A week later, Frank sees Stick again in a police line-up and decides he likes the cut of his jib. He tells the cops that Stick wasn’t the guy, and when Stick is freed they team up.</p>\n<p> This plot summary makes <i>Swag</i> sound like a meat-and-potatoes series of crime capers, but it’s far better than that. The trick of the novel is that it’s as much romance as crime. Frank and Stick’s partnership is presented as a hasty marriage; we watch them fall for each other, commit hard and make alarming discoveries about each other from inside the extreme intimacy of a stick-up duo. Just a few pages into the book, the two are already reflecting on their meeting like impulsive newlyweds. It’s funny, Stick says, how sometimes you get lucky:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>‘It is funny,’ Frank Ryan said. ‘You want to get a drink or something?’</p>\n      <p>‘I wouldn’t mind it. I was in that Wayne County jail six days and six nights … I guess that’s when you were deciding I wasn’t the guy after all.’</p>\n      <p>‘You were the guy,’ Frank said.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>They get drunk and end up in a motel together. ‘Where’d you sleep?’ Frank asks in the bleary morning. Stick, Queequeg to Frank’s Ishmael, replies: ‘Right there in bed with you … but I swear I never touched you.’</p>\n<p>Frank’s got a notion: when it comes to armed robbery, only fools get caught. Like his author, he has ten rules, and as long as he and Stick adhere to them, they’ll be golden: be polite, say as little as possible, never call your partner by name, dress well, never use your own car, never count the take in the car, never flash money, don’t go back to an old bar, don’t tell anyone your business, avoid associating with known criminals. For Frank and Stick, the rules are a recipe for riches; for the reader, they are a menu of mistakes the duo are inevitably going to make.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v47/n17/j.-robert-lennon/never-use-your-own-car\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Together, these trends demonstrate a broader confusion and lack of engagement from the mass market. </p><p>This trend fundamentally means that users will most likely “play it safe” with Web2 applications rather than risk experimenting on Web3. It’s this barrier that slows Web3 adoption. Innovators cannot rely solely on the benefits of Web3 but instead must engage with the existing infrastructure if they hope to draw in a wider audience. </p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/heres-how-hybrid-blockchain-solutions-bridge-the-gap-between-web2-and-web3?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" title=\"null\"><em><strong>Here’s how hybrid blockchain solutions bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3</strong></em></a></p><h2>The Web3 scaffold </h2><p>Collaboration between Web2 and Web3 is already happening, primarily driven by Web2 providers. In finance, giants like PayPal, Visa and major banks are integrating crypto and blockchain services, legitimizing them for the mass market. Beyond finance, Amazon Web Services has launched Web3 labs, and Google Cloud is working with zero-knowledge proofs, weaving Web3 into traditional offerings.</p><p>While Web2 applications are pushing for a middle ground, Web3 developers can and should be doing the same, leveraging Web2’s established market to scale faster. Just as 4G supported the rollout of 5G, Web2 processes can help build better Web3 apps.</p><h2>Looking at this in practice</h2><p>Web3 developers can balance decentralization with the convenience users expect from Web2 by prioritizing accessibility, from sleek UX to human-readable names. They should also recognize how their products could benefit Web2 organizations. </p><p>Too often, Web3 enthusiasts assume their approach’s superiority is obvious, avoiding the work of explaining why it is better. This risks alienating users instead of winning them over. Demonstrating practical advantages through engagement with Web2 offerings can help bridge the gap between both sectors.</p><p>A clear example is the synergy between AI and blockchain. If every piece of data used to train an AI model were immutably tracked on blockchain, whether original or frontier data, its origin, usage and outcomes could be verified instantly, eliminating such disputes. </p><p>Fundamentally, a good idea will deliver whether it is a Web3 application or not. </p><p>Demonstrating this value — even if it means engaging with Web2 sectors — will enhance the legitimacy of the tool and gain greater attention from the mass market.</p><h2>Engaging to innovate</h2><p>While it may feel uncomfortable to lean into Web2 to establish a greater trust in a Web3 tool, the benefits are undeniable. Bringing any form of technology to the mass market can generate a range of issues, including day-one bugs or scaling challenges. Research from Nielsen shows that usability testing with real-world users can improve a product’s success rate by up to <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://blogs.psico-smart.com/blog-what-role-does-user-feedback-play-in-improving-training-and-development-management-software-123637\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"null\">500%</a>. In this way, getting Web2 users to dip their toes into Web3 applications will mean a greater end product.</p><p>Debates over “Web2 vs. Web3” may grab attention, but successful companies rarely define themselves by the label. They are AI firms, financial institutions, consumer platforms and data companies, using whatever tools best serve their market. No customer wakes up wanting to use “a Web3 app”; they want better banking, smarter AI or more useful platforms. </p><p>The winners will be those quietly using Web3 to solve real problems, not chasing purity points.</p><p>Working with Web2 expands the user base, creating more opportunities to test, iterate and improve. Web3’s passionate community has yet to reach mass-market appeal, and achieving that means embracing Web2 processes, habits and infrastructure that have shaped technology adoption for decades.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Richard Johnson, chief operating officer of Data Guardians Network.</strong></em></p><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\" type=\"\">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The indicator shared by Glassnode is the “Long/Short Bias,” which measures the net amount of positions that large traders have currently opened.</p>\n    <p>When the value of this indicator is positive, it means the long positions outnumber the short ones. Such a trend implies the majority of the traders hold a bullish sentiment. On the other hand, the metric being under the zero mark implies more BTC positions are betting on a bearish outcome for the cryptocurrency.</p>\n    <p>Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Long/Short Bias over the past month:</p>\n    <blockquote>The value of the metric appears to have been negative in recent weeks | Source:<a href=\"\">Glassnode on X</a></blockquote>\n    <p>As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Long/Short Bias has been negative for a while now, suggesting short positions have been the more dominant side of the market.</p>\n    <p>Interestingly, this hasn’t changed despite the price recovery that BTC has seen since the start of this month. At present, short positions still outweigh bullish bets by 485 BTC (worth around $56.2 million).</p>\n    <p>Historically, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have tended to move in the direction that goes contrary to the crowd’s expectation, so the dominance of bearish sentiment in the derivatives market may not be such a bad thing.</p>\n    <p>In another X <a href=\"https://x.com/glassnode/status/1969034739819389267\">thread</a>, Glassnode has discussed about some metrics related to the Bitcoin Options market. First of these is the<a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoins-implied-volatility-craters-after-bears-fire-warning-shot/\"> Implied Volatility (IV)</a>, which measures the future volatility expectation of the Options traders.</p>\n    <p>In particular, the version of the metric that’s of interest here is the “At-The-Money” (ATM) one, which only shows this expectation for the traders with a strike price close to the current BTC spot value.</p>\n    <p>Below is a chart that shows the trend in this indicator across the major tenors for Bitcoin over the last few weeks.</p>\n    <blockquote>Looks like the 1 week IV has seen the most change recently | Source:<a href=\"\">Glassnode on X</a></blockquote>\n    <p>From the graph, it’s apparent that the 1-week Bitcoin ATM IV rose ahead of the <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/binance-adds-2b-stablecoin-one-day-fomc-speculation/\">Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)</a> meeting, but then plunged after the Fed announced its decision. Longer expiry timeframes displayed no particular reaction to the event.</p>\n    <p>Another gauge for Options market volatility expectations is the IV Index (DVOL), which aggregates the IV across strike prices and tenors.</p>\n    <blockquote>The trend in the BTC DVOL over the last few weeks | Source:<a href=\"\">Glassnode on X</a></blockquote>\n    <p>“Post-FOMC, DVOL dropped back, confirming the market is not pricing any sharp move in the near term,” notes Glassnode.</p>\n    <h2>BTC Price</h2>\n    <p>Bitcoin made recovery toward $117,900 earlier, but it seems the coin has faced a retrace as its price has dropped back to $116,000.</p>\n    <blockquote>The price of the coin seems to have moved flat over the last five days | Source:<a href=\"\">BTCUSDT on TradingView</a></blockquote>\n    <graphic src=\"https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/safe.png\"/>\n    <p><strong>Editorial Process</strong>for bitcoinist is centered on delivering thoroughly researched, accurate, and unbiased content.

This is the perfect opportunity for dip hunters like Strategy to capitalize on the contraction in preparation for October 29.</p>\n    <p>The combination between the optimism linked to the coming rate cuts and growing institutional Bitcoin hoarding should pump $BTC to a new ATH by the end of October.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://bitcoinist.care/box_27fa54a2abe6756ee07f7504e1c69615?referrer=economist-predicts-alt-season-and-more-rate-cuts-bitcoin-hyper-next-crypto-to-explode\">Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER)</a> $17.1M presale will likely contribute to that as it aims for a Q4 public launch.</p>\n    <h2>How Will Bitcoin Behave in the Coming Months?</h2>\n    <p>It’s extremely likely that Bitcoin will enter a bullish phase come mid-October, likely followed by a modest contraction before the next pump. That’s a near certainty based on the asset’s recent performance ahead of the FOMC meeting.</p>\n    <p>And it makes sense.</p>\n    <p>Cryptocurrencies benefit a lot from Fed’s rate cuts, which decrease the investors confidence in traditional assets like bonds and stocks and turn their gaze to the next big thing: risk-on assets like cryptos. This explains why Bitcoin soared following the Fed’s positive decision.</p>\n    <p>The crashout that followed was nothing more than the result of opportunistic cashouts, with the dumps pushing the price down.

However, the agency, which is intended to be a five-person, bipartisan commission, is down to only acting Chairman Caroline Pham, who is also expected to depart from the agency once a permanent leader is appointed.</p>\n    <p>With the personnel shortage and Quintenz confirmation stalling, it has been difficult to carry out critical agency business, previous reports claim. “Turmoil continues as the agency’s responsibilities, and the potential market risks, are multiplying,” Bloomberg <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/cftc-launches-next-phase-crypto-sprint-initiative/\">stated</a> in August.</p>\n    <p>At the time, a White House spokesperson denied that there’s chaos at the agency, affirming that “President Trump has made it a priority to make America the crypto capital of the world, and in doing so has called for the revitalization of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to play a larger role in securing this promise.”</p>\n    <h2>Quintenz-Winklevoss Clash Stalls CFTC Leadership</h2>\n    <p>The CFTC has been in leadership limbo since July, after the US Senate Agriculture Committee delayed the vote on President Trump’s nominee days before the August recess. Reports claimed that the committee stalled Quintenz’s confirmation process following a request from the White House.</p>\n    <p>The request came after Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/nasdaq-set-to-invest-50-million-in-gemini-ipo/\">Gemini</a> co-founders, allegedly pressed President Trump to reconsider Quintenz’s nomination, arguing that he wouldn’t “shake up the CFTC enough” and was not aligned with Trump’s agenda.</p>\n    <p>In August, a group of crypto organizations sent a letter to the US President in support of the CFTC chair candidate. They highlighted Quintenz’s extensive experience in the private sector and his knowledge and foresight in digital asset regulation.</p>\n    <p>“Mr. Quintenz is uniquely prepared to lead the CFTC in establishing fair, transparent, and trusted markets that will safeguard America’s leadership in digital assets,” the letter affirmed, emphasizing that installing a permanent leader is “absolutely critical” to achieve the Commission’s goals and accomplish Trump’s crypto mission.</p>\n    <p>Last week, Quintenz seemingly confirmed the rumors after sharing private messages with the Winklevoss twins. He suggested the US president “might have been misled” by the crypto exchange co-founders, which led to the delay.</p>\n    <p>As <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-feud-cftc-nominee-accuse-tyler-winklevoss/\">reported</a> by Bitcoinist, Tyler Winklevoss asked Quintenz’s opinion on the crypto exchange’s 13-page complaint letter, which raised multiple concerns and complaints about the CFTC’s Division of Enforcement (DOE) conduct against the crypto exchange over the years. However, Winklevoss was ultimately “disappointed and surprised” with the CFTC nominee response.</p>\n    <p>“It’s my understanding that after this exchange, they contacted the President and asked that my confirmation be paused for reasons other than what is reflected in these texts,” Quintenz wrote on X.</p>\n    <p>Ultimately, he pledged to continue to support Trump’s vision “in whatever capacity” he can, as “protecting the President and his agenda are more important than any job.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/BTCUSDT_2025-09-19_10-31-40.png?w=980&amp;resize=980%2C564\" alt=\"crypto, bitcoin, btc, btcusdt\"/>\n    </p>\n    <blockquote>Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $116,313 in the one-week chart.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>Crypto history has shown that early believers in the right projects can transform small investments into fortunes. Think back to those who picked up Binance Coin before it became a household name or Solana before its explosive breakout. Now, the same conversation is happening around BlockchainFX (BFX), a project that has already raised more than $7.6M in presale and is being tipped as the next big crypto with life-changing potential.</p><p>Unlike speculative tokens with little more than hype, BlockchainFX is already live in beta, operating as a true trading super app. With a foundation that connects crypto with traditional financial markets, it’s offering early investors a chance to secure tokens before the next price jump, and possibly the next Binance-style success story.</p><h2><strong>BlockchainFX: Built for a New Era of Trading</strong></h2>\n\n<p>What sets <a href=\"https://blockchainfx.com/?utm_source=Blockonomi&amp;utm_medium=Could+BlockchainFX+Be+the+Next+Big+Crypto+Coin+That+Turns+%24250+Into+%24100%2C000%3F&amp;utm_campaign=Blockonomi&amp;utm_id=Blockonomi\">BlockchainFX</a> apart is its ability to merge two worlds that were once separate. While exchanges like Binance and Coinbase dominate crypto, they remain limited to digital assets. BlockchainFX goes further, giving traders the ability to manage crypto, stocks, forex, and ETFs all from one decentralized platform. This means users can profit in both bullish and bearish markets, a flexibility few other platforms provide.</p><p>Security is another core advantage. With multiple third-party audits, full KYC verification, and smart contracts already validated, BlockchainFX has positioned itself as a trusted platform rather than a risky experiment. For investors, that peace of mind matters, especially in a presale market where transparency is often missing. Early adoption of the app also tells its own story: thousands of traders are already using it daily, showing demand is real and growing.</p><h3><strong>How $250 Becomes $100,000</strong></h3>\n<p>Here’s where things get exciting for investors running the numbers. At the current presale price of $0.024, a $250 entry secures just over 10,400 BFX tokens. By using the promo code <strong>BLOCK30</strong>, allocations increase by 30%, raising the total to around 13,500 tokens. When BlockchainFX lists at its launch price of $0.05, those tokens would already be worth about $677, nearly tripling the initial stake before the token even hits exchanges.</p><p>But that’s only the beginning. Analysts are forecasting an early post-launch rally toward the $1 mark, which would push those same tokens to a value of roughly $13,500. That alone represents a return of more than 50x from the starting investment. Looking further out, if BlockchainFX climbs to $8, a figure aligned with analyst predictions for its long-term growth, the portfolio value would cross $108,000. At $10, it soars past $135,000. This is how a modest $250 could realistically transform into six figures, echoing the kind of gains that early Binance Coin holders once experienced.</p><p>To add even more incentive, anyone purchasing $100 or more of BFX automatically qualifies for the project’s <a href=\"https://gleam.io/OR72Q/blockchainfx-500000-giveaway\">$500,000 Gleam giveaway</a>, giving early participants not only token exposure but also the chance to win significant bonus rewards.</p><h2><strong>Why Timing Matters</strong></h2>\n<p>Presales are structured to reward those who act quickly, and BlockchainFX is no different. Each stage brings a higher price, meaning that hesitation results in fewer tokens for the same amount invested. With more than 10,000 participants already on board and the $8M soft cap about to be crossed, demand is accelerating. For those watching closely, this may be one of the final chances to buy in at ground level before the market drives valuations much higher.</p><p>The story of Binance Coin shows exactly how early entry makes the difference between small profits and life-changing wealth. BlockchainFX is positioning itself as the modern equivalent – only this time, investors have the chance to be early while the token is still trading below three cents.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion: The Best Crypto Presale Right Now</strong></h2>\n<p>Based on the latest data, <a href=\"https://blockchainfx.com/?utm_source=Blockonomi&amp;utm_medium=Could+BlockchainFX+Be+the+Next+Big+Crypto+Coin+That+Turns+%24250+Into+%24100%2C000%3F&amp;utm_campaign=Blockonomi&amp;utm_id=Blockonomi\">BlockchainFX</a> isn’t just another presale – it’s the best crypto presale currently live and one of the strongest candidates for the title of next big crypto.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Bitcoin (BTC) trading near $117,000 and Ethereum (ETH) around $5,000 have created an uncomfortable truth for many retail investors: entering these giants now requires a serious amount of capital. While both remain pillars of the market, the reality is that smaller portfolios often struggle to capture meaningful upside from these high-priced crypto coins. That is why analysts are turning attention to <a href=\"https://mk.mutuum.com/giftl\">Mutuum Finance (MUTM)</a>, a presale-stage altcoin that combines utility, security, and affordability in a way that larger assets no longer can.</p>\n    <h3>Affordable Entry Point with Strong Foundations</h3>\n    <p>Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, where tokens are available at $0.035. Over $16 million has been raised so far, with more than 16,450 holders and 44% of the 170 million tokens in this stage already sold. Once the presale enters Phase 7, the price will increase by 15% to $0.040, meaning time is running short for those wanting to secure tokens at this lower entry point. For anyone working with a $3,000 budget, that affordability makes a big difference.</p>\n    <p>At the heart of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized finance protocol introducing a stablecoin pegged at $1. The stablecoin will only be minted when users borrow against collateral, such as ETH, and it will be burned when loans are repaid or liquidated. This design links supply directly to platform activity rather than speculation. Governance will oversee borrowing rates to help maintain the peg: lowering them if the stablecoin trades above $1 and raising them if it trades below. Arbitrage by traders will further support stability, while automatic liquidation systems will ensure that the platform remains solvent under stress.</p>\n    <p>Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also built to encourage both lending and borrowing. Lenders deposit assets like stablecoins or major tokens into liquidity pools and receive mtTokens in return. These mtTokens represent their share plus accrued interest. Users will be able to stake mtTokens to earn MUTM rewards, while the platform itself will use its revenues to buy MUTM tokens back from the open market and redistribute them to stakers. That cycle ties platform growth directly to value flow for the community.</p>\n    <p>Price accuracy will be ensured through Chainlink oracle feeds, with fallback oracles and decentralized exchange data serving as additional layers of protection. For a system that relies on collateral valuations and liquidations, these features are essential. They help prevent mispricing and strengthen the overall trust investors place in the protocol.</p>\n    <p>The presale has already delivered strong returns for early entrants. An investor in Phase 1 at $0.01 has seen a 250% increase by Phase 6 at $0.035 on paper. With the presale listing price planned at $0.06, that same allocation reflects an unrealized sixfold gain. Entering today with $3,000 at $0.035 secures 85,700 MUTM tokens. By the time the presale reaches $0.06, this would already reflect a value of $5,150 — a 70% increase before wider market exposure begins. For investors priced out of BTC and ETH, those numbers highlight why analysts are looking closely at MUTM.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image2-50.png\" alt=\"Mutuum\"/>\n    </p>\n    <h3>Roadmap, Security, and Analyst Confidence</h3>\n    <p>Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s development is being guided by a structured four-phase roadmap. The initial phase has already launched the presale, marketing campaigns, audits, and community outreach. The next phase will focus on smart contract development, front-end user interfaces, and infrastructure setup. Following that, Phase 3 will include beta testing on testnet, final audits, regulatory alignment, and presale conclusion. The final phase will deliver the live platform, exchange listings, multi-chain expansion, institutional partnerships, and ongoing feature upgrades.</p>\n    <p>Security has been prioritized from the start. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is undergoing a CertiK audit using both manual review and static analysis, with a Token Scan Score of 90 and a Skynet Score of 79. The timeline was first requested in February 2025 and revised in May 2025, reflecting the team’s attention to thorough review. Alongside this, a $50,000 bug bounty program has been introduced to encourage community reporting of vulnerabilities, with rewards of up to $2,000 for critical findings. To energize community engagement, a <a href=\"https://gleam.io/WQak2/mutuum-finance-100k-giveaway\">$100,000 giveaway</a> is also live, offering ten winners $10,000 each in MUTM tokens.</p>\n    <h3>Final Words</h3>\n    <p>These initiatives have already built a following of more than 12,000 across social platforms, giving the project both credibility and momentum. Analysts reviewing crypto predictions and crypto charts are highlighting Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as an emerging ecosystem that aligns real-world lending and borrowing mechanics with long-term token value growth.</p>\n    <p>For investors evaluating where to place a $3,000 budget, the difference between entering BTC or ETH and MUTM is striking. While the majors are now high-barrier plays, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a presale entry with substantial upside, a structured roadmap, stablecoin innovation, and a staking-plus-buyback model that will reward engaged users. That mix is why experts say Mutuum Finance (MUTM) may well be the best crypto to invest in right now for those seeking accessible but powerful growth potential.</p>\n    <p>For more information about Mutuum Finance (MUTM) visit the links below:</p>\n    <p>Website: <a href=\"https://www.mutuum.com\">https://www.mutuum.com</a></p>\n    <p>Linktree: <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/mutuumfinance\">https://linktr.ee/mutuumfinance</a></p>\n    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>This is a Press Release provided by a third party who is responsible for the content.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The spotlight is back on Cardano, one of the most closely watched projects in the crypto space. ADA continues to generate buzz with ecosystem upgrades, even as its price consolidates. While long-term holders remain patient, many investors are also eyeing PayFi newcomer <a href=\"https://remittix.io/?utm_source=Blocknomi&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=141\">Remittix (RTX)</a>, which is shaping up as a breakout story of 2025.</p>\n    <p>With its presale crossing $26M and wallet testing already live, RTX represents the kind of utility-focused innovation that could shift market attention.</p>\n    <h2>Cardano News Today: Price Action and Ecosystem Progress</h2>\n    <p>After weeks of sideways action, <a href=\"https://x.com/rssbit/status/1969039170325639487?s=46\">Cardano</a> trades in the $0.90 range. Support is holding near $0.82, while resistance at $0.95 remains a key barrier. Analysts say a clean move above $1.00 could open the door to $1.15–$1.20 in the short term.</p>\n    <p>In order to increase transaction speeds and overall efficiency, Cardano developers are still pushing for Mithril enhancements and Hydra scalability. In order to maintain ADA’s standing as one of the top long-term cryptocurrency investment options, the Cardano Foundation has significantly increased its emphasis on decentralized governance.</p>\n    <p>Yet, ADA’s slow price movement compared to other top cryptos to buy now has led some traders to diversify into newer tokens with faster growth potential. That’s where Remittix comes in.</p>\n    <h2>Remittix: A Fresh Take On PayFi Innovation</h2>\n    <p><a href=\"https://remittix.io/?utm_source=Blocknomi&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=141\">Remittix (RTX)</a> isn’t trying to outcompete ADA’s smart contract network. Instead, it’s focused on a completely different sector: PayFi. The project aims to move money seamlessly across borders, connecting crypto wallets with traditional banks. Unlike many presales that exist only on paper, Remittix has already started wallet beta testing, allowing early community members to try out its features firsthand.</p>\n    <p>This week, RTX also made headlines as the best pre-launch token on CertiK Skynet, with the team fully verified by blockchain’s top auditor. Its presale has soared past $26M, showing investors are buying into the idea and execution.</p>\n    <p>Why Remittix is standing out:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>$26M+ raised as presale demand keeps accelerating</li>\n      <li>Wallet beta testing gives users real-world access ahead of launch</li>\n      <li>Officially verified by CertiK, boosting trust across global investors</li>\n      <li>Ranked #1 Pre-Launch Token on CertiK Skynet</li>\n      <li>15% USDT referral program offering daily rewards to promoters</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>What makes <a href=\"https://remittix.io/?utm_source=Blocknomi&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=141\">Remittix (RTX)</a> unique is the combination of payments-first utility and incentives. By targeting the $19 trillion remittance market with crypto-to-bank transfers, it appeals not just to crypto natives but also to freelancers, businesses, and families sending money globally.</p>\n    <p>Add in a referral program that pays instantly in USDT, and RTX is creating a new layer of engagement that feels fresh compared to the usual presale pitch.</p>\n    <h2>Cardano Holds Its Ground, But Remittix Redefines What Early Crypto Adoption Can Look Like</h2>\n    <p>The latest Cardano news confirms the network continues to deliver on tech, but ADA’s price is still moving at a cautious pace. Remittix, meanwhile, is blending innovation, security, and community growth into one package that has quickly raised over $26M.</p>\n    <p>ADA offers stability and proven tech for investors deciding where to put their money in September, while RTX provides momentum and a chance to ride PayFi’s breakout wave.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Discover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their project here:</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Website: </strong>\n      <strong>https://remittix.io/</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Socials: </strong>\n      <strong>https://linktr.ee/remittix</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>$250,000 Giveaway: </strong>\n      <strong>https://gleam.io/competitions/nz84L-250000-remittix-giveaway</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>This is a Press Release provided by a third party who is responsible for the content.

That means early buyers are doubling before listings even go live. If you’re searching for the best crypto presale to buy now, BlockchainFX is shaping up as the rare mix of utility, passive income, and guaranteed upside that could turn a small entry into life-changing returns.</p><p><strong>👉 Secure your $BFX today before the next presale price increase shuts out early buyers.</strong></p><h2><strong>BlockchainFX Presale News: Why $BFX Is the Best Presale Crypto 2025</strong></h2>\n\n\n<p>BlockchainFX isn’t just another new crypto presale 2025—it’s a revenue-generating trading super app that merges crypto, stocks, forex, and ETFs in one place. With over 10,000 daily users, the platform has already processed millions in trading volume. That’s why analysts call it the best token presale 2025—because it’s backed by utility, not hype.</p><p>Key highlights that make $BFX stand out:</p><ul><li>Presale price $0.024; confirmed launch price $0.05.</li><li>Over $7.7 million raised from 10,000+ participants.</li><li>70% of trading fees redistributed to holders in USDT.</li><li>Daily rewards of 4–7% and APYs close to 90%.</li><li>Exclusive Visa cards (Gold, Green, Metal) to spend crypto globally.</li><li>A <a href=\"https://blockchainfx.com/win-500?utm_source=Blockonomi&amp;utm_medium=Avalanche+ETF+Buzz+and+BlockchainFX+Presale+Mania+Put+Two+Best+Cryptos+to+Buy+Now+in+Focus+for+2025&amp;utm_campaign=Blockonomi&amp;utm_id=Blockonomi\">$500,000 giveaway</a>with prizes up to $250,000 in BFX tokens.</li></ul><p>Real-world ROI scenario: A $5,000 buy now equals ~270,000 tokens with the BLOCK30 bonus. At $0.05 launch, that’s $13,500. If $BFX hits $1 long term, that grows into $270,000. That’s why it’s trending as a millionaire-making presale and possibly the next crypto to explode in 2025.</p><p><strong>👉 Don’t wait—this is the best crypto presale project 2025 still under $1. Grab $BFX today.</strong></p><h2><strong>Avalanche (AVAX) Price News Today: Is It Still an Altcoin Undervalued in 2025?</strong></h2>\n<p>Avalanche (AVAX) is showing strong signs of a breakout in September 2025. The price surged 33% from $28 support to $34, breaking past key resistance at $32.50. If momentum holds, analysts expect short-term targets of $36–$50. Institutional demand is growing, with Avalanche Foundation working toward a $1 billion treasury and ETF talks heating up.</p><p>This makes AVAX a solid long-term crypto investment, but here’s the catch: much of that growth is already priced in. For buyers hunting the next 100x crypto or the best crypto under $1, Avalanche no longer fits the bill. BlockchainFX, however, is still in its presale stage, offering guaranteed launch upside, crypto passive income, and the chance at explosive 1000x returns that AVAX can no longer provide.</p><p><strong>👉 If you regret missing AVAX under $10, don’t repeat history—buy $BFX before it leaves the presale zone.</strong></p><h2><strong>BlockchainFX vs Avalanche: Which Is the Best Crypto to Buy Now for 2025?</strong></h2>\n<table><row span=\"5\"><cell><i>Project</i></cell>\n<cell><i>Current Price / Presale</i></cell>\n<cell><i>Launch Forecast</i></cell>\n<cell><i>Long-Term Target</i></cell>\n<cell><i>Key Features</i></cell>\n</row><row span=\"5\"><cell><i>BlockchainFX (BFX)</i></cell>\n<cell>$0.024 presale</cell><cell>$0.05 confirmed launch</cell><cell>$0.10–$0.25 short-term, $1+ long-term</cell><cell>70% fee rewards, 90% APY, Visa cards, global trading, $500K giveaway</cell></row><row><cell><i>Avalanche (AVAX)</i></cell>\n<cell>$34 market price</cell><cell>N/A</cell><cell>$36–$50 near-term</cell><cell>DeFi + NFT ecosystem, institutional growth, ETF speculation</cell></row></table><p>Analysis: Avalanche is strong but already established.

Avalanche is bullish, but its entry point is already high. BlockchainFX gives early adopters the kind of scarcity, urgency, and ROI upside that defined Ethereum and Solana’s early days. With a confirmed launch price of $0.05, daily passive income, global utility, and forecasts pointing to $1 and beyond, BFX checks every box for the best crypto presale 2025.</p><p>This is a millionaire-making presale that blends explosive growth, passive income, and real-world adoption. In a market full of hype, BlockchainFX is delivering actual results.

While ETH consolidates, Remittix has exploded into global headlines after raising over $26.1 million in September, setting new records and emerging as the fastest growing crypto of 2025.</p>\n    <p>Early investors are reporting referral rewards that outperform years of holding traditional DeFi tokens, with analysts dubbing RTX the <a href=\"https://remittix.io/?utm_source=Blocknomi&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=141\">“XRP 2.0 for payments”</a> and naming it the best crypto to buy now before mainstream adoption takes hold. Get all the latest news on Ethereum and Remittix below.</p>\n    <h2>Ethereum Latest News: Fusaka Upgrade to Unlock Modest Gains</h2>\n    <p>Ethereum developers are preparing the Fusaka hard fork for mainnet activation on December 3. The upgrade will implement twelve new proposals, expanding blob capacity from 6 to 15 at launch and then to 21 by January 2026.</p>\n    <p>Analysts expect ETH to climb<a href=\"https://x.com/evcawolfCZ/status/1968976834663493880\"> toward $5,200 </a>by the end of September, with potential highs near $5,460 in October as ETFs and layer-2 adoption drive inflows.</p>\n    <p>Yet Ethereum’s $546 billion market cap limits rapid percentage gains. Citi’s conservative year-end target of $4,300 reflects caution, while chart patterns suggest ETH could remain range-bound between $4,434 and $4,646 until the upgrade fully takes effect.</p>\n    <p>Long-term, the improvements strengthen Ethereum’s foundation, but they will not trigger the parabolic returns that retail investors are chasing.</p>\n    <h2>Remittix: The PayFi Breakthrough Delivering Immediate Utility</h2>\n    <p>Remittix is redefining the crypto landscape with utility-driven growth that few projects can match. After raising $26.1 million and selling more than 666 million tokens at around 10 cents, RTX is positioning itself as the ultimate early-stage investment in the $19 trillion payments industry.</p>\n    <p>The <a href=\"https://remittix.io/?utm_source=Blocknomi&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=141\">live beta wallet</a> is already running tests across more than 30 countries, enabling real crypto-to-bank transfers, while the 15% USDT referral program is generating viral adoption and daily income for holders.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>XRP price prediction chatter has intensified after fresh ETF headlines and a steady push back above the $3 zone. Analysts tracking Ripple expect a possible move toward four dollars if resistance levels give way and ETF flows broaden.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://remittix.io/?utm_source=Blocknomi&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=141\">Remittix (RTX)</a> enters this comparison as the so-called XRP 2.0, drawing interest from investors who want PayFi utility plus stronger upside potential at an early price point. In this match-up of Ripple versus XRP 2.0, the question is whether established liquidity or early-stage utility offers the better near-term growth path.</p>\n    <h2>Ripple Today and the XRP Price Prediction Setup</h2>\n    <p>XRP price has been buoyed by a friendlier backdrop for crypto funds. The SEC just approved generic listing standards that streamline how exchanges list commodity-based ETPs, a change that could ease the path for more crypto products that track assets like XRP.</p>\n    <p>Short-range forecasts published this week float a glide path around $3 with scope to $4 if momentum and flows improve into October.</p>\n    <h2>Remittix Versus Ripple in the XRP Price Prediction Lens</h2>\n    <p>Compared with Ripple, Remittix begins at a far lower starting price, which magnifies percentage returns if adoption clicks. That is why many referring to XRP 2.0 are pointing at Remittix when weighing the better investment today, alongside any XRP price prediction.</p>\n    <p>The <a href=\"https://remittix.io/?utm_source=Blocknomi&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=141\">Remittix</a> team is verified by CertiK and is ranked number one on the CertiK leaderboard for pre-launch tokens, which strengthens trust and due diligence claims. The beta wallet is live with community testing underway, signalling product progress rather than slide decks, as multiple roundups have highlighted in recent days.</p>\n    <p>Remittix has sold over 666 million tokens, the token price is $0.108, and the amount raised is over $26 million. Remittix also runs a 15% USDT referral reward that is claimable every 24 hours and a $250,000 giveaway, and it has secured two centralized exchange listings with a third in view.</p>\n    <p>Why investors tag Remittix as XRP 2.0 right now:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Audited by CertiK, built with trust and transparency</li>\n      <li>Mass market appeal beyond just the crypto crowd</li>\n      <li>Officially ranked #1 among pre-launch tokens</li>\n      <li>Deflationary tokenomics designed for long-term growth</li>\n      <li>Time-sensitive entry point before listings and parabolic growth</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Those strengths echo what many XRP holders want more of in the near term. The difference is that Remittix is earlier in its curve, so positive listings, wallet expansion, and referral flywheels can translate into larger percentage swings than a mature large cap like XRP, even if both benefit from the same PayFi narrative tailwinds.</p>\n    <h2>Where the better risk-reward may sit in an XRP Price Prediction market</h2>\n    <p>XRP price prediction remains constructive with a path toward $4 if resistance breaks and ETF inflows scale, and the regulatory shift on ETP standards supports that view. Remittix is being treated as XRP 2.0 because it pairs a payments utility with fresh incentives and visible product testing.</p>\n    <p>If the goal is a higher percentage upside from a smaller base, Remittix currently looks like the better investment to make today alongside a measured XRP allocation, with catalysts that match what traders seek when the PayFi theme takes centre stage.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Discover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their project here:</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Website: </strong>\n      <a href=\"https://remittix.io/?utm_source=Blocknomi&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=141\">https://remittix.io/</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Socials:</strong>\n      <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/remittix\"> https://linktr.ee/remittix</a>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>$250,000 Giveaway:</strong> <a href=\"https://gleam.io/competitions/nz84L-250000-remittix-giveaway\">https://gleam.io/competitions/nz84L-250000-remittix-giveaway</a></p>\n    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>This is a Press Release provided by a third party who is responsible for the content.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>As discussion regarding a likely XRP ETF listing continues, investor interest remains. If institutional inflows commence and regulatory clarity materializes, they expect Ripple to reach $5 in 2025. This renewed optimism is fueling interest not only in XRP, but also in altcoins with strong fundamentals and community-driven growth, including <a href=\"https://buy.magacoinfinance.com/gu9o\">MAGACOIN FINANCE</a> a breakout contender that’s quickly rising on analyst watchlists.</p>\n    <h2>XRP Price Outlook: Holding Key Levels</h2>\n    <p>According to analysts, the approval of an ETF, added to institutional adoption and retail momentum will push XRP to prices last seen during the 2021 bull cycle. This fresh optimism has also led to renewed interest in altcoins with robust fundamentals. According to market watchers, XRP has a technical setup that looks good. Prices are holding support levels around $2.30 while facing resistance near $2.65. If XRP can overcome this barrier with solid volume, the price will touch $5. Investors looking for growth opportunities are also taking notice of other top altcoins like the ADA and the SOL, which remain stable while the rest of the market undergoes consolidation.</p>\n    <h2>Rising Momentum Altcoin Spotlight</h2>\n    <p>While XRP dominates headlines, analysts are increasingly highlighting MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the most promising hidden gems for 2025. Unlike many meme coins that rely purely on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE combines scarcity-driven tokenomics with strong community adoption.</p>\n    <p>Its audited smart contract, capped supply, and absence of venture capital control have resonated with both retail and early institutional investors. Wallet activity is growing, repeat purchases are rising, and whale accumulation signals confidence in its long-term trajectory. These factors mirror early-stage patterns seen in other meme tokens that later achieved exponential growth.</p>\n    <p>MAGACOIN FINANCE is trending on social platforms and appearing in analyst watchlists as one of the undervalued picks of this cycle. Many traders now view it as a strategic diversification play alongside large-cap names like XRP, ADA, and Solana.</p>\n    <h2>ETF Buzz and Market Outlook</h2>\n    <p>News related to ETF continues to create conversation around XRP. If given the green light, this ETF will attract an influx of institutional investors, increasing liquidity and confidence. According to analysts, there will be an increase in trading, similar to those seen with previous ETFs or big regulations. Incorporating regulatory compliance and payment solutions case for sustained interest and investment in XRP’s use as compared to bitcoin.</p>\n    <p>XRP’s Performance Will Need To Be assessed With BTC And Broader Economic Conditions In Mind, Say Analysts. XRP has tracked Bitcoin fairly closely during major market moves for the last year. However, it is now a unique case in the ETF debate. So, it could see itself outperforming its peers during bullish news cycles.</p>\n    <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n    <p>XRP remains a top altcoin to watch as ETF speculation mounts and analysts believe its price could target $5 in 2025. While investors closely track XRP, early diversification into other accelerating best altcoins such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, provides your portfolio the opportunity to capture major early gains from a rapidly growing community and new investor momentum.</p>\n    <h4>To learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE, visit:</h4>\n    <p>Website:<a href=\"https://buy.magacoinfinance.com/gu9o\"> https://magacoinfinance.com\n</a>Twitter/X:</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://x.com/magacoinfinance\">https://x.com/magacoinfinance<br/>\n</a>Telegram:</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://t.me/magacoinfinance\">https://t.me/magacoinfinance</a>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>This is a Press Release provided by a third party who is responsible for the content.

Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are showing mixed short-term signals that analysts interpret to mean that both meme tokens may be worth watching closely for potential investment opportunities.</p>\n    <p>However, traders looking for maximum returns on investments are increasingly looking to <a href=\"https://remittix.io/?utm_source=Blocknomi&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=141\">Remittix</a>, an Ethereum PayFi solution, to deliver, thanks to its real-world utility and strong early-stage growth.</p>\n    <h2>Dogecoin Price Analysis: Support Holds But Resistance Looms</h2>\n    <p>Dogecoin is currently in a rising trend channel that analysts are suggesting could continue for the immediate short-term. Analysis with the RSI indicator confirms this by signalling that there could be more positive momentum on the horizon. Overall, market sentiment and momentum remain neutral, suggesting that the price might be about to break out either to the upside or below.</p>\n    <h2>Shiba Inu Outlook: Horizontal Channel Indicates Consolidation</h2>\n    <p>Shiba Inu continues to trade within a horizontal trend channel, with support near $12.08 and resistance at $14.01. Analysts predict that there is a high chance Shiba Inu might be about to break out of its consolidation and gain up to 16% price increase. In addition, volume analysis shows higher activity at price tops and lower activity at bottoms, which strengthens the likelihood of a directional move.</p>\n    <p>However, while bullish predictions about Shiba Inu remain, investors are looking for lower-priced tokens with more upward momentum and potential to deliver significant price gains.</p>\n    <h2>Investors Choose Remittix Ahead Of Shiba Inu And Dogecoin</h2>\n    <p><a href=\"https://remittix.io/?utm_source=Blocknomi&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=141\">Remittix</a> is a cross-border payment solution that is solving the international problem of asset transfers by seamlessly uniting crypto and fiat in one efficient system.

But while momentum builds, many SOL holders are diversifying into the PayFi market, led by <a href=\"https://remittix.io/?utm_source=Blocknomi&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=141\">Remittix (RTX)</a>.</p>\n    <p>With over $26M raised, confirmed exchange listings, and a live wallet beta, Remittix is becoming a top pick for investors seeking utility-driven growth alongside Solana’s rally.</p>\n    <h2>Solana Price Today Holds Strong After Symmetrical Triangle Breakout</h2>\n    <p>Solana is riding a bullish wave as the SOL price today trades near $245, only a step below the critical $250 resistance. After breaking out of a symmetrical triangle, momentum indicators like the MACD show sustained buying strength.</p>\n    <p>Analysts believe the Solana price prediction now points toward $294 in the short term, with a bullish extension possibly reaching $418 if volume keeps flowing.</p>\n    <p>On-chain signals confirm this outlook, with the Bull Bear Power and Chaikin Money Flow highlighting strong inflows and persistent demand. These metrics suggest confidence among investors is only growing.</p>\n    <p>The SOL price is also supported by an ascending triangle on the daily chart. This has reinforced the <a href=\"https://x.com/AltcoinGordon/status/1966397056458616906\">expectation of a breakout</a>. A decisive move above $252 could trigger the next big rally.</p>\n    <p>With Solana News focusing on expanding adoption and capital inflows, traders see a clear setup for more upside. While upside targets remain ambitious, cautious holders are also diversifying into PayFi projects like Remittix to capture long-term utility-driven growth.</p>\n    <h2>Investors Hedge Solana Gains With Real World PayFi Solutions</h2>\n    <p>While Solana continues to impress with strong gains, many investors are diversifying into PayFi projects like <a href=\"https://remittix.io/?utm_source=Blocknomi&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=141\">Remittix (RTX)</a>, which is building momentum fast. Unlike speculative tokens, Remittix offers a practical solution by converting crypto directly into fiat and depositing it into any bank account.</p>\n    <p>This seamless approach allows individuals and businesses to avoid delays, hidden costs, and banking red tape. With the <a href=\"https://remittix.io/?utm_source=Blocknomi&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=141\">Remittix token</a> priced at $0.1080 and over $26M already raised, analysts argue it could rival Solana’s rise with its own explosive growth.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Remittix wallet beta testing is live with community access already underway</li>\n      <li>BitMart confirmed as the first CEX to list RTX after the $20M milestone</li>\n      <li>LBank announced another upcoming listing as Remittix surged past $22M raised</li>\n      <li>Referral program rewards users with 15% in USDT for every new buyer invited</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Backed by CertiK verification and ranked #1 for pre-launch tokens, Remittix isn’t just hype. It’s a functioning PayFi project addressing real-world needs. While SOL price predictions point to bullish extensions, many see RTX as the smart diversification play for those seeking utility-driven growth.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Discover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their project here:</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Website: </strong>\n      <strong>https://remittix.io/</strong>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Socials: </strong>\n      <strong>https://linktr.ee/remittix</strong>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>$250K Giveaway: </strong>\n      <strong>https://gleam.io/competitions/nz84L-250000-remittix-giveaway</strong>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>This is a Press Release provided by a third party who is responsible for the content.

    "body": "<p>Karen Leader, a tenured associate professor of Art History at Florida Atlantic University (FAU) in Boca Raton, has spent most of the last week afraid to leave her home, contending with a torrent of threats sent to her work email and left as voicemails.</p>\n<p>“I’ve never been afraid to go outside in my entire life,” Leader told <i>Hyperallergic </i>in an interview. “I wouldn’t wish this on anyone.” </p>\n<p>Leader, who also serves as the only faculty advisor to FAU’s College Democrats group, was placed on administrative leave by the university on September 13 over her social media posts criticizing Turning Point USA Founder and right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk’s political viewpoints. She is one of the reportedly<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/charlie-kirk-teachers-fired-social-media-posts-punished-free-speech-rcna227968\"> dozens</a> of educators across the country who have been reprimanded for their comments in the aftermath of Kirk’s assassination in Utah last week. This week, the American Association of University Professors expressed “<a href=\"https://www.aaup.org/news/academic-freedom-and-death-charlie-kirk\">great alarm</a>” over the wave of retaliation against faculty and students.</p>\n<p>FAU is a designated Hispanic-Serving public institution with an enrollment of approximately 31,000 students. It is the most ethnically diverse school in the Florida public university system, according to the FAU website.</p>\n<p>Leader’s posts in question, reviewed by <i>Hyperallergic</i>, were mostly reposts of other users’ comments about Kirk’s record of hateful statements, and did not specifically address or condone his death. Still, they<a href=\"https://x.com/jordylancaster/status/1966696458914021702\"> </a>were quickly <a href=\"https://x.com/jordylancaster/status/1966696458914021702\">targeted by right-wing individuals</a> on social media, who tagged the university.</p>\n<p>A letter from FAU’s Department of Visual Arts and Art History, obtained by <i>Hyperallergic</i>, notified Leader last Saturday that she would be placed on paid leave related to her social media conduct pending an investigation.</p>\n<p>“The University has received complaints, which gives us reason to believe that your continued presence on the job adversely affects university operations,” the letter, signed by the department chair, read. “The investigation will include a review of your conduct, including, but not limited to, your recent social media posts that the University reasonably believes might disrupt the efficient functioning of the University, and/or jeopardize the safety or welfare of other employees, colleagues, or students.”</p>\n<p>Leader denied that any of her posts jeopardized the safety of anyone on campus or espoused hate of any kind. She said her intentions were to counter dominant narratives that Kirk practiced politics with civility, a view espoused in a highly <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/news/as-the-far-right-rises-dont-be-ezra-klein\">criticized</a> opinion piece by Ezra Klein in the <i>New York Times</i>, among others.</p>\n<p>One of Leader’s posts, dated September 11, read, “The predictable ‘blame the professors’ narrative is full circle, Charlie ‘Professor Watchlist’ Kirk. Ruining lives for fun and profit.” The comment made reference to the ways in which Kirk’s organization Turning Point USA <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/sep/17/turning-point-usa-professor-watchlist\">targeted university professors</a> whose views it disagreed with.</p>\n<p>Leader also annotated a series of X posts from September 11 and 12, republishing them with the caption “This was Charlie Kirk.” The posts she recirculated critiqued Kirk’s anti-LBGTQ+ and racist comments. She reposted another post, which was later determined by X to be factually incorrect, claiming that Kirk had used an anti-Asian slur; Leader deleted it as soon as she learned it was inaccurate, she said.</p>\n<p>Another repost was of a comment by an X user with the name “I smoked Charlie Kirk.” Right-wing commenters interpreted this as an endorsement of Kirk’s death, but Leader said that the user frequently changes their name in a similar format to reflect “smoking” trending headlines.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t say anything or do anything that encouraged violence at all,” Leader told <i>Hyperallergic. </i>“I did not say or do anything that celebrated his death, that said he deserved it, that in any way, shape or form, condoned violence.”</p>\n<p>FAU did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p>\n<p>Leader highlighted in an interview with <i>Hyperallergic </i>that Turning Point USA caused fear among fellow academics. One professor Leader knows closely, whom she declined to name, landed on the organization’s “Professor Watchlist,” which targets professors that Turning Point claims “advance leftist propaganda.” Leader said her friend feared for their life when they were included. </p>\n<p>“Anyone who’s on that list knows that there still might be people coming into their class, literally to surveil them, signing up for their class to record them,” Leader told <i>Hyperallergic.</i></p>\n<p>The university issued a public statement on its X profile announcing the forced leave of an unnamed professor after FAU’s president became aware of “comments on social media made by a tenured faculty member regarding the assassination of Charlie Kirk.” Leader said she did not address the death of Kirk in her posts, and that she views the president’s statement as a “mischaracterization” of her actual social media activity.</p>\n<p>After right-wing accounts fixated attention on Leader’s posts, including Southern Poverty Law Center-designated extremist<a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/resources/extremist-files/chaya-raichik/\"> Chaya Raichik</a>‘s platform “LibsofTikTok,” Leader found posts revealing her home address and faculty email. She said she has filed reports with both FAU campus police and Boca Raton police. She has not heard from the administration since they sent her notice of administrative leave, she said.</p>\n<p>In recent weeks, Leader has become an increasingly prominent dissenting figure on campus. Over the summer break, the university<a href=\"https://m.fau.edu/u/device/large/news/detail?feed=university_press&amp;id=ac5a3482-dea8-509d-9e83-d36bc0ee9ab7\"> reportedly</a> signed an agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) through the<a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/identify-and-arrest/287g\"> 287(g) program</a>, a partnership that would allow federal agents and local police to detain or identify individuals for deportation on the FAU campus. Leader spoke at a student protest condemning the agreement days before Kirk’s assassination. </p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1043397/art-history-professor-placed-on-leave-over-charlie-kirk-posts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Clio Art Fair has been able to stay small after more than a decade in operation, but when you walk into the Chelsea art show, it doesn’t feel that way.</p>\n<p>The self-styled “<a href=\"https://www.clioartfair.com/\">anti-fair</a>,” which returned this week for the second of its two consecutive New York City fall editions through September 21, manages to fit 35 to 40 artists in the ground floor of 511 West 25th Street without feeling claustrophobic.</p>\n<p>That scale is important for Alessandro Berni, who founded the fair in 2014 to give artists outside the traditional art circuit — many of whom do not have the gallery representation required to participate in shows like Frieze or the Armory Show — an opportunity to exhibit their work during art fair season and make new connections with collectors and curators.</p>\n<p>“Clio was born to be small,” Berni told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “Traditional fairs are always too large for the visitor, whose eye eventually becomes tired and desensitized. Offering too many works to see in a single day damages the elective dialogue that should emerge between artwork and viewer.”</p>\n<p>That has proven to be a challenge as the fair has grown in popularity. This year, he received more than 500 submissions, almost double compared to previous years.</p>\n<p>In order to keep its size manageable while still allowing a mix of artists to show during the spring and fall art fair seasons, Berni split the fair into two editions held on separate weekends in May and September. He plans to continue that format into the future.</p>\n<p>But Berni said he won’t change the types of artists he includes in the fair, which is one of the few Manhattan art shows featuring independent artists. He also works to attract artists from around the world, which allows the fair to present works that have not been seen in the United States before.</p>\n<p>The lack of gallery representation keeps prices affordable. Artists pay a fee, roughly $1,500 or so, to participate, and have the option of hiring Berni’s <a href=\"https://www.alessandrobernigallery.com/\">gallery</a> as a dealer to take care of shipping and handling (in which case the gallery takes 20% of the sale). </p>\n<p>The fair’s intimate experience, where viewers come face to face with artists who are more than happy to explain their process and inspirations, contrasts with the impersonal nature of large-scale fairs filled with commercial galleries where dealers often act as intermediaries for the artists they represent.</p>\n<p>“Contemporary art, in recent years, has become an exclusive world, where artists are too often reduced to begging for elite approval,” Berni said. “We believe the great artist of the future will go underground, will remain clandestine, someone who creates because they obey an unshakable inner will. Success and wealth should count for nothing.”</p>\n<p>Fortunately, they still know how to party. At the opening of Clio’s first fall edition on September 4, artists from more than 20 countries, including Japan, Argentina, Taiwan, Greece, and Italy, milled about the floor as the public streamed inside.</p>\n<p>The fair has its share of longtime local artists, too. An Upper West Side mixed-media artist who gave her name as Pearl brought several photo collages she made of classic New York City architectural elements, like Art Deco detailing on buildings, vintage street signs, and shingled water towers.</p>\n<p>“My art is all about New York City architecture,” she said. “I walk around the city and see things that I like, which reminds me of old New York that people take for granted.”</p>\n<p>Next to her booth, New Jersey-based artist Margaret Koval displayed 11 eerie nighttime landscape scenes that she made by painting on the back of a linen canvas and extruding the oil paint through it. Her unique process references the pixellated reality of digital photography and the folksy charm of needlepoint images.</p>\n<p>“It takes on layers of meaning and optical effects,” she said. “I love doing paintings of people in urban spaces who are being surveilled.”</p>\n<p>In another corner, Williamsburg artist Nieves Saah shared two paintings of Hawaiian deities. One featured Pele, the goddess of volcanoes, fire, and wind, who is widely believed to punish tourists who pocket shards of basaltic rock when they visit the Big Island. “People take souvenirs, but then things happen to them so they mail them back to Hawaiʻi asking Pele to please forgive them,” she said. “You have to be respectful to nature and Hawaiʻi. The Goddess Pele is watching you.”</p>\n<p>Nearby, Lower East Side artist Marcus Glitteris flitted between conversations throughout the night, offering drinks and taking candid photographs before assembling everyone who participated in a group photo.</p>\n<p>It helped that his work, a large fabric collage featuring 44 Café Bustelo bags hand-sewn into two figures holding hands, was displayed prominently behind the bar. “What I like about Clio is it offers very good quality art at a very affordable price,” Glitteris said. (Prices at Clio range from $50 all the way to $150,000, according to the fair.) “And it’s entertaining.”</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1043499/clio-the-art-world-anti-fair-returns-to-nyc-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Despite its role as an experimental hub, mounting financial challenges in recent years have put the space at risk of closing. In an effort to keep the gallery running, Founder Bill Dunleavy is thinking outside the white cube, turning to alternative revenue models like crowdfunding to save the beloved space.</p>\n    <p>Superchief began as a magazine in New York in 2010 before transitioning into a <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/68621/guns-badasses-and-art/\">gallery</a> in Williamsburg two years later. In 2014, Dunleavy moved west, opening a Superchief branch in downtown LA. “By 2018, 2019, it felt like Superchief had really found its niche,” he told <i>Hyperallergic</i>.</p>\n    <p>That growing success took a hit in 2020, when a fire caused by an explosion in a neighboring building damaged the gallery and forced them to temporarily close. In 2022, Dunleavy and his team reopened Superchief in a 10,000-square-foot (~3,048-square-meter) warehouse in South LA, which allows them to mount ambitious exhibitions that draw hundreds of visitors. In addition to shows and performances, the space also hosts workshops, classes, and film screenings.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/GalleryFoosGoneWild-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/LUD7798-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>ontagious Culture Vol. 5</i>curated by Estevan Oriol and Bill Dunleavy, in 2025 (photo by Bill Dunleavy, courtesy Superchief Gallery)</p>\n    <p>The gallery has developed a strong following based on its dedication to “anti-elitist street culture,” as Dunleavy puts it, prioritizing artists and community over sheer profit. “My goal is to have an art space that gives a path to young people that don’t come from privileged backgrounds.”</p>\n    <p>Artist Isaac Psalm Escoto, also known as <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sickid1/\">Sickid</a>, who had his first solo show with Superchief in 2019, says he was drawn to the gallery for that democratic spirit. “It didn’t make you feel unwelcome or discriminated against based on your education,” he told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “As an artist developing my craft in my teens, there was no doubt in my mind it was where I wanted to see my work.” After working with Superchief for several years, Sickid had <a href=\"https://deitch.com/los-angeles/exhibitions/isaac-psalm-escoto-a-k-a-sickid-gas-station-dinner\">a solo show at Jeffrey Deitch Gallery</a> in 2024. “I’m very proud that he ended up with a solo at Deitch. I first showed him when he was 19 or 20 years old,” Dunleavy said.</p>\n    <p>Polo Cutty also began showing with Superchief in 2017, participating in the meme-driven group show <i>Peaches: A Black Internet Experience</i> before embarking on a multi-faceted art and media career. “Bill was the first person to reach out. I wanted to show in galleries, but I wasn’t used to that world,” the artist told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “Superchief is a big catalyst for artists who don’t necessarily see themselves showing in galleries. It’s such a necessity. It’s cool to have a space where you can really go all out, be real to yourself.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Creepygals1-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>HAUS OF DIVINE</i>in 2025 (photo by Ludwig Cesar Cortes, courtesy Superchief Gallery)</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/20230114_122638-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>CALIFORNIA COWBOYS</i>, co-curated with Luis Hernandez in 2022 (photo by Bill Dunleavy, courtesy Superchief Gallery)</p>\n    <p>Despite the popularity of Superchief among artists and visitors alike, Dunleavy says that art sales have been declining recently, as have corporate sponsorships. Although most of the work that the gallery sells is priced at $2,000 or less, its sales have been affected by the same market downturn that has <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/906097/behind-the-recent-wave-of-new-york-gallery-closures/\">shaken</a> blue-chip galleries. To supplement art sales, Superchief has relied on sponsorships from media, skateboarding, and beverage companies, which have shifted to other markets like music festivals, according to Dunleavy. </p>\n    <p>“A lot of people resonate with what we’re doing, but the business model needs to change in order to be viable,” he said. Although the gallery runs on a skeleton crew of Dunleavy plus two part-time employees, making rent has been a challenge lately. “We need to pivot away from a traditional business model and make a gallery that is more functional as a community space and an emerging artist incubation space.”</p>\n    <p>Earlier this year, Superchief launched a <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/Superchief\">Patreon</a>, offering supporters free access to ticketed events, art prints, digital publications, and merch, with plans for a podcast and video content. Dunleavy says this brings in roughly $5,000 per month from about 400 supporters. He added that it will offer stability in the long term but doesn’t address the need for more immediate funding, which led him to create a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/save-superchief-gallery-keep-las-home-for-underground-art\">GoFundMe</a> on September 3. So far, the campaign has raised just over half of its $6,500 goal. The gallery will also be hosting a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOe7yl7D-YZ/?img_index=1\">benefit show</a> tomorrow evening, September 20, featuring work by over 200 artists, including JJ Vilard, Erika Weitz, Ara Cho, Steve Gai, Will Carsola, and Creepygals.</p>\n    <p>“It’s time for the community to see the space as something important that exists in the now,” said Sickid, “rather than look back after it’s gone.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/FireReliefDrive2-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Foos Gone Wild</i>art exhibition in 2025.

Her daughter, Catherine Gund, confirmed her death to the <i>New York Times</i>. </p>\n    <p>A staunch social justice advocate and major art collector, Gund was known for her philanthropic endeavors that bolstered underrepresented artists and underserved communities. This work was keenly felt in New York City, where she founded the arts education nonprofit Studio in a School nearly five decades ago in response to dramatic budget cuts that basically eliminated art classes in the public school system at the time.</p>\n    <p>“I have always believed that every student has a fundamental right to quality art education,” Gund told <i>Hyperallergi</i>c earlier this year, during a <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/994466/new-exhibition-spotlights-nyc-high-school-artists/\">student exhibition</a> organized by the Studio Institute, an affiliate of Studio in a School.</p>\n    <p>Gund also gained attention for her efforts to end mass incarceration in the United States, evidenced through the <a href=\"https://artforjusticefund.org/\">Art for Justice Fund (A4J)</a> — a six-year initiative aimed at redressing socioeconomic inequalities in the criminal justice system that disproportionately affect young people and people of color. It was founded in 2017, when Gund notably sold Roy Lichtenstein’s 1962 work “Masterpiece” for $165 million to invest $100 million in the initiative — a move linking cultural patronage to social activism that is rarely seen in the art world. During its run, A4J disbursed more than $127 million to more than 200 artists, activists, and organizations aligned with ending mass incarceration. Its work carries on through its successor project, the Center for Art and Advocacy, which <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1000814/brooklyn-welcomes-a-new-center-for-formerly-incarcerated-artists/\">moved into a new programming space</a> in Bedford-Stuyvesant earlier this year.</p>\n    <p>“She was a force for justice in the world who transformed the cultural landscape in New York and beyond,” Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation and a longtime friend of Gund who supported the creation of the Art for Justice Fund, told <i>Hyperallergic</i>.</p>\n    <p>Studio in a School’s board chair Hasna Muhammad described Gund as a “visionary.”</p>\n    <p>“In founding Studio, she gave young people across New York City the tools to see themselves as artists, thinkers, and leaders,” Muhammad told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “Her vision transformed classrooms and lives, and her legacy will continue to inspire us to fight for the right of every child to have access to the arts. “</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/03/painting-wxp-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Artists Rising 2025</i>organized by Agnes Gund’s Studio in a School (photo Maya Pontone/</p>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>In addition to championing education and social justice causes, Gund was a notable patron of contemporary art, building a collection of works including major pieces by Mark Rothko and Jasper Johns and serving as president emerita and life trustee at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). She joined the museum’s international council in 1967, became a board member less than a decade later, and was appointed board president in 1991. During her tenure, she spearheaded the museum’s efforts to engage with contemporary art, most notably through her central role in its historic 1999 institutional merger with the P.S. 1 Center for Contemporary Art in Long Island City, Queens (now MoMA PS1). Her mark on the museum also extended beyond her presidency through MoMA’s major 2004 expansion — a $858 million project that involved the construction of a new building designed by the late architect Yoshio Taniguchi.</p>\n    <p>Gund also served on the boards of the Cleveland Museum of Art, Foundation for Art and Preservation in Embassies, Morgan Library and Museum, Frick Collection, Andy Warhol Foundation, and Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, among many other cultural institutions.</p>\n    <p>Her influence in museums and the arts can also be seen in the Center for Curatorial Leadership (CCL), an organization she co-founded in 2007 dedicated to training and shaping curators for museum leadership.</p>\n    <p>“Aggie was a trailblazing activist and guiding force for good in the cultural world,” curator and CCL fellow Christa Clarke told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. She described Gund as “eager to continue learning from the next generation with the kind of curiosity that characterizes the best leaders,” and an inspirational force for curators.</p>\n    <p>“She was generous in every way, most especially of mind and spirit,” Clarke said.</p>\n    <p>The news of Gund’s passing has prompted a wave of tributes and shared memories. Among those who memorialized the philanthropist was writer and curator <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/author/laura-raicovich/\">Laura Raicovich</a>, who recalled in a social media post how Gund had written her a warm personal note during her first week as director of the Queens Museum.</p>\n    <p>“She was everywhere, making so many of us a bit more confident that we could do what we set out to accomplish,” Raicovich wrote. “I know many of us often wished for more Aggies to be out there, with the endless interest and care she had for art and its people. She broke so many molds with integrity and true engagement.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1043388/agnes-gund-champion-of-arts-and-equity-dies-at-87/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Curated by Sam Bardaouil and Till Fellrath, the exhibition brings together 52 artists from 35 cities worldwide, featuring 33 commissioned works and site-specific installations.</p>\n    <p>The exhibition explores the notion of yearning — not as nostalgia, but as a vital tension between the real and the desired. Today, yearning takes on a new urgency as it becomes a collective pursuit for justice, recognition, and belonging in the face of erasure.</p>\n    <p>This sense of urgency echoes through three artifacts that inspired the biennial: the puppet from Hou Hsiao-Hsien’s film “The Puppetmaster” (1993), the diary from Chen Yingzhen’s short story “My Little Brother Kangxiong” (1960), and the bicycle from Wu Ming-Yi’s novel “The Stolen Bicycle” (2015). Each object aims to embody both loss and desire, reminding us that yearning is lived — not abstract.</p>\n    <p><i>Whispers on the Horizon</i> gathers works that embody yearning in strikingly different ways, from film and performance to sculpture and immersive environments. Highlights include the following new commissions:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Korakrit Arunanondchai’s installation<i>Love after Death</i>merges recollections and myth into a ghostly ritual: On a transparent projection, spirits and monkeys said to channel the dead flicker into view, asking how grief can turn ash into gold.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Omar Mismar’s “Still My Eyes Water” presents a monumental bouquet of artificial flowers inspired by “Flowers of Palestine”<strong/>(1870). Perfect yet scentless, they reflect on Palestine as both a land of life and a fading memory.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Zih-Yan Ciou reconstructs a colonial decoy airfield in “Fake Airfield” with a handmade Zero fighter and fictional film, exposing history as invention and exploring Taiwanese identity.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>The exhibition also features the following immersive and participatory site-specific installations:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Álvaro Urbano’s “TABLEAU VIVANT (A Stolen Sun)”<strong/>is a silent theater where objects glow like apparitions under shifting light, intertwined with works from the TFAM collection, blurring museum and stage, history and role-play.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Fatma Abdulhadi builds a fragrant garden of basil and printed mesh in “What Remains… Stay as Long as You Can”, preserving fading rituals of care and reminiscence where scent and silence become vessels of belonging.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Gaëlle Choisne’s <i>Fortune Cookies</i>is an<i/>installation of thousands of handmade clay fortune cookies, each containing a seed or secret, evoking hidden labor and misattributed cultural histories.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Curators Sam Bardaouil and Till Fellrath said: “Everywhere we look, there is a longing for clarity in the face of disinformation, for belonging in fractured communities, and for connection in a time of divisiveness. The works in the biennial don’t resolve these tensions — rather, they seek to make them tangible. That is the promise of this biennial: to experience yearning not as something abstract or historical, but as something alive, urgent, and shared in the present.”</p>\n    <p>In addition to Jacopo Benassi’s live performance on the opening weekend, November 1–2, 2025, the biennial will host a two-day forum with six panels, delving deeper into themes of yearning, belonging, dissonance, history, seeing, and collaboration. The event will feature conversations and contributions from nearly 30 acclaimed artists and thinkers, including Taiwanese writer and scholar Wu Ming-Yi, multimedia and installation artist Mona Hatoum, multidisciplinary artist and sculptor Ivana Bašić, and filmmaker Wu Chia-Yun. Building on the exhibition’s presentation, these sessions are intended to spark discussions and exchanges on art’s ability to probe deeply, challenge assumptions, and open new possibilities.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>For more information, visit </strong>\n      <strong>taipeibiennial.org/2025</strong>\n      <strong>.</strong>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1042320/14th-taipei-biennial-explores-collective-yearning-and-shared-futures/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In the early 1960s, quantum physics was regarded as one of the most successful theories of all time. It explained a wide range of phenomena to an unprecedented level of accuracy, from the structure of atoms and the formation of chemical bonds, to how lasers and superconductors worked. For some, it was more than just a theory, providing an all-encompassing framework for understanding the micro-world of elementary particles. However, it turned out that the very foundations of that entire framework were built on shaky ground – and the person who noticed wasn’t a physicist but an up-and-coming philosopher.</p>\n<p>The debate that resulted not only opened the door to new ways of thinking about those foundations, but also had tucked away within it, overlooked by all the participants at the time, an entirely different philosophical perspective on quantum physics – one that can be traced back to the phenomenological philosopher Edmund Husserl. The impact of that shift in perspective is only now being fully appreciated, offering an entirely novel understanding of quantum mechanics, one that prompts a complete re-evaluation of the relationship between philosophy and science as a whole.</p>\n<p>The philosopher who kick-started that debate was Hilary Putnam, who went on to make groundbreaking advances in philosophy of language and philosophy of mind, as well as in computer science, logic and mathematics. In 1961, he responded to a paper offering a resolution of the so-called Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox, which appeared to show that the description of reality offered by quantum mechanics could not be complete. In the course of his argument, Putnam pointed out that there was an even more profound problem that lay at the very heart of the theory, as it was standardly understood, and which had to do with one of the most basic of all scientific procedures: measurement.</p>\n<p>That problem can be set out as follows. A crucial element in the formalism of quantum mechanics is a mathematical device known as the ‘wave function’. This is typically taken to represent the state of a given system – such as an atom or an electron – as a superposition of all its possible states. So, consider an electron and the property known as ‘spin’. (This is not really the same as the spin put on a ball in a game of baseball or cricket, but the name has stuck.) Spin comes in two forms, labelled ‘up’ and ‘down’, and so when we use the wave function to represent the spin state of our electron as it travels towards our detector, it is as a non-classical superposition of spin ‘up’ and spin ‘down’. However, when we come to <i>measure</i> that spin, the outcome is always one or the other, either ‘up’ or ‘down’, never a superposition of both. How can we account for the transition from that superposition to a definite outcome when we perform a measurement?</p>\n<p>This question forms the basis of what came to be known as the ‘measurement problem’. One influential answer emerged from the mind of one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, János (or ‘John’) von Neumann, who was responsible for many important advances, not only in pure mathematics and physics but also in computer design and game theory. He pointed out that when our spin detector interacts with the electron, the state of that combined system of the detector + electron will also be described by quantum theory as a superposition of possible states. And so will the state of the even larger combined system of the observer’s eye and brain + the detector + electron. However far we extend this chain, anything physical that interacts with the system will be described by the theory as a superposition of all the possible states that combined system could occupy, and so the crucial question above will remain unanswered. Hence, von Neumann concluded, it had to be something non-physical that somehow generates the transition from a superposition to the definite state as recorded on the device and noted by the observer – namely, the observer’s consciousness. (It is this argument that is the source of much of the so-called New Age commentary on quantum mechanics about how reality must somehow be observer-dependent, and so on.)</p>\n<p>What bothered Putnam was that if we accept von Neumann’s conclusion, then the theory could not be extended to apply to the entire Universe, because that would require an observer existing beyond the physical universe whose consciousness would collapse the superposition of all the Universe’s possible states into one definite one. Either physicists would have to give up the idea that quantum theory was universally applicable, or the standard account of measurement would have to be abandoned.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/why-quantum-mechanics-needs-phenomenology?utm_source=rss-feed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Because <i>Sick, Sad, World</i> seemed appropriate.</p><p>On the more inspiring end, <strong>Molly Odintz</strong> watched <a href=\"https://www.austinfilm.org/screening/the-9-lives-of-barbara-dane/\">a documentary about the badass Barbara Dane</a>, and now feels that “everyone should spend that much time singing about communism.” The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/arts/music/barbara-dane-dead.html\">undersung feminist folkie</a> was a radical presence on the movement circuits of the 1970s. And, extra fun fact: Dane sang at Berkeley just as the school’s Women’s Studies Movement was lobbying for a curricular change that would have national, field-launching implications. Molly’s mom, Deborah Ellis, was part of that smart set.</p><p>If you’re looking for a place to start with her music and can’t find <a href=\"https://barbaradanefilm.com/the-film\"> The 9 Lives of Barbara Dane</a> in your hometown just yet, Molly reminds us that Dane’s 1974 album “</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVL_Ex0LfnM\">I Hate the Capitalist System</a>” is a banger. Pump it extra loud this week, and make a comrade.</p><p>And speaking of the good guys. <strong>James Folta</strong> is decidedly <i>un-</i>happy about the late, great Robert Redford’s passing. But it’s been nice to revisit some of Sundance’s best work. Most all of RR’s canon is worth spending time with, but James recommends a deep cut.</p><p>“A short performance that I loved revisiting this week was [Rob’s] appearance in a <i>Twilight Zone</i> episode, “Nothing in the Dark.” I don’t want to spoil it, but his performance is excellent, and elevates a pretty average script. I love how understated he is and how it sells the twist. He’s quiet, confident, and eventually, inevitable. Impossible to look away from, part of why <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/quoproquid.bsky.social/post/3lyxggaudls2s\">he didn’t get the lead role in  The Graduate.”</a></p><p>Extra <i>extra</i> fun fact? You can watch the ep for free on <a href=\"https://pluto.tv/us/on-demand/series/5ef0d81d146bc5001ae9f7d0/season/3/episode/63b47020d389730007a371bf\">Pluto!</a></p><p>And from <strong>Drew Broussard</strong>, a tasty seasonal reminder. “IT’S APPLE SEASON, BABYYYYY—the abundance has begun, and hot tip to all the readers: if you want to go apple picking in, say, the Hudson Valley or points north of NYC… <i>now</i> is the time. Not October, when you <i>think</i> would be the time, but now. <strong>Trust me</strong>.” Evergreen advice.</p><p>It’s been an especially unhinged seven days in this timeline, friends. May your weekend be full of solidarity and sweetness.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/heres-whats-making-us-happy-this-week-sep19/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The author, Kristy Puchko, points out that, within the show <i>Platonic</i> starring Rose Byrne and Seth Rogen, there is a TV series that sounds both like a hilarious spoof and a tantalizing television possibility: <i>The Young Darcy Mysteries.</i></p><p>Yes, you heard that right. A TV series where a young Fitzwilliam Darcy solves crimes.</p><p>Is this ridiculous? Blasphemous, even? Yes. And yet, Ms. Puchko is VERY CORRECT when she says she needs it to be real. I, too, need it to be real.</p><p>Come on, you know you’d find it delightful. Especially if the spoofiness <i>remains intact. </i>I don’t want a <i>Young Darcy Mysteries </i>that thinks it’s on par with <i>P&amp;P </i>adaptations… I want a tongue-in-cheek series that is aware of all the dimensions it’s sending up. A <i>Murder by Death</i> or a <i>Clue</i>, but set in the world of Jane Austen. This is just MY preference, but I did once make a fake trailer for a fake adaptation of <i>Walden </i>in which Henry David Thoreau is a zombie hunter. So, again… I think the series should spoof all the stuff that inspired it, but also to have fun with the subject.</p><p><i>The Young Darcy Mysteries</i> is mentioned in Episode 8 of Season Two. A teenager describes it as “It’s like the biggest show on… it’s a prequel to <i>Pride and Prejudice </i>but from the perspective of Mr. Darcy when he was <i>young</i>. Also, Mr. Darcy is a detective, a fencer, a boxer, a dirigible test pilot, and an amateur chemist.” Milo Manheim plays the actor playing Young Darcy.</p><p>The teenager and her father even watch an episode. It seems hilarious. I want more.</p><p>So… what’s <i>Platonic </i>going to do about it? Come on. Let’s get the movement going.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/i-support-the-movement-to-make-the-young-darcy-mysteries-real/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>“If all of your fantasies are imagined confrontations, you are not so secretly rehearsing for the chance to fight and punish your enemies.”</h3>\n<p>Where does a joke end? The last decision an artist makes is deciding when a piece is finished, when one more brushstroke might ruin the painting. When it comes to the freedom of expression, the right wing in America has dropped the curtain. The right’s podcasters, TV stars, agency heads, and presidents have decided that the joke is over.</p>\n<p>Jimmy Kimmel was ripped off the air this week because a few sensitive people can’t take a joke <i>[ed. note: or are pretending they can’t]</i> and a series of companies are trying to make a profit. The hypocrisy and shortsightedness of this shouldn’t be a shock. Those profiting from art have rarely been willing to compromise cash for values. Now though, there’s little safe haven in independent art either, where podcasting and comedy have welcomed truly noxious voices that are eager to remake themselves as Wormtongues in the halls of power.</p>\n<p>To those who have been aghast at the the genocide in Palestine and have watched for years as protesters are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/18/mahmoud-khalil-judge-orders-activist-deported-green-card-form\">snatched off the streets and deported,</a> the hope that the powerful might find moral courage has long fallen away. But for many, Jimmy Kimmel’s cancellation is ringing fascism alarm bells for the first time, and bringing into focus just how eagerly pliable many Americans are.</p>\n<p>Kimmel was canceled at the end of a Rube Goldberg machine that started with a podcast appearance. <a href=\"https://x.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/1858327922810970327?lang=en\">Free speech hypocrite</a> and Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr appeared on a right wing podcast on Wednesday, and was mad at one of Kimmel’s late night jokes that mentioned dead podcaster Charlie Kirk. Carr called the joke <a href=\"https://us.cnn.com/business/live-news/jimmy-kimmel-show-pulled-abc-09-18-25\">“the sickest conduct possible”</a> and suggested that the FCC could revoke ABC’s affiliate licenses in retaliation, forcing Disney to punish Kimmel. Nexstar, an affiliate group that owns 197 TV stations across the US, heard the call and threatened to stop airing Kimmel, which tipped the hand of ABC’s leadership at Disney.</p>\n<p>Nexstar is <a href=\"https://www.nexstar.tv/nexstar-media-group-inc-enters-into-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-tegna-inc-for-6-2-billion-in-accretive-transaction/\">trying to merge</a> with Tegna, another large media company, a deal which will need federal approval. And if you’re surprised Disney isn’t doing the right thing, I have a magic castle to sell you.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t matter to any of these people that the joke wasn’t made at the expense of Kirk, but was instead about how the Trump administration is using his death as an excuse to shut down criticism. The content of the joke wouldn’t stop the state reprisals that were already in the works. Days earlier, the Vice President had taken over Kirk’s podcast to announce their planned crackdown on the left, a holy war in the name of a recent martyr, taking advantage of our collective lack of reading comprehension.</p>\n<p>So many podcasts. And suddenly they’re powerful, influential enough to take down a late night network show and to announce a major national program of retaliation. Comedy podcasts, especially those typified by the Austin stand-up scene, have become a haven for canceled creeps and the fascist-curious, and a big part of the culture of anti-woke, reactionary guys. These edgy podcasts claim that it doesn’t matter what you say, as long as it’s funny, and built a parallel meritocracy of the aggrieved around this worldview, where you’re judged on your ability to cross certain lines and toe others. It’s a stable ecosystem with a lot of money, which is exceedingly rare in creative fields.</p>\n<p>In practice this approach only cheapens the form. You don’t have to believe what you’re saying, as long as it gets the right reaction. It sets up a perverse loop where the content of jokes or takes no longer matters, not really. People who don’t care about saying horrible things, things they don’t believe in, can get laughs and get paid. But people who <i>do</i> care about horrible things and want to see them happen in the world, can voice their beliefs out loud, and be rewarded with laughter and applause. A world where nothing and everything is a joke.</p>\n<p>Naturally cancellation doesn’t penetrate this bubble as you might expect, but insofar as the cries of cancel culture were only ever the privileged fearing their own downward mobility, it’s not that surprising. No matter what you’re fleeing, a right wing heel turn will welcome you in and give you access to a lot of money and the most powerful people in the world.</p>\n<p>This world has become so powerful that it’s escaped containment, riding alongside Trump’s blitzkrieg and lashing out at the rest of us. Carefully avoiding stepping on their toes doesn’t seem to help. Look at Jimmy Fallon, who steered clear of the wrong jokes and tousled the right hair, and is still catching all-caps strays on Truth Social. I wonder if this is the moment when the comedian, who went on yet another podcast to blame <a href=\"https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/national-international/fallon-reveals-personal-pain-following-trump-fallout/2047939/\">an online “gang-mentality’”</a> for his choice to be <a href=\"https://ew.com/article/2016/09/19/donald-trump-jimmy-fallon-responds-criticism/\">“never too hard on anyone,”</a> will finally see that there’s no middle way out of this bind.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/the-power-of-the-podcast-collaborators-on-the-state-cancellation-of-jimmy-kimmel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Sometimes, that means calling it like it is when a hatemonger dies and standing firm in the face of ensuing vitriol and cowardice, like <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/beta-search?keywords=Gretchen+Felker-Martin\">Gretchen Felker-Martin</a> has done in the wake of being fired from DC (and having her whole comic line scrapped) for posting about another dead bigot—and sometimes, that’s about raising up stories that forefront safety, consent, women’s pleasure, and good design, like the novellas from <a href=\"https://831stories.com/\">831 Stories</a>. Sometimes, it’s as simple as putting your money where your mouth is, like <a href=\"http://www.chillsubs.com\">Chill Subs</a> has done with the announcement of their first <a href=\"https://www.chillsubs.com/blog/incubator\">Lit Mag Incubator grantees</a>!</p><p>But no matter what: community.

    "body": "<h3>Anna Bruno Considers the Largely Unexplored Humorous Landscape of Catholicism in Literary Fiction</h3>\n<p>My first apartment after college was a four-bedroom in San Francisco’s North Beach neighborhood that I shared with three guys. We were all in our early twenties, trying to make it on our own for the first time. I worked in PR; Brian worked in advertising; Ryan was an architect; and Chris was a consultant. I considered them all my drinking buddies, but, of the three, Chris seemed the most familiar to me, in that way a sister looks at her brother and sees her own image reflected back in a funny mirror.</p>\n<p>One night, early in our friendship, Chris and I came home from the bar and bonded over the question of who was more Catholic. He went down to his room (the bedrooms were downstairs and the kitchen and living room were upstairs—a fleabag with a nice view from the top). When he returned, he produced a picture of Pope John Paul II. He told me to flip it over. The message on the back, in his mom’s handwriting, read, “For your Bible.”</p>\n<p>I wonder if writers, who also happen to be Catholic, would be more humane if they could find some humor in their tradition.</p>\n<p>Chris did not have a Bible. His life, as I understood it, was entirely secular. Furthermore, John Paul II was no longer pope when Chris received that picture. He had died earlier that year (2005) and Pope Benedict had taken over. But Benedict was no John Paul II, and sales of his image at Catholic novelty shops were probably sluggish.</p>\n<p>Chris kept the picture, not because he loved his mother, though he did very much, but because he saw humor in her gesture. I looked up from the image of the pontiff in his white cassock and zucchetto, cracked a smile, and told Chris that he won: He was more Catholic.</p>\n<p>I’m reminded of this moment whenever I hear John Mulaney speak about his time as an altar boy, or Conan O’Brien insist that he is Catholic “in his bones.” Or when Stephen Colbert talks about his enormous Catholic family. Of the three, Colbert is the only one still practicing, but they are all equally Catholic in their identities, and they frequently mine their childhoods and relationships with their families for jokes. I’m certain all three of them would have nodded knowingly if they were there that night in our grubby apartment, when Chris brought out the Pope’s picture.</p>\n<p>But somehow, I’ve never found this particular identity, which translates so well to comedy, represented in literary fiction. To figure out why, I picked up the essay collection <i>The Novel, Spirituality and Modern Culture</i>. I was interested in Donna Tartt’s thoughts on being Catholic and a famous literary writer. For Tartt, writing and religion operate in separate registers, a perspective that is borne out in her work. She argues, </p>\n<p>Writers are entertainers. Basically, we all lie for a living—and any novelist who feels too puffed up with the spiritual importance and nobility of his work would do well to consider whether he would not be serving humanity far better by opening up a soup kitchen or working among the homeless. But the play-acting and mischief of story-telling can also be a vehicle for getting in touch with the deepest and most serious spiritual truths—truths of fate and coincidence, or suffering and justice, of life and death.</p>\n<p>Another essay in the collection, written by Sarah Maitland, is more exacting. After reading a review that concluded her work was “not a novel for atheists,” Maitland thought, “…what do you think we theists have been reading for the last 200 years? We have had to consume an unmitigated diet of post-Enlightenment bourgeois humanism, if we wish to read novels at all.” The issue, as Maitland states earlier in the essay, is that “There is seldom any mention, and never any examination, of people who are religious some of the time, or whose aspirations to faith are some part of a ‘whole’ life (which may also include adultery, divorce, questioning their sexuality, attending psychological counselling and the whole range of other activities that novels’ characters usually engage in).”</p>\n<p>Maitland and Tartt both come from Christian traditions, but the collection, at least in title, is about spirituality and modern culture, generally, so it’s curious that they don’t address the elephant in the room, which is that there is something particular about Christianity that literary novelists avoid.</p>\n<p><i>Fleishman is in Trouble</i> explores casual Jewishness, what Taffy Brodesser-Akner describes as waking up and going to work as a Jewish person, without leaving Orthodoxy, or becoming Orthodox, or worrying about anti-Semitism. In other words, Brodesser-Akner wrote the kind of novel that Maitland seeks, with characters who are, “religious some of the time.” Dani Shapiro’s <i>Signal Fires</i> is a meditation on human connectedness that feels transcendental. In <i>Martyr!</i>, Kaveh Akbar manages to find God in a flickering light bulb. These authors include religious practice and philosophical musings without the embarrassment of their Catholic literary contemporaries. Perhaps this is because American Christian identity is defined by belief rather than inheritance. Or maybe American novelists avoid writing about Catholicism because people like Harrison Butker make it seem so lame?</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/christianity-and-comedy-on-finding-the-funny-side-of-faith/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><i>The following is from Yasmina Reza's</i>Serge</p>\n<p><i>, translated by Jeffrey Zuckerman. Reza is a novelist and playwright whose prodigious work has been translated into more than thirty-five languages. Her novels include</i>Babylon</p>\n<p><i>, which won the Prix Renaudot and was shortlisted for the Prix Concourt, Hammerklavier,</i>Desolation, Adam Haberberg, Happy Are the Happy,</p>\n<p><i>and</i>Anne-Marie the Beauty</p>\n<p>\n      <i>. She lives in Paris.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Our mother’s last words were “LCI.” The last words of her life. After we’d placed that horrible medical bed in front of the TV, my brother said, “Maman, do you want to watch some TV?” My mother said “LCI.” The bed had been delivered and she’d been put in it. She died that very night without another word. She wouldn’t discuss it. That medical bed haunted her. All and sundry had been singing its praises, purportedly because she’d be more comfortable, but actually everyone had been leaning over her usual far-too-low bed, the big double bed in which our father had died, and it was breaking their backs. She didn’t get up anymore. All the bodily functions that cancer had thrown out of whack were now carried out in the bed. Someone had to convince us of the advantages of a medical bed. We’d ordered it unbeknownst to her. It had been delivered at dawn by two men who’d taken their sweet time putting it together. The room was overrun by such a bewildering arsenal of medical and electronic devices that Serge and I now had no place to stand. She didn’t put up the least protest at being effused from one place to the next. They tried out several buttons. She was up high, half-dazed, helpless, suffering the ludicrous tilting up and down. They’d set the head of the bed against a sidewall on which a calendar with Putin petting a cheetah had been pinned. She couldn’t see out the window anymore, her small and beloved square of garden, and she wearily stared straight ahead. In her own bedroom, she was practically adrift. The calendar was a gift from a Russian home health nurse. My mother had a weakness for Putin, she thought he had sad eyes. Once the men were gone, we decided to put her in her usual position, namely, facing the window and in front of the TV. We had to move the big bed. The mattress first, a mattress from time immemorial that proved to be unbelievably heavy, flabby, and seemingly filled with sand. Serge and I dragged it as best we could into the hallway, falling over several times. We left the base of the bed in her room, upright against a wall. We wheeled in Maman and the medical bed to face the window and the TV again. Serge said, “Do you want to see the TV?” We sat on each side of the bed in folding chairs from the kitchen. It was four days after the attack at the Vivange-sur-Sarre Christmas market; LCI was broadcasting the memorial ceremony for the victims. The only word the correspondent had on her lips was “remembrance,” a word drained of meaning. The same girl said after several shots of candy stores and painted boxes, “Life may go on, but nothing will be the same.”</p>\n<p>“You’re wrong,” Serge said, “everything will be exactly the same. In twenty-four hours.”</p>\n<p>Not one word out of our mother ever again. Nana and her husband Ramos came in the afternoon. My sister shrieked, her head buried in her husband’s shoulder, “Oh, that bed is a nightmare!” Maman died that very night, without getting to make use of the new equipment’s features. So long as things stayed as they always had, she could weather this illness’s innumerable vicissitudes. But the medical bed had sealed her lips. No, the medical bed, that monstrosity smack-dab in the middle of her bedroom, had sealed her fate.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Once she was dead, things went off the rails.</p>\n<p>“Mamie, you were the one holding this mishmash of a family together,” my niece Margot said at the cemetery.</p>\n<p>Our mother had been a stickler for our family lunches every Sunday. Even after she’d moved to her ground-floor place in the banlieues. Even in our Paris years, our Papa years, those Sunday lunches barely did anything for the general atmosphere of panic and hypertension. Nana and Ramos came with heaps of out-of-the-world victuals—Levallois chicken, the best chicken in the world (handpicked on the farm by the butcher), or a leg of Levallois lamb that was every bit as incomparable. The rest—French fries, green peas, ice cream—was straight from the ice chests at Picard. My brother and my sister came with their family, I always came solo. Joséphine, Serge’s daughter, came to the doorstep every other week already exasperated. Victor, Nana and Ramos’s son, was training at the École Émile Poillot, the “Harvard of gastronomy,” according to Ramos, who pronounces it “Harward.” At our table was a future <i>grand chef</i>. We had him carve the leg of lamb and applauded his great skill, and my mother apologized for the incorrect utensils and the frozen vegetables (she’d never enjoyed cooking; the advent of frozen food had changed her whole life).</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/serge/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She is the daughter of <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/t/balthus/\">Balthus</a>, one of the last century’s most enigmatic painters, and the Japanese ceramicist Setsuko Klossowska de Rola.</p>\n    <p>Harumi’s animals—bronze owls, alabaster doves, life-size polar bears and stags—are cast in small editions and then obsessively reworked by hand, her patinas as carefully considered as their forms. “She works diligently on each piece after casting, so that when you see them in person they feel immediately timeless,” Alexander Acquavella said.</p>\n    <p>Prices start under $100,000 for smaller works and climb past half a million for monumental bronzes, a range that has already found traction with both new collectors and major players.</p>\n    <p>\n\tThe match between artist and gallery is not as unlikely as it might first seem. Acquavella became familiar with Klossowska de Rola’s work at the <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/t/palm-beach/\">Palm Beach</a> home of <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/t/peter-brant/\">Peter Brant</a>, a longtime supporter. Acquavella said Harumi’s practice exists within an art-and-design continuum that also includes figures like Claude and François-Xavier Lalanne, whose work has shown appeal among collectors in multiple industries.</p>\n    <p>“We’ve obviously had sculpture shows before,” he said of his gallery’s program, “but not an artist that falls between sculpture and design. We were really attracted to the elegance she accomplishes—it’s not an easy thing to pull off.”</p>\n    <p>The artist herself describes her work as a dialogue with myth and nature, rooted in her upbringing in the Swiss Alps. Her influences reach from Ancient Egypt to Japanese Shintoism, filtered through the wabi-sabi aesthetic. She collaborates with artisans at the Fonderie de Coubertin outside Paris, layering metals with age and gold leaf to achieve surfaces that appear both ancient and alive.</p>\n    <p>\n\tHer first show with Acquavella opened earlier this year in Palm Beach and was accompanied by a Rizzoli book. This fall, new works will appear at the gallery’s booth at <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/t/art-basel-paris/\">Art Basel Paris</a>, followed by a major solo exhibition across both floors of Acquavella’s New York space in 2026.\n\n</p>\n    <p>For a gallery better known for Giacometti and Cézanne, the move is more than a nod to the market’s appetite for crossover objects. It suggests that even institutions built on history are looking for artists who complicate collecting categories. “Her sculptures have a quality that defies easy categorization,” Acquavella said. “That’s what makes them special.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/acquavella-harumi-klossowska-de-rola-1234752923/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The lawsuit claims that <i>Sunflowers</i> (1888) was purchased at a 1987 Christie’s auction by Sompo’s corporate predecessor, Yasuda, which ignored a provenance identifying Mendelssohn-Bartholdy as a victim of Nazi coercion.\n\n\t</p>\n    <p>\n\tThe lawsuit was filed under the Holocaust Expropriated Art Recovery (HEAR) Act of 2016, and aims to recover the painting, as well as recoup the profits Sompo Holdings garnered from the Art Institute-sponsored exhibition of <i>Sunflowers</i> in Chicago in 2001. </p>\n    <p>\n\t“Your honors, this case at its core involves a theme as old as human temptation itself, a classic devil’s bargain,” Thomas Hamilton, an attorney with Byrne Goldberg told the panel of judges, as first quoted by <i>Courthouse News</i>. “When a party in exchange for receiving some illicit advantage or power, that promises great wealth and fame, forfeits its authentic identity and mortgages its future.”</p>\n    <p>\n\tMendelssohn-Bartholdy’s collection included works by Pablo Picasso, Claude Monet and August Renoir, among others, in the mid-1930s. He sold the contested <i>Sunflowers</i> in 1934.</p>\n    <p>A lower court dismissed the case in 2024, saying it lacked general “suit related contacts” with Illinois.The heirs appealed, arguing that the fact of the work’s display in Chicago establishes sufficient legal ties to Illinois.</p>\n    <p>\n\t“These policies also enjoin federal courts to exercise their maximal judicial authority and discretion both to entertain these claims as well as resolve them expeditiously, fairly, and on their substantive merits,” wrote the heirs in the appellate <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/appellants-van-gogh.pdf\">brief</a>. “In enacting the HEAR Act Congress expressly invoked its Constitutional war powers and foreign policy authority to further its long-standing and priority goal to return Nazi-confiscated artworks to rightful owners.”\n\n</p>\n    <p>\n\tAttorney Thomas Hamilton, who is representing the heirs, has put forth the 2009 HEAR Act as an argument for its return to the heirs. The HEAR Act is law created to enforce the principles of the Terezin Declaration, a legally non-binding international agreement—a diplomatic promise—signed by 46 world governments to facilitate when possible the return of <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/t/nazi-looted-art/\">Nazi-looted art</a>.</p>\n    <p>\n\tHowever, Sompo’s legal representation, Daniel Graham, argued in court Thursday that this was not a case of Nazi-confiscated art, because Mendelssohn-Bartholdy sold <i>Sunflowers</i> at an auction.</p>\n    <p>The lower court also determined that because the Terezin Declaration was nonbinding, “the heirs’ claims are premised upon merely ‘desirable social policy,’ and eschewed judicial authority to enforce such mere ‘matters of conscience.’”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/heirs-of-jewish-collector-urge-appeals-court-to-reconsider-claim-to-van-goghs-sunflowers-1234752961/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

(Photo by Eugene Gologursky/Getty Images for Museum of Modern Art)\"/>\n    <p>\n\tAnges Gund, an avid art collector and patron of towering importance to New York’s Museum of Modern Art, <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/agnes-gund-dead-moma-art-collecting-1234752843/\">died</a> on Thursday in Manhattan. She was 87. The <i>New York Times</i> reported her death on Friday, but did not provide a cause.</p>\n    <p>\n\tFollowing the announcement of Gund’s death, artists and cultural workers took to social media to honor her memory. “My heart just broke. Rest in peace dear Aggie. They broke the mold with you,” Roxana Marcoci, chief curator of photography at MoMA, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOym7ATCUNl/\">wrote</a> alongside a photograph of Gund at the opening of “LaToya Ruby Frazier: Monuments of Solidarity” with Frazier, playwright Lynn Nottage, and labor leader and feminist activist Dolores Huerta.\n\n\t</p>\n    <p>\n\tBrooklyn Museum director Anne Pasternak <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOyUzFcjYjEFI1Lk9RPV-e_x9CWjW3AXuq-fmQ0/\">wrote</a>, “Rest in power, Aggie— you gave us a world more just, more beautiful, and infinitely more human.”</p>\n    <p>\n\tWithin the art world, Gund was a force of tireless achievement. She spearheaded the 1990s-era expansion of MoMA, transforming it—and by consequence, New York City—into a global center for contemporary art. She collected many canon-bound artists, including Mark Rothko, Jasper Johns, and Brice Marden, but was not afraid to part with pieces for a good cause: In 2017, she sold Roy Lichtenstein’s <i>Masterpiece</i> (1962) at auction and used $100 million of the proceeds to develop the Art for Justice Fund, a grant-based initiative dedicated to criminal justice reform. </p>\n    <p>David Weiner, interim president of the arts education nonprofit Studio in the School, which Gund started in 1977, said in an emailed statement that “Aggie was forever committed to our organization, and in her memory, she asked that donations be made to her Studio in the School.”</p>\n    <p>He added: “This is a tremendous loss—not only for her family but for the arts community and our entire City.”</p>\n    <p>\n\tGund was known, too, for befriending the artists she championed. “I look like I’m part of Aggie’s security detail in this picture but she was one of those rare people in the art world you would have done anything for—including being the bodyguard— because she would have done anything for you,” Glenn Ligon <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOyjD-WDqyV/\">wrote beneath</a> a portrait of Gund and himself posted to Instagram. Replying to Ligon’s post, filmmaker and installation artist Isaac Julien said, “Such a loss and you both look so beautiful together! I know she meant the world to you and so many of us! May she rest in eternal peace and power.”\n\n</p>\n    <p>\n\tIn her own <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOyjbCbict1/\">post</a>, Lorna Simpson said of Gund, “An amazing person who steadfastly held to the principles of broadly diverse art and world, and for decades a champion of a just society. Extraordinary and beloved.”</p>\n    <p>\n\tMuseum professionals beyond New York also offered their condolences. “I have been so privileged to have spent time with <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/t/agnes-gund/\">Agnes Gund</a> during my time with MoMA PS1,” wrote president and director of the Sharjah Art Foundation, Hoor Al Qasimi. She continued: “A legend and icon, her belief and support for the arts and social justice throughout her life has been instrumental in the lives and careers of so many people.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/art-world-figures-remember-late-patron-agnes-gund-a-legend-and-icon-1234752937/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It arrived suddenly, mysteriously, outside the Capitol Building. When viewed from certain vantage points, this beaming, golden Trump can be seen with the Washington Monument in the distance.</p>\n    <p>\n\tIts makers are a group of cryptocurrency investors, <a href=\"https://wjla.com/news/local/washington-dc-president-donald-trump-bitcoin-statue-federal-reserve-interest-rate-cut-decision-us-capitol-building-cryptocurrency-wall-street-financial-markets-digital\">per ABC’s local Washington affiliate</a>. “The installation is designed to ignite conversation about the future of government-issued currency and is a symbol of the intersection between modern politics and financial innovation,” Hichem Zaghdoudi, a representative for the group, told ABC.\n\n\t</p>\n    <p>Let’s have a conversation about the “installation,” then, which is really just a sculpture. I, for one, am fascinated by the noticeable lack of wrinkles on the sculpture’s face, the off-putting crispness of its suit, the bizarre ridges in its hair, the unnatural shortness of its arms. Perhaps these are all useful flourishes if the artists are, say, needling a distinctly American brand of kitsch à la Jeff Koons.</p>\n    <p>But if the artists are trying to puff up Trump’s reputation, which is what I’d say is happening here, the work isn’t really convincing. Then again, the work literally airbrushes out all his flaws, which is probably the point.</p>\n    <p>\n\tCritics have claimed Trump’s relationship to crypto is itself pretty flawed. In August, World Liberty Financial, the crypto firm launched by the President’s family, revealed plans to sell $1.5 billion in shares. The launch in September led to some pretty so-so results, but it still prompted some to wonder just how much Trump stands to profit from it all, a concern that has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/25/trump-crypto-corruption-ethics\">voiced for months</a> now. The Trump family has clung to the value of crypto, anyway: Eric Trump recently said crypto <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0d40abd6-70e3-4332-80e4-aa852cb9f026\">can “save the US dollar,”</a> even as some experts have said <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/opinion/trump-crypto-stablecoin.html\">the exact opposite</a>.</p>\n    <p>Back to the sculpture. It came to Washington just as the Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate this week. Zaghdoudi, the representative for the group behind the work, said that the hope of the piece is to initiate “reflection on cryptocurrency’s growing influence.” This critic, however, is more preoccupied with the sculpture’s odd proportions.</p>\n    <p>\n\tFor viewers, here’s some additional fodder for thought. This is not the first golden sculpture to find its way to Washington during the second Trump administration, though the others seemed to treat the President with less veneration. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/06/18/dictator-approved-sculpture-national-mall/\">One</a> featured a thumbs-up appearing to smash the head of the Statue of Liberty; <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/mystery-artists-return-with-trump-dance-sculpture-1234746367/\">the other</a> had a TV that was painted gold and adorned an eagle to match.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/trump-bitcoin-statue-washington-dc-crypto-1234752921/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Stocks rallied on the news that the Fed had approved a drop of 0.25 percentage points, bringing rates to their lowest level since late 2022. While markets welcomed the prospect of cheaper money, the implications for the art world are less straightforward.</p>\n    <p>\n\tAnita Heriot, president of the Americas for the Fine Art Group, a London-based advisory and <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/market/high-interest-rates-art-lending-boom-1234723734/\">boutique art lender</a>, was skeptical that the cut would dramatically alter the <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/t/art-market/\">art market</a>.\n\n\t</p>\n    <p>\n\t“Buyers are still the buyers,” Heriot told <i>ARTnews </i>on Thursday. “A small percentage drop in <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/t/interest-rates/\">interest rates</a> isn’t going to make someone suddenly decide to spend $75 million. Those who were planning to buy are going to buy regardless.”</p>\n    <p>\n\tThe real shift, according to Heriot, is in <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/t/art-lending/\">art lending</a>—which bodes well for the Fine Art Group. Lower rates reduce borrowing costs, and that matters for collectors who use their holdings as collateral. “When rates go down, the number of clients looking to borrow against their art goes up,” she said. That, in turn, can fuel opportunistic buying. With prices softening, she added, “Now is the time to buy. We’ve been waiting for this moment.”</p>\n    <p>\n\tJoshua Greenberg, managing director and private client advisor at Bank of America Private Bank, echoed that view while taking a broader perspective. “It is a signal in terms of the direction of rates,” he told <i>ARTnews</i>. After a modest period of interest rate hikes and stability, “the market has an expectation that a trend of lowering interest rates has started.”</p>\n    <p>That expectation carries psychological weight, which often translates into market movement. In an environment where rates are rising, Greenberg explained, clients may be less likely to put capital into illiquid assets like art. But if they believe rates are headed down, they might feel more comfortable borrowing—especially since art loans are typically floating-rate and interest-only.</p>\n    <p>“In the environment where you see rates and the trends going down … you will feel perhaps better about that overall cost because your expectation is that your future cost is going down for carrying that debt,” he said.</p>\n    <p>A lower interest rate environment has the potential to increase demand for more illiquid real asset classes such as art over longer periods of time. Forecasts matter, too. Both Bank of America and the market at large are predicting as much as a one percent decline in rates over the next year, including this week’s cut.</p>\n    <p>While a quarter-point on its own won’t determine whether a collector buys a Hockney or a Picasso in Paris or London next month, the sense that borrowing will steadily get cheaper can nudge those sitting on the sidelines to reengage with the market.</p>\n    <p>\n\tThe broader markets provide a useful cautionary parallel. Historically, when the Fed has resumed cutting rates after long pauses, stocks have almost always gone higher—in some cases spectacularly so. Since 1980, the S&amp;P 500 has risen in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/18/business/stocks-fed-rate-cut.html\">every instance</a> when cuts came near a record high, with average gains close to 14 percent. But this cut comes amid political turbulence. President Donald Trump’s pressure campaign on the Fed, legal battles over board members, and questions about the central bank’s independence form an unprecedented backdrop that could complicate the usual pattern.</p>\n    <p>Taken together, the comments suggest that the Fed’s move won’t create new buyers out of thin air, but it could grease the wheels for those already active: lowering borrowing costs, freeing up liquidity, and adding a layer of confidence.</p>\n    <p>As Heriot put it, the sky is hardly falling. If anything, the signal is that conditions are improving—and in the art market, sentiment often matters as much as money.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/fed-reserve-interest-rate-cuts-art-market-loans-1234752920/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The museum is open through this coming weekend before closing on September 22 and starting a long clock to mark its return.</p>\n    <p>That leaves three more days to see “Wolfgang Tillmans: Nothing could have prepared us – Everything could have prepared us,” a photography show spread out over 65,580 square feet and conceived with the closure in mind. To mark the occasion, the Pompidou granted Tillmans the space in its Bibliothèque Publique d’Information, to encourage “a dialogue between his work and the library space, questioning it both as an architectural structure and as a place for the dissemination of knowledge,” per a show description.</p>\n    <p>When that’s over, the Pompidou’s activities will continue with its “Constellation” program, initiated in the spring, to disperse holdings from its collection to different institutions. Exhibitions under the aegis of “Constellation” include a Maurizio Cattelan show at Centre Pompidou-Metz, three-and-a-half hours away by car, through February of next year, as well as a “Highlights of the Pompidou” show at West Bund Museum in Shanghai and a Constantin Brancusi exhibition at H’ART Museum in Amsterdam. Other institutions involved include the Grand Palais and, beginning with its opening in a suburb of Paris next fall, the Centre Pompidou Francilien.</p>\n    <p>Material elements of the Centre Pompidou’s renovation work—awarded to the Moreau Kusunoki agency in collaboration with Frida Escobedo Studio—include asbestos removal from its distinctive facade (designed by Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers), fortifying the building against corrosion, energy optimization, and work to improve accessibility. The work also encompasses what the museum calls “cultural aspects” including reconceiving its collection display and the layout of the Bibliothèque Publique d’Information, as well as “reconfiguring spatial organization to allow for greater emphasis on creation, and thereby reaffirming the Centre’s multidisciplinary identity.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/centre-pompidou-close-renovation-1234752875/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Its mission, Farietta says, is not simply representation but redistribution: lowering barriers for young galleries and artists who have historically struggled to access New York’s blue-chip fair circuit.\n\n\t</p>\n    <p>“In this historical moment, amplifying global voices isn’t optional, it’s essential,” Farietta said in a statement.</p>\n    <p>The 2025 preview featured artists including Amanda Phingbodhipakkiya, Khaled Jarrar, Modupeola Fadugba, and the Brazilian collective MAHKU.

Patterson.</p>\n    <p>Eric Shiner, president of Powerhouse Arts, framed Conductor’s model as ambitious, but pragmatic. By supporting fabrication onsite in Powerhouse’s shops and studios, the fair sidesteps customs and shipping costs that often keep international artists from showing in the U.S. “With Conductor, we’re pairing curatorial ambition with practical systems that make international exhibition more attainable,” he said in a statement.</p>\n    <p>\n\tAlongside the exhibitor booths, the 2026 edition will include an installation by <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/t/la-vaughn-belle/\">La Vaughn Belle</a> (Trinidad and Tobago/US Virgin Islands), <i>The House That Freedoms Built</i>, originally commissioned for the Cooper Hewitt’s 2024 Triennial. Fair programming will extend to symposia, talks, and fabrication activations across Powerhouse’s workshops.</p>\n    <p>Whether Conductor can distinguish itself in a city crowded with fairs will depend less on mission statements than on collectors’ willingness to show up. Still, with a controlled venue, a fabrication-forward model, and an emphasis on the global majority—a term used to refer to people of African, Asian, indigenous, Latin American, or mixed-heritage backgrounds—it is positioning itself as one of the few truly alternative entries into New York’s fair circuit.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/conductor-art-fair-brooklyn-2026-1234752858/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/t/agnes-gund/\">Agnes Gund</a>, one of the greatest and most influential art patrons in the US, has died at 87. The <i>New York Times</i> reported her death on Friday, but did not state a cause.</p>\n<p>\n\tGund’s collecting and philanthropy transformed the American art world, spurring on many others to begin buying art with seriousness. Her influence is most deeply felt at the <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/t/museum-of-modern-art/\">Museum of Modern Art</a>, the New York institution that she had helped fund since 1967, when she joined its international council.</p>\n<p>In the 40-plus years since then, Gund helped bankroll many efforts that aided in launching MoMA into the future, in particular the museum’s 2004 expansion. That initiative, which involved the creation of an entirely new building, was designed by Yoshio Taniguchi, cost $858 million, and transformed MoMA into the behemoth it is today. At the time of her passing, Gund was listed as president emerita and a life trustee at MoMA, where she served as president from 1991 and 2002.</p>\n<p>She was also crucial in relaunching the institution now known as MoMA PS1, a vaunted Queens contemporary art center that she helped bring under MoMA’s aegis in 1999. As of Friday, Gund was still listed as a board member of MoMA PS1, where the directorship position, currently held by Connie Butler, is currently titled after Gund.</p>\n<p>\n\tHer impact at MoMA can be seen in its galleries, where masterpieces that she bought and then gifted to the museum appear frequently. She bought art with vigor and fervor, and appeared on the annual <i>ARTnews</i> Top 200 Collectors list frequently, ranking on each edition between 1990, the year the list was first created, and 2018.</p>\n<p>Even before our current moment when many are focused on expanding the canon, Gund paid special mind to supporting women artists and artists of color. And although she gained respect for her commitment to these artists, she sometimes recalled that museums—including MoMA—didn’t respond to her efforts in kind.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/aggie-documentary-review-agnes-gund-1234573267/\">the 2020 documentary  Aggie</a>, by Gund’s daughter Catherine Gund, Agnes recalled urging MoMA to acquire Adrian Piper’s video installation </p>\n<p><i>What It’s Like, What It Is #3</i>(1991) after the museum had exhibited it in the year it was made. The museum declined to do so, only to rectify the mistake in 2017. The high-impact artwork, in which a Black man rebuts a spread of stereotypes while speaking directly to his viewer, ended up becoming the centerpiece of MoMA’s retrospective for Piper the year afterward.</p>\n<p>\n\tArtists close to Gund—and there were many of them—have always described her as a patron who was always willing to wade into the fray, supporting the kind of work that may have scared off others. “Aggie has always been there for the new kind of art,” the artist and filmmaker John Waters says in <i>Aggie</i>. “She doesn’t question it. She gets behind it.”</p>\n<p>At MoMA right now, one can find an array of treasures gifted by Gund: a James Rosenquist painting based on the layout of a house, an Ana Mendieta sculpture that aligns the female body with the landscape, a spare Agnes Martin painting from her days in the Coenties Slip district of New York. These are but a few of the more than 250 works she gave to the museum across the years. Others marshaled in a 2018 show at MoMA devoted specifically to gifts from her included key works by Jasper Johns, Elizabeth Murray, Catherine Opie, Martin Puryear, Julie Mehretu, Mona Hatoum, and many more.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn 2018, Ann Temkin, chief curator of painting and sculpture at MoMA, <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/who-is-agnes-gund-collector-1234587301/\">told  ARTnews</a> that Gund was “ahead of her time as far back as the 1970s. She had those convictions and in her own home, obviously, it didn’t require courage perhaps in the same way that it did require courage to advocate at MoMA for a number of artists who—if not for her advocacy—probably the curators would not have been looking at closely.”</p>\n<p>Her patronage was not limited to MoMA, of course. As of Friday, she was also listed as a standing trustee at the Cleveland Museum of Art, a life trustee at the Morgan Library and Museum, and an emeritus director at the Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland. At various points, she had patronized all those institutions.</p>\n<p>Her roots lay in Cleveland. She was born in a suburb of that Ohio city in 1938, the second of six children. Her father, a banker, tended to provide her brothers with more opportunities, Gund said, but she persevered and credited her childhood with instilling in her a resiliency that came to define her entire life.</p>\n<p>\n\tShe grew up attending art classes at the Cleveland Museum of Art, though as she told <i>ARTnews</i> in 2018, “I was never any good at drawing but I was very good at learning the collection.” Gund’s mother, who had taken her to those classes, died of leukemia when Gund was 14, and so she was sent to Miss Porter’s School in Connecticut, where she acquired an interest in art history. (Much later on, in 2019, with Oprah Winfrey, Gund would co-chair an all-women Sotheby’s auction in support of the school. Off to sale went Gund’s prized Carmen Herrera painting, which sold for a record-setting $2.9 million.)</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/agnes-gund-dead-moma-art-collecting-1234752843/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Just as the first flowers spring from the ground, he heads out to bucolic locations, where he rigs up a contraption that allows him to install the heavy builds all on his own.</p>\n    <p>In addition to watching the beautifully shot documentary above, you can find more about Somerville and his process on his website, <a href=\"https://beekindhives.uk/\">Bee Kind Hives</a>.

Instead, the artist returns to rippling abstractions and bubbling textures, obscuring identifiable features with painterly gestures. </p>\n    <p>Water, for Rawles, is never neutral. In the lineage of scholars like Christina Sharpe and Saidiya Hartman, the artist considers water to be a charged site and vessel for memory. Along with references to texts by Audre Lorde, Octavia Butler, and Albert Camus, among others, she presents this philosophical grounding as a way to consider the inevitability of change and how transformation can inspire hope. “What is the artist’s role in moments of crisis?” she asks.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/calida-6.jpg\" alt=\"a mirrored Black figure underwater in a painting by Calida Garcia Rawles\"/>\n    <p>Mixing her hyperrealistic style with surreal distortions, Rawles always begins with a photo session before turning to the canvas. In this stage, she conjures moments of ambiguity. Glimmering undulations and bubbles cloud the figures’ bodies, while the reflective surface creates the illusion of a double and two forms bleeding into one another. Whether barely breaching the water’s surface or plunging into a pool, the figures appear suspended in a brief moment, their liquid surroundings embracing their relaxed limbs.</p>\n    <p>Rawles gravitates toward chiaroscuro in these paintings, rendering deep, murky waters in bold acrylic. This dark color palette is also a metaphor for the current moment. She says:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>Personally, I’m grappling with the fractures within the American mythos—once rooted in the promises of democracy, inclusion, and justice. Today, that dream feels increasingly elusive. The melting pot that was once a symbol of unity now cracks under the weight of deportations; truth has become subjective; and justice feels subverted. Amidst this cultural disorientation, I find myself untethered—aware of tectonic shifts beneath both my personal and collective foundations.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p><i>This Time Before Tomorrow</i> is on view through September 27 at <a href=\"https://www.lehmannmaupin.com/\">Lehmann Maupin</a> London.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/calida-1.jpg\" alt=\"a mirrored Black figure underwater in a painting by Calida Garcia Rawles\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/calida-3.jpg\" alt=\"a mirrored Black figure underwater in a painting by Calida Garcia Rawles\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/calida-4.jpg\" alt=\"a mirrored Black figure underwater in a painting by Calida Garcia Rawles\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/calida-5.jpg\" alt=\"a mirrored Black figure underwater in a painting by Calida Garcia Rawles\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/calida-7.jpg\" alt=\"five large paintings by Calida Garcia Rawles in a white gallery\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2025/09/calida-rawles-this-time-before-tomorrow/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Now, they are bringing their magic to Rockaway, staging a new edition of their group show “Portal,” with 35 artists showing in a repurposed military warehouse at Fort Tilden, a former United States Army installation right on the beach.</p>\n<p>“We were really sad that the island did not have us back,” 4heads co-founder <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nixlaemmle/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nicole Laemmle</a> told me. “We took a one-year hiatus—a leap year.”</p>\n<p>Then she and co-founder Jack Robinson, her husband, started looking for a new place to stage an exhibition. They landed in Rockaway last year thanks to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/christophersaucedoart/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Christopher Saucedo</a>, a past 4heads artist who is a board member of the <a href=\"https://www.rockawayartistsalliance.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rockaway Artists Alliance</a>, which operates the space.</p>\n<p>“It’s just like Governors Island.

Its surprisingly spare beauty is paired with another work by the artist inspired by his former day job as an art handler, made from foam and cardboard tape roll interiors, bound together by packing tape in cell-like accumulations.</p>\n<p>And then there’s <a href=\"https://www.cynthiareynolds.art/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cynthia Reynolds</a>, who has two works in the show: a tidy bundle of bubble wrap, displayed in wavy layers in the window to catch the late summer light, and a large trailing sculpture of pink packing peanuts strung together in a surprisingly delicate arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-2690333\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cynthia Reynolds, <em>Cope (anti-static): The Rest of Venus</em></p>\n<p>“At our opening, the artist actually wore the artwork.

The exhibition, originally dubbed the Governors Island Art Fair, <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/market/governors-island-art-fair-329974\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">adapted crumbling officers’ houses</a> into makeshift galleries, displaying art on kitchen counters, spilling out of ovens and dusty cabinets.</p>\n<p>That unique vibe was recaptured in <a href=\"http://johnburon.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">John Buron</a>’s <em>Living Room Incursion</em>, a life-size installation of a recliner chair, television (with working screen), living room window, and baseboard radiator all crafted from cardboard, rope, and fabric, painted entirely in white.

    "body": "<p>Five years ago, Shihui Zhou established <a href=\"https://www.artnet.com/galleries/latitude-gallery/\">Latitude Gallery</a> in the heart of Chinatown with the aim of creating a platform for emerging talents and a focus on artists from the Asian diaspora. With a program driven by community engagement and cross-cultural dialogue, Latitude Gallery soon became a regular presence on the international art fair circuit, recognized for its boundary pushing solo and group shows.</p>\n<p>Now, Latitude Gallery steps into its next chapter in a new space in Tribeca. To inaugurate it, collaborator Neil Jiang has curated the group show “<a href=\"https://latitudegallery.art/exhibitions/83-birth-of-the-between/\">Birth of the Between</a>,” on view through October 25, 2025.</p>\n<p>Jiang first began following the gallery’s program roughly three years ago, and as a collector and friend of the gallery, is an apropos choice for the debut show’s curator. “When Shihui told me she was opening a new space in Tribeca, I was honored to be invited to curate the very first show,” Jiang commented. “Especially this year—with so many New York galleries downsizing or closing—Latitude Gallery did the opposite: they expanded. Not just once, but multiple times, going way beyond the footprint of the previous space. It’s a bit crazy, a bit fearless, and exactly the kind of energy the NYC art scene urgently needs right now.</p>\n<p>This kind of move sends a strong signal: a belief in artists, in collectors, and in the future of the art market. It’s uplifting and motivating to so many in the industry. Latitude must be doing something right!”</p>\n<p>Marking the occasion, we sat down with Zhou to learn more about the relocation and expansion, and what’s next for the gallery.</p>\n<p><strong>With Latitude Gallery recently announcing a big move, can you tell us a bit about what inspired the relocation and what about the new space you are most excited about?</strong></p>\n<p>Relocating to Tribeca feels like the natural next step for Latitude. Over the past five years, we’ve grown alongside our artists—our program has expanded, our audiences have widened, and the community of diasporic voices we’ve nurtured has deepened. At some point, our ambitions and the scale of our exhibitions simply outgrew the walls we were in.</p>\n<p>What excites me most about the new space is the freedom it creates. We’ll finally be able to run multiple shows at once, take on more experimental projects, and invite new forms of collaboration. For me, it’s not just about square footage, it’s about possibility, or latitude. More opportunities for artists, more flexibility in how we work, and more ways to carry forward the spirit that has always defined us.</p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-2689520\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Latitude Gallery New York’s new space in Tribeca at 5 Lispenard Street. Courtesy of Latitude Gallery, New York.</p>\n<p><strong>How are you envisioning the expanded space and new neighborhood impacting the gallery’s exhibition program?</strong></p>\n<p>The move to Tribeca marks an intentional new chapter. With nearly 2,800-square feet across two levels, we can now host exhibitions that weren’t possible before, whether ambitious installations, performance-based projects, or pairing two artists in dialogue across the space. These juxtapositions allow us to create more meaningful conversations between practices, cultures, and generations.</p>\n<p>We remain committed to championing emerging Asian diaspora voices—from early collaborations with artists such as Yuan Fang to more recent projects with Nianxin Li, Ellie Kayu Ng, and Wenhui Hao. At the same time, our new space allows us to broaden our scope: to engage a wider range of artists we love, introduce mid-career voices, and encourage dialogue across disciplines.</p>\n<p>Growth, for us, is about intention. We want to reach wider audiences while holding onto what has always defined Latitude: care, community, and a belief in art’s power to connect.</p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-2689668\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Installation view of “Birth of the Between” (2025). Photo: Yanmei Jiang. Courtesy of Latitude Gallery, New York.</p>\n<p><strong>Having spent the last five years in Chinatown, is there anything you’re going to miss? Or, alternatively, carry with you?</strong></p>\n<p>Chinatown will always be part of Latitude’s DNA. I’ll miss the history and stories embedded there, generations of immigrant families who made the best of life and built something better for the future. That sense of resilience and renewal gave so much depth to our presence in the neighborhood. And then there are the small things: the noise, colors, scents, and the way people would just wander in and connect with us so naturally. In many ways, it felt like home. And now it feels as if we’ve graduated.</p>\n<p>What we carry forward is that role in the continuum: bringing contemporary Asian art into a place so deeply shaped by immigrant experience. Moving to Tribeca gives us more space and visibility, and puts us closer to industry giants, but the values we formed in Chinatown—resilience, cultural exchange, elevating diasporic voices—will always shape who we are.</p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-2689669\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Installation view of “Birth of the Between” (2025). Photo: Yanmei Jiang. Courtesy of Latitude Gallery, New York.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you give us some insight into the new space’s inaugural exhibition “Birth of the Between”? What made this show perfect for the new location’s first exhibition?</strong></p>\n<p>Where to begin! Neil Jiang is not only a dear friend but also a longtime collector who has supported Latitude for many years. We’ve always exchanged ideas and discovered artists together, and after collaborating on Xintong Gao’s solo exhibition last year, it felt natural to invite him to curate our inaugural show. He knows our program intimately and is deeply connected to many of our artists.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/latitude-gallery-shihui-zhou-2-2689477\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><span>PEN America, a prominent defender of free speech, has released a devastating report outlining extensive damage to cultural sites in Gaza caused by Israel’s bombardment of the territory. Titled “<a href=\"https://pen.org/report/all-that-is-lost/\">All That Is Lost</a>,” it notes the destruction of museums, important heritage centers, individual works of art, and prominent archaeological sites, as well as the death of more than 150 cultural figures. </span></p>\n<p><span>“Today, the survival of Palestinian culture in Gaza is under existential threat, as writers, artists, and cultural workers are killed or forced into exile and cultural heritage is demolished by Israeli military attacks,” reads the report’s opening line, adding, “Gaza’s cultural landscape lies in ruins, almost entirely erased.”</span></p>\n<p><span>The report highlights the war’s effects on 36 cultural, historical, religious, and educational institutions and sites, including book burnings and looting of archaeological artifacts, from among 226 damaged heritage sites and historical buildings. (For that figure, PEN cites a study by the Endangered Archeology in the Middle East and North Africa, or EAMENA, project, based at Oxford University, which the organization said has conducted the most comprehensive assessment.)</span></p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-2690904\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The remains of the Hammam al-Samra bathhouse, September 19, 2024. Photo: Omar Al-Qataa / AFP via Getty Images.</p>\n<p><span>It also notes <a href=\"http://cchp.ps/index.php/en/372-damage-and-risk-assessment-of-cultural-heritage-sites-in-the-gaza-strip\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a February report</a> that estimated that emergency preservation efforts alone would cost about $36.4 million and that the costs of full reconstruction, estimated to take up to eight years, will run to about $304 million, adding that the cost will likely be significantly higher six months later. </span></p>\n<p><span>The destruction is not only material. PEN America has documented the deaths of at least 151 cultural figures in the war, though it notes that number is almost certainly not comprehensive. As of September 10, 2025, nearly 65,000 Palestinian men, women, and children have been killed, and more than 163,000 wounded, notes the report.</span></p>\n<p><span>In response to PEN America’s request for information about the targeting of the specific cultural heritage sites, institutions, and universities included in this report, the Israeli military provided no information on any specific damages cited in the report. But, in a message to the organization, cited the “unprecedented intermingling of Hamas within the civilian infrastructure” and stated that it “does not aim to cause excessive damage to civilian infrastructure and strikes only out of military necessity.”</span></p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-2690910\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The recovery of Ottoman-era stones and archaeological artifacts from the ruins of the Pasha Palace Museum in Gaza City, March 3, 2025. Photo: Dawoud Abo Alkas / Anadolu via Getty Images.</p>\n<p><span>PEN America concluded that the Israeli attacks have either targeted cultural sites or been indiscriminate, thus breaching laws including the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict and constituting war crimes and crimes against humanity. “And while destruction of cultural heritage is not itself one of the underlying crimes required to prove genocide,” notes the report, “it has in some cases been cited as evidence of genocidal intent.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Israel’s military action in Gaza began in response to Hamas’s terrorist attack of October 7, 2023, in which over 1,100 civilians and military personnel were killed and 251 individuals taken hostage. PEN’s report acknowledges that Hamas’s attack also constitutes a war crime and a crime against humanity. </span></p>\n<p><span>Israel is not the only threat, says the report. U.S. president Donald Trump’s plan to take over the Gaza Strip and Israel’s campaign to evict all Palestinians from Gaza City, further “reflect a ruthless disregard for Gaza’s cultural heritage” and underscore a dangerous narrative that Gaza has no culture worth preserving.</span></p>\n<p><span>PEN calls for a halt to attacks on Palestinian cultural heritage and for an investigation of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and evidence of genocidal intent. </span></p>\n<p><span>The report quotes three visual artists. </span></p>\n<p><span>Mai El-Shaer, who managed to flee Gaza in 2024, described the challenges in making art in Gaza before the war: “The art scene in Gaza is not very open… The tools, materials, and resources are somewhat limited. You work with what’s available to you in Gaza. Many materials, of course, are blocked by Israel under the pretext that they could be used for non-artistic purposes, and so not everything is accessible. On top of that, traveling outside of Gaza was very difficult. Not everyone could easily travel or leave Gaza… There were challenges you can’t overcome as an artist.”</span></p>\n<p><span>When she fled Gaza, she said, “I tried my best to bring as many pieces as possible—those that were closest to my heart, the ones I couldn’t bear to leave behind.”</span></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOeGQ5Ujds1/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\">\n\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>Shareef Sarhan, an artist and co-founder of an artists’ collective and gallery that was partially damaged in a November 2023 Israeli airstrike and then completely destroyed in April 2024, explained what art and culture mean in the war. “People are losing their connection with the outside world, but art is able to play a role that the artist cannot… People can see their message and feel your situation,” he said, describing art as being “like an official spokesperson for them.”</span></p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/gaza-cultural-heritage-pen-report-2690843\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Earlier this week at Gladstone Gallery in New York, partner Caroline Luce was standing in front of a six-foot-tall painting unmistakably by Keith Haring. A conflagration of bodies in rapture, it could have been a blissful dance floor at Paradise Garage—packed forms, arms outstretched, caught mid-motion. Brash yellow and red shapes vibrate against a pulsing field of electric blue, the surface alive with passionate drips of purple and syncopated rhythm. For all its liveliness, this radiant depiction of community was in fact the last studio painting Haring ever completed. He finished it in November 1989; three months later, in February 1990, he was gone.</p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-2690278\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Keith Haring, <i>Untitled </i>(1989). Courtesy of the Keith Haring Foundation and Gladstone Gallery.</p>\n<p>“Every time I see it, I get chills,” Luce said. “What’s really fascinating is that it hearkens back to so many of Haring’s earlier motifs—bodies in poses of dancing, joy, exaltation—and what you have here is a community of people. As an activist, as an artist, as a friend, as a member of family, the idea of joy at a time when he was so sick and knew that he only had but so long to be in this world—that the last image is one of togetherness, celebration, vitality. Even the palette is sunny and uplifting. In this single work, it shows the balance Haring was able to strike—to hold all the joy and love and beauty at the same time as the pain, suffering, and loss.”</p>\n<p>Haring’s paintings take center stage in “<a href=\"https://gladstonegallery.com/en/exhibit/keith-haring-liberating-gg25/\">Liberating the Soul</a>,” on view through November 1. It is a tight edit of eight works, but they’re monumental in scale, uplifting in spirit, and elegiac in tone. Made between 1984 and 1989, they confront both life and mortality with brash color and unrelenting energy. They are also studies in communication: Haring’s signature line, deceptively simple, conveys complex messages about sexuality, activism, and community with disarming clarity. Many are painted not on canvas but on industrial tarps—vast, unconventional surfaces that amplify their urgency and rawness.</p>\n<p>“He started using tarps in 1981 to find a different medium that was outside of a traditional painting practice,” Luce said. “He continued to use tarps throughout his body of work. The grommets, the sheen, the fact that the material maintains its integrity and becomes a part of the work rather than being overpainted is all very much a part of it. The size of these tarps evidence is how compelling he was at scale and how his language was really able to evoke emotions and energies in a very signature, singular way.”</p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-2690279\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Keith Haring, <i>A Pile of Crowns for Jean-Michel Basquiat</i> (1988). Courtesy of the Keith Haring Foundation and Gladstone Gallery.</p>\n<p>Another startling work is <em>A Pile of Crowns for Jean-Michel Basquiat</em>, a triangle-shaped canvas that depicts a disheveled mountain of his fellow artist’s motif. “Haring painted it almost immediately after Basquiat passed away in August of 1988,” Luce said. “It’s on raw canvas, so it feels a little bit different than the other ones. It’s a monument, and the paint has actually seeped into the surface of the material. It’s poetic and quite moving to take in. He was friends with Basquiat throughout the ’80s. They met when Keith was a student at SVA in 1979, so they were in each other’s lives for that entire decade.”</p>\n<p><em>Tree of Life</em> is another elegy for a lost friend. “She was a student at Columbia and it was a tragic car accident. She passed away at 20, so on the back, the signature in it, he says ‘In memory of Maria Dahlin.’ Christian iconography runs through his work, so here the <em>Tree of Life</em>, is certainly a biblical reference that he would’ve been aware of. And as always with Keith, it’s quite open to interpretation.”</p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-2690651\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Installation view of “Liberating the Soul: Keith Haring’s Paintings.” Courtesy of Gladstone Gallery.</p>\n<p>The painting <em>Safe Sex</em> harnesses vibrant color to capture the spirit of the decade and nods to Haring’s AIDS activism. <em>Brazil</em> could be an ecstatic beach scene of overlapping bodies or a cartographical study. A jumble of intricate hieroglyphs crowds an orange mass pressing towards a cerulean expanse in the corner.</p>\n<p>“He spent a lot of time in Brazil,” Luce said. “You could kind of imagine it—the coastline of Brazil, the density of the rainforest. Again, very open to interpretation. Formally, this has a really interesting connection to another major work from the end of his practice, which is called <em>Unfinished Painting,</em> which leaves some blank space open and dripping. And that kind of empty space—is it the Atlantic Ocean? Is it something more cerebral? As always with Haring, he doesn’t want to pin you into one reading of it.”</p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-2690276\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Keith Haring, <i>Untitled</i> (1985).

The younger Gund directed a <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/aggie-documentary-2019-premiere-1780494\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2020 documentary, <em>Aggie</em></a>, about Gund’s life’s work, and even turned her mother’s art collection into an <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/agnes-gund-art-collection-card-game-1962738\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apples-to-Apples-style board game</a>.</p>\n<p>At MoMA, Gund first joined the museum’s international council in 1967, and then the board of trustees in 1976. She held the board presidency, an unpaid role, from 1991 to 2002. During her tenure, Gund oversaw a $858 million expansion erecting a new building by Yoshio Taniguchi, completed in 2004, and helped forge a merger with the P.S. 1 Center for Contemporary Art in Long Island City, Queens, now known as MoMA PS1. She stayed on as president emerita of the board until her death.</p>\n<p>As a collector, Gund was a champion of contemporary art, encouraging MoMA to expand its holdings in that area. She owned work by some of the great American artists of the 20th century, many of whom she counted as friends—Roy Lichtenstein, Mark Rothko, James Rosenquist, Jasper Johns, Claes Oldenburg, Ellsworth Kelly, Brice Marden, and Frank Stella.</p>\n<p>But Gund, a self-proclaimed feminist and prominent Democratic donor, was also known for supporting artists of color and women artists. She believed firmly in the power of art to solve problems. “I think that now artists are really going to come to the fore when it comes to political and social causes,” she told then-Artnet News editor-in-chief Andrew Goldstein <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/agnes-gund-diversity-moma-interview-968207\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in 2017</a>. “I think art can make a difference. I think art can help.”</p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1326833\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Agnes Gund and Klaus Biesenbach at the 2018 MoMA Party in the Garden at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Photo: by Paul Bruinooge, ©Patrick McMullan.</p>\n<p>Born in Cleveland on August 13, 1938, Gund, known as Aggie, was the daughter of Jessica Roesler Gund and George Gund II. The family fortune, which Gund inherited upon her father’s death in 1966, came from real estate and brewing.</p>\n<p>She was engaged in art from an early age through classes at the Cleveland Museum of Art. (Gund would grow up to be a major supporter of the institution, from donating her first major acquisition, <a href=\"https://www.artnet.com/artists/henry-moore-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Henry Moore</a>’s sculpture <a href=\"https://www.clevelandart.org/art/1970.112\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Three-Way Piece No. 2</em></a> to the museum in 1970, to the <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/agnes-gund-cleveland-museum-art-1097210\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">gift of five works</a> by contemporary American artists in 2017, among other artwork.)</p>\n<p>After her mother’s death in 1954, Gund enrolled at Miss Porter’s School in Farmington, Connecticut, where, she told <a href=\"https://lifestylesmagazine.com/profile/agnes-gund/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Lifestyles Magazine</em></a>, a “magical art history teacher” named Sarah B. MacLennan taught her how to look at art.</p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-2690836\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Agnes Gund at the Frick in 2011. Photo: by Amber De Vos, ©Patrick McMullan.</p>\n<p>“On the weekends, I’d come into New York with an aunt, and we would go to all the museums in the city. We would go to the Museum of Modern Art and to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. I went to the Frick Collection so many times that I knew where everything was by memory,” Gund told the <a href=\"https://gagosian.com/quarterly/2014/12/23/agnes-gund/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Gagosian Quarterly</em></a>. “I sometimes joke that if I ever go to prison, what’s going to keep me from going crazy is that I have these museums memorized, and I can go through them and see all my favorite things in my head.”</p>\n<p>Gund got a degree in history from the Connecticut College for Women. Later in life, after her divorce, she went back to school, earning a master’s in art history at the Fogg Museum, at the Harvard Art Museums in Cambridge in 1980.</p>\n<p>Twice married and twice divorced, to Albrecht Saalfield and Daniel Shapiro, Gund is survived by her four children, Catherine Gund, David, Anna, and Jessica Saalfield, and 12 grandchildren, as well as her siblings Gordon, Geoffrey, and Louise Gund.</p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-2690831\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Agnes Gund at a Studio in a School event in 2004.Photo: ©Patrick McMullan.</p>\n<p>Gund was also the founder of <a href=\"https://studioinaschool.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Studio in a School</a>, which she formed in 1977 in response to cuts to arts education in New York City public schools.</p>\n<p>“I just couldn’t believe that they wouldn’t still have an arts and music program at least available,” Gund told me <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/oral-history-why-were-so-many-new-york-art-organizations-founded-40-years-ago-1073045\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in 2017</a>, on the occasion of the organization’s 40th anniversary. “Our whole idea was to have artists who were the teachers.”</p>\n<p>Those teachers include such luminaries as Mark di Suvero, Jeff Koons, Julie Mehretu, and Fred Wilson.</p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-1187111\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Students working at PS 112 in Manhattan with Cathy Ramey, who has worked with Studio in a School for over 20 years.

In 2022, she sold Lichtenstein’s <a href=\"https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-6397636?ldp_breadcrumb=back\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i>Mirror #5</i></a> (1970) for $3.18 million, to benefit the work of two nonprofits fighting for reproductive rights after the Supreme Court overturned <em>Roe v.

    "body": "<p>Despite the fact that I have seen many, many art shows sanctifying 1920s modernism from seemingly every angle, the “Mouvement Flou” is a new one to me. The term, meaning the “blurry” or “out of focus” movement, is mentioned in “<a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/man-ray-when-objects-dream\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Man Ray: When Objects Dream</a>” at the <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>. It is credited to the Surrealist poet Louis Aragon, who used it to refer to the bridge moment in the European avant-garde between Dada, with its obsession with chance and irrationality, and Surrealism, with its concern for dreams and desire. In that brief both/and moment, a sense was percolating of new possibilities not completely fixed to any single creed.</p>\n<p>Personally, I like the idea of “Movement Flou” for <a href=\"https://www.artnet.com/artists/man-ray/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Man Ray</a>‘s (1890–1976) particular style of creativity. Partly because, as a singular star of that era, he consorted with both Dadaists and Surrealists without becoming a true member of either movement. But also because a commitment to in-between-ness powered his practice.</p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-2690717\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Installation view of Man Ray: When Objects Dream, on view September 14, 2025–February 1, 2026 at The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Photo by Anna- Marie Kellen, Courtesy of The Met</p>\n<p>“When Objects Dream” is not really a full-dress Man Ray retrospective. Instead, it uses his 1922 portfolio of “Rayographs,” <em>Champs Délicieux</em> (<em>Delicious fields</em>), as a way into talking about the surrounding era of his art. These were experiments in “cameraless” photography that Man Ray made by arranging objects from his studio on photographic paper and then exposing the surface to a flash of light, so that the objects’ shadows left their outlines.</p>\n<p>What makes the Rayographs endure as art is the intriguing sense that they exist in-between different ways of seeing. Each image reads as both a Cubist-inspired 2D abstraction and a ghostly photographic document of a specific chance moment. Their composed, hieroglyphic quality, meanwhile, sits in contrast with them as symbols of quicksilver experimentation.</p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-2690677\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Man Ray, <i>Rayograph</i> (1925).

The photogram remains a potential even today, although a minor one. For a hot second, though, the technique offered itself as an area to explore that was in between photography and painting, art and technology. May Ray rushed into the space with all his usual intensity and elegance (though he failed at the self-branding exercise of getting people to permanently use the term “Rayograph”; Moholy-Nagy’s “photogram” won out).</p>\n<p>He was good at such stiletto-strike innovation. “What seem to be the tricks of today will be the truths of tomorrow,” he would say.</p>\n<p>He was born Emmanuel Radnitzkyin to a Russian Jewish family in 1890 in Philadelphia, and raised in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. He precociously eschewed college for the artist’s life, drawn to the exotic European art styles of the period that shocked still-provincial American taste, stripping his name down to the ultra-modern “Man Ray” in the process. In 1910s New York, he made a living in the fast-growing commercial design world as an illustrator. He learned photography out of necessity, on the side, to document his own tries at experimental painting.</p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-2690672\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Man Ray, <i>Self-Portrait in 31 bis rue Campagne-Première Studio</i> (1925).

He was in his early thirties. (Charmingly, when he first met Duchamp, Ray didn’t speak French and Duchamp spoke no English; they intuitively understood one another.)</p>\n<p>On either side of the Atlantic, Man Ray’s career was marked by restless zigzag experimentation. Correspondingly, “When Objects Dream” goes in a lot of different directions, mixing his stylish greatest hits in experimental photography with his forays into painting, which are less famous—mostly justifiably so, though I don’t hate them.</p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-2690671\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Man Ray,<i> Paysage suédois (Swedish Landscape)</i> (1926).

Aside from Man Ray’s photos, his most celebrated works pick up Duchamp’s idea of the readymade and run with it. These include a sewing machine covered in a cloth and bound so you just see its lumpy outline, which became an icon of Surrealism (<em>The Enigma of Isidore Ducasse</em>, from 1920), a flat iron with a strip of tacks fixed on it to make it a weapon (<em>Gift</em>, 1921), and a metronome with a little cut-out photo of an eye on it (<em>Object to Be Destroyed</em>, 1923).</p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-2690210\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Man Ray, <em>Cadeau (Gift)</em> (1921/1963).

It is part of a group of Surrealist works going on sale across the house’s marquee evening sales this November, the first to take place at the house’s new Madison Avenue headquarters. The collection of over 80 paintings, drawings and sculptures, coming from an unnamed private collector, includes giants of the movement like Salvador Dalí, Max Ernst and René Magritte. The group is estimated to total between $70 and $105 million. It’s the latest reveal by the auctioneer, which has recently announced several major consignments. </span></p>\n<p><span>The body of works are brought together under the punning title “Exquisite Corpus,” alluding to the <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/art-bites-surrealists-exquisite-corpse-2672024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">group art-making exercise</a> “exquisite corpse,” beloved of the Surrealist artists.</span></p>\n<p><span>“Collections of this caliber and focus are encountered perhaps once in a lifetime,” said Julian Dawes, Sotheby’s vice chairman and head of Impressionist and Modern Art, Americas, in press materials. “Exquisite Corpus is more than a remarkable assembly of individual masterpieces—it is a living body in which the narratives and imagery of different artists converge into something greater than the sum of its parts. It captures the spirit of imagination and intellectual curiosity that defined the Surrealist epoch—a collection that is, in every sense, the stuff of dreams.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2690741\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/09/frida-kahlo-sueno-cama-1024x657.jpg\" alt=\"A pair of art handlers pose with a Frida Kahlo painting showing the artist in bed, with a skeletal figure atop the bed above her\" srcset=\"https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/09/frida-kahlo-sueno-cama-1024x657.jpg 1024w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/09/frida-kahlo-sueno-cama-300x192.jpg 300w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/09/frida-kahlo-sueno-cama-768x493.jpg 768w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/09/frida-kahlo-sueno-cama-1536x985.jpg 1536w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/09/frida-kahlo-sueno-cama-2048x1314.jpg 2048w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/09/frida-kahlo-sueno-cama-50x32.jpg 50w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/09/frida-kahlo-sueno-cama-1920x1232.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-2690741\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Frida Kahlo, <i>El sueño (La cama)</i> (1940). Courtesy Sotheby’s.</p></div>\n<p><span>Kahlo’s </span><i><span>El sueño (La cama) </span></i><span>(1940) is estimated to sell between $40 million and $60 million. It shows her in a four-poster bed floating in the sky, wrapped in vines that symbolize regeneration. Atop the bed lies a figure with a skull for a head, wired with multiple sticks of dynamite and carrying a bouquet of flowers. Sotheby’s pointed out, in press materials, that Kahlo kept a traditional papier-mâché skeleton above the canopy of her bed, a way of domesticating death in the Mexican tradition.</span></p>\n<p><span>“<em>El sueño</em> stands among Frida Kahlo’s greatest masterworks—a rare and striking example of her most surrealist impulses,” said Anna Di Stasi, Sotheby’s senior vice president and head of Latin American Art, in press materials. “In this composition, Kahlo fuses dream imagery and symbolic precision with unmatched emotional intensity, creating a work that is at once deeply personal and universally resonant. It is an enduring testament to her genius and its appearance on the market presents an unparalleled opportunity to acquire a cornerstone of Surrealism.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Kahlo may have played second fiddle to her husband, artist Diego Rivera, during her lifetime, but she has been </span><a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/frida-kahlo-icon-headlines-2641740\"><span>thoroughly rehabilitated</span></a><span> in the market and in institutions. A forthcoming exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston and Tate Modern, London in 2026 will celebrate her work and impact on contemporary artists.

    "body": "<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin’s narrative of a shared Russian–Ukrainian origin in the Viking-founded Kievan Rus is having dramatic implications in eastern Europe today. Here’s why the real history might be more complicated than the Russian president says</p>\n<p>When Vladimir Putin states that Russians and Ukrainians are “one people”, he’s invoking a very specific vision of history. In essays and speeches, the Russian president has unfurled more than a thousand years of history to argue that modern Ukrainians and Russians share a single origin.</p>\n<p>“Putin’s claim is that because of a shared origin the Ukrainians and the Russians are one people, and that any division of them into two sovereign states is an artificial modern construct,” explains Martyn Whittock, <a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/membership/viking-impact-russia-ukraine-podcast-martyn-whittock/\">speaking on the  HistoryExtra podcast</a>.</p>\n<p>Whittock is an author and historian whose recent book, <i>Vikings in the East: From Vladimir the Great to Vladimir Putin – The Origins of a Contested Legacy in Russia and Ukraine</i>, dissects that shared story and its connections to the medieval world of the <a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/period/viking/the-viking-age-dates-start-end-norse-era/\">Viking Age</a>.</p>\n<p>At the centre of this origin story are the Rus (a particular group of Norse traders and warriors who settled in Eastern Europe and gave their name to both Russia and Belarus), and the towering 10th-century ruler Vladimir the Great, whose conversion to Christianity reshaped the destiny of the region.</p>\n<h2>The Rus: the Vikings who headed east</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/period/viking/vikings-history-facts/\">The Vikings</a> are mostly remembered as violent raiders of the lands that lie south or west of Scandinavia: Britain, France, Ireland and Iceland.</p>\n<p>Yet from the 9th century, another branch of Norse seafarers set out east, rather than west.</p>\n<p>They navigated the great rivers of Eastern Europe – the Dnieper, the Don, the Volga – using their ships to link the Baltic to the Black Sea and the rich markets of Byzantium.</p>\n<p>These Norsemen became known as the Rus.</p>\n<p>“The Norse who came to this Slavic region are described as the Rus, and that’s a name that will run and run. It still exists in the name of Belarus and of course, Russia,” explains Whittock.</p>\n<p>The Rus were traders and warriors, dealing in furs, honey, wax and enslaved people. They established fortified towns along river routes, often marrying into Slavic elites. Over time they became culturally hybrid: Norse in origin but increasingly Slavic in language, custom and culture.</p>\n<p>Their most important political centre was Kyiv, which by the 10th century had become the capital of a loose federation of principalities known as Kievan Rus.</p>\n<h2>What was Kievan Rus?</h2>\n<p>Kievan Rus wasn’t a centralised nation state but rather a network of regional centres including Kyiv, Novgorod, Smolensk and Chernihiv, bound together by dynastic ties and tribute. Its rulers belonged to the Rurikid dynasty, descended from the Viking chieftain Rurik.</p>\n<p>At its height in the 11th century, Kievan Rus stretched from the Baltic to the Black Sea. Trade flowed south to Byzantium and north to Scandinavia. The society was multi-ethnic, comprised of Slavs, Norse, Balts, Finnic peoples and steppe nomads.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Read more |</strong>\n        <a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/period/medieval/viking-frontier-norse-greenland-daily-life-could-you-survive/\">Could you survive on the Vikings’ furthest frontier? Here’s the dark reality of Norse life on the edge</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Kyiv’s wealth and culture gave it prestige, but already the threat of future fragmentation was present: powerful local princes, rival trade hubs and external threats from nomadic raiders were all emerging.</p>\n<h2>Vladimir the Great and the baptism of Rus</h2>\n<p>One of Kyiv’s most celebrated rulers was Vladimir the Great, who lived c958–1015.</p>\n<p>“In AD 988, a decision was made by Vladimir’s court to convert to Eastern Orthodox Christianity. It was a game changer and of immense historic importance because it allied the Rus with the Eastern Roman empire,” Whittock explains.</p>\n<p>Vladimir ordered mass baptisms in the River Dnieper. From this point on, the Rus elite looked to Constantinople, capital of the Byzantine empire, for spiritual authority.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Read more |</strong>\n        <a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/period/viking/varangian-guard-byzantine-empire-kievan-rus-vikings-basil-ii-vladimir-great/\">The Viking connections to the Byzantine empire</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<p>This decision had far-reaching consequences. Rus Christianity was Orthodox, not Catholic. Its holy books were written in Old Church Slavonic, not Latin. Its priests and rituals bound the region eastward, and created the notion of Holy Rus: a concept of Russian origins connected to both geography and religion.</p>\n<p>“We have this highly enhanced religious, national and ethnic character,” says Whittock. And it’s that character that would form the shared basis of Russia and Ukraine and the broader Soviet landscape in eastern Europe.</p>\n<h2>Collapse, Mongol conquest and the rise of Muscovy</h2>\n<p>Kievan Rus never became a lasting empire. In the 12th century, internal rivalries and shifting trade routes weakened it. In the 13th century, Mongol invasions shattered its unity.</p>\n<p>Power shifted north and east. Novgorod survived as a trading hub, but over time, the newer principality of Muscovy, centred on modern Moscow, ascended in prominence. Its princes cooperated with the Mongol khans, gradually building resources and influence.</p>\n<p>By the end of the 15th century, Moscow had thrown off Mongol dominance and emerged as the core of a new Russian state. Its rulers claimed continuity with Kievan Rus, insisting that the sacred legacy of Vladimir’s baptism had passed to them.</p>\n<h2>Shared origins but divergent paths</h2>\n<p>Russia, Ukraine and Belarus all trace cultural and linguistic roots back to this early medieval era, and to Kievan Rus. But despite that shared origin, their histories would diverge significantly in the succeeding centuries.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/period/viking/putin-ukraine-justification-rus-vikings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, it was recently revealed the site may risk losing its place among the other modern wonders, or at least its “credibility” as a wonder.</p>\n    <p>The announcement comes in the wake of transportation-related protests in the region, which have left some tourists stranded near the historic site. Regardless of its status as a world wonder, Machu Picchu will continue to be a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as UNESCO is not associated with New7Wonders.</p>\n    <h2>New7Wonders Is Concerned For Machu Picchu’s Future As A Historic Site</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/machu-picchu-in-1912.jpg\" alt=\"Machu Picchu In 1912\"/>\n    <p>Wikimedia CommonsMachu Picchu pictured in 1912.</p>\n    <p>In a statement from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=757940233538596&amp;set=a.178796051453020\">New7Wonders</a>, the organization outlined its concerns about local officials’ plans and regulations for the site, including alleged poor management and a lack of sustainable planning. The statement goes on to describe how the historical site’s standing as a world wonder rides on the next steps of Peru’s “key decision-makers.”</p>\n    <p>“The designation implies a shared commitment to the conservation and responsible management of the site, as well as the implementation of international preservation and management standards,” the statement said.</p>\n    <p>As of right now, the organization has not released what the process would look like if they determined it was appropriate to remove Machu Picchu from their list of world wonders. They also don’t currently have plans regarding the next steps for adding a new site in its place if removed.</p>\n    <p>“This is premature, especially as we believe all stakeholders can and should consider this a wake-up call to get the house of Machu Picchu in order,” New7Wonders Director Jean-Paul de la Fuente told <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/17/travel/machu-picchu-new-7-wonders-latam-intl\">CNN</a>. “We already have an official representative adviser in Peru itself, who is ready to support the process toward both short term and more importantly long-term solutions.”</p>\n    <p>Peru’s <a href=\"https://www.gob.pe/institucion/cultura/noticias/1246708-comunicado\">Ministry of Culture</a> released a statement following the organization’s call for change, stating that “the conservation and protection of the Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu is not being violated.” The ministry also said UNESCO is “the only competent body to promote the identification, protection and preservation of cultural and natural heritage.”</p>\n    <p>In addition, the ministry pointed out that <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/machu-picchu-facts\">Machu Picchu</a> is not included on UNESCO’s list of endangered world heritage sites.</p>\n    <h2>Recent Concerns Surrounding Machu Picchu</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/machu-picchu-from-above.jpg\" alt=\"Machu Picchu From Above\"/>\n    <p>Wikimedia CommonsMachu Picchu could see over 1.5 million visitors this year.</p>\n    <p>New7Wonders’ statement comes in the wake of protests regarding Peru’s transportation concessions. Due to the unrest, thousands of tourists have been left stranded near the historic site in the last few days.</p>\n    <p>While the protests over control of the concession for the route leading to Machu Picchu have actually been going on since the beginning of September, they took a turn in recent days. Some protesters completely blocked rail access leading to Machu Picchu, halting transportation to the historic site.</p>\n    <p>While New7Wonders’ announcement was made during a contentious time, according to de la Fuente, the warning is a long time coming.</p>\n    <p>Most of the organization’s concerns stem from the impacts of overtourism. Specifically, they’re concerned about the increased risk of damage to the site, rising prices for services in the area, irregular ticket sale practices, and the alleged lack of cooperation between institutions and travel companies.</p>\n    <p>In recent years, the organization has also heard reports of repeated complaints from visitors and has become concerned over the limited conservation and management plans for the future of the site.</p>\n    <p>Even with these potential issues and the ongoing transportation protests, <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/machu-picchu-fault-lines\">Machu Picchu</a> is supposed to host over 1.5 million visitors this year.

However, the material’s unusual color prompted further examination. Upon closer inspection, Professor Gordon Noble recognized that the stone fragment carried a schematic carving of a face: two eyes, a nose, and what appears to be a hairline.</p>\n    <p>“I had no idea I was holding anything significant,” Allan said in a <a href=\"https://www.abdn.ac.uk/news/24685/\">statement released by the University of Aberdeen</a>. “But I took a closer look because of its size and because the color — a sort of oxidized coppery green — caught my eye. I showed it to Professor Noble who took one look at the stone and his reaction told me it was something special — with what appears to be a carved face on it.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/professor-gordon-noble-and-jodie-allan.jpg\" alt=\"Professor Gordon Noble And Jodie Allan\"/>\n    <p>University of AberdeenProfessor Gordon Noble and Jodie Allan, the student who made the discovery.</p>\n    <p>The find comes from East Lomond, a hillfort and adjacent settlement believed to lie at what would have been the southernmost edge of Pictish territory.</p>\n    <p>Excavations have revealed material culture indicating contact with the wider early medieval world: Roman imports such as Oxfordshire Ware pottery and “E‐ware” from northern France. These suggest East Lomond was not isolated but part of long‐distance trade and cultural exchange networks.</p>\n    <p>Professor Noble and excavation partner Joe Fitzpatrick of the Falkland Stewardship Trust have been leading work at East Lomond since at least 2022, with community volunteers, students, and specialists collaborating. The building from which the face was retrieved is part of what archaeologists think was the final phase of activity in the settlement, dating from the fifth to seventh centuries C.E.</p>\n    <p>“It is incredibly rare to have a representation of a human face in this time period,” Noble said. “We’ll have to look at all the parallels, but if it really is a human face it’s nice to think it could be a rudimentary portrait of a local Picts who lived at East Lomond.”</p>\n    <p>Most surviving carvings are symbolic rather than representational. Noble said this fragment adds a window into how <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/picts\">Picts</a> may have represented individuals — not just abstract symbols — for family or community rather than for public display.</p>\n    <h2>East Lomond Is Proving To Be An Archaeological Treasure Trove</h2>\n    <p>Other recent finds at the site bolster the argument that East Lomond was a high‐status settlement. Alongside the carved face, the 2025 dig recovered a complete iron mattock head and fragments of weaponry. Hearths built on top of older hearths, buildings replacing earlier structures, and well‐preserved objects suggest continuous occupation and investment in material culture.</p>\n    <p>“East Lomond is turning out to be such an amazing site,” Professor Noble remarked.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pictish-stone-face-in-the-field.jpg\" alt=\"Pictish Stone Face In The Field\"/>\n    <p>Facebook/Gordon NobleThe stone face as it was found during the dig at the East Lomond hillfort.</p>\n    <p>To confirm the stone’s age and cultural context, the team will carry out radiocarbon dating of floor layers and deposits associated with the building. They also plan to compare the carving with artistic parallels from early medieval Europe to understand its style and significance.</p>\n    <p>“This is an early schematic carving… [It] resembles some of the human faces you see in early medieval manuscripts,” Noble said, adding that fully understanding what this object represents is now a priority.</p>\n    <p>Archaeologists think that if this really is a human face, it may reflect how Pictish identity was expressed locally.</p>\n    <p>“The face suggests that Pictish people here were making more expedient carvings,” Noble said, “perhaps something for family members living at the site rather than public display like the more famous Pictish symbol stones.”</p>\n    <p><i>After reading about this possible piece of Pictish history, go inside the enduring legend of the  Loch Ness monster and how Pictish carvings influenced it.

It was discovered on the face of a rock on the Tibetan Plateau about 14,000 feet above sea level.</p>\n    <p>The carving reads, “The emperor commanded level five grand master Yi to lead a group of alchemists here to collect yao.”</p>\n    <p>The word “yao” could refer to healing minerals, herbs or other medicines, but it could also refer to the elixir of life, a potion said to grant immortality to those who drink it.</p>\n    <p>The carving also specified that the expedition wagon had made it to the lake during the 37th year of the emperor’s reign and that they were aiming to reach Kunlun Mountain, which was about 40 miles away.</p>\n    <p>Other records from this time corroborate that Emperor Qin Shi Huang, known for his sprawling tomb featuring the <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/terracotta-army\">Terracotta Army</a>, sent expeditions to Japan in search of the elixir of immortality.

What’s more, this carving comes from a quest through much rougher terrain than the others.</p>\n    <p>“In ancient times, reaching this harsh and sparsely populated environment would have been even more challenging,” said Hou Guangliang, who discovered the inscription in 2020. “The inscription shows that as early as the Qin dynasty, people bravely explored the Tibetan Plateau.”</p>\n    <h2>The Debate Surrounding This Historic Inscription</h2>\n    <p>Since the discovery of the inscription, archaeologists and historians have debated whether it’s a genuine Qin-era carving.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/qin-shi-huang-elixir-of-life-inscription.jpeg\" alt=\"Qin Shi Huang Elixir Of Life Inscription\"/>\n    <p>Zhai XiangThe inscription describes how “level five grand master Yi” was ordered by Qin Shi Huang to lead a team of alchemists to Kunlun Mountain in search of the elixir of life.</p>\n    <p>For one, it uses xiaozhuan script, which does suggest it was made during the Qin dynasty. Additionally, archaeologists found that the carvings were made with a flat-edged tool, which is consistent with Qin-era technology.</p>\n    <p>Researchers also found evidence excluding the possibility that modern alloy tools were responsible for creating the inscription. The inscription furthermore showed signs of long-term weathering, also making it unlikely that it’s a recently created forgery.</p>\n    <p>“The evidence is clear, but that does not mean those who are skeptical will be convinced,” said Li Yuelin, a physicist at the Argonne National Laboratory in the United States. “There will always be people who will argue and claim that it is fake.”</p>\n    <p>Even though the carving has now been declared legitimate by China’s National Cultural Heritage Administration, there are some who have doubts and want more transparency regarding the authentication process.</p>\n    <p>One of the people who speculated that the inscription could be a forgery was Xin Deyong, a history professor at Peking University. After the carving was verified, Deyong took to social media to request that the National Cultural Heritage Administration release both its verification reports and the names of the specific experts involved in the authentication process.</p>\n    <p>“This is a major academic issue that the academic community has the right to know.

    "body": "<h2>Sarah McLachlan launched Lilith Fair out of frustration with the male-dominated music industry — and it quickly sold out venues across the U.S. and Canada.</h2>\n<p>Jason Philbrook/Wikimedia CommonsLilith Fair ran for three consecutive years in the 1990s and featured all female artists.</p>\n<p>Lilith Fair, a touring music festival that traveled across the United States and Canada for three summers between 1997 and 1999, was similar to other festivals in many regards. There were massive crowds, multiple stages, and artists who ranged from world-famous to virtually unheard of.</p>\n<p>However, there was one aspect of Lilith Fair that was incredibly unique: Every single performer was a woman.</p>\n<p>The all-female festival made waves at a time when music industry executives didn’t believe that female artists could sell tickets. In fact, Canadian singer Sarah McLachlan came up with the idea for Lilith Fair after she was told that concert lineups and radio stations wouldn’t feature two women back-to-back because it wasn’t profitable.</p>\n<p>Lilith Fair quickly proved these assumptions wrong. It was the top-grossing touring festival in 1997, selling out most of its venues. And over its three-year run, it brought in tens of millions of dollars and launched the careers of women who went on to become some of the biggest names in the music industry.</p>\n<h2>The Spiteful Origins Of Lilith Fair</h2>\n<p>Sarah McLachlan conceived the idea of Lilith Fair in 1996 after she became frustrated with sexism in the entertainment industry. Executives told her that more than one female headliner wasn’t good for ticket sales, even after she’d sold more than 2.8 million albums.</p>\n<p>Doug Wilson / Alamy Stock PhotoThe massive crowd at Lilith Fair during its stop at the Gorge in Washington State. 1997.</p>\n<p>As McLachlan told <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/07/05/1108635464/25-years-on-lilith-fair-is-a-reminder-of-how-one-womans-radical-idea-changed-mus\">NPR</a> in 2022, “I’d walk in and do an interview and they said, ‘Well, we’d love to add this song but we can’t add you this week because we had a Tori Amos or because we added Tracy Chapman or because we added Sinéad O’Connor. And it was extremely frustrating.”</p>\n<p>“So the beginning of this was just born out of the desire to come together as a community,” McLachlan continued. “And it became this — we’re going to break down some barriers. We’re going to prove these guys wrong.”</p>\n<p>McLachlan knew her experience wasn’t isolated, so she brought together dozens of other female bands and performers to put on a festival that would show that women could sell tickets — millions of them.</p>\n<p>McLachlan and her co-organizers chose a name fitting of a festival born out of resistance. It was called Lilith Fair after the mythological figure who was said to be Adam’s first wife but refused to submit to him.</p>\n<p>Public DomainJohn Collier’s 1887 painting of Lilith, the rebellious woman after which Lilith Fair was named.</p>\n<p>The first year was a smashing success. Lilith Fair sold out almost every single show and brought in over $16 million, becoming the top-earning touring festival and even beating out Lollapalooza in ticket sales and crowd sizes.</p>\n<p>Lilith Fair visited 37 cities in its first year, with its main stage acts including artists like Fiona Apple, Tracy Chapman, Sheryl Crow, the Indigo Girls, and Jewel. It was so successful that organizers decided to run it again the following year. But despite the festival’s accomplishments, it still faced plenty of criticism.</p>\n<h2>The Return Of The Groundbreaking Festival</h2>\n<p>Lilith Fair quickly became a target for misogynistic comments, as well as some not-so-tactful jokes. It was dubbed “Lesbopalooza,” and the artists who performed onstage were called out for their “mom music.”</p>\n<p>However, amongst the tasteless remarks were legitimate critiques, like how the ’97 lineup lacked diversity. So, organizers worked to increase the number of artists of color for the ’98 tour, securing singers like Queen Latifah, Erykah Badu, and Missy Elliot.</p>\n<p>In fact, Lilith Fair marked Missy Elliot’s first live performance. The festival also furthered the careers of up-and-coming artists like Dido, Nelly Furtado, and Christina Aguilera.</p>\n<p>HollenbeckTAH/Wikimedia CommonsElisabeth Carlisle and Meredith Brooks onstage at Lilith Fair 1999.</p>\n<p>The women who were part of Lilith Fair knew that it was something special. Meshell Ndegeocello, who was part of the 1998 lineup, told NPR, “I was able to see people I admired but cherished in a way that had a musical connection to me that was uplifting and healing. And I think I flourished as a musician because I was out of the male gaze.”</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Lilith Fair’s third run in 1999 would be the festival’s last until its brief 2010 revival. It wasn’t for a lack of success — McLachlan was simply exhausted. Several big milestones were happening in both her personal and professional lives: She got married, released albums, and was getting ready to go on her own tour. She simply no longer had the time to put Lilith Fair together.</p>\n<p>However, the festival’s legacy endured, both for the fans who attended and the artists who performed.</p>\n<h2>Lilith Fair Still Serves As An Inspiration Today</h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/lilith-fair\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Also known as <i>horiatiki</i> (Greek for “peasant salad” or “village salad”), this rustic dish is a chunky assemblage of tomatoes, cucumbers, black olives, red onion, and a <i>substantial</i> amount of feta—many traditional recipes are crowned with thick slabs of it. Anointed with a bright, herby dressing of lemon juice, red wine vinegar (sometimes), dried oregano, and extra-virgin olive oil, it’s a marvelous, Mediterranean way to celebrate <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/g65104794/summer-produce-recipes/\">summer produce</a>. The best part? This easy recipe only takes 15 minutes to prepare, making it a perfect last-minute addition to any meal. Ready to make it your own? Keep reading on for all of my top tips: </p>\n    <p><strong>What People Are Saying:</strong><br/>\"Love it. We are a Greek family and it's a favorite every time. Even Mum is impressed.\" -<i>GoldDucky</i> </p>\n    <p>\"Made it &amp; my family loves it! I’m making it for a picnic this weekend as well. Thanks for sharing the recipe!\" <i>-GreenMustache</i> </p>\n    <p>Sharpen your chef’s knife and prep those ingredients! If you’re going to soak the red onion (to reduce its pungency), now’s the time to do it. Be sure to cut the feta into large cubes so it doesn’t wind up as crumbles. The tomatoes and olives should stay chunky—just halve them and move on. Now combine everything in a large bowl and admire all those colors.</p>\n    <p>On to the dressing: To get a good emulsion, you want to combine the water-based ingredients (the lemon juice and vinegar) first and then gradually whisk in the oil until the dressing is slightly thickened and completely homogeneous. A well-emulsified dressing won’t separate and will wrap the salad ingredients in a loving embrace rather than run right off them. When seasoning the dressing, bear in mind that the feta is quite salty. </p>\n    <p>Pour the dressing over the salad and toss gently, trying not to break up the feta. Now dig in. I told you this was simple!</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>The full list of ingredients and directions can be found in the recipe below.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>This salad is best eaten fresh, but if you have any leftovers, store them in the fridge for up to 3 days.</p>\n    <p>cucumber, halved lengthwise, thinly sliced into half-moons</p>\n    <p>red onion, thinly sliced</p>\n    <p>grape or cherry tomatoes, halved</p>\n    <p>halved pitted Kalamata olives</p>\n    <p>feta, cut into 1/2\" cubes</p>\n    <p>red wine vinegar</p>\n    <p>Juice of 1/2 lemon</p>\n    <p>dried oregano</p>\n    <p>Kosher salt</p>\n    <p>Freshly ground black pepper</p>\n    <p>extra-virgin olive oil</p>\n    <p>Let us know how it went in the comments below! </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a54226/best-greek-salad-recipe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

While stripping away the <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a51229/loaded-potato-skins-recipe/\">skins</a> to reveal the clean <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/g3030/potato-recipes/\">potato</a> underneath can be a genuinely enjoyable task—at least for those of us who get a kick out of cleaning—around the <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/holiday-recipes/\">holidays</a>, or any other event that calls for peeling mountains of potatoes, it’s important to figure out the quickest and most effective ways to get the job done.</p>\n    <h2>Why Should You Peel Potatoes?</h2>\n    <p>Potato peels are completely edible and actually contain a good amount of fiber, vitamins, and other nutrients that are beneficial to our health; however, they do change the texture of potato recipes. Some people prefer skins in their mashed potatoes, but if you want a smoother <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a51451/easy-chicken-parmesan-recipe/\"> mashed potato</a>, or especially with a pommes purée, you’re going to want to remove those fibrous skins. Though, honestly, often the decision of whether or not to peel potatoes breaks down to a matter of taste.</p>\n    <p>Now I know I’m talking all about the best ways to get skin off of potatoes, but it’s a shame to waste them! Turn those strips into our <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/a46487812/veggie-peel-chips-recipe/\"> veggie peel chips</a>.</p>\n    <h2>How To Peel Potatoes</h2>\n    <p>The simplest method for peeling potatoes is also the most straightforward. Simply grab your potato peeler in your non-dominant hand and work your way down the potato, peeling the skin in vertical strokes, and turning the potato as you go so that once you make a full 360° rotation, all the skin that is left is at the very top and bottom of the potato. At this point, go ahead and use the peeler to clean both ends of the potato until all the skin is removed. Repeat these steps with each potato that you’re using, and be careful not to accidentally catch your skin with the peeler.</p>\n    <p>Different potatoes have skins with varying thicknesses, but each can be peeled easily and quickly using a potato or vegetable peeler. This method is certainly the quickest and simplest way to peel a small number of potatoes, but if you need to work through an especially large batch, you may want to check out the next method.</p>\n    <h2>Other Methods Worth Trying</h2>\n    <p>Another potato peeling technique that you may consider trying doesn’t actually involve a potato peeler at all. This method calls for scoring each potato all the way around the middle and then placing them in a pot to boil. Once the potatoes have cooked long enough to be fork-tender, remove them from the pot and either set them on a cutting board to cool or dunk them into an ice bath to cool more quickly. Then, once they are cool enough to handle comfortably, pull the skin in either direction away from the center, and it should slide right off.</p>\n    <p>This method works great if you are using a lot of potatoes at once, but it does have a few limitations. For one, this method obviously isn’t great for any recipes where you don’t want to use boiled potatoes, so it limits the recipes where this would be helpful. Another drawback is that this method only really works for potatoes with thicker skins, like russets or sweet potatoes. With thinner-skinned varieties like Yukon gold or Idaho yellow potatoes, the skin isn’t going to peel away easily, and you’ll be left with chunks of potato sticking to the torn potato peels.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/kitchen-tools/kitchen-secrets/a67961345/how-to-peel-potatoes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

While there are plenty of delicious ways to make them, this recipe is my all-time favorite. The homemade fried shallots contribute crunch and texture, while the homemade shallot oil gives the <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/g40189579/salad-dressing-recipes/\">dressing</a> an irresistibly rich and aromatic twist. Boiling the farro in veggie broth, rather than water, infuses this already flavorful <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/g42229861/grain-bowl-recipes/\">grain</a> with even more flavor. And then there are all the mix-ins—nuts, cheese, fruit, greens—which lend the <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/g30717155/spring-salads/\">salad</a> substance and make every bite an adventure. I love this salad as is, but if you want to make it your own, keep reading on for all of my top tips: </p>\n    <p><strong>What People Are Saying:</strong><br/>\"This has to be my favorite recipe. I made it for a potluck and my friend's food snob husband asked for the recipe. now in their regular potluck/party rotation, too.\" - <i>GoldBattery</i></p>\n    <p>\"This is THE BEST farro recipe ever. And I say that as someone who has been making farro recipes for years. Perfection. I’ve made it twice in the span of a week. Thank you.\" - <i>ElizabethL</i></p>\n    <p>Alright, let's get going on the farro! Grab a medium saucepan and add the farro, vegetable broth, bay leaf, and 1/2 tsp. salt. Bring it to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cover with a lid. Let it cook away until the farro has absorbed all the liquid. We're aiming for tender but still with a bit of chew; no one wants mushy farro! By the end of cooking the farro should be plump and slightly split, which is just perfect. This will take about 30 minutes. Once it's done, transfer the farro to a large bowl and let it cool.</p>\n    <p>Now let's make the crispy shallots! Grab a small saucepan and add the olive oil and shallots. Heat over medium until the shallots start bubbling. Cook, stirring occasionally and adjusting the heat as needed to keep them gently bubbling away, until the shallots are golden brown and crisp. This usually takes 15 to 20 minutes, but keep a close eye on the shallots once they begin to brown because things can move quickly from there. To test for crispiness, remove one with a slotted spoon—if it slumps, it’s not done yet! When the shallots are ready, remove the pan from the heat and use a slotted spoon to transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate and immediately season with a pinch of salt. Let the oil cool—you’ll need it for the dressing in just a bit.</p>\n    <p>When the shallot oil has cooled completely, it’s time to make the dressing. Transfer the shallot oil to a medium bowl, then add the vinegar, mustard, and honey. Grab a whisk and prepare yourself for a little culinary calisthenics. Vigorously whisk the dressing until it thickens and emulsifies, and the honey is fully dissolved. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</p>\n    <p>Okay, some assembly required! Add the shallots, arugula, apple, Parmesan, basil, parsley, and pecans to the farro. Drizzle the dressing over and toss gently to bring it all together. Now that’s what I call the best farro salad <i>ever</i>!</p>\n    <p><i>The full list of ingredients and directions can be found in the recipe below. </i> </p>\n    <p>I highly recommend treating this salad as a template for a great grain salad. So long as you’ve got all the requisite elements—sweet, salty, soft, crunchy, fatty, and fresh—you’re golden. Not a fan of pecans? Use walnuts instead! Got some extra pears on hand?

And while the requisite candy is a good pairing for any night on the couch, no movie is really complete without popcorn. To give yourself the most authentic experience at home, freshly popped is the only way to go. And when time is of the essence, nothing beats <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/food-news/a62718777/reasons-not-to-eat-microwave-popcorn/\">microwave popcorn</a>. But like anything, not all are created equal. </p>\n    <p>The team at Delish is quite particular (and varied) when it comes to <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/g1005/popcorn-recipes/\">popcorn</a> preferences—some prefer loads of butter, while others enjoy simple, salted kernels. For the sake of journalism, we tested 10 different brands and more than 15 varieties of microwave popcorn to determine which ones are worth stocking up on for your next night in. Without further ado, here are the top five brands that we would gladly buy again.  </p>\n    <h2>Best Overall: Kirkland Signature Movie Theater Butter</h2>\n    <p>Honestly, is there anything <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/costco/\">Costco</a> doesn't succeed at? Its store-brand microwave popcorn was beloved across the board in our office, with people praising its \"incredible texture\" and \"nice crunch.\" Others said it had a great salt level and well-balanced flavor, though a few thought it could use more butter. And with a box of 44 bags, you're unlikely to run out anytime soon. Overall, you won't be disappointed with this pick, whether you prefer butter or salt. </p>\n    <h2>Best Salted Popcorn: Orville Redenbacher's Naturals Simply Salted</h2>\n    <p>People really enjoyed this popcorn, noting its freshness and superior salt ratio. Comments ranged from \"can't stop eating\" to \"perfect balance.\" One editor likened it to high school <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/game-day-super-bowl-recipes/\">football game</a> concession popcorn (positive), and another mentioned they expected it to be bland, but it wasn't. \"Our guy Orville knows how to salt,\" wrote another.  </p>\n    <h2>Best Better-For-You Popcorn: SkinnyPop Butter</h2>\n    <p>If you're looking for popcorn with minimal ingredients, this is your best bet. The brand avoids using common additives in microwave popcorn, including artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives. \"Yum!\" wrote one editor. Another said it had a nice butter-forwardness and a fresh, bouncy mouthfeel. One editor wrote, \"This is the buttery popcorn I'd serve my vegan friends\" (yes, it's <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/vegan-food-recipes/\">vegan</a>!). Another Delish staffer said it may even be better than their bagged popcorn, while someone else called it \"a personal fave.\"  </p>\n    <h2>Best Movie Theater Butter Popcorn: Orville Redenbacher's Movie Theater Butter</h2>\n    <p>If you're trying to recreate that classic butter-on-your-fingers vibe from the <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/food-news/a63267198/movie-theater-popcorn-buckets/\">movie theater</a>, this is the bag to grab. One tester wrote, \"My favorite. Very close to movie theater popcorn,\" while another echoed similar sentiments, saying it was a good replica of the real deal. The combo of salt and butter makes this a solid indulgent option if you want to that classic moviegoing feel.  </p>\n    <h2>Best Budget-Friendly Popcorn: Newman's Own Touch Of Butter</h2>\n    <p>Another high-scorer in our ranking was this simple option, which also happens to be one of the cheaper picks on this list. Editors noted the popcorn was very \"corn forward,\" and one person wrote, \"I love her so much.\" Others said it was a good classic because it was neither too salty nor too buttery (though it leans a bit more salty than buttery).</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/food/a67949033/best-microwave-popcorn-taste-tested/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Learn more about the </strong>\n      <strong>Delish app</strong>\n      <strong>.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>The beans:</strong><br/>Cannellini beans are usually my white bean of choice. Large and creamy, they’re amazing in everything from <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a57946/easy-white-chicken-chili-recipe/\"> chili</a> to </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a46341540/creamy-white-bean-dip-recipe/\">, and they serve as a perfect blank canvas here for the cheese and black pepper. That said, if you don’t have them, navy or great northern beans would also work well.</a>\n    </p>\n    <u>dips</u>\n    <p>While I typically rinse canned beans before using them, in this case, I recommend simply draining them. The excess canning liquid that clings to the beans will help thicken the sauce (see below!).</p>\n    <p><strong>The sauce:</strong><br/>Typical cacio e pepe pasta is thickened with a combination of cheese and starch from the pasta. Here we’re harnessing the starch of the beans to create a creamy, luscious sauce. The sauce will continue to solidify as it cools, but don’t worry: If it gets too thick, you can always loosen it up by adding a few tablespoons of water.</p>\n    <p><strong>Storage:</strong><br/>These beans are best the day they’re made, but any leftovers can be refrigerated for up to 3 days in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Since the sauce will thicken as it sits, I highly recommend adding a few tablespoons of water to the beans before reheating them.</p>\n    <p>Did you try making this?

Once licensed in one country, companies would be able to “passport” their services across the bloc without navigating a patchwork of local rules.</p><p>But less than a year into implementation, national regulators in countries including France, Italy, and Austria <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/france-block-passporting-unified-eu-mica-regulations\" title=\"null\">are voicing concerns</a> that passporting could encourage firms to choose jurisdictions with lighter oversight, a practice known as regulatory arbitrage.</p><p>“Regulatory competition in Europe is nothing new,” said Jerome Castille, head of compliance and regulatory affairs for Europe at CoinShares. </p><blockquote>“We saw retail trading platforms flock to Cyprus and Malta under MiFID. With MiCA, the expectation was that this time it would be different. But again, we kind of see firms choosing jurisdictions seen as more accommodating. And if people start thinking that not all licenses are equal, then the whole single market promise goes away.”</blockquote><p>The issue, according to Castille, is not a lack of rules but a lack of consistent implementation. “Europe already has a very high level of investor protection and probably the highest globally,” he explained. </p><blockquote data-ct-non-breakable=\"undefined\">“The real issue right now is ensuring that MiCA is fully implemented. Without formal guidance, national regulators are making their own call. That’s where divergence or even regulatory arbitrage comes from. If we get that right, the market becomes both safe and attractive for global players. If we don’t, innovation will look elsewhere.”</blockquote><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitgo-bafin-mica-crypto-trading-europe\" title=\"null\"><em><strong>BitGo secures license to launch regulated crypto trading in Europe</strong></em></a></p><h2>Little fish big pond</h2><p>For smaller firms, the rollout is proving particularly challenging. Marina Markezic, executive director of the European Crypto Initiative, noted that capacity gaps between regulators and the pace of new rules could squeeze startups out of the market. </p><p>“It is very intense to be compliant in a very short amount of time,” she said. </p><blockquote data-ct-non-breakable=\"undefined\">“For the biggest ones, having one single access to the whole European Union market is really positive. But unfortunately, for the smaller companies, it’s a really big burden and they might not survive this process.”</blockquote><p>While MiCA was Europe’s bid to lead on crypto regulation, its success will depend on whether the rules are applied evenly across the bloc. </p><p>As Markezic added, “There are 27 different national competent authorities supervising the same regulation. Some are bigger, some smaller, some more experienced, some less. It’s really a test for Europe to see if we’re able to supervise consistently.”</p><p data-ct-non-breakable=\"undefined\">Listen to the full episode of <em>Byte-Sized Insight</em> for the complete interview on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/podcasts/decentralize-with-cointelegraph\" title=\"null\">page</a>, <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/decentralize-with-cointelegraph/id1667543601\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"null\">Apple Podcasts</a> or <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/3ggY18n7dqoxPGljBdRFrj\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"null\">Spotify</a>.

This leads to strict reserve, disclosure and governance rules; algorithmic stablecoins are effectively banned. Scotti’s commentary indicates that she fears that a multi-issuance stablecoin may undermine the effectiveness of some of those rules.</p><h2>Stablecoins recognized as promising tools</h2><p>Scotti highlighted that the robustness of the multi-issuance stablecoin model “hinges on strong cross-border cooperation among supervisory authorities, including mechanisms to consistently monitor and verify the adequacy of reserves.”</p><p>She recognized that stablecoins are “promising tools for lowering transaction costs, enhancing efficiency and enabling 24/7 availability.” She argued, however, that only stablecoins pegged to a single fiat currency are suitable as payment instruments.</p><blockquote>“It is worth noting that while various types of crypto products are used as a means of payment, only stablecoins pegged to a single fiat currency are suitable for this function, also because they offer a high level of customer protection through the right to redemption at their nominal value.“</blockquote><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/italian-gov-ramp-up-surveillance-cryptocurrency-market\" rel=\"\" target=\"_self\" title=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/italian-gov-ramp-up-surveillance-cryptocurrency-market\"><em><strong>Italian gov’t to ramp up surveillance of crypto market</strong></em></a></p><h2>Italy takes firm stance on stablecoins</h2><p>Italian regulators have voiced concerns over the rise of stablecoins. <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/cryptocurrency-regulations-in-italy\" rel=\"\" target=\"_self\" title=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/cryptocurrency-regulations-in-italy\">Italy’s</a> financial markets regulator, Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa, joined regulators in France and Austria to call for <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/france-block-mica-passporting-eu-crypto-firms\" rel=\"\" target=\"_self\" title=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/france-block-mica-passporting-eu-crypto-firms\">regulatory supervision of crypto firms to be transferred</a> to the Paris-based European Securities and Markets Authority.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/digital-euro-not-mica-control-crypto-risks-bank-italy\" rel=\"\" target=\"_self\" title=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/digital-euro-not-mica-control-crypto-risks-bank-italy\">At the end of May</a>, Fabio Panetta, a former European Central Bank official and Governor of the Bank of Italy, suggested that a euro-based <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-cbdcs-a-beginners-guide-to-central-bank-digital-currencies\" rel=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-cbdcs-a-beginners-guide-to-central-bank-digital-currencies\" target=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-cbdcs-a-beginners-guide-to-central-bank-digital-currencies\" title=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-cbdcs-a-beginners-guide-to-central-bank-digital-currencies\">central bank digital currency</a> is the right tool for addressing the risks associated with increasing cryptocurrency adoption, rather than regulating cryptocurrencies.

That suggests the buyers are not rushing to the exit as they anticipate a move toward the all-time high of $124,474.</p>\n<p>BTC researcher Axel Adler Jr. said in a post on X that the “market is neither overheated nor oversold” at the current level. That could result in one to two weeks of consolidation before <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-has-70percent-chance-of-hitting-new-highs-in-2-weeks-analyst\" title=\"null\">BTC rises to a new all-time high</a>.</p>\n<p>Several analysts expect BTC to hit a new all-time high. Into The Cryptoverse founder Benjamin Cowen said in an interview that the rally could peak quickly after making a new high. Once the top is in, Cowen does not rule out <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-drawdown-bear-market-buying-dip-benjamin-cowen\" title=\"null\">a 70% fall in the next bear market</a>.</p>\n<p>Could BTC break out of its overhead resistance, pulling altcoins higher? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.</p>\n<h2>Bitcoin price prediction</h2>\n<p>BTC pierced the $117,500 overhead resistance on Thursday, but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels.</p>\n<p>The upsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($114,457) and the relative strength index (RSI) in the positive territory suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside. A close above $117,500 opens the gates for a rally to $124,474.</p>\n<p>Contrary to this assumption, a break below the 20-day EMA signals that the bulls are closing their positions in a hurry. The BTC/USDT pair could then drop to $110,000, remaining inside the $107,000 to $117,500 range for a while longer.</p>\n<h2>Ether price prediction</h2>\n<p>Ether (<a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\" title=\"null\">ETH</a>) has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating indecision between the buyers and sellers.</p>\n<p>If the price turns down and breaks below the support line, it signals that the uncertainty has resolved in favor of the bears. The ETH/USDT pair could collapse to $4,060 and, after that, to the pattern target of $3,426.</p>\n<p>Buyers will be back in the driver’s seat if they kick the price above the resistance line. That improves the prospects of the resumption of the uptrend. The Ether price could then rally toward the pattern target of $5,586.</p>\n<h2>XRP price prediction</h2>\n<p>XRP (<a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\" title=\"null\">XRP</a>) turned up from the 20-day EMA ($2.99) on Tuesday, but the bulls could not clear the overhead barrier at $3.20.</p>\n<p>The bears are striving to pull the price below the moving averages to seize control. If they succeed, the XRP/USDT pair could descend toward the strong support at $2.73. Such a move suggests the breakout above the downtrend line was a bull trap. A close below $2.69 will complete the bearish descending triangle pattern, clearing the path for a fall to $2.20.</p>\n<p>The bulls will have to push and sustain the price above $3.20 to signal a short-term trend change. The XRP price may then ascend to $3.40 and eventually to $3.66. </p>\n<h2>BNB price prediction</h2>\n<p>BNB (<a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index\" title=\"null\">BNB</a>) jumped over the psychological level of $1,000 on Thursday, indicating sustained demand from the bulls. </p>\n<p>The bears will try to defend the $1,000 level, but if the buyers prevail, the BNB/USDT pair could extend the rally to $1,090.</p>\n<p>The 20-day EMA ($915) is the critical support to watch out for on the downside. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to resume the up move.</p>\n<p>Sellers will have to pull and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA to signal strength. The BNB price may then collapse to the 50-day SMA ($855).</p>\n<h2>Solana price prediction</h2>\n<p>Solana (<a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index\" title=\"null\">SOL</a>) turned down from $253 on Thursday, indicating that the bears are aggressively defending the $260 level.</p>\n<p>The pullback is likely to find support at the 20-day EMA ($225). If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with force, the bulls will again attempt to clear the overhead hurdle at $260. If they manage to pull it off, the SOL/USDT pair could skyrocket toward $295.</p>\n<p>Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA suggests the bulls are booking profits. That could pull the Solana price to the uptrend line, which is likely to attract buyers.</p>\n<h2>Dogecoin price prediction</h2>\n<p>Dogecoin (<a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/doge-price-index\" title=\"null\">DOGE</a>) turned up from the $0.26 level on Tuesday, but the bulls are facing stiff resistance from the bears at $0.29.</p>\n<p>If the price rebounds off the $0.26 level again, it shows that the bulls are buying on every minor dip. That increases the likelihood of a break above $0.31. If that happens, the DOGE/USDT pair could start a new up move to $0.35 and subsequently to $0.44.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, a break below the 20-day EMA ($0.25) suggests that the bulls have given up. The Dogecoin price may then tumble to the 50-day SMA ($0.23). That could keep the pair range-bound between $0.21 and $0.29 for some time. </p>\n<h2>Cardano price prediction</h2>\n<p>Cardano (<a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ada-price-index\" title=\"null\">ADA</a>) turned down from the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle pattern, signaling that the bears are fiercely defending the level.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/price-predictions-9-19-btc-eth-xrp-bnb-sol-doge-ada-hype-link-avax?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p><strong>Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead.</strong></p><p>Grab a coffee because the year’s final stretch is shaping up to be pivotal for Bitcoin (BTC). With the Federal Reserve (Fed) beginning what looks like its rate-cutting cycle, analysts believe the pioneer crypto could be setting up for a record-breaking run.</p><h2>Crypto News of the Day: Analysts Eye $145,000 Bitcoin by December as Liquidity Shifts After Fed Cuts</h2>Sponsored<p>Bitcoin bulls are finding fresh momentum after the <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-rises-as-us-federal-reserve-opts-for-25bps-rate-cut/\">Fed’s September rate cut</a>, with analysts now projecting a potential year-end rally toward record highs.</p><p>With <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/feds-25bps-cut-labor-risks-inflation-liquidity-bets/\">liquidity dynamics shifting</a> and institutional flows accelerating, some analysts believe Bitcoin could end 2025 near the $145,000 mark.</p><p>John Glover, Ledn’s Chief Investment Officer, told BeInCrypto he expects a sharp move higher as investors reposition for a weaker dollar.</p><blockquote><p>“I’m forecasting a BTC price of circa $140,000 to $145,000 by year’s end. The rate cuts will help to push this narrative as money moves to BTC for safe haven among expectations of a USD devaluation,” Glover said.</p></blockquote><p>This forecast suggests a growing conviction that the Fed’s policy pivot will funnel capital into non-yielding, alternative assets like Bitcoin.</p><p>With real interest rates under pressure, digital assets are increasingly framed as macro hedges and liquidity beneficiaries. Jake Kennis, Senior Research Analyst at Nansen, echoed the bullish tone.</p><blockquote><p>“With the Fed cutting 25 bps and its projections indicating two additional cuts by December, the macro backdrop turns more supportive for Bitcoin into year-end,” Kennis told BeInCrypto.</p></blockquote><p>However, the Nansen executive articulated that the Fed’s path is not the only driver. In his opinion, end-of-year levels hinge more on real rates, dollar strength, liquidity, and broader market dynamics.</p>Sponsored Sponsored<p>Kennis highlighted that lower policy rates reduce the opportunity cost of <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/how-to-buy-bitcoin-in-four-easy-steps\">holding Bitcoin</a> and can ease financial conditions.</p><p>If real yields drift lower and <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-bitcoin-etf\">Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded funds)</a> inflows persist, he believes the “path of least resistance is higher.”</p><p>Still, Nansen’s Kennis warned that recessionary cuts could weigh on broader risk assets, potentially tempering crypto upside.</p><h2>Institutional Flows and Options Markets Signal Growing Confidence in Bitcoin</h2><p>Institutional participation also marks a major shift from previous cycles. <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/how-to-prepare-bitcoin-etf\">US spot Bitcoin ETFs</a>, alongside the rise of digital asset treasuries (DATs), reported in a recent <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/standard-chartered-ethereum-treasuries-us-crypto-news/\">US Crypto News</a> publication, have simplified allocations for funds, pensions, and corporates.</p><p>If the SEC finalizes a <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/altcoins-benefit-sec-new-etf-listing-standards/\">generic listing framework for spot digital-asset ETFs</a>, as reports suggest, product breadth could expand further, accelerating mainstream adoption.</p><p>Markets appear to be adjusting in real time. <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/rate-cut-roulette-0-25-50-bps-bitcoin-altcoins/\">Bitcoin has held above $115,000 in the post-FOMC rally</a>, with Glassnode data showing 95% of supply now in profit.</p><p><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-ethereum-options-expire-today-volatility/\">Options markets also reflect the bullish tilt</a>. Open interest has surged toward record levels ahead of next week’s massive September 26 expiry, where $18 billion in notional contracts come due.</p><p>While skeptics caution that <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/\">volatility</a> spikes and profit-taking remain likely, the narrative of rate cuts fueling Bitcoin as a macro hedge is gaining ground.</p><p>If Glover’s and Kennis’ projections hold, Bitcoin could run 24% above current levels by year-end and realize the $145,000 target.</p>Sponsored Sponsored<h2>Chart of the Day</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZNJaovz9/\">TradingView</a></p><h2>Byte-Sized Alpha</h2><p>Here’s a summary of more US crypto news to follow today:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/binance-cz-trust-wallet-token-twt-utility-roadmap/\">Binance founder CZ sparks 25% Trust Wallet Token (TWT)</a>rally after utility roadmap reveal.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-may-slide-down-to-105k-if-it-loses-this-level/\">Bitcoin may drop to $105,000</a>if it loses this level.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-ethereum-options-expire-today-volatility/\">Over $4.3 billion Bitcoin &amp; Ethereum options expire today</a>–<a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/\">Volatility</a>ahead for BTC and ETH?</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/upbit-lists-four-altcoins-ethfi-resolv-init-spk/\">Upbit expands market</a>with four new altcoin listings.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/cathie-wood-backs-300m-solana-deal-on-italian-soccer-team-owner/\">Cathie Wood backs $300 million Solana deal</a>on Italian soccer team owner.</li><li>This is why <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/cardano-traders-should-prepare-for-liquidations/\">Cardano traders should prepare for $73 million liquidations</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-price-dip-before-120k-journey/\">Bitcoin price hints at a 2% dip</a>before resuming $120,000+ journey.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/xrp-etf-launch-breaks-records-but-price-lags/\">XRP ETF launch breaks records</a>, but price lags behind market rally.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/kalshi-overtakes-polymarket-nfl-season-prediction-market/\">Kalshi overtakes Polymarket</a>as NFL season fuels $500 million prediction market surge.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/paypal-usd-stellar-xlm-price/\">PayPal USD officially launches on Stellar</a>– What does this mean for XLM price?</li></ul><h2>Crypto Equities Pre-Market Overview</h2><table><row span=\"3\"><cell><i>Company</i></cell><cell><i>At the Close of September 18</i></cell><cell><i>Pre-Market Overview</i></cell></row><row span=\"3\"><cell>Strategy (MSTR)</cell><cell>$349.12</cell><cell>$348.44 (-0.19%)</cell></row><row span=\"3\"><cell>Coinbase (COIN)</cell><cell>$343.13</cell><cell>$341.00 (-0.62%)</cell></row><row span=\"3\"><cell>Galaxy Digital Holdings (GLXY)</cell><cell>$33.08</cell><cell>$32.70 (-1.15%)</cell></row><row span=\"3\"><cell>MARA Holdings (MARA)</cell><cell>$18.50</cell><cell>$18.34 (-0.86%)</cell></row><row span=\"3\"><cell>Riot Platforms (RIOT)</cell><cell>$17.51</cell><cell>$17.39 (-0.71%)</cell></row><row><cell>Core Scientific (CORZ)</cell><cell>$16.75</cell><cell>$16.90 (+0.90%)</cell></row></table><p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/finance/\">Google Finance</a></p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/fed-rate-cuts-bitcoin-145000-us-crypto-news/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The firm warns that a failure to do so could lead to a drop to $105,500.</p><h2>Record Options Expiration Looms</h2><p>Glassnode’s data shows that fears of a major price decline have lessened since the Fed’s announcement. While the spot market showed some minor selling pressure, risk-off positions in the derivatives market noticeably increased.</p>Sponsored<p>Open interest in the perpetuals market has slightly decreased. Glassnode noted that open interest, which had peaked at 3.95 million BTC, has now dropped to 3.78 million BTC. An analysis of liquidation data shows that while <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/high-spread-between-bitcoin-derivatives-and-spot/\">short positions were squeezed</a> just before the rate announcement, the proportion of long position liquidations increased after the rate cut.</p><p>The potential for major <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/\">volatility</a> remains, however, as the open interest in the options market has hit a record high of 5 million BTC. A record amount of these options are set to expire next Friday, on September 26.</p><h2>Drop Below $115,200 Could Break Momentum</h2><p>Glassnode suggests paying close attention to the Bitcoin options’ “max pain” price. With both a price increase and decrease on the table, a large-scale liquidation event on either side could have a significant impact on the spot price.</p><p>The current <a href=\"https://%244.3%20Billion%20Bitcoin%20&amp;%20Ethereum%20Options%20Expire%20Today%20%20BeInCrypto%20https://beincrypto.com%20%E2%80%BA%20bitcoin-ethereum-options-expi...\">max pain</a> price for long positions is $112,700, while for short positions it’s $121,600. As of this article’s writing, Bitcoin’s price is fluctuating around $116,990.</p><p>Most of the Bitcoin traded on-chain since the September FOMC has been above $115,200. Glassnode states that maintaining this price level is key to preserving momentum, while losing it risks a drop to $105,500.</p><p>Ultimately, staying above $115,200 would maintain demand-driven momentum, while a drop below that level risks a retraction into the $105,500 to $115,200 range. Glassnode concludes that a comprehensive look at the on-chain signals suggests that market participants may be in a state of waiting for Bitcoin’s direction to be decided.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-may-slide-down-to-105k-if-it-loses-this-level/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

At press time, it was trading near $117,100, up 1.3% in the past 24 hours and 3% over the week. The breakout from a head-and-shoulders pattern on September 10 still points higher, with a first target of $120,800.</strong></p><p>But not everything is smooth. Two on-chain red flags, selling from large balance groups and younger coin holders, hint at a possible 2% correction before the rally resumes.</p><h2>Selling Pressure Builds From Large Balance Groups</h2>Sponsored<p>Two of Bitcoin’s biggest wallet groups have trimmed their holdings since September 15. These groups are often referred to as “whales” and “sharks” — wallets holding 1,000–10,000 BTC and 10,000–100,000 BTC, respectively.</p><ul><li>The 1,000–10,000 BTC group dropped their holdings from 4.35 million BTC to 4.33 million BTC.</li><li>The 10,000–100,000 BTC group fell from 2.17 million BTC to 2.16 million BTC.</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://app.santiment.net/charts/BK58RjBT__sCl\">Santiment</a></p><p>That’s a net outflow of about 30,000 BTC in just four days. With today’s <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-price-soars-following-fed-rate-cut/\">Bitcoin price</a> above $117,000, nearly $3.5 billion worth of BTC has been trimmed from holdings.</p><p><strong>Want more token insights like this? </strong>Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya’s Daily Crypto Newsletter <a href=\"https://go.beincrypto.com/4lUzHZj\">here</a>.</p><p>Such drops often signal that large investors are booking profits or preparing for <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/\">volatility</a>.</p><h2>Younger Coins Show Fresh Selling</h2><p>Another key on-chain signal confirms the picture: Spent Output Age Bands. This metric shows what percentage of coins from different “age groups” are being moved or sold. In other words, it tracks how much of the supply last moved weeks or months ago is now being spent again.</p><p>Over the past two weeks, every younger age cohort has increased its share of spent coins:</p><ul><li>1 week to 1 month holders: rose from 8.72% to 9.78%.</li><li>1 to 3 month holders: rose from 3.67% to 6.08%.</li><li>3 to 6 month holders: rose from 2.04% to 3.26%.</li><li>6 to 12 month holders: rose from 1.64% to 3.18%. (relatively younger considering BTC’s history)</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://studio.glassnode.com/charts/indicators.Soab?a=BTC&amp;mScl=lin&amp;s=1757047420&amp;u=1758257020&amp;zoom=14\">Glassnode</a></p><p>These cohorts are considered “younger” because they bought or moved their coins within the last year. Unlike long-term holders who keep Bitcoin for multiple years, younger holders are quicker to sell into Bitcoin price rallies.</p><p>The rise across all four bands means more short- to mid-term holders might be cashing out. This aligns with the selling already visible from the big balance groups, forming a clear picture of near-term supply pressure.</p><h2>Bitcoin Price Chart Still Points Higher, But With Risks</h2>Sponsored<p>Despite the selling signs, the broader technical setup remains bullish. <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-price-flag-breakout-hurdle/\">Bitcoin broke above</a> an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on September 10, and the breakout level has held since then.

For Bitcoin, the expiring options have a notional value of $3.5 billion and a total open interest of 30,208.</p><p>With a Put-to-Call ratio 1.23, the maximum pain level for today’s expiring Bitcoin options is $114,000.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.deribit.com/statistics/BTC/metrics/options\">Deribit</a></p><p>For their Ethereum counterparts, the notional value for today’s expiring ETH options is $806.75 million, with total open interest of 177,398.</p><p>Unlike Bitcoin, however, today’s expiring Ethereum options have a Put-to-Call Ratio (PCR) below 1, with Deribit data showing 0.99 as of this writing. Meanwhile, the maximum pain level, or strike price, is $4,500.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.deribit.com/statistics/ETH/metrics/options\">Deribit</a></p><p>The maximum pain point is a crucial metric in <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/crypto-options-trading/\">crypto options trading</a>. It represents the price level at which most options contracts expire worthless. This scenario inflicts the maximum financial loss, or “pain,” on traders holding these options. </p><p>Notably, today’s expiring Bitcoin and Ethereum options are <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-ethereum-options-expiry-4-billion/\">slightly higher than last week’s</a>. On September 12, BeInCrypto reported nearly $4.3 billion expiring options, highlighting 29,651 BTC and 189,700 ETH contracts, with notional values of $3.42 billion and $858.2 million, respectively.</p><p>However, the main difference between this week’s expiring options and those seen last week is that this time, Ethereum expiring options have a PCR below 1.</p><p>A PCR below 1 indicates that more Call (Purchase) options are traded than Put (Sale) options. Therefore, this suggests a bullish market sentiment for Ethereum, and bearish sentiment for Bitcoin, which has more Puts than Calls.</p><p>Nevertheless, Bitcoin’s PCR at 1.23 and Ethereum’s at 0.99 suggest an almost balanced bet among traders between sale and purchase orders.</p><p>This balanced outlook comes as investors speculate whether the market will move higher or are hedging their portfolios in case of a sell-off.</p><h2>Options Market Signals Caution After Fed Cut as Record Expiry Looms</h2>Sponsored<p>In hindsight, it is worth noting that options had repriced ahead of the <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/feds-25bps-cut-labor-risks-inflation-liquidity-bets/\">Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision on Wednesday</a>.</p><p>With this, implied <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/\">volatility</a> for options contracts rose while trading volume declined, suggesting market caution.</p><blockquote><p>“Options are repricing ahead of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate meeting, with implied</p><a href=\"\">volatility</a>on options expiring tomorrow rising significantly. Recent actual<a href=\"\">volatility</a>has also been substantial, showing a marked increase compared to last month, yet actual trading volume has declined instead,” analysts at Greeks.live had<a href=\"\">noted</a>.</blockquote><p>Glassnode highlights a post-rate-cut patience in the market, with Bitcoin trading above 115,200 and 95% of supply in profit after the <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-rises-as-us-federal-reserve-opts-for-25bps-rate-cut/\">FOMC rally</a>.</p><blockquote><p>“</p><a href=\"\">Futures</a>show short squeezes, and options open interest hit a record 500,000 BTC ahead of the September 26 expiry. Holding above 115,200 is key while a drop risks a move back toward 105,500,”<a href=\"\">wrote</a>Glassnode analysts.</blockquote><p>Meanwhile, it is worth noting that next Friday, September 26, the largest weekly Bitcoin options expiry in history will be seen. On that day, over $18 billion in notional value will expire.</p>Sponsored Sponsored<p>At the $118,000 Bitcoin price level, over $2.4 billion is in the money, with a maximum pain of $110,000. The Put open interest is minimal until $110,000.</p><p>Therefore, next week could be interesting. The margin usually drives short-term price action, so markets should not be surprised to see a flush despite the sentiment.</p><p>In the meantime, however, traders should brace for <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/\">volatility</a> because the max pain concept often influences market behavior.</p><p>According to the Max Pain theory, the asset’s price tends to gravitate toward this level as options near expiration.</p><p>As the options near their expiry time, 8:00 UTC on Deribit, the Bitcoin price, <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/price/bitcoin/\">trading for $117,147 as of this writing</a>, could pull toward its max pain at $114,000. Meanwhile, Ethereum, which was <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/price/ethereum/\">trading for $4,590</a>, could drop toward $4,500.</p><p>Nevertheless, markets usually stabilize soon after traders adapt to the new price environment. With today’s high-volume expiration, traders and investors can expect a similar outcome, potentially influencing market trends into the weekend.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-ethereum-options-expire-today-volatility/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

One to six individuals can come together to form an SMSF.</p>\n<p>SMSFs are largely unique to Australia.

These investors plan to allocate an average of $67,000 to cryptocurrency, indicating a growing mainstream interest in digital assets for retirement portfolios.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, OKX took the lead by launching its SMSF product in June 2025, and the demand has exceeded expectations. OKX’s advantage lies in its simplified approach, providing not only crypto access but also connecting clients with accountants and legal advisers to facilitate SMSF setup and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-okx-crypto-australia-retirement-system\">compliance</a>.</p>\n<p>These efforts highlight how global exchanges are tailoring their strategies to Australia’s distinctive retirement savings market, where the scale and regulatory environment position SMSFs as a key entry point for cryptocurrency adoption.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Digital assets held in Australian SMSFs\" src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/36d86b39596f23c8ae34451b82f50db2.jpg\" title=\"Digital assets held in Australian SMSFs\"></p>\n<h2 data-ct-widget=\"explained-block-title\">                Multiple catalysts behind the move of Coinbase and OKX            </h2>\n<p data-ct-widget=\"explained-block-content\">                </p>\n<p><em>The efforts of Coinbase and OKX to enter Australia’s SMSFs are fueled by local demand and global policy changes.

Globally, policy developments are lending credibility to this trend. For example, a US executive order allowing cryptocurrency inclusion in 401(k) retirement plans indicates that digital assets are becoming part of mainstream retirement strategies.</p>\n<p>This global context strengthens confidence among Australian investors and regulators. Together, these factors explain why exchanges like Coinbase and OKX view SMSFs as a key opportunity for incorporating cryptocurrency into long-term savings.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> In a US Securities and Exchange Commission filing in February 2021, Tesla declared that it had bought <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$1.5 billion</a> worth of BTC.

Stablecoin opposers point to <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/stablecoin-risk-crypto-transactions-bitrace-2024-report\" title=\"null\">transfers of illicit funds</a>. Proponents argue that the transparent nature of blockchains <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/debunking-the-myth-cryptocurrency-is-used-for-criminal-activity\" title=\"null\">can be used to detect such crimes</a>. </p><p>There is a lack of awareness of how a deep integration of stablecoins in global finance can drive the use of blockchain’s properties of immutability and transparency to fight financial crimes, even in traditional finance.</p><h2>The stablecoin story</h2><p>The stablecoin industry is going from strength to strength, aided by increased regulatory clarity and meaningful use cases. The ability to facilitate swifter, more cost-effective transactions than traditional banking rails has accelerated their adoption worldwide. The total value in circulation is <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/stablecoin-market-cap-surpasses-200-b-as-usdc-dominance-rises\" title=\"null\">estimated to be north of $200 billion</a>.<br></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-08/019864ed-c95d-78ba-83be-6bb720d761b7\" title=\"\"><figcaption><em>Average supply of stablecoins in circulation, across all stablecoins. Source: World Economic Forum.</em></figcaption></figure><p>We now have a host of <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/genius-stablecoin-bill-opens-door-for-big-tech-stablecoin/\" title=\"null\">tech</a> firms, <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/walmart-amazon-explore-stablecoins-payments\" title=\"null\">retail</a> giants and traditional financial institutions lining up to issue their own stablecoins. The payment economy might be on a metaphorical spiral staircase that runs back to pre-Civil War times. Back then, the US had hundreds of local banks, each issuing their own private currency to be used as legal tender. Despite being a part of everyday payments, those currencies were not accepted too far away from the issuing bank. In hindsight, this probably kept an unintended check on any attempt to obfuscate the money trail.</p><h2>Tracking illicit finance</h2><p>In contrast, with thriving crosschain interoperability, it can be safely assumed that users will not have to jump through hoops to convert one stablecoin to another or any other digital asset or off-ramp them to fiat. This vision of the near future, marked by unabated and instantaneous capital flows across jurisdictions, naturally translates to stringent regulations to address illicit finance. </p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/real-time-crypto-laundering-cex-vulnerabilities-report\" rel=\"\" target=\"_self\" title=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/real-time-crypto-laundering-cex-vulnerabilities-report\"><em><strong>Real-time crypto laundering exposes CEX vulnerabilities — Report</strong></em></a></p><p><a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/genius-act-legitimizes-stablecoins-institutional-adoption\" title=\"null\">Regulatory</a> guardrails for stablecoins mandate adherence to the highest standards of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance. Surprisingly, the prowess of stablecoins themselves, to beef up law enforcement’s fight against financial crime, is not yet a part of the crypto zeitgeist. </p><p>Stablecoins flowing across the globe on immutable, transparent, public blockchains add teeth to the global fight against illicit finance by providing traceability in international finance with a much-needed leg up.</p><h2>The old world</h2><p>The archaic structure of traditional finance severely handicaps counter-crime initiatives. This is primarily because each bank or financial institution is a walled garden, a closed ecosystem in which the central authority controls all accesses, processes and user experiences. </p><p>Compliance professionals at each such financial institution can only investigate financial activity that transpired strictly within the virtual walls of the organization. This is a sliver of any entity’s entire set of commercial dealings, as any firm or person typically engages with multiple financial institutions. </p><p>Any walled garden hosts only a partial picture of their customers. </p><p>Suspicious Activity Reports filed by each bank are based on an incomplete picture of their customers, potentially causing misreporting of risk levels. Additionally, this outdated predicament causes significant inefficiency for law enforcement agencies, as they must separately obtain access to records from each financial institution that the entity under investigation might have touched and then proceed to painstakingly stitch together the complete picture.</p><h2>The new world</h2><p>A world with agile, international capital flows on stablecoin rails will enable law enforcement to study suspicious patterns using unfragmented, reliable and transparent information gathered directly from blockchains. Tracing across jurisdictions will not entail navigating red tape.</p><p><br>On a more thought-provoking note, a robust stablecoin payment economy will induce routine capital flows from traditional finance organizations to blockchains and vice versa. </p><p>Proceeds from real-world offenses, such as human trafficking, drug peddling and violent crimes, and crypto crimes, such as decentralized finance hacks, ransomware and crypto scams, might be laundered across a combination of traditional finance and crypto products. </p><p>Using live data from blockchains in AML initiatives can provide prompt intelligence even on criminal organizations that primarily use banks to place the spoils of their crimes.</p><p>Case in point, in recent times, the financial crime of sanctions evasion has <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/russian-ruble-stablecoin-a7a5-grinex-link-garantex-ft\" title=\"null\">exhibited such patterns</a>, with sanctioned funds flowing interchangeably across both banking and stablecoin rails in an attempt to launder the same and dodge sanctions. </p><h2>The road ahead</h2><p>The emergence of a pervasive stablecoin infrastructure will do wonders to showcase to the global compliance community how the ubiquitous transparency of public blockchains enables lightning-fast, sophisticated responses toward preventing and detecting illicit finance.</p><p>This can spur much-needed cooperation between anti-crime divisions within traditional finance and crypto, with each sharing relevant intelligence for cross-pollination.</p><p>Custodians of conventional financial products have not yet recognized that metaphorical bread crumbs strewn across blockchains can be used as well-founded signals to infer user intent. A stablecoin industry, deeply integrated with the global banking system, will influence the use of these assets to make the universal financial network safer.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Debanjan Chatterjee, financial analyst.</strong></em></p><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\" type=\"\">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Speaking at the Chartered Professional Accountants conference in Ottawa, Morrow called for clear <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/senate-advances-genius-act-to-create-first-u-s-stablecoin-regulations\">regulations</a> to guide stablecoin usage. He stressed that as the digital asset market grows, Canadian regulators must act swiftly to maintain stability and security.</p>\n    <h2>Clear Rules Needed as Stablecoins Surge</h2>\n    <p><a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/jpmorgan-new-stablecoins-set-to-compete-with-circles-usdc-in-us-market/\">Stablecoins</a> have seen rapid growth in recent years, now handling transactions worth $1 trillion annually. <a href=\"https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2025/09/making-change-accelerating-payments-innovation/\">Morrow emphasized</a> that stablecoins, unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, are more reliable for everyday use. He noted that their value is tied to stable assets, such as national currencies, which reduces price instability.</p>\n    <p>Morrow pointed out that while cross-border payments are vital, they must also be secure and efficient. He explained that these digital currencies could help lower transaction costs and speed up international transfers. However, for them to be trusted as real money, Morrow stated, they need clear and consistent regulations.</p>\n    <p>He called on federal and provincial regulators to cooperate on creating comprehensive rules for stablecoins. As interest in these digital assets grows, Canada must align its approach with global standards.</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p/>\n      <i>“Stablecoins must be as safe and stable as the funds people hold in their bank accounts,” Morrow added.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <h2>Bank of Canada’s Approach to Payments Innovation</h2>\n    <p>Canada’s payment system has faced criticism for lagging behind global counterparts. Many argue that Canada’s banking infrastructure is slow, costly, and lacks competition. Morrow acknowledged these issues and stressed that Canada must modernize its payment system to stay competitive.</p>\n    <p>The Bank of Canada has explored digital currency options in the past. In 2022, it partnered with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to investigate a central bank digital currency. However, by September 2024, the Bank decided to focus on a real-time payment system for instant transfers.</p>\n    <p>Morrow indicated that the country’s slow pace in adopting new technologies must change. He urged the Canadian government and regulators to use the current momentum to drive innovation. Modernizing Canada’s payment system is essential to providing Canadians with faster, cheaper, and more secure services.</p>\n    <h2>Global Stablecoin Regulation and Canada’s Role</h2>\n    <p>The rise of stablecoins has been supported by clearer regulations in the United States. The recent <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/genius-act-loophole-risks-draining-small-banks-senator-warns/\">GENIUS Act</a> in the U.S. has provided more certainty to the market, encouraging wider adoption. Morrow believes Canada must take similar steps to ensure stablecoins are safely integrated into the country’s financial system.</p>\n    <p>With the rapid growth of digital assets worldwide, Morrow warned that Canada risks falling behind. He highlighted the need for regulations that foster innovation while ensuring security. The Bank of Canada’s role in shaping the future of stablecoins will be crucial as global payment systems continue to evolve.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/bank-of-canada-calls-for-stablecoin-regulations-amid-global-shift/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>While XRP celebrates its groundbreaking ETF launch and Cardano pushes forward with massive healthcare investments, both communities are experiencing something remarkable—yet incomplete.</p>\n    <p>These institutional wins represent genuine progress, but they also highlight the persistent technical barriers that prevent true blockchain revolution. The Layer Brett presale, <a href=\"https://www.layerbrett.com/\">having raised over $3.78 million</a>, offers something entirely different: a community-driven escape from these limitations through revolutionary Layer 2 technology that transforms passive crypto holding into active participation.</p>\n    <h2>The hidden scalability crisis: Why XRP’s ETF success and Cardano’s $200M healthcare investment can’t fix core blockchain bottlenecks</h2>\n    <p>XRP’s recent institutional momentum tells an incredible story. The first U.S. XRP ETF launched in September, followed by CME adding futures options in October. This institutional embrace signals mainstream acceptance that XRP believers have championed for years. However, beneath this celebration lies an uncomfortable truth: institutional adoption doesn’t solve the fundamental throughput issues that limit real-world utility.</p>\n    <p>Cardano faces similar challenges despite Charles Hoskinson’s ambitious $200 million healthcare initiative in Wyoming. While ADA maintains resilience around $0.87 with surging trading volumes, the project still grapples with the same scalability constraints that have plagued blockchain networks since inception.</p>\n    <p>Both communities deserve better than watching institutional money validate their investments while the underlying technology remains constrained. The question becomes: what happens when institutional demand meets infrastructure limitations?</p>\n    <h2>Layer Brett’s community-driven solution: How our Layer 2 technology delivers what XRP and ADA promise but can’t execute</h2>\n    <p>This is where the Layer Brett movement becomes revolutionary. Built on Ethereum Layer 2 architecture, Layer Brett delivers the speed and cost efficiency that XRP and Cardano communities have been waiting for. While traditional networks process transactions in seconds or minutes, Layer Brett operates at lightning speed with minimal gas fees—solving the exact problems that limit mainstream adoption.</p>\n    <p>The difference lies in approach. XRP and ADA built their solutions as monolithic networks, inheriting the scalability challenges that come with that architecture. Layer Brett leverages proven Layer 2 technology, creating a foundation that scales naturally with demand.</p>\n    <p>What makes this truly special is the community-first mentality driving development. Unlike corporate-controlled projects that prioritize institutional partnerships over user experience, Layer Brett emerges from genuine grassroots enthusiasm. The project combines meme culture energy with serious technical innovation, creating something that feels both accessible and revolutionary.</p>\n    <h2>Why Layer Brett’s 675% staking rewards create true community wealth</h2>\n    <p>Traditional crypto investing often feels passive—buy tokens, watch prices, hope for institutional validation. Layer Brett transforms this experience through active participation that generates real returns. The over 675% staking APY represents more than impressive numbers; it demonstrates how community-driven projects can redistribute wealth directly to supporters rather than institutional intermediaries.</p>\n    <p>Consider the viral potential: meme culture combined with legitimate utility creates unprecedented sharing incentives. XRP and Cardano supporters promote their investments hoping for price appreciation. Layer Brett community members share something more compelling—a project that rewards participation immediately while building toward long-term revolution.</p>\n    <h2>Join the Brett revolution: How our meme-powered Layer 2 ecosystem transforms you from crypto spectator to blockchain pioneer</h2>\n    <p>The opportunity window remains open, but momentum builds daily. <a href=\"https://www.layerbrett.com/\">At $0.0058 per token</a>, early supporters can access genuine Layer 2 innovation before mainstream discovery drives prices higher. This isn’t about following institutional lead—it’s about joining a movement that prioritizes community empowerment over corporate profit.</p>\n    <p>The comparison becomes clear: XRP and Cardano offer institutional validation and steady development progress. Layer Brett offers immediate participation in blockchain’s next evolution. While others celebrate external recognition, the Layer Brett community builds internal value through revolutionary technology and authentic collaboration.</p>\n    <h6>Connect your wallet and buy in today.</h6>\n    <p>Website: <a href=\"https://layerbrett.com\">https://layerbrett.com</a></p>\n    <p>Telegram: <a href=\"https://t.me/layerbrett\">https://t.me/layerbrett</a></p>\n    <p>X: <a href=\"https://x.com/LayerBrett\">(1) Layer Brett (@LayerBrett) / X</a></p>\n    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>This is a Press Release provided by a third party who is responsible for the content.

    "body": "<p>Autumn, in all its crisp color, has long been a muse for artists and poets — and for good reason. The shorter days and early darkness often cast a spell, encouraging us to spend more time indoors and chip away at our to-be-read piles. These 12 new and forthcoming art books are well worth adding to that list, offering insights into the decades-long practice of Nayland Blake, the curatorial vision of the late Okwui Enwezor, the artistic life of Louise Bourgeois, and more topics we’re eager to explore. We’re also keeping an eye out for other upcoming releases, including <i> Native Visual Sovereignty: A Reader on Art and Performance</i> (Dancing Foxes Press, November 11); Brandon Taylor’s novel </p>\n<p><i>(Riverhead Books, October 14); and innumerable others. Get your pre-orders and library holds in now — and happy reading! —</i></p>\n<p><i>Lakshmi Rivera Amin</i></p>\n<p>A giant of 21st-century contemporary art, Okwui Enwezor’s curation for the 2nd Johannesburg Biennale, Documenta 11, the 56th Venice Biennale, the epic <i>Postwar: Art between the Pacific and the Atlantic, 1945–1965</i>, and many others are all landmark moments in the history of contemporary art. This anthology of his essays forms the foundations of understanding his complex ideas that shifted discourse to a more global perspective that has been slowly decentering the West to give a more accurate picture of art today. </p>\n<p>The first volume focuses on his earlier writings that mark his desire to renew African art discourse to rewrite histories. The second volume of this two-volume set starts in 2006 and charts a time when his influence was at its zenith.</p>\n<p>Taken from us far too early, Enwezor’s writings are indispensable tools for those who want to continue the important work of reformulating the world of art with justice and equity in mind. —<i>Hrag Vartanian</i></p>\n<p>Buy <a href=\"http://bookshop.org/a/539/bookshop.org/a/539/\">Volume 1</a> and <a href=\"http://bookshop.org/a/539/9781478031567\">Volume 1</a> on Bookshop | Duke University Press, August 5, 2025</p>\n<p>I’m looking forward to finally getting my hands on <i>Frank S. Matsura: Iconoclast Photographer of the American West</i> by Michael Holloman, editor, with portraits by and essays about the life and work of an early 20th-century Japanese photographer in a small western town. The spirited community captured by Matsura counters endless assumptions and misrepresentations propagated in American art and literature about the “real” West. I grew up in rural Montana, with Blackfeet siblings and a Japanese-American godfather who also grew up in Montana; finding out about Matsura felt both familiar and significant in rewriting tired Western tropes. Matsura came to Seattle from Japan in 1901 before settling in the small town of Okanogan, Washington, where he set up shop as a photographer of his friends and neighbors, many of whom were Sylix (Okanagan). Matsura’s lively portraits offer an instructive counterpoint to Edward S. Curtis’s better-known (for now) somber, ethnographic takes on Native life and people. —<i>Bridget Quinn</i></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bookshop.org/a/539/9781797232812\">Buy on Bookshop</a> | Princeton Architectural Press, September 9, 2025</p>\n<p>It’s easy to understand the enduring fascination with the aristocratic Mitford sisters, six 20th-century British siblings who grew up to live starkly different lives. One became a fascist and befriended Adolf Hitler, while another joined the communist party, and still a third penned numerous novels. They were even the subject of a <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt23856916/\">mediocre BritBox show</a> earlier this year. In <i>Do Admit!: The Mitford Sisters and Me</i>, however, cartoonist Mimi Pond illuminates their lives anew with her impeccable visual style and playful sensibility. A few pages in, I’m already hooked. —<i>LA</i></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bookshop.org/a/539/9781770468047\">Buy on Bookshop</a> | Drawn &amp; Quarterly, September 16, 2025</p>\n<p>While Robert Rauschenberg is best known for his “combine” paintings that blend sculpture and painting, photography has always been central to the Pop artist’s work. This small show brings together some of the photo-based work as well as their related paintings and larger format works, while highlighting for us that his eye for the overlooked and at first seemingly banal urbanscapes is central to his art making.</p>\n<p>Like his one-time partner, Jasper Johns, Rauschenberg helped chart new realities for queer artists who were far more marginalized up until then. This book is a celebration of one part of an artist’s practice that is finally getting the attention it deserves. —<i>HV</i></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bookshop.org/a/539/9781917273091\">Pre-order on Bookshop</a> | Giles, September 30, 2025</p>\n<p>Marie-Laure Bernadac started writing this biography of Louise Bourgeois as a way to mourn her passing in 2010. Not an easy task — the artist kept extensive journals, and threw absolutely nothing away. Translator Lauren Elkin points out that she wrote in a mix of French and English — sometimes in the same sentence.</p>\n<p>The result is a hefty, densely researched tome that quotes liberally from Bourgeois herself, as well as reproduces family photos and artworks, some in color. Bernadac conducted research at the Easton Foundation, which holds the artist’s archive, even sleeping there on occasion. It’s housed adjacent to the artist’s townhouse, with a mirrored layout  — which feels somehow fitting given Bourgeois’s obsession with domestic space as psychic theater. —<i>Lisa Yin Zhang</i></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bookshop.org/a/539/9780300268300\">Pre-order on Bookshop</a> | Yale University Press, October 14, 2025</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1043154/12-art-books-to-read-this-fall-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>One of Brooklyn’s most iconic artist studio buildings is in a precarious state after a five-alarm fire ravaged the 155-year-old warehouse in Red Hook late Wednesday night into Thursday morning.</p>\n    <p>Smoke filled the third floor of 481 Van Brunt Street at 11:35pm on September 17 before the fire spread to the roof, forcing more than 250 firefighters, EMS responders, and a marine fire boat dispatched to the Red Hook waterfront to tame the blaze. New York Fire Department (FDNY) officials said they believe the building was unoccupied at the time. Two firefighters sustained minor injuries.</p>\n    <p>By the morning, part of the roof and the fourth floor had collapsed, and Van Brunt Street had flooded out. The building had taken on so much water from the firefight that it appeared to bow, sources at the scene said.</p>\n    <p>Kevin Woods, chief of fire operations for the FDNY, <a href=\"https://www.nyc.gov/site/fdny/news/A91825/fdny-officials-provide-on-5-alarm-fire-brooklyn\">told reporters</a> Thursday that firefighting operations were still ongoing and that the deterioration of the building was “extensive.” The cause of the fire is still unknown. </p>\n    <p>“Before we get in there, the engineers have to evaluate the structural stability,” Woods said. “With the amount of water going into this building and the amount of fire, with the damage to the roof structure and multiple floors, it’s going to take a while.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_5325-1-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_5326-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The Civil War-era warehouse is the spiritual center of Red Hook’s vibrant arts community, which has rebounded since Hurricane Sandy flooded its streets 13 years ago. The four-story commercial building contains dozens of artist studios and high-end design businesses and is home to the Brooklyn Waterfront Artists Coalition (BWAC), a 400-member, artist-run nonprofit that has hosted exhibitions on the first and second floors of its 25,000-square-foot space for 48 years.</p>\n    <p>Artists have not been able to enter the building and determine the extent of devastation to their spaces. Managers for BWAC, which celebrated the opening of two group shows, <a href=\"https://www.bwac.org/exhibition-content/brooklyn-resilience\"> Brooklyn Resilience</a> and </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.bwac.org/exhibition-content/aerosol-euphoriaurban-street-art\"/>\n    </p>\n    <i>Aerosol Euphoria: Urban Street Art</i>\n    <p><i>,</i>last Saturday, posted on</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOwWP0PkWP0/?hl=en\">support</a>to help them rebuild. On Friday, city buildings officials issued vacate orders for 475, 485, 491, 497, and 499 Van Brunt Street due to the fire damage.</p>\n    <p>Anastasios Poneros, a mixed-media artist whose studio resides above BWAC’s space, was working late on an installation and left a few hours before the fire started. His studio’s windows were intact, and she hoped that any water damage from hoses and sprinklers his space sustained would be minimal.</p>\n    <p>“I have a lot of works on paper, and they would be ruined,” Poneros told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “It’s basically 15 years of my life packed into that 1,000 square feet of space. It’s bad news all around. I’m worried we’ll all get kicked out.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/DSC07127-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>Some artists already know that their entire life’s work has been lost.</p>\n    <p>Grace Whiteside, a glass blower and performance artist, said she arrived at the scene at 7:30am and witnessed water pouring out of an open window like a “waterfall.”</p>\n    <p>“Absolutely nothing is salvageable,” she said. “My entire livelihood was in that studio, either business-wise or art profession-wise. It’s possible the whole building will be condemned due to safety issues.”</p>\n    <p>Meg Suttles, founder of the arts residency and gallery space <a href=\"https://hot-wood-arts.mailchimpsites.com/\">Hot Wood Arts</a>, told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that she was awakened by text messages from two of her studio neighbors who saw firefighters entering the building just before midnight. She took a cab and arrived at Van Brunt Street at 1am, and stayed up the entire night as her portion of the warehouse became engulfed in flames. </p>\n    <p>“I made a lot of 2am calls when I knew it was going to be devastating,” Suttles said. “We’re just in shock today. I have 13 and a half years’ worth of artwork, plus things from undergrad that I did 20-something years ago, that’s all just gone.”</p>\n    <p>The fire’s destruction has cast a cloud on <a href=\"https://www.redhookopenstudios.com/\">Red Hook Open Studios</a>, which is slated to celebrate its 10th anniversary this year on October 11–12. Suttles, who co-founded the festival, wasn’t sure how the event would adjust since a majority of open studios were on the pier and the building could remain closed to the public. For now, Red Hook business leaders have launched a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-red-hook-artists-and-businesses-rebuild-after-fire?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAae_E9-WJyx1_GotuVlZ6G6nHEBrVYkA364DpYBcEEiAAUr7__nU8EzeR5RgCw_aem_A0Ilf_Qh3qtMxr-9v5BBtA\">GoFundMe</a> campaign to help artists recover from the fire.</p>\n    <p>“[Red Hook Open Studios] can still go on because there are artists elsewhere, but this is such a huge loss,” Suttles said. “I love this neighborhood, it’s such a magical place with unique people. I hope we don’t have to leave the neighborhood. I really hope we can rebuild somehow.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1043096/fire-tears-through-iconic-artist-building-in-brooklyn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Adjacent to an unfolding mass inside Manhattan’s formidable St. Patrick’s Cathedral, a gaggle of reporters arranged themselves in front of an empty podium awaiting Archbishop of New York Timothy Dolan on Thursday, September 18. Amid a profusion of anti-immigrant sentiment in national politics and sweeping deportations, the New York City cathedral planned to take a stand for the humanity of immigrants — in the form of the largest artwork ever commissioned for the Neo-Gothic landmark.</p>\n    <p>“What’s So Funny About Peace, Love, and Understanding” (2024–5), an enormous 12-panel mural created in tribute to New York City immigrants and their descendants by artist Adam Cvijanovic, was unveiled on Thursday morning. For weeks, installation teams have worked overnight to position Cvijanovic’s panels, transported from his Brooklyn Navy Yard studio. Tucked into crowds of immigrants of various ethnicities portrayed by the artist, figures of New York City’s Catholic history peer out. They all stare upward into the distance, some in the direction of the cathedral’s altar. The work, which was entirely funded by private benefactors, will be dedicated during Mass on Sunday.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/patrick-1200x795.jpg?resize=1200%2C795&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>When Cardinal Dolan — who is considered to be <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2012/08/economist-digs-into-us-churchs-finances.html\">Manhattan’s largest landowner</a> as the overseer of the Archdiocese of New York and its 2.5 million Catholics — approached the podium, Cvijanovic hung off to the side. Though the artist assumed a humble demeanor, his 25-foot-tall oil-painted murals in the background were characteristically boisterous and disruptive, as they were meant to be. </p>\n    <p>“The whole issue of immigrants has been important for the church, always, but it seems to be a little bit under the limelight today,” Dolan said at the unveiling. “Some have asked me, ‘Are you trying to make a statement about immigration?’ Surely, mainly that immigrants are children of God.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/adam-1200x1799.jpg?resize=1200%2C1799&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Cvijanovic, whose dad immigrated from Serbia, told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that he never expected to collaborate with the Archbishop of New York on such a project. He secured the commission through a competitive process before Trump’s election, but at the mural’s opening, the president’s recent immigration crackdowns sparked increased interest in the work. Cvijanovic added<i> </i>that he worked with limited direction from the church and could paint what he wanted to freely.</p>\n    <p>“What has made me, personally, really, really happy, is people who come in, who are from all kinds of different places and are feeling really not good about themselves at the moment, looking at this painting and saying, ‘I belong here. I belong in the center of New York. I belong in a place where I’m being deeply respected,’” Cvijanovic told <i>Hyperallergic. </i></p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/DSC_0339-1200x795.jpg?resize=1200%2C795&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The Catholic Church has consistently called for immigration reform, and in recent months, leading bishops across the nation have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/29/us/catholic-bishops-trump-immigration.html\">condemned</a> Trump’s mass deportation campaign. Dolan has embraced his role in leading one of the most diverse archdioceses and has <a href=\"https://thegoodnewsroom.org/cardinal-dolan-shows-support-for-immigrants/\">publicly expressed</a> dismay at “blanket attacks” on immigrants, including raids at <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/california-divide/2025/07/ice-targets-immigrants-church-grounds/\">houses of worship</a>. (Dolan has faced scrutiny for years for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/02/us/dolan-sought-vatican-permission-to-shield-assets.html\">reportedly</a> asking the Vatican for permission to move nearly $60 million to protect against lawsuits related to sexual abuse claims when he was archbishop of Milwaukee. He has repeatedly denied these claims.)</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/DSC_0307-1200x795.jpg?resize=1200%2C795&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The new mural is situated between the entrance and exit of the Midtown church, which Dolan said sees 6 million tourists each year.</p>\n    <p>Cvijanovic honored Dolan’s desire to incorporate a telling of the 1879 Apparition of Knock, when 15 people at a parish in Knock, Ireland, said they saw the Virgin Mary, the Lamb of God, and angels on the walls. This event was remarkable, Dolan shared, because it occurred within the same year St. Patrick’s Cathedral was dedicated. The apparition is seen as a spiritual symbol of resilience.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/DSC_0422-1200x795.jpg?resize=1200%2C795&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Gold leaf strips of various karats surround a representation of the Lamb of God, a symbol of Jesus, on one panel. The lamb hovers above immigrants of different ethnicities standing in a line that appears to stretch endlessly. Children are portrayed sitting on modern-day luggage or held in their caretakers’ arms. The murals are filled with easter eggs of notable Catholic individuals who blend in with their surrounding subjects: The Lamb of God panel portrays Cuban abolitionist priest Venerable Félix Varela y Morales, who lived in New York alongside St. Frances Xavier Cabrini, the first US citizen to be recognized as a saint.</p>\n    <p>Another panel features five individuals in a more focused portrait, including the first Native American person to be recognized as a saint, Kateri Tekakwitha, a Mohawk woman canonized in the 17th century for her devotion and care for the sick. Servant of God Dorothy Day, who co-founded the Catholic Worker Movement in 1933, is also pictured in the panel.</p>\n    <p>An entire panel depicts law enforcement officers and first responders of varying backgrounds, and another is dedicated to immigrants from Ireland and Italy, who wear antiquated clothing.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/DSC_0451-1-1200x795.jpg?resize=1200%2C795&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Cvijanovic said he based his figures on models, among them members of his Catholic wife’s family in New Jersey. The lamb portrayed in the Lamb of God also came from New Jersey, the artist quipped.</p>\n    <p>“If you had told me that I was going to be the rector of Saint Patrick’s Cathedral when I came to this country, I would have never believed it,” Very Reverend Enrique Salvo, who was born in Nicaragua, said at the unveiling. “Hopefully, [the mural is] an inspiration of that to everyone that walks in that we’re not only welcome, but we’re also invited to make a difference.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/DSC_0379-1200x795.jpg?resize=1200%2C795&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/DSC_0404-1200x795.jpg?resize=1200%2C795&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/DSC_0513-1200x795.jpg?resize=1200%2C795&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/DSC_0285-1200x1811.jpg?resize=1200%2C1811&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1043132/sprawling-mural-in-support-of-immigrants-unveiled-in-st-patricks-cathedral/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>A Moscow court has sentenced five members of the exiled feminist art collective Pussy Riot to prison in absentia on charges relating to anti-war protest and performances critical of Vladimir Putin’s regime. The jail terms delivered by Judge Evgeniya Nikolaeva of Moscow’s Basmanny District Court ranged from eight to 13 years, according to <i>Mediazona</i><i>,</i> the news outlet founded by Pussy Riot.</p>\n    <p>Activists Maria “Masha” Alyokhina, Diana Burkot, Olga Borisova, Alina Petrova, and Taso Pletner were accused of disseminating “false information” about the Russian military in the collective’s 2022 anti-war music video “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr0GN2llJaY\">Mama, Don’t Watch TV</a>,” and in a 2024 performance at the Pinakothek der Moderne in Munich during which a member <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/ru/v-ramkah-protestnoj-akcii-prosedsej-v-munhenskoj-pinakoteke-sovremennosti-pussy-riot-isportili-portret-putina/a-68867419\">urinated on a portrait of Putin</a>.</p>\n    <p>Founding Pussy Riot member Alyokhina received the harshest prison sentence of 13 years and 15 days. Pletner was sentenced to 11 years, and the other three members were each given eight-year terms. <i>Mediazona</i> reported that the prosecutor initially requested longer sentences for the activists.</p>\n    <p>“I stand by every single word and my anti-war stance is clear,” Burkot said in a statement posted on <a href=\"https://x.com/pussyrrriot/status/1967784614744953253\">X</a>, calling the verdict a “joke.”</p>\n    <p>“The paradox is that rapists and murderers in Russia get 3–4 years, sometimes spending less than a year in prison before signing a military contract, killing Ukrainians and then they return freely into society, with PTSD, and may end up back in prison for yet another killing … Meanwhile, activists receive monstrous sentences for their opinions,” Burkot said.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/like-a-red-prison.jpg?resize=2000%2C1249&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Since the group formed in 2011, Pussy Riot’s membership has fluctuated between 10 and 20 members. They are known for their balaclava-wearing performances protesting Putin’s regime and Russia’s ongoing bombardment of Ukraine, which has killed at least 13,883 civilians since its invasion in 2022, according to a United Nations <a href=\"https://ukraine.ohchr.org/en/Number-of-civilians-killed-and-injured-in-Ukraine-reaches-three-year-monthly-high-in-July-2025-UN-human-rights-monitors-say\">report</a> released in August. </p>\n    <p>In 2023, Pussy Riot co-founder Nadya Tolokonnikova was <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/811304/pussy-riots-nadya-tolokonnikova-placed-on-russian-wanted-list/\">placed on Russia’s Wanted List</a> and <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/858071/russia-arrests-pussy-riot-nadya-tolokonnikova-in-absentia/\">later arrested in absentia</a> on charges related to anti-Putin protests.</p>\n    <p>In her statement, Burkot continued to rail against Russia’s ongoing assault on Ukraine and called for Putin to “face trial in The Hague.”</p>\n    <p>“Activism now is needed like daily practice, because only together can we resist and overcome the crisis of democracy,” Burkot said.</p>\n    <p>“Fortunately, they have no access to my physical body,” Burkot continued. “And even if I were in Russia, I would say the same thing: Go f**k yourself.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1043215/pussy-riot-members-sentenced-to-russian-prison-in-absentia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Even things that have united humanity across the ages and that we take for granted – such as the constellations and our relatively pristine view of the Milky Way on clear nights far from light pollution – will evolve and rupture over the course of deep timescales. In this video from the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, the US astronomer and curator Jackie Faherty discusses how the contours of the night sky as we know it will dramatically alter millions of years in the future. Her words are paired with extraordinary data visualisations of these coming distortions, some drawn from the show Encounters in the Milky Way, playing at the museum’s Hayden Planetarium.</p>\n

    "body": "<p>Stepping out of a sleek office tower in Shanghai, I hear a bell ringing from Jing’an Temple. In the shadow of steel and glass stands a centuries-old Buddhist shrine. Its curled eaves and drifting incense offer a quiet counterpoint to the digital tickers flashing above trading floors. As a finance professor, I interpret corporate decisions like dividend payments through the lenses of incentives, governance and regulation. But, in that moment, I wondered: could the moral rhythms of the temple – with its teachings of harmony, reciprocity and impermanence – be quietly shaping the boardroom across the street? What if the chants of monks and the calculations of CEOs weren’t as far apart as we assume?</p>\n<p>That question led me to think more broadly: how do values persist across time, even as belief systems shift? China’s spiritual and philosophical traditions – especially Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism – have long shaped attitudes toward wealth, obligation and fairness. These influences may seem distant from today’s stock markets, yet their traces remain visible in how people understand legitimacy and virtue, even in the realm of commerce.</p>\n<p>In imperial China, merchants occupied a low place in the social hierarchy, ranked below farmers, artisans and scholars. Yet many built reputations not only through commerce but through acts of generosity, supporting temples, schools and public works. Profit and virtue were not seen as opposites, but as forces that could be balanced through wisdom and restraint. This ethos was significantly challenged during the early decades of the People’s Republic, when traditional religions were classified as ‘feudal superstition’ and many temples were closed during the Cultural Revolution. These policies reflected the priorities of that historical period, focused on class struggle and rapid industrialisation. Yet even amid sweeping transformation, many moral traditions persisted. From the 1980s onward, as China pursued reform and opening-up, spiritual traditions gradually re-emerged, complementing the country’s economic development and cultural revitalisation efforts under the evolving framework of socialism with Chinese characteristics. That ancient ideal still lingers beneath the surface of modern Chinese capitalism. Today, companies listed on stock exchanges operate in a global market, but their decisions are often shaped by those older moral logics. As I was to discover, even something as technical as a corporate dividend may still bear the imprint of beliefs rooted in Buddhism, Taoism and centuries of ethical tradition.</p>\n<p>Today, the worlds of tradition and commerce often coexist in unexpected proximity. I grew up observing how deeply cultural values shape people’s behaviour – often unconsciously. Still, it might seem unlikely that spiritual traditions could influence something as technical as corporate dividend policy.</p>\n<p>Dividend payments are the portion of profit that a company pays out to its shareholders – essentially, a reward to investors for their trust. In modern capitalism, dividends are not mandatory; they are a voluntary decision made by a firm’s leadership to return value to its owners. Unlike wages, which compensate labour, or charitable donations, which serve public good, dividends reflect a deliberate act of profit-sharing within capitalist enterprise. Choosing to pay them signals financial strength, accountability and a long-term commitment to shareholder value. Beyond just a payout, they represent a gesture of corporate accountability. In the realm of corporate governance, regular dividends are often <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=226317\">interpreted</a> as a sign of respect for shareholders and a mechanism to discipline management by reducing discretionary cash reserves.</p>\n<p>Dividends are typically explained using financial theories or legal frameworks. Conventional finance emphasises formal factors such as taxation, investor protection laws and corporate governance rules. Yet in China, a country often described as having the Buddha on the bookshelf and the <i>Tao</i> in the boardroom, I began to suspect that there was more to the story.</p>\n<p>Nearly half of all profitable firms still went three or more consecutive years without paying a cent</p>\n<p>Take the term ‘iron rooster’. In Chinese, <i>tie gong ji</i> is a metaphor for stinginess – a rooster so iron-clad you cannot pluck a single feather from it. For years, Chinese investors used this colourful insult to describe companies that never pay dividends. As one financial newspaper lamented, ‘some companies would rather be iron roosters sitting on piles of cash than share a feather with investors.’ The problem was widespread: low or non-existent dividends have long undermined investor confidence in China’s stock markets. Throughout the 2000s and early 2010s, many listed firms would report profits yet refuse to share the bounty – a far cry from what shareholders might expect in more mature markets. Regulators grew so frustrated that they launched campaigns to crack down on these dividend-shy companies. In 2017, the head of the China Securities Regulatory Commission even threatened ‘hard measures’ against the perennial non-payers, invoking the iron rooster idiom in a fiery speech. And in 2023, authorities rolled out rules tying executive performance evaluations to dividend payouts and barring large shareholders from selling stock if their companies hadn’t paid dividends in years. The intent was clear: coax the roosters to finally shed some feathers.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/how-chinese-religious-traditions-shape-corporate-generosity?utm_source=rss-feed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, talks about her new book \"Why Fascists Fear Teachers.\"</p>\n<p>\n      <strong/>\n    </p>\n<p>MICHEL MARTIN, BYLINE: The Trump administration has made no secret of its desire to upend the Department of Education as it currently functions. It plans to lay off at least half of the department's workforce, more than 1,000 people, and the Supreme Court has agreed that it can. And in response to troubling data from the latest Nation's Report Card, which is out this month, the president reiterated his plans to, quote, \"return education back to the individual states,\" unquote.</p>\n<p>Longtime teachers' union leader Randi Weingarten says whatever the problems with the nation's schools, this administration is not trying to solve them. Instead, she says, these efforts are really part of a plan to destroy public education, which itself is part of a plan to weaken democracy. Weingarten makes this argument in a fiery new book called \"Why Fascists Fear Teachers.\" And she's with us now to tell us more about it. Good morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p>\n<p>RANDI WEINGARTEN: Good morning.</p>\n<p>MARTIN: So let me start with, why this book now? You've been president of the American Federation of Teachers, AFT, since 2008. What motivated this book now? This is your first book, so clearly you felt strongly enough about something to take the time away from your day job to write this.</p>\n<p>WEINGARTEN: So I started thinking about this particular book in the weeks and months after we got back to school from COVID and thought about why all of these smears and why this level? There started to be a different kind of political attack on teachers. And it was coming from extreme forces, some on the left, but mostly on the right, that seemed different. The smears seemed different.</p>\n<p>MARTIN: You don't pull any punches with the title, which accurately represents the tone of the book. But despite that, you say that you're not interested in the labels as much as the actions. What is it about public schools per se that you think is particularly challenging to people who you believe try to weaken democracy?</p>\n<p>WEINGARTEN: I think we teach kids how to really think, not what to think, but how to think. We teach kids how to live with each other in a diverse environment. That's why welcoming...</p>\n<p>MARTIN: Because they have no choice, basically. Public schools have to welcome all comers, I guess, right?</p>\n<p>WEINGARTEN: Exactly. But in that realm, that is critically important, particularly if you think about what's going on in America and the attack on immigrants and the attack on diversity. We actually believe in opportunity for all, not opportunity for some. And that is different than a competitive model. If you think about education as the public square or education as imperative to democracy, which is what the founders thought. Then you think about, what are the three things, Michel, that give regular people power? It's voting, it's education and it's some economic power. And so what teachers and their unions do is basically two of the three.</p>\n<p>MARTIN: Teachers are one of the last remaining heavily unionized workforces in the country. You're arguing that their efforts to unionize pose a challenge to autocrats. But you also make the case that the interests of kids and families and the interests of teachers are aligned. But what if they aren't? Isn't the role of the union to protect the interests of teachers, even if that conflicts with the interests of kids and parents as they perceive them?</p>\n<p>WEINGARTEN: I think our role is to do everything in our power to align those interests. And in 2010, parents and teacher unions really were divergent. I saw that as a clarion call. So 2024, several years after COVID, we asked that question again. In that polling, it was 74% approved of teachers and 9% disapproved. But even the union in 2024, what we saw is 53% of people approved of teacher unions and 22% disapproved of them. We have to align them.</p>\n<p>MARTIN: You begin the book by talking about how some conservative activists have used critical race theory, which is a complex legal analysis of racism, to attack public education, implying that it's being taught, you know, in third grade, at levels which is not appropriate. Why do you think that people are receptive to these arguments?</p>\n<p>WEINGARTEN: I think there's a lot of fear. There's a lot of anxiety. I think social media has been a pretty prime reason. I think that the politics have gotten corrosive. And when you have this kind of fear and anxiety in a country, it creates distrust. Frankly, Ruth Ben-Ghiat, Tim Snyder, all of these historians talk about what autocrats or what oligarchs or others end up doing to exploit it.</p>\n<p>MARTIN: What do you have to say about the Nation's Report Card data that the president cited in saying that this is exactly why the Department of Education needs to be rethought?

Also called Alice in Wonderland Syndrome, the disorder is the basis of a disorienting exhibition by Berlin-based duo <a href=\"http://www.elmgreen-dragset.com/\">Elmgreen &amp; Dragset</a>.</p>\n    <p>Collaborating since 1995, Michael Elmgreen and Ingar Dragset are behind a slew of iconic works, perhaps most famously the full-sized boutique in the middle of the Texan desert known as “Prada Marfa.” This destination installation is representative of the artist’s enduring interest in recontextualizing seemingly common objects to explore how our interpretation and perception change.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/elmgreen-1.jpg\" alt=\"an installation by Elmgreen and Dragset of a realistic looking blond woman slumped over at her desk with a bookcase behind her\"/>\n    <p>For their exhibition at Pace Gallery in Los Angeles—their first solo show in the city—the duo continues this line of inquiry. <i>The Alice in Wonderland Syndrome</i> opens with a silicone gallery attendant dozing on her desk, an undrunk cup of coffee and stack of books nearby. Like the adventurous tale it references, the large-scale show invites viewers to ask whether what unfolds is real or all a hallucinatory dream.</p>\n    <p>Farther inside is a series of white marble figures recreated on two different scales. Wearing headphones and VR headsets, these nondescript characters appear perpetually distracted and immersed in their technologies of choice. On the gallery walls is a collection of circular works from the artist’s <i>Sky Target</i> series, which varies mirrors and cloudy expanses in stripes or concentric rings. These patterned pieces reflect the wide, open space and fragments of the sculptures, albeit through a distorted view.</p>\n    <p>As we collectively grapple with the strange, often concerning effects of living in an increasingly digital world, Elmgreen &amp; Dragset prompt us to consider how physical presence shapes our understanding and can lead to an uncanny experience all on its own.</p>\n    <p><i>The Alice in Wonderland Syndrome</i> is on view through October 25.

When faced with distant galaxies and the seemingly endless sea of trillions of stars—a <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/\">trillion trillion</a>, actually, known as a septillion—the sheer scope is impossible to grasp. The universe’s workings may always remain a mystery. So it’s no surprise that when peering up at the night sky, whether it’s homing in on distant stellar clusters or simply watching the moon rise, photography helps us appreciate its enigmatic beauty.</p>\n    <p>This year’s <a href=\"https://www.rmg.co.uk/whats-on/astronomy-photographer-year/galleries/overall-winners-2025\">ZWO Astronomy Photographer of the Year</a> competition received more than <a href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2025/07/zwo-astronomy-photographer-of-the-year-2025/\">5,800 entries</a> from astrophotographers in more than 60 countries. The top prize has been awarded to Weitang Liang, Qi Yang, and Chuhong Yu for their image titled “The Andromeda Core,” captured using a focal-length telescope at AstroCamp Observatory in Nerpio, Spain. The remarkable image details the core of the Andromeda Galaxy, also know as M31, revealing the intricate structure of its center and the incredible array of surrounding stars.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/zwo-9.jpg\" alt=\"a beautiful photo of the Andromeda galaxy\"/>\n    <p>This year, photographers submitted photos in categories such as Skyscapes, Our Sun, Our Moon, and Stars and Nebulae. Taking the top spot in the Aurore group is Kavan Chay’s “Crown of Light,” shot at Tumbledown Bay in New Zealand. Luis Vilariño’s runner-up image showcases a bright green aurora curtain in the sky over an otherworldly Icelandic landscape.</p>\n    <p>Explore the winners’ gallery on the Royal Museums Greenwich <a href=\"https://www.rmg.co.uk/whats-on/astronomy-photographer-year/galleries/overall-winners-2025\">website</a>, and visit the National Maritime Museum to see the work of more than 100 photographers in beautiful light box presentations.

Because let's be clear: foundries around the world are pushing the boundaries of the discipline every day of the week. And that doesn't just mean crafting brand-new typefaces, but also breathing new life into timeless classics.</p>\n<p>There's just one problem: with all the incredible font releases out there, it's easy for some to slip under the radar. Which is exactly why we reached out to the Creative Boom community to find out which fonts they're buzzing about for 2026. Wisdom of crowds and all that.</p>\n<p>You'll find the results below: 50 popular typefaces that graphic designers look likely to make strong use of in the year to come. It's a heady fusion of retro vibes and modern functionality, from elegant serifs being reimagined for the digital age to bold, expressive sans-serifs ready to make a serious splash in branding and editorial design.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, our survey revealed a ton of old favourites. This is something we're seeing a lot of across the creative community – a return to familiar territory. Perhaps it's a comfort thing during challenging times. Who knows?</p>\n<p>Either way, whether you're looking to refresh your go-to collection or searching for new type to bring your latest project to life, you're sure to find some exciting options below. Enjoy!</p>\n<p>GT America aims to bridge 19th-century American Gothics with 20th century European Neo-Grotesk traditions, and take the finest design features from both. In practice, it proves remarkably versatile, and works well across both corporate identity systems and editorial applications. Designed by Noël Leu with Seb McLauchlan, this comprehensive family offers 84 styles, with extensive script extensions developed alongside Tania Chacana.</p>\n<p>Sight Lines: Women in Art in Aotearoa by Studio Katie Kerr <a href=\"https://www.grillitype.com/typeface/gt-america\">GT America</a> by Grilli Type</p>\n<p>Kris Sowersby's Söhne captures the memory of Akzidenz-Grotesk, filtered through Helvetica's influence, and specifically evokes the analogue feel of Standard Medium as used in New York's subway signage. But rather than being a direct revival, Sowersby has created something more nuanced: a typeface that channels the confident boldness of those classic grotesques, while feeling utterly contemporary at the same time. Built from the semibold weight outward, it includes condensed, wide and monospaced variants.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://klim.co.nz/collections/soehne/\">Söhne</a> by Klim Type Foundry</p>\n<p>An \"emphatically vanilla\" editorial workhorse, Graphik has become one of Commercial Type's most popular releases. This hybrid typeface combines geometric sans-serif roundness with European grotesk architecture and proportions, while avoiding the baggage of more dogmatic modernist alternatives. Its low contrast, open counters and compact descenders make it a good choice for tight editorial settings, whilst human touches such as round dots mean it also works well for display.</p>\n<p>Mark Bloom and Joe Leadbeater's Aeonik presents itself as a neo-grotesque with geometric foundations, achieving mechanical precision through strict perpendicular terminals, whilst maintaining warmth through its rounded letterforms. Its eight weights, from Air to Black, are enhanced by variable font technology and since launching in 2021, it's become a favourite for global brands including Revolut, Eurosport, Alipay and Virgin Hyperloop.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cotypefoundry.com/our-fonts/aeonik\">Aeonik</a> by CoType Foundry</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cotypefoundry.com/our-fonts/aeonik\">Aeonik</a> by CoType Foundry</p>\n<p>Mat Desjardins created Neue Montreal in 2018 as a versatile grotesque with the spirit of a display font. Inspired by the Canadian city that became a beacon of modernist design in the 1960s and 1970s—a place where graphic design wasn’t just a profession, but a cultural force—this timeless sans-serif has been the official typeface of football club Montreal FC since 2021. It's available in 14 weights.</p>\n<p>Joan Creative – <a href=\"https://pangrampangram.com/products/neue-montreal\">Neue Montreal</a> by Pangram Pangram</p>\n<p>Originally developed for photography magazine Hotshoe in 2012, Basis Grotesque drew inspiration from Akzidenz and early Monotype grotesques. But it's since been refined towards something more considered and shapely. The family's skeletal consistency across weights creates a sense of unity, whilst allowing each style to develop its own personality, from Light through to Black.</p>\n<p>Maison Neue is a complete reconstruction of the original Maison family, moving beyond the latter's rigid geometric construction towards greater optical refinement. This superfamily of 40 styles includes the original, subtly condensed version, an extended counterpart, and mono-spaced alignment, each with additional weights.</p>\n<p>ABC Favorit is a straightforward yet characterful grotesque that combines geometric rigidity with subtle oddities and humorous touches. Designed by Johannes Breyer and Fabian Harb, it's available in five weights with italics, along with extended and expanded variants. Smart underlines create unconventional letter shapes, whilst script extensions cover Greek, Cyrillic, Hangul and Arabic.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://abcdinamo.com/typefaces/favorit\">Favorit</a> by Dinamo Typefaces GmbH</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://abcdinamo.com/typefaces/favorit\">Favorit</a> by Dinamo Typefaces GmbH</p>\n<p>Appearing in three versions since its birth in 2016, Lucas Sharp's Sharp Grotesk Global has evolved from hand-drawn poster lettering into Sharp Type's most comprehensive superfamily. Featuring 12 weights and seven widths across Roman and Italic styles, with extensions in Greek, Cyrillic, Hangul and Thai, this font balances modernist rigour with hand-drawn imperfection.</p>\n<p>With a name that references the pre-digital typesetting machines that influenced its design, Diatype is a warm yet sharp grotesque that's optimised for screen reading. Created by Johannes Breyer and Fabian Harb, this font captures the essence of Swiss Neo-grotesque tradition whilst addressing the needs of contemporary digital type. Its careful balance between warmth and precision makes it particularly effective for extended reading applications, across various digital platforms.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://abcdinamo.com/typefaces/diatype\">Diatype</a> by Dinamo Typefaces GmbH</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://abcdinamo.com/typefaces/diatype\">Diatype</a> by Dinamo Typefaces GmbH</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.creativeboom.com/resources/top-50-fonts-in-2026/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>We speak with the German artist about her new illustrations for Kazuo Ishiguro's Klara and the Sun, including portraits generating atmosphere and poetic imagery.</p>\n    <p>Serendipity is a beautiful thing, and in the creative industries, it leads to even more beautiful things. But, as the saying goes, the harder you work, the luckier you get.</p>\n    <p>Let's go back 10 years to when German illustrator Isabel Seliger first submitted her portfolio to the Folio Society, a publisher of deluxe editions of classic books. The feedback Isabel received was that there weren't enough faces in her work. Although she didn't then force herself to draw faces, it's an area she's developed to become a recognised portrait illustrator.</p>\n    <p>Now we'll fast forward to August 2024, when she received an enquiry from the Folio Society. That would be exciting enough on its own, but the brief was to illustrate 'Klara and the Sun' by Kazuo Ishiguro, a book Isabel had just finished listening to on audiobook and one that had deeply touched her. Serendipity? Hard work? Who knows? But things had come full circle.</p>\n    <p>\"It's such a great and special story, and Klara is maybe the most wonderful character I've ever read,\" enthuses Isabel. \"I'd just finished it when I received a commission from the Folio Society to illustrate this very book! It felt simply surreal. It was incredibly exciting to work with this book because the author's writing had touched me so deeply, and because I knew he would be approving my illustrations.\"</p>\n    <p>Bound in cloth and with metallic endpapers and a slipcase, the Folio Society's edition of Klara and the Sun came out this week. The cover image sets the tone with a wistful portrait of Klara, the Artificial Friend in Ishiguro's story, who observes the world, hoping a human will buy her and become her friend.</p>\n    <p>\"I was commissioned to design a cover, slipcase, endpapers and seven interior illustrations,\" says Isabel. \"I read the book three more times before I was able to suggest the scenes for the interior. I spent two weeks at the seaside and worked my way through the book, observing the light around me with intense focus. I was perhaps as obsessed with the sun as Klara is. For the book, I gave the characters faces, which I found to be a great challenge and responsibility. But I had to let go of any worries and just trust my instincts.\"</p>\n    <p>Isabel's style and creative outlook seem ideally suited to this particular story, setting the mood for the reader. It's a look Isabel has honed pragmatically over the years as she's graduated from pen and ink sketching to digitally colouring ink drawings, and on to a completely digital process using Procreate on her iPad and Photoshop on a Mac, equipped with a Wacom Intuos tablet.</p>\n    <p>Annette Gordon Reed for The New Yorker.</p>\n    <p>Francis Ford Coppola for The New Yorker.</p>\n    <p>From the Fortune Tellers series for NYT Kids.</p>\n    <p>\"I like to create atmospheric, mysterious and poetic motifs that play out in an inner rather than an outer world,\" she says. \"I love working with elements – objects and abstract motifs – that, when viewed together, tell a bigger story. I like to create moods with a series of images.\"</p>\n    <p>In recent years, the Berlin-based artist has continued to grow in strength, particularly in the editorial and publishing markets. From October 2024 to January 2025, she illustrated the weekly Book Currents column in The New Yorker, blending the portrait of each columnist with themes from the books being discussed.</p>\n    <p>She has created some wonderful pieces for The New York Times, too. Last year, she illustrated an article about what life on Mars might do to the human psyche. This followed work for the NYT Kids section in 2023, including twelve illustrations on the theme of fortune tellers. \"I love it when a commission allows me to approach a topic in a freer and playful way, like the fortune tellers project,\" she says.</p>\n    <p>Undo - artwork for Black Dragon Press.</p>\n    <p>Illustration from Der Schwarm by Frank Schätzing.</p>\n    <p>While artificial intelligence is sometimes the topic of Isabel's illustrations, she believes that in editorial illustration, it will make life harder, especially for those still trying to establish a name for themselves. \"I wouldn't pay so much attention to what you think is in demand,\" she advises. \"Really look inside yourself and find the thing or things that really interest you, that you feel like doing and that you'd like to explore further. Experiment and work on creating a strong personal signature. I also think being reliable and approachable is essential.\"</p>\n    <p>As for Isabel's next challenge… We'll have to see. With Klara and the Sun, she has already conquered her dream project, and magnificently so.</p>\n    <p>Get the best of Creative Boom delivered to your inbox weekly</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.creativeboom.com/inspiration/the-sun-is-shining-for-illustrator-isabel-seliger/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Born out of the chaos of 2020, Egg has evolved into a close-knit agency working with clients ranging from startups to Formula 1. As it marks five years, the team reflects on their rebellious beginnings, collective model, and what it means to thrive on their own terms.</p>\n<p>Egg wasn't hatched in the usual way. The London-based agency began life in the strangest of circumstances, when it was mid-lockdown and the world of work and life was more uncertain than ever.</p>\n<p>What started as a group of friends helping old clients on the side quickly turned into something more deliberate. There was no grand plan, no market analysis, just a shared instinct to do things differently. Five years on, Egg is still guided by that instinct.</p>\n<p>As Nick Abrahams, managing partner &amp; co-founder, recalls, the origins were far from polished. \"Egg's an agency that formed organically after the sad end of an agency we all worked in together previously, and when that business closed due to COVID-19, we were still in touch with some old clients who asked us to support on the odd brand project here or there.</p>\n<p>\"We worked as a design collective without a name for a couple of months, loved it, and so started chatting about what our ideal agency might look like and how we might formalise what we were doing.\"</p>\n<p>That spirit of rebellion is baked into Egg's DNA, thanks to the fact that the team looked back at the things they disliked about traditional agencies and decided to try the opposite. \"Looking back at the weird old time in 2020 when we formed, the lack of clarity about the world we were living in was actually quite freeing,\" Nick says. \"The fact that no one had a clue what was going to happen with anything, but definitely the design/agency landscape, meant we were able to be quite brave and rebellious with how we could set up.\"</p>\n<p>One of the clearest outcomes of that early rebellion was Egg's ownership model. From the outset, the team opted for collective ownership and profit-sharing over the traditional hierarchy that most agencies employ.</p>\n<p>The effect on culture has been transformative, according to Nick. He says: \"The biggest impact we've seen is the change in accountability an individual has across all aspects of the business.</p>\n<p>\"A designer doesn't just focus on delivering great work on time because they might get a pay rise or a new word in front of their title, it's because their actions genuinely impact everyone else around them.\"</p>\n<p>This doesn't mean blurred boundaries, because roles remain defined; however, it does mean more care, curiosity, and accountability across the board. \"That's a brilliant culture to be surrounded by,\" Nick adds, \"as it's one (in its simplest form) of love.\"</p>\n<p>While many agencies scrambled to figure out hybrid working after the pandemic, Egg built remote-first into its foundations. For Rich Watters, designer &amp; co-founder, that decision has been central to the agency's resilience.</p>\n<p>\"Working remotely and flexibly is a foundational part of our identity as a business, not just a way of working,\" he says. \"Early doors in the business, we knew that creating an environment of trust and autonomy would be key to making it sustainable long term.\"</p>\n<p>The team already had a strong bond before setting out, which provided them with a solid foundation to adapt quickly. Daily check-ins, regular creative catch-ups, and the occasional in-person meet-up keep them close, even while they are spread across different places. Then there are the clients who are benefiting from more openness, real-time collaboration, and a more flexible rhythm.</p>\n<p>Of course, remote work isn't without its challenges. The buzz of office life and those post-work pints are sometimes missed, but as Rich points out, the trade-off is worth it. \"That balance lets us keep the energy and spontaneity of being together, while enjoying the focus and freedom that remote work brings.\"</p>\n<p>Despite its modest size, Egg has never shied away from ambitious briefs. Laurie Jackson, designer &amp; co-founder, says the agency's versatility is what surprises them most: \"Overall, what I'm most proud of and what has constantly surprised me is our versatility to shift from helping build brands for small startups to branding enormous global companies all with the same core team.\"</p>\n<p>From Experian to Formula 1, Egg has proved it can operate at scale, but Laurie's personal highlight was closer to home when they rebranded Pride in London. \"It was a very long collaborative project, which we took on ad hoc on top of the work we had, but culminated in a moment where I stood in Leicester Square, surrounded by spectators watching our hard work projected onto the big screen and all around us while the red arrows flew overhead. That one felt very real!\"</p>\n<p>Like any independent studio, Egg has faced its share of turbulence. Saoirse Richardson, managing partner &amp; co-founder, recalls a difficult spell in 2023, when big projects dropped away and sign-offs slowed. Admittedly, at this stage, they didn't have a buffer in place, but it was also a moment when Egg's unusual structure proved its worth.</p>\n<p>\"Our unique set-up as an agency really shone through and we took on the challenge as a collective responsibility,\" says Saoirse. \"We were not afraid to have challenging and honest discussions.\"</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.creativeboom.com/insight/egg-turns-five-the-independent-agency-rewriting-the-rules-with-collective-ownership-and-creative-freedom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She was the daughter of the future Count Baldwin V of Flanders (then one of the most important principalities in Europe) and Adela, the daughter of King Robert II ‘the Pious’ of France.</p>\n<p>Matilda had two brothers, Baldwin and Robert. Described by a contemporary chronicler as ‘highly born’, she could trace her descent from the kings of France, the emperors of Germany and even the Anglo-Saxon dynasty. The latter connection would be of great value to her future husband, William of Normandy.</p>\n<p>There is no surviving likeness of Matilda, but a later chronicler described her as “one of the most beautiful women that could be seen”. Her skeleton was examined in 1961 and recorded as being four feet two inches tall. This was likely a miscalculation, but she was known to be of small stature, as was her eldest son Robert ‘Curthose’ (meaning ‘short trousers’).</p>\n<p>Matilda was better educated than most noble women at the time. She was clever, politically astute, strong-willed and fiercely ambitious – qualities that would spark criticism and unease among her contemporaries, and that would shape the negative portrayals of her in the chronicles of the time.</p>\n<p>Among Matilda’s first suitors was a Saxon lord named Brihtric Mau (or Meaw), who had been sent to Flanders as an ambassador by King Edward the Confessor.</p>\n<p>Brihtric was one of the richest and most powerful nobles in England, and his vast lands spanned six western counties from Cornwall to Worcestershire. As well as being a man of wealth and influence, Brihtric was a tall and “stalwart”, with light blonde hair; one chronicler claims that Matilda fell in love with him at first sight. Without pausing to seek her father’s approval, she sent a messenger to England to offer herself in marriage.</p>\n<p>In an age when daughters were expected to meekly accept the fate that was decided for them by their parents, this was an astonishingly audacious act and gives an early glimpse of her forthright nature. But to her dismay and outrage, Brihtric rejected her proposal.</p>\n<p>Matilda never forgot the slight. Years later, when Queen of England, she had his lands confiscated and threw him into prison, where he died in mysterious circumstances. It was widely rumoured that Matilda had ordered his murder.</p>\n<h2>Matilda of Flanders and William of Normandy</h2>\n<p>In the late 1040s, Matilda received a proposal of marriage from William, Duke of Normandy. He had been the duke since the age of about seven or eight, and was widely known as ‘William the Bastard’, thanks to his illegitimacy. Although he grew into a fierce warrior who saw off Normandy’s enemies and extended its territories, he never shook off the stain of bastardy. He therefore set his sights on a wife with more than enough royal blood for the both of them.</p>\n<p>Matilda’s father greeted Duke William’s proposal with enthusiasm – given his duchy bordered Flanders, it would be a strategically advantageous alliance. But when his daughter heard of it, she declared that she would not lower herself to marry a ‘base-born duke’.</p>\n<p>Furious, William rode over to Flanders and confronted his would-be bride, dragging her to the ground, rolling her in the mud and almost beating her to death “with his fists, heels, and spurs”.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Read more |</strong><a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/period/norman/king-and-conqueror-true-story-real-history/\">How historically accurate is</a><i>King and Conqueror</i>?</li></ul>\n<p>According to contemporary chronicles, just a few days later Matilda announced that she would marry none but William, since “he must be a man of great courage and high daring” to have ventured to “come and beat me in my own father’s palace”.</p>\n<p>Whatever the truth of this outlandish tale, the couple were betrothed shortly afterwards.</p>\n<p>But there was another obstacle: Pope Leo IX prohibited the marriage on the grounds that William and Matilda were distantly related. Yet William and Matilda were not to be dissuaded; they defied the ban and married in secret in around 1050.</p>\n<h2>Matilda as Duchess of Normandy</h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/period/norman/real-matilda-of-flanders-william-the-conqueror-wife-life-legacy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Following the attempted assassination of Donald Trump in July 2024, Matt Elton spoke to historian Adam IP Smith about the history of violent attacks on US leaders. In this interview, first published in the October 2024 issue of <i>BBC History Magazine</i>, Smith discussed the political and social repercussions of such assaults across the decades</p>\n<h3>Matt Elton: Assassinations, and attempted assassinations, have occurred around the world throughout history. But is there a particularly American aspect to this story of political violence?</h3>\n<p><strong>Adam IP Smith:</strong> I think there is. Political violence is hardly unique to the US, sadly, so we must be careful about ascribing American exceptionalism to what we saw at Donald Trump’s rally [in Pennsylvania on 13 July 2024]. There is nevertheless an American political tradition into which this specific kind of gun violence – the attempted assassination of leading political figures, especially presidents and presidential candidates – fits.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong>On the podcast |</strong>\n        <a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/membership/assassinations-us-history-podcast-adap-ip-smith/\">Adam IP Smith on assassinations that shaped US history</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<h3>As a historian, do you think it’s a stretch to suggest that the violence that shaped the founding of the modern nation may have paved the way for later political violence in the US?</h3>\n<p>Certainly the political polarisation and the potential for political violence we’re seeing today form part of a recurrent pattern in US history.</p>\n<p>There are several reasons, but maybe the core one is that there’s long been a fundamental disagreement within the US about who constitutes the legitimate American nation. That has led to a fear, genuinely held by significant numbers of people involved in the political process, that the stakes are so high because if their political enemies win then everything will be lost – that their freedom, the republic, even their own place in society will be jeopardised.</p>\n<p>That’s partly because, from the beginning, the president of the United States has held many of the powers held by monarchs – in some respects, even greater powers. <a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/period/georgian/george-washington-first-us-president-founding-father-facts-life/\">George Washington</a> had more influence over the government of the US than <a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/membership/history-explorer-the-decline-of-george-iii/\">George III</a> had over the government in London, for instance. So the monarchical style of the US head of state puts a huge amount of pressure on that role, which needs to feel like the embodiment of America at that particular moment in time.</p>\n<h3>The first US president targeted was Andrew Jackson in 1835 – an episode that’s less familiar to many in the UK than later attempts. Why is that?</h3>\n<p>The reason may be just that it was unsuccessful: the gun wielded by the would-be assassin malfunctioned. If Jackson had been shot on the steps of the Capitol, then we would know about it.</p>\n<p>Jackson already had a bullet lodged in him from an earlier duel, one of several he’d fought (in one of which, some 30 years earlier, he’d killed a man). So Jackson himself was no stranger to gun violence. He was a deeply controversial and polarising figure – and, perhaps not irrelevantly to this conversation, the president to whom those advancing Trump’s agenda have most wanted to compare Trump.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Read more |</strong>\n        <a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/period/general-history/famous-assassinations/\">50 assassinations that changed the world</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Jackson was kind of an outsider – the original ‘drain the Washington swamp’ candidate. He first ran to become president in 1824, but failed due to what he called a “corrupt bargain”, and argued that the election had been stolen from him. He ran again in 1828 and won convincingly, defeating John Quincy Adams, who was the last of the old guard.</p>\n<p>In fact, Jackson was a wealthy slave holder in Tennessee – he wasn’t some hard-scrabble guy anymore – but he had literally been born in a log cabin and had worked his way up. Like Trump – indeed, like Trump’s new running mate, JD Vance, and many other big figures in American political history – he was of Scots Protestant Irish descent.</p>\n<p>The tradition that Jackson, Trump and Vance have tried to embody is one of rugged individualism, of standing up for yourself. It’s a kind of frontier mythos – the idea that in the end you have nothing to rely on but your wits and your bravery and your courage, and it’s all about you and your family.</p>\n<p>Jackson was both a perpetrator and a victim of gun violence. So in a way, if he had have been shot, it wouldn’t have fundamentally changed the image of him. It would almost have seemed fitting for him to die in that way, such was the nature of the romance built up around him.</p>\n<h3>Some presidential assassinations had repercussions not just in the US but on the world stage. What examples are particularly illuminating in terms of that wider picture?</h3>\n<p>The global impact of these events is one way of measuring the significance of the US in people’s imaginations. News of <a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/period/victorian/abraham-lincoln-assassination-shot-what-timeline/\">Lincoln’s assassination</a> in April 1865 reached Britain a week or so after the event, having been carried by the fastest ship to the west coast of Ireland, then transmitted by telegraph from there to London.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/period/modern/political-violence-us-history/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Dubbed “Prisoner 77,” Pietrzykowski faced terrible odds at Auschwitz, where more than a million people would perish between 1940 and 1945. But Pietrzykowski managed to survive, largely by winning dozens of boxing matches.</p>\n<p>The bantamweight vice-champion of Poland and a champion of Warsaw, Pietrzykowski soon realized that boxing could win him extra food and privileges — provided that he won his bouts. During his time at Auschwitz, Pietrzykowski engaged in between 40 and 60 matches, purportedly only losing just one of them. And while he boxed for the entertainment of the guards, he also became a symbol of hope for his fellow prisoners.</p>\n<p>This is the incredible true story of Tadeusz Pietrzykowski, as seen in the 2020 Polish film <i>The Champion of Auschwitz</i>.</p>\n<h2>A Rising Star In Polish Boxing</h2>\n<p>Tadeusz Pietrzykowski was born on April 8, 1917, in Warsaw, Poland. He was too young to remember <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/ww1-photos\">World War I</a>, which ended some months before his second birthday, and spent most his youth focused on sports. Pietrzykowski was interested in soccer as a teenager, and soon showed his skill as a boxer. </p>\n<p>He trained with a coach named Feliks “Papa” Stamm, who oversaw the development of scores of young boxers. Pietrzykowski took his training seriously, though <a href=\"https://polishnews.com/pietrzykowskis-fights-in-auschwitz\">Polish News</a> reports Pietrzykowski’s family thought his talents lay more in art than in boxing or soccer. </p>\n<p>Family Photo Archive of Eleonora SzafranPietrzykowski around 1938.</p>\n<p>“Teddy left behind notes about his workouts, which tell us how he was developing tactics and technique,” Dr. Karol Nawrocki, director at the Museum of the Second World War in Gdańs, Poland, told <i> Vice</i> in 2020. </p>\n<p>Tadeusz Pietrzykowski showed early promise, competing in matches that placed him among the best in his weight class. While he lacked the size of a heavyweight, his technical skill, sharp footwork, and grit made him a formidable fighter. By 1939, he was considered one of Poland’s young athletes to watch — until fate intervened.</p>\n<h2>Tadeusz Pietrzykowski’s Deportation To Auschwitz</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/ww2-color-photos\">World War II</a> began on September 1, 1939, when Germany invaded Poland. Pietrzykowski promptly put down his boxing gloves down and joined the fight. He joined a light artillery regiment and defended Warsaw against the Nazis and, when the city fell, headed to France, where thousands of his countrymen were forming a new Polish army under General Władysław Sikorski.</p>\n<p>Public DomainGerman tanks in the streets of Warsaw in September 1939.</p>\n<p>But Pietrzykowski never made it.</p>\n<p>Instead, the Gestapo arrested the 23-year-old on the Hungaro-Yugoslav border. Not long after that, Pietrzykowski became one of the first transports to the newly established <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/liberation-of-auschwitz\">Auschwitz concentration camp</a>, where he was branded with the number 77. A Catholic political prisoner, Pietrzykowski was thrust into a new, brutal world that would seek to dehumanize him as much as possible. </p>\n<p>Tadeusz Pietrzykowski didn’t start boxing in Auschwitz right away. At first, he was assigned to work in a carpenter’s shop, and though the labor was backbreaking, his prior fitness helped him persevere.</p>\n<p>All that changed in March 1941.</p>\n<h2>Tadeusz Pietrzykowski’s First Fight In Auschwitz</h2>\n<p>Family Photo Archive of Eleonora SzafranPietrzykowski found that winning boxing matches could earn him extra food, which he shared with his fellow prisoners.</p>\n<p>Tadeusz Pietrzykowski’s first fight came about by chance. In 1941, on a Sunday, Pietrzykowski noticed a large crowd near the camp kitchens. Suddenly, one person from the crowd broke away and called to him.</p>\n<p>“One of them ran towards me and shouted, ‘Teddy, you want a piece of bread, come quickly. There is a German boxer among us. I’m looking for someone to box with him and beat him. The winner will be rewarded with bread,'” Pietrzykowski<a href=\"https://www.normandy1944.info/holocaust/tadeusz-pietrzykowski\"> recalled of the fight years later</a>. “I weighed 42 kg [92 pounds], but decided to fight right away. I saw a perfectly built blonde, holding gloves that we used in winter during our work. When I was seen, the crowd laughed because I was very skinny.”</p>\n<p>Pietrzykowski’s opponent was Walter Düning, a German kapo (a prisoner who oversaw other prisoners), who had been a successful boxer before the war. He was a formidable opponent. But despite the odds, Pietrzykowski outmaneuvered Düning and claimed victory.</p>\n<p>That was the moment Pietrzykowski realized that boxing could secure him special privileges at Auschwitz.</p>\n<p>“At one point, Walter Düning lowered his gloves,” Pietrzykowski recalled. “He stopped fighting and, appreciating my advantage over him, asked which commando I would like to work in. I replied ‘Tierpfleger’ [animal caretaker] knowing that there could be additional food such as bagasse, swede, and carrots.”</p>\n<p>Family Photo Archive of Eleonora SzafranPietrzykowski fought more than 40 matches during his time in the concentration camp.</p>\n<p>Slowly but surely, Pietrzykowski became known as a boxer. The Auschwitz guards found him amusing and began “enrolling” him in other fights, sometimes against guards, sometimes against other inmates. The guards often placed bets on the outcomes of the fights, but to call the events sport would be a disservice to the word.</p>\n<p>These were exercises in cruelty.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/tadeusz-pietrzykowski\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

And of course, many Americans celebrate <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/july-fourth-myths\">July 4th</a> every year during other anniversaries of the country’s birthday.</p>\n    <p>It’s little wonder why the National Archives wanted to do something special to honor the United States’ 250th anniversary, or the semiquincentennial. Aside from displaying the Constitution in its entirety, the National Archives is also opening up a new, permanent exhibit called “The American Story,” which allows guests to use artificial intelligence to explore various records.</p>\n    <p>Of course, many other celebrations and commemorations are planned elsewhere throughout the country, with Philadelphia’s Museum of the American Revolution planning to open a new exhibition on the Declaration of Independence later this year, and the New York Public Library set to display a copy of the Declaration handwritten by <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/thomas-jefferson-dark-side\">Thomas Jefferson</a> next year.</p>\n    <p>For now, with the entirety of the Constitution on display, it is a reminder for Americans of both the importance of this foundational document and the rights it affords those who call the country home.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Next, learn about  the rare, signed copy of the Constitution found sitting in an old file cabinet in North Carolina.

The castle remains unnamed, but it was likely built in the 12th or 13th century.</p>\n    <p>The discovery was part of a major archaeology project described in a new book: <i>The Archaeology of Finlaggan, Islay</i>. The book describes archaeological work conducted at the site in the 1980s and 1990s and the decades of analysis that followed, revealing that the area was seemingly the epicenter of power for the lords of western Scotland.</p>\n    <h2>The Medieval History Of The Isle of Islay</h2>\n    <p>David Caldwell is the author of <i>The Archaeology of Finlaggan, Islay</i> and the lead archaeologist on the project to study the site where the castle once stood.

In the 14th and 15th centuries, the two small islands on Loch Finlaggan held a palace that was home to the Lords of the Isles, powerful members of the MacDonald clan who ruled the islands of western Scotland, acted like kings, and even invaded the mainland from time to time.</p>\n    <p>Before the Lords of the Isles lived on the lake and transformed Finlaggan into their ceremonial and administrative center, however, an earlier castle stood on the same two islands.</p>\n    <h2>The Long-Lost Castle That Once Stood On Loch Finlaggan</h2>\n    <p>Before the Lords of the Isles gained power, their ancestors seemingly built a series of structures on Loch Finlaggan between the 12th and 13th centuries.

Those rulers used such towers to showcase their power and wealth, and whoever built the castle at Finlaggan likely did so for similar reasons.</p>\n    <p>It’s unclear why the original castle was destroyed, but it may have fallen into disrepair or been destroyed by an enemy attack.</p>\n    <p>Dr. Helen Spencer, the Head of Research at the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, said in the statement, “As a charity, part of our mission is to share knowledge of the past with everyone.” This latest publication is doing just that — revealing the little-known medieval history of Scotland’s westernmost reaches.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>After reading about the forgotten castle on Loch Finlaggan, discover the story of  Edinburgh Castle.

Between 1975 and 1979, the country was at the mercy of his ruthless regime, one that sought to exterminate anyone considered an “enemy.” Under the rule of Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge movement, an estimated two million people — nearly a quarter of the population — died from starvation, overwork, disease, and mass execution.</p>\n<p>Cities were emptied, religion was outlawed, and families were torn apart in the name of building a supposedly utopian agrarian society. Pol Pot was the architect of “Year Zero,” a movement that promised equality but instead delivered genocide. He was a man who projected humility but orchestrated policies that dismantled his nation — and never faced true justice.</p>\n<p>The once-quiet student of Marxism in Paris returned home to engineer one of the bloodiest revolutions of the 20th century, but Pol Pot died at age 73 under house arrest in the Cambodian jungle. He left behind a fractured and traumatized country, and a legacy as the man who broke it.</p>\n<p>This is the story of his rise — and fall.</p>\n<h2>The Formative Youth Of Saloth Sar</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/pol-pot\">Pol Pot</a> was born Saloth Sar — “Sar” loosely translating to “white” or “pale,” a reflection of his lighter complexion — on May 19, 1925, in the small farming village of Prek Sbauv in central Cambodia. His family lived modestly but comfortably, with enough land to employ laborers and maintain status within their community. As a child, he grew up studying the fundamental principles of Buddhism, and even spent a year at a Buddhist monastery. </p>\n<p>His education soon took him far beyond the rice paddies, however.</p>\n<p>In 1949, Sar set off for Paris with a scholarship — and it quickly changed his worldview. In France, he was exposed to a different way of life and was surrounded by centuries of French culture, but radical new ideas were forming in Europe at the time as well. Sar was transfixed.</p>\n<p>CPA Media Pte LtdSaloth Sar, later known as Pol Pot, circa 1979.</p>\n<p>Alongside his study of radio technologies, Sar spent much of his time immersed in communist theory, absorbing ideas about class struggle and revolutionary transformation. Back in his home country, many others were also newly drawn to ideas about Communism.</p>\n<p>In 1951, the Khmer People’s Revolutionary Party (KPRP) was founded in Cambodia. Revolution was brewing on multiple fronts, as the Cambodians also fought for the independence from France.</p>\n<p>And after Saloth Sar returned to Cambodia in 1953, he soon took advantage of the dramatic changes taking place across his country.</p>\n<h2>The Rise Of The Khmer Rouge</h2>\n<p>By November 1953, Cambodia had achieved its independence from France. Meanwhile, Saloth Sar worked as a teacher while simultaneously plotting a communist revolution with the KPRP.</p>\n<p>Throughout the next decade, Sar rose through the ranks of the organization, which was renamed Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK) and would eventually become known as the Khmer Rouge. Sar also began identifying himself with a <i>nom de guerre</i>, Pol Pot.</p>\n<p>CPA Media Pte LtdKhmer Rouge soldiers in 1975.</p>\n<p>He became the leader of the CPK in 1963, the same year that the Khmer Rouge set up guerrilla bases deep in the Cambodian countryside. As the decade came to a close, the movement only grew more radical. Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge soldiers — mostly composed of teenage peasant boys — gained the support of peasants living on the fringes of Cambodian society, organizing their revolution around causes that would support the poor at the expense of the wealthier people living in the cities.</p>\n<p>Then came the Vietnam War.</p>\n<p>Although Cambodia was not directly involved in the conflict, as Vietnam’s neighbor it still suffered from the fighting. The violence drove more and more people out of the cities and into the arms of Pol Pot and his followers.</p>\n<p>In 1970, the movement gained an unexpected ally: Prince Norodom Sihanouk. The prince had lost power after General Lon Nol staged a coup — possibly with the support of the United States. Sihanouk, furious, then allied himself with Pol Pot’s guerrillas, lending them legitimacy in the eyes of many peasants.

At the same time, he described the labor market as no longer “solid.”</p>\n<p>He cited hiring slowing, immigration shifts reducing supply, and AI adoption potentially weighing on entry-level jobs.</p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Powell’s remarks were even more dovish than his 2024 guidance when the Fed slashed rates by 50 bps. This suggests a deliberate pivot toward prioritizing employment over <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency/\">inflation</a>.</p>\n<h2>Market Reaction With Fed Divisions on Full Display: Dollar Slides, Equities Eye Liquidity</h2>\n<p>The new dot-plot revealed a central bank struggling to find consensus. Nine of 19 officials see two more cuts this year, while six expect no further easing.</p>\n<p>One member even projects a hike, while Trump appointee Stephen Miran dissented in favor of a 50 bps cut.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“This meeting was a mess…One member thinks the Fed hikes this year…another thinks we get five cuts. This rigging of the</p><a href=\"\">voting</a>to create the illusion of a ‘consensus’ and then publishing a wide dot plot like this only further undermines their credibility,”<a href=\"\">said</a>macro investment researcher Jim Bianco.</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/biancoresearch/status/1968439250325836134/photo/1\">Jim Bianco on X</a></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, The Kobeissi Letter called the move historic, highlighting the first rate cut in over 30 years with Core PCE <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency/\">inflation</a> above 2.9%.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s clear the Fed is prioritizing the labor market over</p><a href=\"\">inflation</a>,” Kobeissi<a href=\"\">wrote</a>, noting markets now expect as many as four more cuts by September 2026.</blockquote>\n<p>The immediate market response was swift. The US dollar fell to its weakest level since February 2022, while equities held near record highs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/perpetual-futures-contracts\">Futures markets</a> priced in at least two additional cuts by year-end, with Kalshi data showing the odds of three cuts spiking above 60%.</p>\n<h2>What Did the Markets Interpret from Powell’s Speech Yesterday?</h2>\n<p>Barchart highlighted that when the Fed cuts rates within 2% of stock market all-time highs, the S&amp;P 500 has historically risen 100% of the time over the following 12 months, averaging a 14% gain.</p>\n<p>Fidelity’s Jurrien Timmer compared the moment to the late-1998 LTCM crisis, when the Greenspan Fed eased into strong markets, fueling a spectacular rebound.</p>\n<p>Crypto markets are also watching liquidity flows closely, with analyst Ash Crypto highlighting prospects for more liquidity in the face of more rate cuts. This, he says, would translate into potential pumps for crypto prices.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“More cuts = More liquidity = pump,” the analyst</p><a href=\"\">wrote</a>.</blockquote>\n<h2>The Case for Caution</h2>\n<p>Still, not everyone is convinced the cut heralds an extended bull cycle. Mark Minervini argued the Fed’s move was a “token” cut. <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-us-cpi-fed-rate-decision-september/\">Given inflation’s persistence</a>, he says it is unlikely to set off an aggressive easing path.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Rate cuts are typically bullish, particularly when they occur outside of a recession. But the Fed is cutting preemptively rather than reacting to an outright downturn. That distinction matters: it lowers the likelihood of an aggressive easing path, which could diminish the market impact,” he</p><a href=\"\">noted</a>.</blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile, economists at The Conversation stressed the balancing act: cutting too quickly could reignite <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency/\">inflation</a>, while moving too slowly risks a sharper labor downturn.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/trump-tariff-appeal-crypto-market-impact/\">Tariff-driven price pressures</a> complicate the picture, particularly for lower-income households, who spend more on imported essentials that are now climbing in cost.</p>\n<p>Henrik Zeberg, a long-time cycle analyst, warned that markets may enter a euphoric blow-off phase before a severe downturn.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Liquidity now will only build a higher peak from which the market can crash,” he</p><a href=\"\">wrote</a>, likening today’s rally to late-1920s behavior.</blockquote>\n<h2>What Comes Next</h2>\n<p>The divergence between strong market technicals and weakening fundamentals leaves investors in a precarious position.</p>\n<p>Investors believe Powell has signaled further cuts are coming. Against this backdrop, sentiment is bullish, at least for now, with equities at records and crypto climbing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/price/bitcoin/\">BeInCrypto</a></p>\n<p>As of this writing, Bitcoin was trading for $117,107, while Ethereum exchanged hands for $4,572. Both assets showed strength following the Fed’s decision.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding, risks abound and continue to erode investor confidence. These include:</p>\n<ul><li>A labor market softening into recession,</li><li>Tariff-driven <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency/\">inflation</a>stickiness, and</li><li>Political overtones around Powell’s “risk management” framing.</li></ul>\n<p>If the Fed cuts too aggressively, it risks losing its <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency/\">inflation</a>-fighting credibility. At the same time, rising unemployment could force more drastic action later if it moves too cautiously.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the next few weeks for riskier assets like Bitcoin may be defined by liquidity-driven optimism. However, this is with the understanding that this rally rests on fragile ground.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/feds-25bps-cut-labor-risks-inflation-liquidity-bets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n<h2>1. Introduction: The Contrarian View of Today’s Crypto Market</h2>\n<p>The cryptocurrency market is currently in a state of flux. Headlines are dominated by discussions of regulatory crackdowns, government scrutiny, and failing projects. Combined with a dramatic reduction in retail interest, many have come to believe the golden days of crypto are over. However, this mindset often misses the true opportunity. When the hype fades and the noise dies down, seasoned investors see clear skies ahead.</p>\n<p>Contrarian investors—those who run counter to mainstream sentiment—recognize powerful opportunities in pessimism. While the masses exit the digital asset space due to fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), smart capital begins deploying quietly, focused on fundamentals and future utility. The current <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bear-market/\">bear market</a> isn’t a death sentence for crypto—it’s a reset. It clears overvalued protocols, washes out unsustainable business models, and paves the way for real innovation and resilience. Historically, bear markets have produced some of the market’s biggest winners, offering patient investors a chance to strike gold while everyone else is looking the other way.</p>\n<h2>2. Analyzing Hidden Investment Opportunities in Today's Crypto Landscape</h2>\n<p>Though Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the blue-chip players of the crypto ecosystem, the real innovation is happening beneath the surface. Savvy investors are now turning their attention toward infrastructure and protocol-layer solutions poised for long-term relevance. Innovations like <strong>zk-Rollups</strong>—specifically zkSync and StarkNet—are addressing essential scaling challenges, offering fast, cheap transactions on Ethereum while maintaining trustless security. These technologies are essential to onboarding the next billion users, representing asymmetric upside for those who invest early.</p>\n<p>Similarly, data protocols like <strong>Arweave</strong> and <strong>The Graph</strong> serve critical functions for decentralized ecosystems. Permanent, censorship-resistant data storage and data indexing should not be undervalued in a world increasingly focused on data ownership and freedom.</p>\n<p>Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization projects like <strong>Centrifuge</strong> and <strong>Maple Finance</strong> are bridging the gap between traditional capital markets and decentralized finance (DeFi). These platforms allow real assets—such as invoices, commercial real estate, or even art—to be tokenized, traded, and collateralized on-chain, opening doors for institutional investors and stable yield generation.</p>\n<p>Moreover, projects focused on regulatory compliance—sometimes dubbed <strong>RegFi</strong>—are increasingly relevant. As regulators crack down on opaque projects and demand transparency, tokens that are built around compliance and governance will likely be the first to welcome institutional inflows. <strong>Tokeny</strong> and <strong>Polymesh</strong> are examples of blockchains developed specifically to meet these stringent requirements, offering token lifecycle management, KYC/AML integration, and permissioned infrastructure for real-world finance. These aren't meme coins; they're the plumbing for the future of digital capital markets.</p>\n<h2>3. Balancing Risk vs. Reward in Cryptocurrencies</h2>\n<p>It’s no secret that the cryptocurrency market is volatile. While volatility scares off casual speculators, seasoned investors understand it as a double-edged sword—an opportunity for monumental returns if managed correctly. The key to thriving in crypto is not to eliminate risk, but to qualify and quantify it.</p>\n<p>Identifying risk involves a thorough analysis of factors including protocol security, the competency of the founding team, roadmap execution, regulatory developments, and token supply economics. For example, if a project has a highly inflationary tokenomic model, early investors may suffer significant dilution. Similarly, if a protocol’s core contracts are not audited or have a history of exploits, the risk outweighs the reward, no matter the upside.</p>\n<p>Investors can lower exposure and preserve capital with practical strategies such as diversification across different sectors (DeFi, infrastructure, gaming), geographic regions, and layer ecosystems (Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos). Being a <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/contrarian-investor/\">contrarian investor</a> also means staying disciplined in the face of fear and greed. Those who build robust investment frameworks, rather than chasing hype cycles, often outperform over time.</p>\n<h2>4. Smart Crypto Investment Strategies for 2024 and Beyond</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Value-Based Token Picking:</strong>Dig beyond token prices and market caps. Evaluate real protocol usage, developer contributions on GitHub, on-chain transaction growth, and native revenues. Tools like Token Terminal and CryptoQuant can be immensely helpful in conducting objective assessments.</li>\n      <li><strong>Cycle Positioning:</strong>History has shown that building positions during times of low sentiment offers the best ROI. Accumulate assets gradually when the mainstream is bearish, and scale out when sentiment flips positive. Avoid making emotional decisions based on social media hype or influencer shilling.</li>\n      <li><strong>Staking &amp; Yield Farming:</strong>Generate passive income through staking protocols like<strong>Lido</strong>and<strong>RocketPool</strong>, or explore emerging protocols such as<strong>EigenLayer</strong>that offer Ethereum re-staking capabilities. For less technical users,<a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/staking-as-a-service/\">staking-as-a-service</a>platforms handle the complexity while maximizing yields.</li>\n      <li><strong>Private Markets &amp; RegCF Access:</strong>Sites like<strong>Republic</strong>,<strong>SeedInvest</strong>, and<strong>Securitize</strong>allow accredited and sometimes retail investors to participate in early-stage token and equity rounds. These private placements often offer a much better entry point than post-IDO (initial DEX offering) price actions, especially in high conviction projects.</li>\n      <li><strong>Trend Tracking:</strong>Monitor emerging sectors like decentralized AI, real-world asset (RWA) financing, and undercollateralized lending. These niches may define the next trend cycles and create 10x+ opportunities in the coming bull market.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>5. Case Studies: Winning Against the Crowd</h2>\n<p>To understand the value of a contrarian approach, it’s important to study previous success stories where early investors bucked mainstream skepticism and reaped the rewards.</p>\n<p><strong>Chainlink (2018–2021):</strong> Dismissed by many early on as a niche project with limited utility, Chainlink proved essential to DeFi by providing oracle services that ensured trustless real-world data integration. As the DeFi sector exploded, Chainlink surged over 100x from its earlier valuations.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/crypto-investment-opps-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We’re thrilled to bring you another action-packed edition filled with the latest insights, trends, and market developments to help fuel your crypto journey. Whether you’re an experienced trader managing a diversified portfolio or a newcomer exploring the rapidly evolving world of digital assets, our newsletter is your go-to resource for reliable, up-to-the-minute information. Let’s dive deep into the movements that are shaping the landscape of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the ever-growing altcoin ecosystem.</p>\n<h2>Market Recap:</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Bitcoin (BTC):</strong>The flagship cryptocurrency is currently trading around $115,000, slowly approaching a major resistance level at $118,000. While some technical indicators point toward a consolidation phase, historical data suggests that Bitcoin often experiences a short-term pullback before breaking through critical resistance zones. Want to understand these cyclical movements better? Check out our detailed<a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/history-of-bitcoin-bull-bear-market/\">Bitcoin Bull Market</a>walkthrough and see how price tends to behave in the aftermath of halving events and macroeconomic shifts.</li>\n      <li><strong>Ethereum (ETH):</strong>Ethereum continues to show strength above a key ascending trendline, currently maintaining levels that signal upward momentum. The ongoing upgrade initiatives tied to Ethereum 2.0, including better scalability and energy efficiency, have bolstered investor confidence. As decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi platforms, and NFT marketplaces remain built atop Ethereum’s network, we anticipate growing demand and potential price appreciation.</li>\n      <li><strong>Altcoins:</strong>The broader altcoin market is mixed, with several tokens experiencing strong inflows fueled by announcements, partnerships, and community sentiment. From AI-powered crypto protocols to layer-2 scaling solutions, altcoins continue to carve out their own niches. Read more about specific sectors and promising projects in our in-depth<a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/altcoin/\">Altcoin investing guide</a>, which breaks down market caps, use cases, and tokenomics essentials.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>Featured Trend or Insight:</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>\"Is Bitcoin’s Growth Engine Losing Steam?\"</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>As institutional investors increasingly adopt Bitcoin and mainstream financial platforms offer BTC integration, the narrative around the premier cryptocurrency is shifting. Historically, Bitcoin’s price trajectory followed an exponential curve, driven by scarcity (only 21 million BTC will ever exist), halving events, and network expansion. But today’s market shows signs that this explosive growth may be tapering off. Analysts suggest that without groundbreaking innovation or new utility enhancements, BTC’s upside may become more limited.</p>\n<p>Transaction fees have begun to eclipse their past highs, and although Taproot upgrades vowed to bring more efficiency, the real-world benefits remain modest. Stablecoins, Layer 1 alternatives, and interoperability-focused ecosystems now draw users who might have once invested mainly in BTC. For those balancing risk with long-term potential, diversifying across sectors might be a smarter strategy than a Bitcoin-only bet. Don’t miss our comprehensive and data-driven piece on futuristic projections: <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bitcoin-btc-price-prediction/\">Bitcoin Price Predictions through 2030</a> — a must-read for forward-looking investors.</p>\n<h2>Top Gainers &amp; Losers:</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Top Gainer:</strong><i>Pump.fun (PUMP)</i>has gone parabolic, with daily trading volume surpassing an eye-popping $1 billion. This sudden surge has been largely driven by momentum traders and retail investors riding the memecoin craze. Community engagement, viral meme content, and listings on new exchanges have further accelerated FOMO. As always, meme-token investments are highly volatile, so proceed with caution.</li>\n      <li><strong>Top Loser:</strong><i>KindlyMD (KMD)</i>saw its token nosedive more than 55% in just 24 hours. This dramatic decline was traced to negative sentiment across forums and automated trading bots triggering stops after a swing trading alert flagged bearish patterns. Despite the broader market being relatively stable, KMD’s poor liquidity and negative momentum intensified the selloff. Always remember to manage risk and check token fundamentals before jumping in on hype-driven pumps.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>News Highlights:</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Bitcoin Reserve Bill Gains Momentum:</strong>High-profile bitcoiners like Michael Saylor and Cynthia Lummis are now collaborating to promote federal legislation proposing the inclusion of Bitcoin in national reserves. This bill could reshape future fiscal policy by establishing BTC as a digital gold standard. If passed, the bill would grant Bitcoin a powerful status on government balance sheets, bolstering its legitimacy worldwide.</li>\n      <li><strong>American Express Takes NFTs Global:</strong>Travel innovator meets blockchain tech — American Express has unveiled NFT-powered ‘passport stamps’ for its premium cardholders. These NFTs are not just collectibles, but also unlock exclusive travel perks and digital identity capabilities. This signals a bullish step forward in real-world applications of NFTs, especially with a major legacy financial institution leading the charge.</li>\n      <li><strong>XRP &amp; DOGE ETFs in the Pipeline:</strong>Investment firms have quietly begun filing preliminary paperwork for ETFs based on XRP and Dogecoin. If approved by regulatory watchdogs, these funds could open mainstream investor access to two of the most widely held altcoins. This move, while controversial to some, underscores how altcoins once viewed as niche or meme-based are entering institutional portfolios.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>On Our Radar:</h2>\n<p>Solana has caught our attention with its corporate treasury now exceeding $4 billion in value. This increase in reserves is a strong signal that enterprise adoption within the Solana network is beginning to materialize. As the ecosystem continues to grow, boasting faster transaction speeds and lower network costs than many competitors, institutional players are starting to take note. We’re keeping a sharp eye on Solana-based DeFi protocols and NFT marketplaces that are driving network utility beyond speculation.</p>\n<p>We're also monitoring rising activity around Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization — a sphere expected to grow exponentially as traditional finance integrates with blockchain infrastructure. Projects facilitating tokenized securities, real estate, and carbon credits are gaining traction fast. Expect to see this trend become a dominant force throughout 2024 and beyond.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/altcoin-news-2025-09-18t09-50-20-964z/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n<h2>Bitcoin ETFs: The Inevitable Catalyst Wall Street Ignored</h2>\n<p>As traditional financial giants increasingly establish a foothold in the digital assets space, <strong>Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)</strong> are rising to prominence as a strategic gateway to mainstream adoption. While most media focus remains tied to Bitcoin’s short-term price swings and volatility, many miss the deeper transformation taking place. We are witnessing a shift from a retail-dominated market to institution-driven, long-term capital inflow. And at the front lines of this seismic transition are Bitcoin ETFs — vehicles that offer regulated, familiar access to the decentralized financial frontier.</p>\n<p>For savvy investors who can look beyond day-to-day movements, Bitcoin ETFs are far more than just another investment product. These instruments represent a bridge between two financial worlds. On one side, we have Bitcoin, an asset born from distrust in centralized banking. On the other, we have legacy institutions whose very credibility lies in their regulatory compliance and risk management. The convergence of these forces marks a defining moment in crypto history — and yet, much of Wall Street remains stuck in cautious observation mode.</p>\n<h3>Why ETFs Matter More Than Ever</h3>\n<p>Exchange-Traded Funds revolutionized traditional finance by providing investors with transparent, liquid, and low-cost exposure to diversified assets. This democratization of investing is now arriving in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Spot Bitcoin ETFs give institutional and retail investors a streamlined, regulated channel for gaining exposure to BTC without requiring direct asset management, cold wallet storage, or understanding the technical nuances of private keys and blockchain confirmations.</p>\n<p>The implications are profound. Each ETF share backed by physical BTC represents a withdrawal of supply from circulation. Unlike derivative-based exposure or synthetic tokens, spot ETFs must purchase and hold real Bitcoin in reserve. This accumulation gradually reduces the liquid supply accessible on open exchanges. Over time, basic supply-demand economics suggest upward pressure on price. If demand remains consistent or increases while the available BTC on-market decreases, the value of Bitcoin is likely to rise — perhaps significantly.</p>\n<p>It's crucial to revisit <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bitcoin/\">what Bitcoin (BTC)</a> truly is. Far from just a speculative digital coin, Bitcoin is a provably scarce store of value, boasting a hard cap of 21 million coins. This scarcity, hardcoded in the protocol, resonates with institutional investors seeking an inflation-resistant hedge. ETFs, by facilitating large-scale exposure, are strengthening Bitcoin’s investment narrative as “digital gold.”</p>\n<h3>The Impact of ETFs on Bitcoin Price Dynamics</h3>\n<p>The disruptive effect of Bitcoin ETFs extends well beyond accessibility. Their emergence is transforming how Bitcoin’s price is discovered. Rather than the market being driven primarily by retail users reacting emotionally to tweets or media narratives, ETFs introduce steady and methodical capital deployment. Asset managers conducting large ETF purchases tend to follow strategic macroeconomic themes, execute on quarterly allocations, and make decisions based on diversified portfolio objectives rather than short-term hype.</p>\n<p>What this does is fundamentally dampen price volatility in the long term. Instead of wild swings caused by sudden mass sell-offs, institutional ownership lowers volatility through slower, more deliberate movements. When ETFs steadily accumulate during market dips, they add invisible price floors. This cushions downward pressure and builds institutional “support zones” that new investors rely on when entering the market. Conversely, recoveries are often sharper due to constrained liquid supply — especially if those ETFs choose to hold rather than sell for long durations.</p>\n<p>This shift creates a more stable environment, one that is more palatable to family offices, pension funds, and sovereign wealth managers. As traditional investors incrementally adopt Bitcoin through ETF vehicles, further confidence emerges, triggering a self-reinforcing feedback loop that drives long-term appreciation. The result? Bitcoin ceases to be viewed as risky speculation and starts to earn its place in conservative portfolios alongside gold, bonds, or broad equity indexes.</p>\n<h3>Recent ETF Inflows: A Contrarian Signal</h3>\n<p>In recent months, Bitcoin ETFs have experienced tremendous inflows, especially during periods of market uncertainty. Major institutional offerings such as BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF have each secured billions of dollars in assets under management (AUM) within a short span following their launch. This is far from a retail-fueled flash-in-the-pan; it is coordinated, methodical acquisition by power players.</p>\n<p>It’s worth noting that institutional adoption often trails retail speculation — but when the shift occurs, it often marks the start of a more sustained growth phase. The very nature of institutional investing is cautious, often waiting for regulatory clarity, auditor-reviewed structures, and liquidity depth before engaging. Now that those barriers are beginning to fall, we’re watching a crescendo of capital enter the market quietly, piece by piece.</p>\n<p>While some traders frame this as a \"top signal,\" arguing that once institutions buy, most returns are priced in, history tells a different tale. Institutional investors are rarely early — but when they do arrive, they often make up for lost time by deploying large capital allocations strategically over time. This steady absorption sets up for constrained supply conditions and can lead to massive appreciation.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n    <h2>The Commodity Class Is Law</h2>\n    <p>In a market clouded by uncertainty, one truth has already been established: Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies belong to the commodity class.<br/>The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and federal courts have ruled repeatedly that Bitcoin is a commodity under the Commodity Exchange Act. The CFTC v. McDonnell (2018) decision and CME’s regulated Bitcoin futures contracts leave no doubt — Bitcoin trades under the same legal framework as gold, oil, or wheat.<br/>In January 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reinforced that status by approving spot Bitcoin ETFs as Commodity-Based Trust Shares. The commodity class isn’t theory — it’s defined law.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://cdn.getmidnight.com/13448471d89a9cd8d7f71026a0334ec8/2025/09/POW.jpg\"/>\n    <h2>The Golden Lineage of Proof-of-Work</h2>\n    <p>Bitcoin was the genesis: digital gold with no issuer, no premine, no promises. But the lineage didn’t stop there. Other proof-of-work assets carried forward the same DNA: decentralization, fair mining, and issuance without corporate control.<br/>This is the Golden Lineage — assets that regulators and markets consistently treat as commodities, not securities. And critically, there are only four Proof-of-Work coins launched before 2015 that fully hold to what many call the King’s Law: Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Vertcoin. These are the foundation stones of the commodity class.</p>\n    <h2>Litecoin: The Silver Signal</h2>\n    <p>If Bitcoin is gold, Litecoin is silver. With faster block times and over a decade of survival, Litecoin has proven itself as a foundational proof-of-work asset.<br/>Now, it has stepped into Bitcoin’s regulatory shadow. In 2025, major exchanges filed for spot Litecoin ETFs, explicitly building on Bitcoin’s commodity precedent. This marks Litecoin as the signal — proof that the commodity class is expanding beyond BTC.</p>\n    <h2>Dogecoin: The Cultural Commodity</h2>\n    <p>Dogecoin adds another branch to the lineage. Born as a meme, it evolved into one of the most mined and most traded proof-of-work assets. No premine, no ICO, and a global community have ensured its survival.<br/>Dogecoin demonstrates that even culture-driven coins can achieve commodity status when they are decentralized, mined fairly, and operate without an issuer.</p>\n    <h2>Vertcoin: The Overlooked Heir</h2>\n    <p>This brings us to the hidden gem in Bitcoin’s lineage: <a href=\"https://vertcoin.org\">Vertcoin (VTC)</a>.<br/>Launched in 2014 with no ICO, no premine, and no centralized control, Vertcoin was designed for one mission: true decentralization. Unlike most networks, it remains ASIC-resistant, keeping mining accessible to everyday participants and aligned with Satoshi’s vision of a people-powered network.<br/>By structure, Vertcoin belongs to the same commodity class as Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin:<br/>- Proof-of-Work secured<br/>- Decentralized, no issuer promises<br/>- Fair distribution, no premine or ICO<br/>- Recognized trading markets, fungible and uniform<br/>Yet unlike BTC, LTC, and DOGE, Vertcoin trades far below the spotlight. That gap between commodity-class certainty and market recognition is what makes it the golden opportunity.</p>\n    <h2>The Family Tree Is Written — The Advantage Is Hidden</h2>\n    <p>- Bitcoin: defined as a commodity by law and futures markets.<br/>- Litecoin: signaling commodity expansion through ETF filings.<br/>- Dogecoin: the cultural commodity with scale and community.<br/>- Vertcoin: the overlooked heir, built on the same DNA, still waiting for recognition.<br/>Certainty is rare in crypto — Bitcoin and Litecoin have it. Dogecoin proved it culturally. Vertcoin, the fourth member of the pre-2015 lineage that holds the King’s Law, won’t stay hidden forever.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bitcoin-defined-it-litecoin-etfs-validate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Traditional capitalism is experiencing a profound transformation, one that is redefining the very fabric of global financial systems. At the forefront of this seismic shift is cryptocurrency—a decentralized, borderless, and permissionless paradigm that operates beyond the control of traditional banking infrastructures and central governments. Cryptocurrencies are not just digital assets anymore; they have evolved into foundational elements of an emerging economic order that many are calling <i>Capitalism 2.0</i>.</p>\n<p>This new financial architecture is driven by an ethos of open-source collaboration, decentralized governance, and blockchain-based transparency. Central banks are being challenged by algorithmic stablecoins. Wall Street is competing with decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Institutional investment portfolios now include tokens, and venture capital is pouring billions into Web3 projects. As the lines blur between traditional and digital finance, it’s becoming clear that crypto is not a trend—it’s the next evolution of capitalism itself.</p>\n<h2>Investing in the Crypto Market</h2>\n<p>The cryptocurrency market is a highly dynamic ecosystem characterized by 24/7 trading hours, immense innovation, and often extreme volatility—all of which create both unparalleled opportunities and substantial risks for investors. The key to navigating this explosive environment lies in understanding its nuances and being able to identify asymmetric investment opportunities before they go mainstream.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bitcoin/\"> Bitcoin (BTC)</a> continues to be the gold standard of digital assets. As the first and most secure blockchain, it offers scarcity through its capped supply and attracts interest from both retail and institutional investors alike. </p>\n<p><strong>Ethereum (ETH)</strong>, with its support for smart contracts and thriving DeFi ecosystem, remains a high-conviction long-term hold. However, the most compelling alpha often lies beyond the blue chips—in emerging sectors and novel protocols.</p>\n<p>Investors today are pouring capital into a range of next-generation projects such as <strong>Layer 2 scaling solutions</strong> that tackle Ethereum’s congestion and high transaction fees. Optimism, Arbitrum, and zkSync are gaining traction for enabling faster and cheaper transactions. Meanwhile, AI-integrated blockchain platforms like Fetch.ai and SingularityNET are creating synergistic environments where machine learning intersects with secure, decentralized data infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The modular blockchain thesis is another strong narrative capturing investor attention. Networks like Celestia and Cosmos build composable ecosystems where components can be decoupled and customized, enabling faster innovation and higher performance at scale. Combine these with DAO-based governance models, and you're looking at investment potential akin to early-stage tech startups—with added liquidity and community participation.</p>\n<h2>Understanding the Market Trends</h2>\n<p>Understanding macro and micro trends in the cryptocurrency space is essential for investors who aim to stay ahead of the curve. Several important movements are currently shaping the landscape, indicating a sustained and widespread integration of blockchain technology into mainstream finance.</p>\n<p>First, the introduction of <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bitcoin-etf/\"> Spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> in multiple jurisdictions marks a milestone in regulatory acceptance. These instruments have opened the door for institutional investment, providing exposure to Bitcoin without requiring direct custody. As inflows rise, so does market legitimacy, creating a flywheel effect that enhances mainstream adoption.</p>\n<p>Another critical trend is the ongoing tokenization of <strong>real-world assets (RWAs)</strong>. From tokenized real estate and equities to fractionalized art and bonds, blockchain technology is making traditionally illiquid assets tradeable in seconds. This unlocks capital efficiency and democratizes access to markets previously reserved for elites.</p>\n<p><strong>Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</strong> continues to evolve, now moving towards more sustainable yield mechanisms and refined tokenomics. Protocols are focusing on utility-driven staking, insurance against smart contract risks, and integration with real-world data sources through oracles. Additionally, compliance layers are being introduced to satisfy regulatory criteria without compromising decentralization.</p>\n<p><strong>NFTs</strong> are also undergoing a transformation. No longer just speculative art pieces, NFTs are being utilized in gaming ecosystems, intellectual property management, ticketing systems, and even decentralized identity solutions. This diversification is expanding their utility and reducing their volatility over time, making them a more compelling investment segment again.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, as governments and regulators increase their involvement, crypto-native developers are responding with a renewed emphasis on decentralization and censorship resistance. This cat-and-mouse dynamic is driving innovation at a staggering pace—and keeping the market vibrant and investor-focused.</p>\n<h2>Maximizing Profits</h2>\n<p>To generate meaningful profit in the crypto space, investors must move beyond conventional strategies and embrace a contrarian, data-driven approach. Simple buy-and-hold tactics may yield modest returns, but the true potential lies in dynamic allocation, risk hedging, and capital deployment tailored to market cycles.</p>\n<p>One core strategy is adopting a <strong>contrarian mindset</strong>. Profits often emerge from making informed moves when sentiment is at its lowest. History has shown that buying during market capitulations—when “fear” dominates social metrics and sentiment indicators—can yield exponential gains when market confidence returns. Conversely, taking profits during irrational exuberance can protect capital and allow reentry at lower prices.</p>\n<p>Using on-chain analytics tools like Nansen, Glassnode, and Dune Analytics can offer invaluable insights into wallet activity, token supply changes, exchange inflows/outflows, and smart contract interactions. This data-driven approach can uncover accumulation patterns, early project momentum, and whale movements that often precede breakout rallies.</p>\n<p>Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) provide early access to nascent tokens often before centralized listings. By utilizing liquidity pools, you can engage in yield farming, liquidity provision, and token staking—but always with a security-first mindset. Smart contract auditing, impermanent loss mitigation, and thorough whitepaper evaluation are essential to prevent common pitfalls.</p>\n<p>Adopting strategies like <strong>dollar-cost averaging (DCA)</strong> into high-conviction assets during bearish periods allows investors to manage risk while building exposure gradually. Periodic rebalancing of the portfolio in bull markets can help lock in gains and maintain a diversified risk profile.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/crypto-capitalism-2-profit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>In an economic landscape marred by rising inflation and diminishing real returns from traditional financial instruments, crypto presents a disruptive alternative for savvy investors—<strong>yield-bearing stablecoins</strong>. These assets are far more than just digital representations of the U.S. dollar; they are engineered on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to <i>generate ongoing, passive income</i> with minimal price volatility. As we move into 2025, yield-bearing stablecoins are becoming a transformative force, enabling individuals to monetize idle liquidity without the red tape of conventional banking systems. With a few clicks, investors can earn real yield while retaining the dollar-peg stability they trust—this is income on autopilot, redefined for the digital age.</p>\n<h2>The Growing Importance of Passive Income</h2>\n<p>Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a crypto newcomer, one investing truth remains evergreen: <strong>the power of passive income compounds over time</strong>. This principle becomes even more essential during extended bear markets, where portfolio prices fall, market sentiment nosedives, and liquidity becomes elusive. Traditional strategies often falter under such conditions, but passive income allows investors to weather volatility by providing steady, reliable returns.</p>\n<p>Yield-bearing stablecoins address this need elegantly. They offer a mechanism to earn yield without the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. In downturns, when price action becomes unpredictable or outright hostile, predictable earnings from these digital instruments serve as a stabilizing force. Whether you're taking a conservative approach or diversifying across high-risk altcoins, passive income can cushion losses and even provide a basis for reinvestment. In fact, some of the most profitable DeFi portfolios have been carved out and grown during periods when the rest of the market stalled or retraced.</p>\n<h2>What Are Yield-Bearing Stablecoins?</h2>\n<p>To understand their value, we need to differentiate basic stablecoins from their yield-generating cousins. Standard stablecoins like USDC and USDT simply act as blockchain-based representations of fiat currency. They are typically used for transfers, trading, or holding value. However, they offer <i>zero yield</i>—unless manually deployed into DeFi yield farms, lending platforms, or liquidity pools. That’s where <strong>yield-bearing stablecoins</strong> redefine the model.</p>\n<p>Examples like <strong>yETH</strong> from Yearn Finance, <strong>aUSDC</strong> issued by Aave, and <strong>sDAI</strong> via Spark Protocol accumulate interest directly from underlying strategies. When you hold these tokens, you participate in lending markets, staking mechanisms, or automated DeFi strategies without doing the heavy lifting yourself. These assets are programmatically designed to capture yield from verified DeFi sources and automatically rebalance for maximum efficiency. There is no need for staking, locking periods, or gas-intensive interaction with smart contracts. These stablecoins offer set-it-and-forget-it convenience.</p>\n<p>Because their earnings are embedded in the token design, yield-bearing stablecoins also benefit from composability across protocols. They can be used as collateral, integrated into vaults, or supplied to other apps where they continue earning—turning one financial position into a multitasking income engine.</p>\n<h2>Key Factors That Influence Yield Generation</h2>\n<p>Not all yield-bearing stablecoins are created equal. The source and sustainability of the yield, along with other macro and technical indicators, greatly affect how much you can earn and how secure your position really is.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Protocol Risk:</strong>The foundational risk rests within the protocol generating the yield. Is the core revenue derived from lending, validator staking, or liquidity provision? Or is it based on inflationary token emissions that could dry up overnight? Sustainable yield comes from value-generating activity, not financial engineering.</li>\n      <li><strong>Adoption and Total Value Locked (TVL):</strong>A higher TVL often signals trust and usage volume but can also compress yields as more users chase limited returns. Conversely, emerging protocols may offer higher APYs but carry greater implementation or security risk.</li>\n      <li><strong>Smart Contract Optimization:</strong>Yield-bearing stablecoins rely on automation, and the quality of the smart contracts determines performance. Solutions that include real-time rebalancing, adaptive fee routing, and smart reinvestment strategies usually outperform more static alternatives.</li>\n      <li><strong>Asset Backing and Transparency:</strong>Some tokens are fully collateralized with high-grade assets or deploy clear rate models with strong reserves. Others mix loose asset backing with speculative tokenomics—often hiding risks. Thorough due diligence is not optional; smart investors demand clarity, particularly in hectic markets.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>In sum, reliable passive income is about both yield and risk. An attractive APY means little if capital is at risk due to an insecure or mismanaged platform.</p>\n<h2>Risks and Considerations</h2>\n<p>Despite the appeal of passive earnings, <strong>there are risks involved</strong>. Soft rugs, smart contract exploits, protocol governance failures, and depegging events can all significantly impact returns—or wipe them out entirely. Yield-bearing stablecoins may appear stable on the surface but often carry hidden systemic risk.</p>\n<p>For example, some protocols incentivize users with their native tokens—boosting APYs temporarily without a true revenue source. When those juicy rewards disappear, so does your yield. Others rely on overly leveraged strategies that can unwind during black swan events. Additionally, many platforms lack open auditing, limiting users’ ability to verify where yield truly originates.</p>\n<p>This is where <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/contrarian-investor/\">contrarian investing</a> becomes powerful. Smart investors dig past the buzz, analyze fundamentals, and form independent theses. They test and question token mechanics, examine revenue models, and utilize risk-adjusted positions. In the realm of passive DeFi income, healthy skepticism is a strength, not a limitation.</p>\n<h2>The Regulatory Landscape</h2>\n<p>The legal outlook for yield-bearing stablecoins remains murky, particularly in the United States. Regulatory bodies such as the SEC and CFTC are increasingly focused on whether interest-generating crypto assets should be considered securities or banking products. This has led to lawsuits, settlements, and more cautious behavior from larger protocol teams.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/passive-income-stablecoins/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

One bullet said “Hey fascist! Catch!,” then included a code for dropping a bomb in the video game Helldivers 2. Another said “If you Read / This, You Are / GAY / lmao,” and a third contained an emoticon-laced message drawn from furry subculture. (The symbol is not perverse because of its origins; it’s perverse because of how gleefully and literally it was weaponized, not unlike when Nikki Haley wrote “Finish them” on Israeli artillery destined for Gaza.) Spencer Cox, the Republican Governor of Utah, has said that Robinson subscribed to a “Leftist ideology.” According to court documents released on Tuesday, Robinson’s mother told investigators that he had moved to the left politically in the past year, becoming more “pro-gay and trans-rights oriented.” He had also begun to date his roommate, who, in his mother’s description, was male at birth and was transitioning. Text-message exchanges quoted in the documents show Robinson telling his roommate that he had killed Kirk because he’d “had enough of his hatred.” Still, it is unclear how Robinson made the leap from disliking Kirk’s views to deciding to murder him—he wrote, chillingly, that he’d been planning the shooting for only “a bit over a week”—and the messages that Robinson left behind remain a muddle. The phrase “Bella Ciao,” engraved on one bullet, is both the title of a famous antifascist anthem and a phrase that crops up in video games. Some have pointed out that the song also appeared on a Spotify playlist associated with Groypers, a group of far-right, white-nationalist, meme-steeped internet denizens led by <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-young-political-spaces-of-the-internet\">Nick Fuentes</a>, who frequently attacked Kirk for not being extreme enough. In isolation, the references are vague enough to be interpreted every which way.</p>\n<p>According to an interview that Robinson’s grandmother gave to the <i>Daily Mail</i>, he grew up in a conservative family that staunchly supported Trump. He attended just one semester of college before dropping out. He was registered to vote in Utah but was unaffiliated with a party and did not vote in the 2024 Presidential election. Instead, he seems to have spent time in the corners of the internet where young men can become radicalized toward violence. Like <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/the-online-spaces-that-enable-mass-shooters\">Payton Gendron</a>, who committed a mass shooting at a Tops grocery store in Buffalo, New York, in 2022, Robinson left a trail of self-implicating messages on the chat-room app Discord. In one chat, he reportedly played dumb about Kirk’s murder, joking about how the suspect was his “doppelganger.” In another chat, though, he confessed to shooting Kirk, saying, “It was me,” just before going with his family to turn himself in to the police.</p>\n<p>Whatever radicalization Robinson may have undergone online, people in his offline life seem to have failed to fully understand what was happening to him. Only he knew what ideas he was steeping himself in, and the stubborn opacity of his motivations adds to our collective despair in this moment: if, as one TikTok commentator put it, Kirk’s assassination was in some sense a “shitpost”—a nihilistic in-joke translated horribly into real-world action—then an already senseless act becomes an utterly meaningless one. Memes are incoherent by nature; it’s useless to try to make them mean more than they do. That police are now talking about furries in public is Robinson’s gruesome joke, carried out for the benefit of the online audience that he was, on some level, performing for. (In the text exchange quoted in the court documents, he writes, “The fuckin messages are mostly a big meme, if I see ‘notices bulge uwu’ on fox new I might have a stroke.”) Robinson is not alone in this self-referentiality and crackpot mythologizing; the alleged perpetrator of a shooting at a Colorado high school posted TikToks in which he’d copied the poses of previous shooters and showed off a T-shirt that referenced the Columbine mass shooting, according to the Anti-Defamation League. Shootings have effectively become their own memes, with their own viral tropes and signifiers. No matter what political ideas Robinson may have harbored, he might ultimately be best understood as a participant in that warped online culture.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/charlie-kirk-and-tyler-robinson-came-from-the-same-warped-online-worlds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>“I was losing my mind,” the chef and writer Samin Nosrat said. We were sitting in the living room of her small house in Oakland, and she was describing a period in her life, just after the arrival of <i>COVID</i> vaccines, when she was sunk in a depression and floundering in her attempts to write the follow-up to her 2017 cooking guide, “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Salt-Fat-Acid-Heat-Mastering/dp/1476753830/\">Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat</a>.” That book was a phenomenon whose promise to teach readers the four “elements of good cooking”—thus liberating them from the tyranny of recipes—proved irresistible. It earned Nosrat a James Beard Award, spawned a <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/recommends/watch/samin-nosrats-sensual-compassionate-food-travels-in-salt-fat-acid-heat\">Netflix series</a>, and sold 1.4 million copies. In 2019, Nosrat sold a proposal for an ambitious sequel called “What to Cook,” which would help readers decide on a dish based on four constraints: time, resources, preferences, and ingredients. But the concept refused to cohere. After two years, she said, “I was, like, ‘Take the money back.’ ”</p>\n<p>One of her agents suggested that she just write, you know, a cookbook, with recipes. At first, Nosrat resisted. Though “Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat” includes recipes, it also sniffs at them. For beginning cooks, Nosrat writes, “recipes can be necessary and comforting, like training wheels.” She stresses that their ultimate goal should be to remove those training wheels: to “improvise, and judge what good food looks like on your own terms.”</p>\n<p>Nosrat distrusts recipes, but she’s very good at devising them. She might be responsible for more canonical dishes than any other writer in the past decade. The list of her hits reads like the <i>Billboard</i> Top Ten: her buttermilk roast chicken, her garlicky green beans, her <i>tahdig</i>, her focaccia. Just the other day, a friend was trying to figure out how to cook some chicken thighs, and I advised her to try Nosrat’s conveyor-belt chicken. As has been the case every one of the dozens of times I’ve cooked it, it worked perfectly.</p>\n<p>Nosrat tried to follow her agent’s advice, but she felt like a fraud. “There was nothing that made me excited to cook,” she recalled. “I was just trying to figure out, like, <i>What is the point? Who cares</i>?”</p>\n<p>One morning, Nosrat was in the middle of a misbegotten experiment—attempting to prepare meat al pastor in her kitchen, inspired by a documentary about tacos—when a friend texted and asked if she and her kids could stop over. “Sure,” Nosrat told her. “I’m just over here ruining some pork.”</p>\n<p>At this time, Nosrat said, she was searching for a way to handle the fame that “Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat” had brought, and the concomitant feelings of guilt and self-doubt. Perhaps more important, she had tapered off the antidepressants she’d taken for years, in order to try psychedelic therapy—which didn’t work. The six pounds of pork she had ruined seemed like a synecdoche for her whole life, which, apparently, she had also ruined. When her friend arrived and saw her predicament, she suggested that Nosrat bring the pork to <i>her</i> house a few nights later; they’d figure out what to do with it together. Nosrat grasped at the invitation like a lifeline. That get-together evolved, over time, into Monday dinner, a now weekly ritual with a group of ten or so that, Nosrat told me, has become “the heart of everything for me.”</p>\n<p>It’s also at the heart of the book Nosrat has finally produced: “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Good-Things-Recipes-Rituals-Cookbook/dp/1984857789/\">Good Things</a>,” part cookbook, part self-portrait, which does indeed contain recipes, along with advice, confessions, and stories about her dog. It begins with an acknowledgment that Nosrat worries she’s betrayed her readers and herself by assembling “a book of recipes after writing ‘Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat,’ which is a veritable manifesto designed to free cooks from relying on them.” But, as the introduction suggests, “Good Things” represents a dramatic rethinking of what Nosrat wants out of life in general. She’s still not quite sure where that leads. It might take her away from food entirely.</p>\n<p>Nosrat was born in San Diego, the child of Iranian immigrants who’d arrived in the U.S. just a few years prior. When she was eighteen months old, her three-year-old sister, Sammar, died of brain cancer; the tragedy, Nosrat told me, contributed to her spending her own life as “a crazy achievement machine,” in an attempt to please her mother and make up for the absence. She struggled to fit in socially—a consequence, she’s <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/i-fail-almost-every-day-an-interview-with-samin-nosrat\">said</a>, of growing up “as a brown kid in a super-white world”—but excelled academically. She was studying at U.C. Berkeley when, bewitched by a meal at Alice Waters’s restaurant Chez Panisse, she got a job there bussing tables and eventually talked her way into a culinary internship. Or, as Nosrat jokes, “I went from my incredibly demanding, impossible-to-please mother’s house into <i>another</i> incredibly demanding, impossible-to-please mother’s house.” She learned in Waters’s kitchen, then left the nest, serving stints as a sous-chef elsewhere, taking catering gigs, and beginning to teach others. Her first thirty-odd years, she said, trained her to be a perfectionist. “There’s a lot I appreciate in that,” she said. “I also constantly use it as a cudgel to, like, hate myself and be mean to myself.”</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/how-samin-nosrat-learned-to-love-the-recipe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>In Oliver Hermanus’s new film, “The History of Sound,” two young men at the New England Conservatory of Music meet in a bar, when one of them (Josh O’Connor) plays a folk song the other (Paul Mescal) instantly recognizes. The two fall into bed, and then love, almost at once—but World War I soon intervenes, sending one to the front and the other back to the countryside where he was born. Queer love and romance are not new themes for Hermanus, whose other projects include “Mary &amp; George” (in which Julianne Moore plays a countess who uses her son’s beauty to seduce King James I). Not long ago, he joined us to talk about a few novels of same-sex desire that have inspired him. His remarks have been edited and condensed.</p>\n    <h2>Death in Venice</h2>\n    <p>\n      <i>by Thomas Mann</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>When I started thinking about the books I wanted to talk about, I was struck by the fact that there’s the story of each book, but there’s also the story of the authors and their relationships to the books. The ones I chose are all interesting to me because of the intention behind them. These are all by queer writers who hid their sexuality sometimes.</p>\n    <p>I read “Death in Venice” when I was in my twenties, living in Paris—I had the very Parisian experience of sitting in a café reading it—and it loosely inspired my second film, which is about a sexually repressed middle-aged character. I called my film “Beauty” because that is the commodity that is most treasured in the book. I was fuelled by the book, but I was almost upset by it, too, because I interpreted it as a very misguided, varnished book about lust. It’s a case where the author is speaking in a language that he finds agreeable in order to express something inside of him. It’s hidden, but it’s also not hidden. It’s coding desire into beauty, to make that desire acceptable in some way.</p>\n    <h2>Maurice</h2>\n    <p>\n      <i>by E. M. Forster</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>The Merchant Ivory adaptation of “Maurice” was the first queer film I ever watched. I did it sort of illegally—I was too young, it was kind of titillating to watch it in secret—and I read the book only after I saw the movie. I read it again recently because I was fascinated by the fact that it was published without the author’s knowledge—I’d never realized that Forster had died before the book could come out. It fascinates me that the author has no idea that we, the public, have access to this novel.</p>\n    <p>The story first follows two men, Maurice and Clive, who meet at Cambridge and fall in love. Although Maurice is cautious about it, they step into a relationship. But, because they are of marrying age, the threats on their bachelorhood become a pressure between them, and eventually Clive succumbs to those pressures, and the relationship ends. Later, Maurice—who is more upper class—has a relationship with a man who comes from a background very different from his, and who is working on the grounds of Clive’s estate. The book traverses the story of these relationships elegantly. And Forster’s attitude toward Maurice is also very interesting—he describes him as someone who’s handsome but not necessarily the smartest or the most deserving of things. I like that he questions the main character in this way.</p>\n    <h2>The Price of Salt</h2>\n    <p>\n      <i>by Patricia Highsmith</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Highsmith first published this book under a pseudonym, for fear of being associated with it. That is another, rather blunt manifestation of the fear of authorship that each of these books expresses, in a way—Forster didn’t want to publish his novel, and Mann kind of veils the true content of what he’s interested in.</p>\n    <p>In “The Price of Salt,” a housewife falls in love with a shopgirl. The novel really shows the texture of their life. Ultimately, the drama of the book turns on whether the housewife’s love for her child—who could be taken away from her in those days, if during divorce proceedings the court learned that she was gay—is more important than the love she has in her relationship. The characters are beautifully drawn. I always love Highsmith, but one thing that stands out in this case is that these characters are nice. You like them. And that’s not usually the case with her.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/books/book-currents/great-gay-novels-recommended-by-the-director-of-the-history-of-sound\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But the story opens with a warning from the Indigenous owner: do not till the south-west corner of the field. Russel, the new owner, dismisses the caution, and in doing so shrugs off any responsibility for what lies beneath the ground. His disregard literalizes the colonial gesture of erasure: extracting abundance while denying the weight of history and accountability. </i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Written by Nathan Niigan Noodin Adler and appearing first in the anthology, </i>\n      <i>Zegaajimo: Indigenous Horror Fiction,</i>\n      <i> published by </i>\n      <a href=\"https://kegedonce.com/\">Kegedonce Press,</a>\n      <i> this narrative renders horror as something unearthed and tangible. In prose that tips from lush into cannibalistic, Adler shows how settlers’ celebrations of plenty are built on desecrated ground, and that for Indigenous communities horror is not spectral but real, ongoing in collective memory and lived existence.</i>\n    </p>\n<p><i>— Raaza Jamshed </i>for Guernica Global Spotlights</p>\n<p/>\n    <p>“Don’t till the south-west corner of the field.” The old man signs the contract with gnarled fingers bent with age, injuries or arthritis. All three.</p>\n<p>Russel leans in and signs with a flourish, long looping letters underscored with a squiggly dash. Mckenzie leans and signs with somewhat less pizzazz, her letters coiled and neatly contained on the line below Russel and Eamonn’s.</p>\n<p>Yeeees! Russel and Mckenzie kiss.</p>\n<p>“I can’t believe we bought a house!” Mckenzie’s belly brushes a flute glass and knocks it from the counter. Crrraaack. All three flinch as the glass hits the linoleum and shatters on the kitchen floor with a smash. The newlyweds burst out laughing. Mackenzie apologizes; her hips have grown wider with the pregnancy she explains. The corner of her eyes crinkle. Blond wisps escape from the clasp of her ear.</p>\n<p>“They’re yours now.” Mr. Eamonn shrugs, shoulders slumped, spine bowed, white eyebrows like an owl. “The glasses, everything in the cupboards. The lawn mower in the garage. Anything we didn’t take is yours to keep or give away. We’ve cleared away most of the junk and most everything else, but figured you might appreciate a few essentials.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Thump! Cluunk. Thumpp. </i>\n    </p>\n<p>All three look to the brown water-stained white ceiling. Russel scrunches an eye, head tilted as he listens, brown hair slightly disarranged. “Is their someone else upstairs?”</p>\n<p>Eamonn waves a hand downward. “Paah! Damned racoons. Dug a hole in the shingling again I suspect. But my shoulder’s bad.” He rolls a shoulder. “Haven’t been able to make it up to the ruff to repair it. Might want to cut down the pines. Growing too close to the house, makes it easier for them to get on the ruff. Going to damage the eaves-troughing. Again, haven’t been able to do it with my bum shoulder.” His elbow circles, testing the limits of the range of motion. “One of the reasons I have to sell. Just can’t keep up with the maintenance.”</p>\n<p>They tramp up the wooden stairs, the old man leading them up to the second floor. He holds the worn banister and uses it to pull himself up with every step. The paint is peeling and yellow-stained along the stairs. Mckenzie’s nose wrinkles, and her stomach heaves. Tries to force down a gag. She can smell the vague scent of mildew, and something sweeter underneath like rot. “Does it leak along here when there’s rain?”</p>\n<p>“Used-to.” The old man pauses for breath, one foot on the next step, gnarled left hand still gripping the railing with surprising strength. “Some of the soffit had fallen down, but that’s fixed. Hasn’t been a problem since. Shouldn’t give you a problem now. Never got around to painting. Structure is sound is the main thing.”</p>\n<p>“Good bones,” Russel chimes in. Flashes McKenzie a disarming smile. White teeth.</p>\n<p>“The light here is burnt-out.” Eamonn explains on the darkened landing where another set of stairs leads to the bedrooms at a ninety-degree angle. “Grand-niece took my ladder. Says I’ll just get myself killed if she lets me keep it. Nothing electrical, I just can’t reach the socket. Know my way around They reach the top and Eamonn flicks a switch and the hall fills with yellow light, two bare bulbs with no shelters dangle from above. High ceilings. A large window at the far end lets in an orange glow from the dwindling light. Fire.</p>\n<p>The old, blue-painted floorboards creak as they enter the hall, chipped and grooved, the grooves are packed flat, filled with a lifetime of dust, a tread worn down the center from the passing of feet. A sander and stain, or maybe just clear sealant would allow the raw grain of the wood to shine. Russel mentally adds it to the itemized list of tasks on their new to-do list. The doors creak as Eamonn pushes each one open in turn, showing them the three small bedrooms, bathroom, and master with a small ensuite. They’d had a tour already of course, but the old man wants to give them one last run-down of their new home. Pointing out little quirks and things they might like to know.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.guernicamag.com/the-harvest/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Anna Bruno and I met in Iowa City about a decade ago, long after living out our own coming-of-age stories, when we were just beginning the journey of new motherhood. In fact, in our first interview for Guernica, we discussed how her debut novel, <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/341/9781982126964\">Ordinary Hazards</a>, reads like an immersive monologue of a mother and businesswoman who is on her metaphorical deathbed in a bar, reflecting on the moments that led up to the worst day of her life. I loved this slow burn of a novel, and yet I was intrigued when I read an early draft of Anna’s second novel, <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/341/9781643757001\">Fine Young People</a>, which could not be more different. It is narrated by Frankie, a college student looking back on the end of her senior year in a Catholic high school in Pittsburgh, where she and her best friend, Shiv, conducted an investigation into the long-ago mysterious death of a hockey player named Woolf, who ends up being more relevant to their lives than they could have ever imagined.</p>\n<p>This book understands the magical and confounding time of adolescence, while also astutely examining the lives of the adults they interview who are looking back on their own high school days. Not only does it offer insight into grief, motherhood, friendship, hockey, and Catholicism, but it’s also a suspenseful page-turner. I was thrilled to catch up with Anna about how she transitioned to writing such a different second novel, what it means to write literary suspense, and how to delicately tackle subjects like Catholic identity without alienating faith-based readers or secular readers who are either uninterested in religion or skeptical of it.</p>\n<p>— <i>Maria Kuznetsova</i> for Guernica</p>\n<p/>\n    <p><strong>Maria Kuznetsova: </strong>How did you transition from writing more of a character-driven novel to a whodunnit? Were you using the same writer-brain when digging into a suspense novel, or did you have to look at things differently?</p>\n<p><strong>Anna Bruno: </strong>Literary writers want to take on big human questions. Global questions. Existential questions. But novels are not polemics – at least not the ones I’m drawn to. The fiction that I love is written to entertain. A writer I admire, Sarah Elaine Smith, told me once that all stories are mysteries. She read my first book, <i>Ordinary Hazards</i>, as a mystery. In that book, the mystery is the question of why the narrator is spending her night at a seedy bar. I totally agree with her – all books are mysteries! But they’re not all murder mysteries. And murder is entertaining. It sells. I would be lying if I didn’t admit that I endeavored to write a book that does well commercially. Tim Johnston, another literary writer who writes mysteries – most recently, the haunting novel, <i>Distant Sons</i> – told me that he never intended to write genre fiction, but he wanted to raise the stakes for his characters. For the individual character, the stakes don’t get much higher than murder.</p>\n<p><strong>Maria Kuznetsova:</strong> I’ve heard that every story is a love story, and I love thinking of every story as a mystery–because in the end, we are always chasing the “why,” not the “what.” I wonder if writing something that isn’t a mystery is harder, because you have to create the stakes – will this couple stay together, will this family survive in a new land–and sometimes, they just may not seem high enough, but here, you have these built-in stakes. However, when you have built-in stakes like a potential murder investigation, there are also these built-in plot points you may have to hit, like interviews, reading old newspaper articles, having new revelations, and so on, which might make it harder to work in the big ideas. I wonder how you got into the “deep stuff” when you have a certain investigation plot to follow, and you don’t want to slow the story down with, say, an exploration of grief or Frankie’s best friend Shiv’s dad joining the Hare Krishnas or some hypocrisies within the Catholic church. How did you write a page-turner that engages in such big questions?</p>\n<p><strong>Anna Bruno: </strong>Sneaky, right? Readers are turning pages, finding clues, trying to figure out who killed this hot-shot hockey player, and then hopefully they turn the last page and they go to their book clubs and find themselves talking about religion and philosophy and secular gods like money and sports and power and privilege. And ideally they feel joy–the joy of being alive, of being in communion with other people, of remembering what it felt like to be young. It’s the experience I have whenever I read a Tana French novel. Like I’ve gotten so much more than a mystery. In <i>The Witch Elm</i>, the main character unravels because he’s been attacked and he is no longer the strapping buck he once was, because his memory is shot and he’s physically disabled. As I read, I wanted to know everything the character couldn’t remember, and I couldn’t look away from the train wreck of how he deals with the investigation. The book is a mystery, okay, but it’s also a literary exploration of ableist male privilege. A guy who lives in a world rigged in his favor loses his status, and he is utterly destroyed. He has no capacity to deal.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.guernicamag.com/anna-bruno-suspense-secular-gods-and-scandal-in-an-elite-catholic-school/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The first time I read Yambo Ouologuem’s novel, <i>Bound to Violence</i>, I was shocked by the fury and seeming lack of restraint with which he wrote the story. Yet at the same time, his inventive style struck a chord with me, although I could not immediately explain why. I discovered the novel by chance at an antiquarian bookshop in Eindhoven, where I was living after my arrival in the Netherlands as a refugee fleeing the First Gulf War in Kuwait. The novel was tucked among books that had nothing to do with Africa, lined up alphabetically in a row as could be expected in bookstores or libraries. It was at that antiquarian bookshop that I encountered this book written by a man with a name that sounded Nigerian at first. The cover of the English translation was eye-catching: it was black with an image of a carved wooden mask impaled by a spear. The subtitle was noteworthy and revealing: <i>A savage, panoramic novel of Black Africa</i>.</p>\n<p>I had previously thought that I knew the majority of novels by writers from Africa. I had grown up with, among others, Heinemann’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinemann_African_Writers_Series\"> African Writers Series</a>, which began with the publication of the seminal </p>\n<p><i>Things Fall Apart</i>by Chinua Achebe, who became the first editor of the series. I had read Heinemann masterpieces including works by Sembene Ousmane and Ngugi wa Thiong’o, and the only novel by Cheik Hamidou Kane,</p>\n<p><i>Ambiguous Adventure</i>(1961), one of my all-time favorites. But I had never heard of this particular writer. Who was Yambo Ouologuem? Despite the discovery, the intriguing image on the cover, and the provocative subtitle—an emerging author such as myself was always in search of the new and unknown in literature—I approached the book with trepidation. My fear was that—just as in other books about Africa written mostly but not exclusively by Western writers—I’d find in this a story that would only perpetuate stereotypical depictions of Africa. A story that justifies colonialism, the looting of an entire continent, slavery, and other iniquities. And in fact, Ouologuem’s work, with its portrayals of profuse violence and devastating wars, with its profanities, did appear to live up to my frightened expectations—which caused me to stop reading, abruptly, after my first attempt. Still, the novel would not let go of me. There was something about the work that tempted me to overcome my initial resistance, set aside my assumptions, give the book a chance, and immerse myself in the story.</p>\n<p>One day, I adjudged myself ready for this reading experience, open to whatever it would bring. I picked up the novel again and started to read. A unique, almost overwhelming experience. I tumbled through the world of the author, every page and every paragraph presenting me with a deluge of stunning images, each one more astonishing than the last. Violence was juxtaposed with unparalleled beauty; an original image was followed by an even more unusual one. As if the writer were on a mission to compel me and the world to acknowledge his genius, to share in his fury, resentment, love, bewilderment.</p>\n<p>I read about an African empire, Nakem, and its dynasty of ruthless and devious rulers, the Saifs, who employed every means to hold onto power from their rise in the thirteenth century to their fall in the twentieth. I had something unique here in my hands, I thought. Like any writer confronted with a formidable work, first a huge sense of admiration came over me, followed by profound jealousy. But more beautiful than all of this was the wonderful feeling that, thanks to my curiosity about the marvels of literature, I had somehow discovered this work. Ouologuem became <i>my </i>writer. There was that feeling that the author is addressing his words exclusively to you, that he is entrusting you with his secrets, love, anger, and sense of wonder. The Senegalese novelist Mohamed Mbougar Sarr must have had the same feeling when he read Ouologuem for the first time, which then birthed his Goncourt Prize-winning novel <i>The Most Secret Memory of Men.</i> In Sarr’s 2021 novel, a Senegalese writer, Diégane Latyr Faye, goes in search of T.C. Elimane, an elusive compatriot whose book had been celebrated in an earlier time only to be undone by controversy and disgrace, and who subsequently disappeared into a “chosen, radical exile”.</p>\n<p>Speaking of wonder, here is Ouologuem describing the love scene between Tambira and Kassoumi, two of the characters in <i>Bound to Violence</i>. Listen to this song:</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.guernicamag.com/in-search-of-ouologuem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The corner outside the shophouse café is overrun. Two Brits in Chang singlets and Muay Thai shorts are shadowboxing out front, trading insults, stalling traffic. “Wot mates” and “bloody hells.”</p>\n<p>Under the noontime sun, Ken is a throbbing mass of nerves and finding it difficult to chit-chat. Chiang Mai is unreasonably hot for Christmas. Beside him, Jackie chugs a bottle of hotel water. They haven’t been out long, but her bared shoulders are already cooked salmon filets, weeping oil. “I can’t believe you’re able to wear pants,” she repeats herself, offering the bottle, which Ken waves off. In truth, he could use a sip. “I drink and drink and don’t need to go. It’s coming out through my skin.”</p>\n<p>He closes his eyes, attempts a few deep breaths. It’s not just the heat or the line or the bozos that’s bothering him. It’s also Jackie. Her well-intentioned but wide-eyed naivete, made obvious by her technicolor choice of dress—sandals and shorts and tank top. American gorpcore. Earlier, in their Bangkok stopover, she’d unwittingly inconvenienced his friend Jong to drive them from lunch through an hour of stop-and-go traffic to the Grand Palace, where she’d insisted on trying stale chicken skewers from a dozing vendor. Meaning to be polite, she reciprocated the wai—clapped hands and a bow—to 7-11 clerks and restaurant staff, who blinked back in confusion. She mashed the word for “thank you,” saying “swatty” instead of “sawatdee,” and used “krub” instead of “ka.” “Swatty krub!”</p>\n<p>He’d tried to explain what to say, how to act, but she was too overwhelmed to remember. Or she got annoyed. She feared retaliation for canceling last-minute on an overpriced four-handed massage, thereby abruptly departing a dinner party that his Thai friends had hosted in their honor. She directed precaution incorrectly: to the fear of bad ice and dengue fever, rather than to questionable street foods and the overabundant UV.</p>\n<p>Across the street, in front of the basket shop, a redheaded woman in cat-eye sunglasses and a fringed macramé skirt is vlogging. He stares. It <i>is</i> her. Baddie Maddie. She’s rangier than he remembers from her videos. Freckled and sun-chapped, the way surfers and cyclists are. He’d stumbled on to her vlog during the pandemic, when he was nostalgic for Thailand. Her Thai had been abysmal and her itinerary quotidian, but she uploaded new content frequently and they’d been companionably long.</p>\n<p>He tugs at the linen shirt tied around Jackie’s waist to distract her from noticing. “Don’t you want to cover your shoulders?”</p>\n<p>“I put on sunblock already.”</p>\n<p>“It’s not an all-day thing. You’re supposed to reapply every ninety minutes.”</p>\n<p>“Uh huh.” Jackie lowers her sunglasses. “Hey, isn’t that Baddie Maddie? That vlogger you subscribe to?”</p>\n<p>He looks over. “I don’t know.”</p>\n<p>“I guess there’s only one way to find out.”</p>\n<p>He pulls her back by the shirt. “She’s working.” And she is—gesticulating, speaking enthusiastically into the selfie stick, though what she is actually saying is impossible to parse out over the noise of traffic. “Wouldn’t it be rude to interrupt?”</p>\n<p>The line creeps forward, and they’re finally within the threshold of the café proper, which is completely open on two sides, and without air conditioning. Behind the counter, next to the black and white portrait of two unsmiling elders, a pink neon sign reads, ICED COFFEE KILLS BARISTA.</p>\n<p>The barista with the thick glasses and knitted beanie looks familiar, but Ken can’t remember his name. The barista grimaces as he takes orders, changes bills. Five years earlier he’d come with his friend Bank, a drummer from Goomung, and Win, the actor. That time, there had been a slight chill in the air. There’d been no other cafes or bars on the street, no thronging masses of farangs either. The barista had been obsequious, had given them hot water in fine bone China while they waited. Ken was a nobody, but the guy had insisted he also join in for a selfie.</p>\n<p>Blending in, being mistaken as someone important through association, he never tired of that. He liked the questions and compliments that came when he spoke Thai: <i>Where are you from? Are you Thai? You speak so well.</i> To which he answered with rehearsed familiarity, <i>American but my parents immigrated from Korea. And no, I’m not so good, I’ve forgotten a lot of words.</i></p>\n<p>The barista’s expression softens as the two women ahead of them start speaking Thai. He’s all smiles when they ask for hot coffees, and invites them to sit upstairs. When their drinks are ready, he unhooks the red velvet rope at the bottom of the stairs to let them through.</p>\n<p>The stony expression reappears on the barista’s face as he returns to the counter. Jackie orders an iced latte with oat milk.</p>\n<p>“Only have cow and soy,” he barks.</p>\n<p>“I’ll have regular milk,” she says.</p>\n<p>“And you?” the barista asks.</p>\n<p>Ken responds in Thai—asking for a hot Americano.</p>\n<p>“Hot or iced?”</p>\n<p>“Hot,” he replies, this time in English, his face flushing. Had he mispronounced <i>rohn</i> to the point of incomprehension, or had the barista pretended not to hear him?</p>\n<p>They are not invited upstairs. Of course not. He’d been stupid to think that ordering hot coffee could be like a secret handshake.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.guernicamag.com/tourists/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Excerpted from the novel <i>Mona’s Eyes</i></p>\n<p/>\n    <p>Camille had decided: this time would be the one, she’d finally ask, at their check-up appointment with Dr. Van Orst, whether, yes or no, Mona risked temporarily going blind again, or worse, losing her sight permanently. For a month and a half, this question hadn’t been off her mind for more than an hour. She couldn’t focus on a task without this fear resurfacing after a few minutes. It was exhausting, especially since she’d promised herself not to look up anything on the internet, and the willpower needed to resist this temptation had ended up draining her. Camille thought that at least a doctor’s opinion would help her to channel this nagging obsession a little. She was walking fast, with her daughter by her side, through the corridors of the Châtelet metro station, endlessly repeating to herself a double question: “Does Mona risk losing her sight one day? What’s the likelihood?”</p>\n<p>And then, in one of the station’s endless gray corridors, when Camille was speeding up again, Mona tried to warn her mother. Lost in her thoughts, impervious to the crowd and the surrounding din, feverish and determined, Camille suddenly felt her foot catching on an obstacle. She was sent flying. It was the leg of a homeless man lying on the floor, and Camille, her nerves shot, barked:</p>\n<p>“Watch what you’re doing, for god’s sake!”</p>\n<p>The man, perplexed, wasn’t sure how to react. He merely responded with embarrassing politeness:</p>\n<p>“I’m blind, <i>madame</i>.”</p>\n<p>Only then, Camille saw the word “blind” written in capitals, among a few other statements scribbled on a scrap of cardboard, appealing for generosity; she saw the dark glasses that had been knocked to the floor; she saw Mona’s blue trousers right beside them. She’d just crashed into a blind homeless man in a metro corridor at the very moment she was taking her daughter to hospital, fearing for her eyes. A cold shiver coursed through her. Without a word, almost panicked, she got up and rushed to the exit with Mona. After pretending to check her phone, she made up a work crisis and told her daughter:</p>\n<p>“We won’t visit the doctor today, darling. I need to go back home.”</p>\n<p>A Persian tale, from medieval times, recounts how, one morning in a Baghdad market, a vizier was horrified to encounter Death, emaciated and somberly clad, because it gestured towards him, in what seemed like an invitation, despite his being young and healthy. The vizier went to see his caliph and announced to him his immediate departure for the city of Samarkand, in order to escape from this sinister invitation. The caliph agreed to this, and away his man galloped. Nevertheless, the concerned caliph summoned Death and asked it why it had threatened a vigorous vizier, in his prime, in a Baghdad market. Death retorted: “I wasn’t threatening him, I merely made a gesture of surprise! I’d met him early in the morning, in the middle of a Baghdad market, and I was surprised because we were due to meet that very evening, in Samarkand . . . ”</p>\n<p>Camille thought again of this legend, which had always terrified her. She had the feeling of wanting, in vain, to escape from fate, or more specifically, to clumsily shield her daughter from it; because canceling that appointment with the doctor to avoid a diagnosis was absurd and protected no one from misfortune. Yet she still called Dr. Van Orst’s office and, assuming a formal tone, moved the appointment to a later date, much later. When she hung up, she saw Mona looking somber.</p>\n<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>\n<p>“I’m fine.”</p>\n<p>“I know you inside out, Mona. Something’s bothering you. We’ll go see the doctor. You’ll see, it’ll all work out.”</p>\n<p>“Mommy . . . It’s just the way you spoke to the poor man in the metro . . . ”</p>\n<p>Mona was right. Ashamed, Camille went back to apologize and ask if the poor man was alright. He’d disappeared.</p>\n<p>We teach children that it is wrong to lie. And Mona knew she was lying to her parents by pretending to visit the child psychiatrist every week when she was actually strolling around the museum with Dadé. She opened up to him about this, and spoke of Pinocchio. Was she herself changing a bit, every Wednesday when she deceived her mother, her father? Does it show on someone when they’re being misleading? Henry rubbed her nose: right here, at any rate, nothing’s budged, he reassured her. And he laughed heartily. But he didn’t want to compromise himself, either, by simply justifying the hoax, however irreproachable its aim. The issue was too serious, morally, to be dealt with hastily. How could you explain the betwixt and between, the interlacing of the true and the false to a child raised to be honest? How dilute the binary concepts of good and evil without upsetting her, disorientating her, or disappointing her? It was an impossible task, and Henry knew full well that only life experience could provide such moderations; trying to explain those hierarchies to Mona would be counterproductive. And, while pondering all this as they approached the Louvre, he decided that it was a good time to go up to the second floor of the Denon wing. The ideal moment to introduce the notion of chiaroscuro . . .</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.guernicamag.com/rembrandt-know-yourself/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

For “In Light of Innocence,” <a href=\"https://pioneerworks.org/\">Pioneer Works</a>’ Main Hall transforms into a vibrant sanctuary complete with 50 stained glass-like panels that reach up toward the heavens. The individual pieces are fitted into the space’s windows, with a larger lightbox mural radiating from below.</p>\n    <p>De Nieves is known for utilizing common materials, including wood, glue, tape, and, for this project, brilliantly colored acetate that allows light to filter into the open hall. Along with swapping plastic for glass, the artist also upends the typical cathedral environment with non-religious imagery and typographic panels. Included are a skeleton riding a horse—long a symbol of transformation in tarot—and bold phrases like “happiness runs in circular motion” and “words are like weapons they wound sometimes.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nieves-16.jpeg\" alt=\"an installation by Raul de Nieves of a colorful window fitted pieces with typography and spiritual imagery\"/>\n    <p>This medley of spiritual references creates a welcoming environment that allows for reflection and connection across belief systems. A statement says, “‘In Light of Innocence’ invites viewers to embrace change not as loss, but as renewal—a passage that leads to deeper insight and inner strength.”</p>\n    <p>The immersive project marks de Nieves’ first institutional exhibition in New York City and is on view through December 14.

Situated in a volcanic crater, its Latin name is synonymous with hell or the underworld, and to the ancient Romans, it was considered the portal to Hades. Dante Alighieri echoed the belief in his seminal <i>Inferno.</i> More recently, <a href=\"https://anishkapoor.com/\">Anish Kapoor</a> set out to explore the notion in a striking new entrance to the Monte Sant’Angelo subway station in central Naples. “In the city of Mount Vesuvius and Dante’s mythical entrance to the <i>Inferno</i>, I found it important to try and deal with what it really means to go underground,” the artist says.</p>\n    <p>Kapoor is renowned for <a href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/tags/anish-kapoor\">large-scale sculptures</a> and installations that tap into visceral psychological experiences, from a perpetually swirling whirlpool of black water in “Descension” to a meat-like slab of wax being wedged through a doorway in “Svayambhu,” which references a Sanskrit word meaning “self-born.” And, of course, there’s the iconically mirrored “Cloud Gate,” known fondly as “The Bean,” in downtown Chicago.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kapoor-4.jpg\" alt=\"the entrance to a contemporary train station in Naples designed by Anish Kapoor\"/>\n    <p>“At Monte Sant’Angelo station, three integral themes of Kapoor’s practice have coalesced in more potent form than ever: the mythological object, the body, and the void,” a statement says. The artist’s design for two separate entrances, initiated more than two decades ago, tap into his interest in dualistic relationships like internal and external experiences or lightness and darkness.</p>\n    <p>Kapoor’s two entrances exist in dialogue with one another, as one is made from weathered steel with a rusty patina that suggests an amorphous bodily form. The other is conceived as something of the inverse, where a tubular steel form is presented more smoothly and “cleanly” while likewise hovering over travelers like a mysterious system or gigantic conduit.</p>\n    <p>“The station is a remarkable symbiosis of sculpture and architecture, a dynamic that has always been a central force in Kapoor’s work,” a statement says. “Kapoor’s work both holds and creates the new space in which it is experienced.”</p>\n    <p>Explore dozens of works on Kapoor’s <a href=\"https://anishkapoor.com/\">website</a>, and discover even more artistic <a href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/tags/train-stations\">subway stations</a> around the world.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kapoor-5.jpg\" alt=\"escalators leading up from a contemporary train station in Naples designed by Anish Kapoor\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kapoor-2.jpg\" alt=\"a side view of the entrance to a contemporary train station in Naples designed by Anish Kapoor\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kapoor-3.jpg\" alt=\"the entrance to a contemporary train station in Naples designed by Anish Kapoor\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kapoor-6.jpg\" alt=\"escalators leading up from a contemporary train station in Naples designed by Anish Kapoor\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2025/09/anish-kapoor-mont-sant-angelo-naples-subway-station/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

With over 4,700 entries from 85 countries, this year's winners reveal how artists are shaping how we see, think and connect.</p>\n<p>Guess Who Studio - Cinema Escape</p>\n<p>The Association of Illustrators (AOI), in partnership with the Directory of Illustration, has announced the winners of the World Illustration Awards 2025. The global showcase, now in its 50th year, continues to spotlight outstanding talent from every corner of the industry.</p>\n<p>Selected from more than 4,700 entries across 85 countries, the 20 Category Winners, four Cross-Category winners and two Overall Winners were revealed during an online ceremony on 16 September. Projects ranged from editorial commissions to site-specific installations, underlining the award's role as one of the most wide-ranging celebrations of illustration in the world.</p>\n<p>Rachel Hill, CEO of AOI, said: \"This year's entries highlight the power of illustration to help us explore and understand the world around us. Artists tackled themes like human connection, the celebration of diversity and inclusion, and the growing impact of AI on our daily lives.\"</p>\n<p>The Professional Overall Winner was awarded to Chu-Chieh Lee for Minus Plus Multiply, a short film that explores the delicate balances shaping human experience. Drawing on her own perspective as an Asian woman living in the UK, Chu-Chieh employed a blend of 2D animation, stop-motion, 3D printing, pottery, and ceramics to bring the narrative to life. The work has already been screened at more than 50 film festivals worldwide, reflecting its universal resonance.</p>\n<p>\"The film tends to capture the difficulty and struggle of a female immigrant building a new life in the UK, away from her safe space where her family, lover and friends are,\" Chu-Chieh explained.</p>\n<p>Her background spans Taiwan and London, where she studied Narrative Animation at the Royal College of Art. Since relocating in 2018, she has worked with clients including Google, Nestlé, Pfizer and the BBC. Minus Plus Multiply is actually an uncommissioned personal project, proving that deeply personal stories often cut through most powerfully.</p>\n<p>Chu-Chieh Lee - Minus Plus Multiply</p>\n<p>The New Talent Overall Winner was Léane Ruggli, a Swiss illustrator graduating this year from Arts University Bournemouth. Her project, Ready to Drink Cocktail Cans, is a playful and colourful exploration of cocktail history and culture, designed to animate packaging for social media. Each can design nods to the drink's origins, from the Mojito's roots in Havana to the Espresso Martini's London nightclub beginnings.</p>\n<p>\"This personal project was created to further my style and add motion to my practice,\" Léane said. \"I wanted to portray the history, essence and flavours of specific cocktails.\"</p>\n<p>Vibrant, experimental and accessible, the work captures the sense of illustration as a medium that can elevate even the most everyday objects into something memorable.</p>\n<p>Léane Ruggli - RTD Cocktail Cans</p>\n<p>In New Talent, Cheuk Lam Siu won for The Sound of Cinema, celebrating the London Philharmonic Orchestra's season of music inspired by film soundtracks. Her pencil line work, coloured digitally, conveys the atmosphere of animal documentaries through richly layered imagery.</p>\n<p>The Professional category winner was Raafaye Ali Sheikh with Gaza Cola – The Taste of Freedom, a powerful campaign for Palestine House. Raafaye created posters and packaging that highlight Palestinian culture and resilience, drawing attention to injustice while celebrating heritage. \"I wanted to honour the culture of Palestine as we see so much of their land erased,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Cheuk Lam Siu - The Sound of Cinema</p>\n<p>Raafaye Ali Sheikh - Gaza Cola</p>\n<p>Animation proved to be one of the most emotionally charged categories this year, showcasing the medium's ability to transition seamlessly between intimacy and scale.</p>\n<p>The New Talent award went to Ti Zu for Snow Bird, a tender short about the comfort of cuddling a bird. Rendered with Procreate Dreams, its gentle pacing and delicate colour palette evoke a quiet sense of warmth and safety, showing that even the simplest narratives can carry deep emotional weight.</p>\n<p>In Professional, *Chu-Chieh Lee's Minus Plus Multiply not only won the category but also the Overall prize.</p>\n<p>Ti Zu - Snow Bird</p>\n<p>Book cover design is often where illustration meets mass culture most directly, and this year's winners showed how fresh imagery can reframe familiar stories.</p>\n<p>In New Talent, Jae Kwak won for Puddle Jumpers, a project born from improvised tales told with his children while exploring Wimbledon Common. The cover brims with energy and curiosity, capturing the childlike sense of discovery that inspired the narrative. Hand-drawn textures and lively compositions give it an immediacy that feels personal, yet universally inviting.</p>\n<p>The Professional award went to Jennifer Dionisio for her striking take on Patricia Highsmith's The Talented Mr Ripley. Commissioned by Vintage Classics, the cover strips back the complexity of the novel to a bold interplay of cut-outs and silhouettes. The stark contrasts echo Ripley's dual nature, while the minimal palette makes the design feel timeless.</p>\n<p>Together, Jae's playful storytelling and Jennifer's sharp minimalism demonstrate the versatility of illustration in the publishing world.</p>\n<p>Jae Kwak - Puddle Jumpers</p>\n<p>Jennifer Dionisio - The Talented Mr Ripley</p>\n<p>Taiwanese illustrator Ping-An Shih won the New Talent award with 'Tai Chi', a 32-page picture book that reimagines the martial art as a metaphor for balance and joy in daily life.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.creativeboom.com/news/world-illustration-awards-2025-winners-unveiled/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>With its third issue on textiles about to launch, independent magazine Fanfaretti continues to champion craftsmanship, aesthetics and a slower, more tactile way of experiencing creativity. Founder and designer Angela Blumen tells us how it all began, why print still matters, and what's next for the project.</p>\n<p>Fanfaretti might be small, but it's already making its way onto the shelves of some of Europe's most respected magazine stores. Stocked at MagCulture in London, PaperCut in Stockholm, Athenaeum in Amsterdam and Yves Lambert in Paris, the Amsterdam-based title has carved out a place for itself among the new wave of independent publishers. Now, as it prepares to release its third issue, the focus is firmly on textiles and the many ways they shape our everyday lives.</p>\n<p>The magazine is the brainchild of designer and art director Angela Blumen, who runs a namesake studio in Amsterdam. Publishing has been part of her practice from the beginning.</p>\n<p>\"I have been making publications and magazines since I started doing design – that is actually how I got into design in the first place,\" Angela says. Early projects included Sucre Paper, a newspaper-style publication, as well as magazines such as Sea Together and Ambivalence.</p>\n<p>Fanfaretti emerged in 2023 as a self-initiated space for more editorial, less client-led work. Not long after, Angela was joined by Laura Josephine O'Brien, a Stockholm-based editor. Together, the pair run the magazine remotely, meeting in person every few months for interviews and launches.</p>\n<p>Fanfaretti is about aesthetics, beauty and craft, with each issue exploring a single theme, from \"Localism\" in the debut edition to \"Details\" in the second, which featured Paris-based creatives. The new issue centres on textiles, specifically their lifecycles.</p>\n<p>\"It's hard not to talk about textiles when you talk about craftsmanship. Textiles surround us everywhere and every day,\" Angela explains. What started as a modest summer edition quickly expanded into a full issue, featuring interviews with fashion designers, artists, and upcycling studios, as well as fashion editorials.</p>\n<p>Angela believes the idea of \"timelessness\" is key to both editorial and design decisions. \"Timeless to me, in terms of aesthetics, means that when any viewer sees the object/image/text, they can relate to it. It is the opposite of trend-based,\" she says. Old issues of Acne Paper and early Monocle remain benchmarks.</p>\n<p>This longevity also influences the subjects chosen, such as pottery, jewellery, fashion, and other crafts that retain relevance across generations.</p>\n<p>Design-wise, Fanfaretti is deliberately simple, defined by clean layouts, minimal styling, and the occasional stamp to create a sense of restraint. The magazine is tactile and collectable, intended to feel as relevant in twenty years as it does today.</p>\n<p>Unlike many titles, Fanfaretti is entirely self-funded and carries no advertising. It's a choice that brings both freedoms and challenges. \"Fanfaretti is primarily a creative outlet for me and Laura, and we went into this knowing that it is rare that a magazine can fully fund itself, but then we also get to do whatever we want!\" Angela says.</p>\n<p>One breakthrough came when she discovered a local printer in the Netherlands that offered high-quality printing at an affordable price. \"That made producing a magazine very easy,\" she adds. Distribution, meanwhile, has been a mix of friends hand-delivering copies and new partnerships with small distributors, such as JessePresse, in the Benelux region.</p>\n<p>Growing the magazine slowly and without a large marketing machine requires patience. Social media, Angela admits, remains a sticking point: \"Without constantly posting content, it is difficult to get the word out there, even though we are stocked in some great places around Europe.\"</p>\n<p>Despite its modest scale, Fanfaretti has found a receptive audience. Independent shops across Europe have agreed to stock it, and Angela enjoys seeing photos of the magazine popping up in unexpected places. While most distribution is currently focused on Europe, due to import taxes that make international expansion challenging, the plan is to continue building connections organically.</p>\n<p>The relationship between Angela's design studio and the magazine is fluid, with each feeding into the other. Fanfaretti serves as a kind of business card or portfolio, often attracting new client work. This year, it has already led to Angela being commissioned for more editorial and print projects, including a forthcoming cookbook with a Dutch publisher.</p>\n<p>In a digital-first world, producing a print-only magazine might seem risky, but Angela believes the format has renewed value. \"Print seems to be more in demand because it is seen as craftsmanship: producing a beautiful book or magazine takes time, money, and dedication,\" she says.</p>\n<p>Independent publishing, like independent shops and freelance work, contributes to cultural diversity. \"A diversity of opinions, styles and production modes is just as important for a well-functioning society!\" she adds.</p>\n<p>Fanfaretti's emphasis on positivity and craft is also personal. \"For both Laura and me, it is important to have a positive outlook on the future,\" says Angela. \"We feature stories that hopefully inspire people to go offline, start a new project, look at the world with more curiosity or just have a moment with print.\"</p>\n<p>Issue 3 will be launched later this year, with a celebratory event at a friend's studio in Copenhagen. Plans for Issue 4 are already in motion, and the theme – cake – promises to be the biggest yet, both in terms of contributors and scale.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.creativeboom.com/inspiration/inside-the-amsterdam-print-magazine-celebrating-timeless-creativity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

No two are exactly alike, and each was carved with a machete and finished with a knife, embracing individuality and imperfection as core design features.</p>\n    <p>Grey Brazil explains how the process was about aligning with the values of the programme itself. \"The idea is rooted in craft, which is central to D&amp;AD's mission to celebrate and elevate creative excellence. It also stands for individuality. No two hand-sharpened pencils ever look the same,\" the team explained. The result, they added, is a reminder that \"the simplest ideas can also be the most effective.\"</p>\n    <p>Since its launch in 2016, D&amp;AD Shift has evolved into a global programme that provides training, mentorship, and live briefs for creatives without formal education in advertising or design. The goal is to open up access to the industry for individuals whose skills have been developed outside traditional pathways.</p>\n    <p>The design of the new Pencil reflects this journey, as it embodies \"resourcefulness and curiosity\" – two qualities that perfectly define self-taught creatives. \"That journey is rarely polished, but it is inventive and determined. The Pencil embodies that spirit, sharpened by effort into something truly original,\" they added.</p>\n    <p>This ethos challenges an industry that often defaults to hiring talent with conventional qualifications while simultaneously demanding innovation. D&amp;AD says: \"Some of the most powerful creativity comes from unexpected places, from lived experience, from people sharpening their skills on whatever surface they can find.\"</p>\n    <p>The new award made its debut at the graduation of Shift São Paulo, where Uber, Natura and Surf (a Unilever brand) became the first recipients. Their role went far beyond financial backing, as each brand provided a real brief to the 19-strong cohort of students, who worked on live projects throughout the programme.</p>\n    <p>Direct encouragement is crucial to the programme, according to D&amp;AD. \"It is the best way for brands to see what happens when people who do not know the 'rules' of the industry are asked to solve a problem,\" they explained. \"Without those limitations, Shifters often push past them in the most creative way possible. That is when brands find themselves saying, 'How have we not thought of that before?'\"</p>\n    <p>By the end of the programme, sponsors walked away with fresh ideas and perspectives that might otherwise have been overlooked. D&amp;AD is keen to stress that this is not corporate charity but \"a strategic advantage\", as it offers a chance to connect with voices and audiences that are often the hardest for established companies to reach.</p>\n    <p>Sponsored awards can sometimes feel tokenistic, but The Pencil for Sponsors is a deliberate attempt to reframe sponsorship as active participation in shaping the industry's future. D&amp;AD explains: \"When the industry overlooks emerging creatives, it misses out on the very ideas and perspectives audiences are craving.</p>\n    <p>\"This hand-sharpened Pencil is a way to recognise the brands that are willing to take risks and back often overlooked points of view, while also crediting them as ones helping push our industry forward.\"</p>\n    <p>Kwame Taylor-Hayford, global president of D&amp;AD, attended the São Paulo event to present the awards and underline the importance of the Shift programme as it expands internationally. By awarding Pencils to sponsors, D&amp;AD aims to reinforce the notion that meaningful change necessitates collaboration between brands and talent.</p>\n    <p>As the programme continues in cities across the world, more brands will have the opportunity to receive the Pencil. In doing so, they're recognised not just for writing a cheque but for opening doors, commissioning work, and giving self-taught creatives the chance to prove themselves.</p>\n    <p>Get the best of Creative Boom delivered to your inbox weekly</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.creativeboom.com/news/dad-introduces-new-pencil-for-sponsors-of-its-shift-programme/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The new 'Iconic Home' campaign strips back the noise to a single, clever visual, reminding us that the smartest campaign ideas are often the simplest.</p>\n    <p>Dunkin' is no stranger to cultural status. Its pink-and-orange branding is instantly recognisable on high streets across America and beyond; however, the brand hasn't always enjoyed the same prominence when it comes to at-home coffee.</p>\n    <p>Now, a new campaign developed by PSOne for The J.M. Smucker Co., led creatively by BBH USA, sets out to change that with radical simplicity. The concept behind Iconic Home is so straightforward that it's almost surprising nobody thought of it sooner.</p>\n    <p>A clean pack-shot of Dunkin' coffee is cropped at just the right angle to resemble a house. Set against bold gradient skies, the visuals capture not only the idea of bringing Dunkin' into the home, but also the warm, familiar feeling that comes with it. Seven product variants each feature their own gradient, reflecting the time of day or season best suited to that flavour.</p>\n    <p>The work will roll out across static and digital out-of-home channels, including Times Square billboards and wild postings, as well as digital and social media. In a market saturated with increasingly elaborate campaigns, this one takes the opposite approach, and we're all here for it.</p>\n    <p>For Josh Williams, director of brand experience coffee at The J.M. Smucker Co., the challenge was clear. He says: \"Dunkin' at home is loved for its unpretentious vibe and coffee that fuels millions every day, but it's not always the first at-home brand that comes to mind.</p>\n    <p>\"Our challenge was to continue to remind people they can enjoy that same unmistakable Dunkin' taste at home. This campaign rises to that challenge by using timeless, beautifully crafted design to spark that 'I can have this at home' realisation. It's a simple, elegant solution to a key business objective.\"</p>\n    <p>The elegance of the solution is what makes it so effective, as it strips away clutter, allowing the product itself to do the talking. It doesn't rely on dense copy, complex metaphors, or cinematic storytelling. Instead, it boils the message down to one striking, memorable image.</p>\n    <p>Sapna Ahluwalia, group creative director at BBH USA, says: \"The power of this idea lies in its simplicity… a graphic pack-shot that conveys the whole message. It is literally just a bag of Dunkin', cropped at the perfect angle to resemble a house.</p>\n    <p>\"Stripped of clutter, the aesthetic conveys warmth, comfort, and the inviting feeling of home, standing out in a world that's become visually too much.\"</p>\n    <p>So many brands often go down the route of spectacle in order to compete for attention, yet simplicity is often more effective in building strong mental recall. A viewer doesn't need to interpret layers of meaning or follow a storyline. They see a Dunkin' pack, shaped like a house, and immediately get that the coffee that fuels your commute is the same one you can enjoy at home.</p>\n    <p>There's a discipline to creating work this pared back because it requires confidence in the brand's core assets and a willingness to resist over-explaining. For Dunkin, it also leans into the straightforward, democratic character that has always defined the brand.</p>\n    <p>Of course, there is a place for complex and cinematic campaigns, but sometimes the smartest move is the simplest idea, executed with confidence.</p>\n    <p>There's a broader lesson here for creative industries. As advertising evolves to meet fragmented audiences across multiple platforms, the instinct is often to over-engineer campaigns, layering ideas to try to cut through the noise. Sometimes, as Iconic Home shows, cutting through means removing rather than adding.</p>\n    <p>It's also worth noting that simplicity in idea doesn't equate to simplicity in impact. This is a campaign designed for scale, from the intimacy of a social feed to the spectacle of Times Square. The consistent design system allows it to stretch effortlessly while staying true to its central concept.</p>\n    <p>Get the best of Creative Boom delivered to your inbox weekly</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.creativeboom.com/news/dunkin-at-home-and-bbh-usa-prove-why-simple-campaign-design-still-wins/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The London studio has rebranded Empower as Tilt, a financial technology company reshaping access to credit for millions of working Americans.</p>\n    <p>Ragged Edge has unveiled its latest project with US fintech Tilt, creating a new name and identity for the company as it seeks to redefine access to credit for millions of working Americans. Formerly known as Empower, Tilt is challenging an industry that leaves more than 100 million people locked out of fair credit, using 250-plus non-traditional signals of financial health to expand opportunity beyond the wealthy few.</p>\n    <p>The rebrand arrives at a pivotal moment, as Tilt has expanded its suite of products and made key acquisitions, prompting the need for a stronger identity that signals a long-term partnership rather than short-term relief.</p>\n    <p>\"Traditional lending sees people through the lens of risk. We look for potential,\" says Stephanie Lin, Tilt's CMO. \"The new Tilt brand reflects the intelligence of our underwriting and our conviction that millions more people deserve a fair shot at credit and cash. We're building a new credit system that sees people fully and helps them rise.\"</p>\n    <p>Changing the name from Empower to Tilt was in aid of reframing the company's role in the market, tilting the odds back in favour of everyday working people. The new logo, with its signature-style typography, underlines this intent as a direct commitment to the communities Tilt serves.</p>\n    <p>That attitude extends across the brand world. A stark black-and-white palette signals clarity and straightforwardness, with flashes of chartreuse injecting energy and optimism. The type system is equally confident, with a customised headline script literally tilted to convey urgency and movement.</p>\n    <p>For Ragged Edge, the challenge was to balance financial authority with human grit. Collaborating with illustrator Pearl Chuaynarong, the team developed painterly textures and brush-stroke details that embrace imperfection. This visual language sets Tilt apart in a sector that too often feels cold, transactional, and overly \"friendly\" in its tone.</p>\n    <p>Jessica Bong-Woon, associate creative director at Ragged Edge, explains: \"We wanted Tilt to welcome newcomers while still resonating with those who've felt let down by the system. \"That tension between grit and warmth became central to the brand.\"</p>\n    <p>The verbal identity pushes just as hard. Rejecting the casual friendliness that dominates fintech marketing, Ragged Edge gave Tilt a voice that is \"urgent and unwavering,\" says copy director Fia Townshend. \"So many brands try to act like your friend. But Tilt customers don't need another friend. They need help kicking down doors. So the Tilt voice has an urgent and unwavering belief that emboldens people to keep pushing.\"</p>\n    <p>Executive Creative Director Matt Smith explains more about how the brand refuses to sit quietly within the category, saying, \"This wasn't about creating another friendly fintech. Tilt needed a brand with teeth that could challenge outdated systems and credit people for their potential. That clarity of purpose is what makes this rebrand transformative.\"</p>\n    <p>It seems the strategy is already paying off. Meta campaigns tied to the new identity have delivered a 70% higher click-through rate, with customer acquisition continuing seamlessly during the transition. Internally, the rebrand has also helped align Tilt's growing team under a shared mission.</p>\n    <p>While the new name is short and simple, the ambition behind it is anything but. Tilt wants to reset how credit works in America by evaluating people through more than 250 non-traditional signals of financial health.</p>\n    <p>By moving beyond limited credit scores, the company hopes to support those who are often overlooked, like people with limited history, recovering records, or finances still in the making.</p>\n    <p>Ragged Edge ultimately sought to design a brand that could serve as a lever for systemic change, providing the company with a platform to challenge an outdated system.</p>\n    <p>Get the best of Creative Boom delivered to your inbox weekly</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.creativeboom.com/news/ragged-edge-tilts-the-odds-with-a-new-identity-for-us-fintech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>And other tips from history to avoid banquets going bad, in advance of King Charles III's state dinner with President Trump this week</p>\n<p>There won’t be any cannibalism happening at the state banquet this week in Windsor Castle, in honour of the 47<sup>th</sup> US president, Donald J Trump. I haven’t seen the menu, but I think that’s a reasonable guess. I also suspect that Prince Harry won’t be in attendance, despite his recent trip to the UK and reconciliatory tête-à-tête with his father, King Charles III. However, if you believe <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/royal-family/article/prince-harry-king-charles-royals-never-forget-fc02v7t8f\">this piece in </a><i> The Times</i>, while the king and his youngest son might be mending their relationship, Prince William cannot forgive his brother Harry for his apparent betrayal of trust in recent years.</p>\n<p>That’s where the cannibalism comes in. Back in the 11<sup>th</sup> century, two brothers – one of them destined for the throne of England – had a pretty big falling out. It led to an event at a feast that most people would find very hard to forgive. I’m talking about Harold and Tostig Godwinson. Harold, of course, went on to become Harold II of England, after the death of Edward the Confessor in 1066. He had to defend his crown against Tostig, who had joined the Norwegian king Harald Hardrada in an attack on the country from the north. Harold beat Hardrada and Tostig at the battle of Stamford Bridge, and both of the would-be invaders were killed.</p>\n<p>The root of the brotherly tiff went back a few years before that. In 1063, according to the 12th-century historian Henry of Huntingdon (who is unique in offering us this account, so we ought to be sceptical about its veracity), at the royal hall in Windsor, Tostig grabbed Harold’s hair while he was pouring wine for King Edward. Tostig, apparently, was so embittered that the king thought more highly of Harold that he was unable to “check his hand from his brother’s flowing locks”.</p>\n<h3>Nobody would drink to this</h3>\n<p>Hair-yanking in front of the king is one thing. But it gets worse; a lot worse. Henry of Huntingdon goes on to explain that Tostig flounced out of Windsor in umbrage and went to Hereford, where Harold’s servants were in the process of knocking up another royal banquet. It’s quite a long way from Windsor to Hereford, but in the course of what must have been a few days’ travel, Tostig’s anger had not abated. When he got to Hereford, he dismembered all his brother’s servants, and put their severed heads, legs and arms into all the drink containers. Then he sent a message back to the king saying that there was lots of salted meat waiting for him at Harold’s place. Unsurprisingly, King Edward wasn’t delighted about this act of anticipated anthropophagy, and exiled Tostig.</p>\n<p>According to Professor Heather Blurton, who has written a book about cannibalism in medieval literature, the whole thing is a symbolic fiction that draws on Greek mythology: “Tostig’s transformation of a royal banquet into a cannibal banquet is densely symbolic. The suggestion of a Thyestian feast rewrites history, casting an unnamed Edward the Confessor as the putative father of two feuding sons whose struggle for power is ultimately futile. In myth, Atreus kills Thyestes’s sons and serves them to him, leaving only their hands and feet, with which he taunts Thyestes. The invocation here of the myth of the House of Atreus, with its cursed history of murder and cannibalism, condemns Harold and Tostig as unworthy heirs to the kingdom. Simultaneously, its narrative intrusion into the prelude to the Norman Conquest of 1066 centres cannibalism as a privileged metaphoric mode for representing invasion and conquest in high medieval England.”</p>\n<p>Yikes. So, basically it probably didn’t happen. Nevertheless that is pretty much the worst example of a royal banquet that I could find, with the added contemporary spice of a fraternal spat. As I say, it’s unlikely to offer any sort of model for what is going to happen at the state banquet in Windsor this week. Princes Harry and William won’t be present together, and I very much doubt there will be any hair-pulling, and definitely no cannibalism.</p>\n<p>The location of this week’s banquet is St George’s Hall in Windsor Castle. It was badly damaged in the fire of 1992 but it’s been restored and still bears the coats of arms of all the past Knights of the Garter. That is the chivalric order created by King Edward III back in 1348. Edward is closely associated with Windsor and spent loads of money doing it up in the 14th century. He was a huge fan of the legends of King Arthur and he was basically trying to reinvent Windsor as a new Camelot.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/membership/why-you-should-avoid-hair-pulling-and-cannibalism-at-royal-banquets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>On the <i>HistoryExtra</i> podcast, historian Steven Gunn reveals what coroners’ inquests tell us about everyday Tudor life, and how routine accidents on roads, fields and football pitches turned deadly</p>\n<p>After a long day’s work in the fields, a group of villagers gather in a meadow between two towns for a game of football. One man charges after the heavy leather ball, when an opponent from the neighbouring town smashes into him. The collision shatters his leg. Within days, infection sets in and he’s dead.</p>\n<p>Scenes like this weren’t shocking in 16th-century England. For ordinary Tudors, death could – and often would – come unexpectedly from a competitive game gone wrong, a slip while making dinner or a fall on the road. Records of coroners’ inquests into accidental deaths at the time reveal just how hazardous daily life could be.</p>\n<p>“These are a very good way to look at the whole of Tudor life. People have accidents at home and relaxing, playing sport, playing football, traveling, whether riding horses or walking along. Every different area of people’s life throws up different kinds of accidents,” explains historian Steven Gunn, co-author with Tomasz Gromelski of <i>An Accidental History of Tudor England</i>, <a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/membership/accidental-tudor-deaths-podcast-steven-gunn/\">speaking on the  HistoryExtra podcast</a>.</p>\n<h2>The deadliest sport? Tudor football</h2>\n<p>Football was one of the few leisure activities available to most men in Tudor villages and towns. Games were usually held on holidays or Sundays after church, when labourers could spare the time. The ‘ball’ was heavy and stitched from leather, and the pitch might be the village green, a field, or even the streets.</p>\n<p>There were no fixed numbers of players. Matches could involve dozens of men – sometimes entire parishes – who competed to force the ball towards a goal agreed in advance. Tackling was brutal, kicking and tripping were common, and injuries were part of the game. As a result, Gunn states, “Tudor football was very dangerous.”</p>\n<p>“If two people just run into each other, that’s an accident. If one person tackles another in a particularly brutal way, breaks their leg and they then die … that’s a homicide by misfortune,” Gunn explains.</p>\n<p>If these games were so dangerous, why did they carry on?</p>\n<p>The matches were popular in part, says Gunn, because they were communal. They brought villages together, sometimes to compete against neighbouring parishes, though they also revealed the risks of a society without formalised medical care. The law was clear that football deaths weren’t deliberate murders, but the man responsible still had to seek a royal pardon. It was a reminder that such violence, even if accepted as distinguishable from murder, had a price to pay.</p>\n<h2>Fights that weren’t meant to kill</h2>\n<p>Tudor society was hierarchical, but also quarrelsome. Disputes over land boundaries, debts, insults or drunken slights could easily spill out into scuffles. Wrestling was a common form of entertainment, and even neighbours might grapple in jest or anger.</p>\n<p>“There are certainly disputes in which people are fighting. Mostly those seem to be cases where it’s not intended to be fatal,” Gunn notes.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Read more |</strong>\n        <a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/period/tudor/king-henry-viii-facts-wives-spouse-execution-weight-reformation-cromwell/\">Henry VIII: the life and rule of the Tudor king</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Juries were often sympathetic if both parties had been drinking or if the fight was thought to be spontaneous.</p>\n<p>Still, the presence of knives, sticks or farming tools meant that a quarrel could quickly turn deadly.</p>\n<h2>Dinner table dangers</h2>\n<p>Meals were another source of risk. Tudors ate with their fingers and personal knives, and every man and woman carried a blade daily, used to cut bread, cheese, meat and fruit.</p>\n<p>“Everybody needs a knife to cut their food up. People very rarely use forks in the 16th century; forks are quite exotic. That means everybody's got a knife and you have lots of accidents with knives.”</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Listen now |</strong><a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/podcast-series/tudor-england-big-questions/\">Tudor England: a</a><i>HistoryExtra</i>podcast series</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>These knives were carried around in a similar way to how someone might carry a wallet or keys today: they were part of a personal toolkit. “People have got knives hanging on their belts, [because] you can't not have a knife or, or you can't have your dinner.”</p>\n<p>But this ubiquity also meant that any trip or fall could instantly turn deadly. “They fall over running along and their knife goes into their leg.

But it was made in England in the aftermath of the Conquest, probably at Canterbury by English needlewomen. Scholars think that it was commissioned by the Conqueror’s brother Odo, bishop of Bayeux, who features prominently on the Tapestry along with his followers. One of those, Vitalis, is singled out and named, shown mounted and in full armour, reporting to William the whereabouts of the English army. Perhaps he was the leader of a scouting detachment who had gone ahead of the Norman army.</p>\n    <p>The artistic inspiration was the English school of manuscript painting in Canterbury, but there may have been Roman models, too. Trajan’s Column, in particular, depicts the emperor’s Dacian campaigns in a similar manner – like a strip cartoon. Odo himself had been to Rome; so, too, had Scolland, abbot of St Augustine’s Abbey, who may have designed the Tapestry – perhaps using a sketch book from his travels?</p>\n    <p>It’s a huge artwork, some 68.3 metres long, but damaged at the end: perhaps as much as 3 metres is missing. It is generally agreed that the Tapestry originally finished with William’s crowning at Westminster at Christmas 1066 – a mirror image to the opening panel of the enthroned Edward the Confessor. Based on that assumption, a brilliant full-scale reconstruction has been completed by embroiderers on Alderney (<i>alderneybayeuxtapestry.com</i>).</p>\n    <p>It’s thought that the Tapestry was commissioned for the consecration of Bayeux Cathedral in 1077. Art historian Christopher Norton suggests that its original length would perfectly fit the nave of Odo’s new church, along three walls of a rectangular space 31 metres long and 9 metres wide, taking account of doorways and architectural supports. Possibly the first record of the embroidery tells us that, in the 15th century, it was hung in the nave at Bayeux on the feast of the cathedral’s relics, 1 July, and for the following week. By the 18th century, that period stretched from the Feast of John the Baptist on 24 June till the end of July. This gives us a key clue to its original purpose: perhaps it was made specifically to be shown in the cathedral on the relic feast.</p>\n    <p>On the Tapestry, Harold has a bigger role than William, and his story unfolds as a tragedy. Harold’s fate is sealed when he breaks his oath to support William’s claim to the English throne. Before then, he was a great and successful warrior. So he’s portrayed not as a Judas but as a Macbeth – a brave man led by his ambition into disloyalty. It is possible that his fateful oath was actually sworn on the cathedral’s relics at Bayeux. If the Tapestry was dedicated by Odo to his cathedral, then the part of the relics in the story is central.</p>\n    <p>We know nothing of the women who made it. Yet we do know that the work of Old English needlewomen was later prized abroad as <i>opus Anglicanum</i>, ‘English work’. We know that Earl Byrhtnoth, the hero of the battle of Maldon in 991, was depicted on a tapestry hung in Ely Abbey (now Ely Cathedral) that perhaps also commemorated the faithful retainers named in the famous Old English poem. And even middling people had embroideries in their houses depicting heroic or biblical scenes, which provided richly coloured decoration and acted as draught-proofing. In her will from the 940s, a woman called Wynflaed gives her friend her “long hall tapestry”, which must have been a fine heirloom.</p>\n    <p>So much bigger in scale, the Bayeux Tapestry was commissioned by a rich and powerful person at the top of society. As for its actual makers, it is only later in the Middle Ages that we start to learn the names of some of the women who created such wonderful works of art that were prized across Europe. So when we stand in front of the Tapestry next year, and take in the immense drama of the Conquest, we should also remember the unknown women who made it: the likes (let’s imagine) of Eadgyth of Sittingbourne and Ælfflæd of Whitstable. Now, they would have a story to tell.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>This column was first published in the September 2025 issue of </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>BBC History Magazine</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/membership/michael-wood-on-womens-contributions-to-the-bayeux-tapestry/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Meanwhile, mortgage costs have risen 91.9% in the same period.</p><blockquote><p>“Costs to buy have gone up four times faster than incomes. Not sustainable,” Gerli</p><a href=\"\">wrote</a>.</blockquote><p>Other commentators, including Darth Powell and <a href=\"https://x.com/neilfromsa/status/1968127071240196129\">Neil</a>, pointed to skyrocketing late rental payments. There is also a growing struggle for homeowners to keep pace with monthly bills.</p><p>Meanwhile, Polymarket and Barchart data <a href=\"https://x.com/Polymarket/status/1967951468629225551\">show</a> that searches for mortgage help have surpassed 2008 levels. This reflects how financial stress is spreading beyond renters to homeowners.</p><p>With affordability collapsing, home-buying activity remains muted even as credit conditions tighten.</p>Sponsored Sponsored<h2>FHFA’s Crypto Experiment Pushes Adoption, But With Strings Attached</h2><p>Against this backdrop, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-mortgages-housing-credit-us-crypto-news/\">attempted to ease access to credit in June</a> by allowing Bitcoin and certain cryptocurrencies to count as assets for mortgage eligibility.</p><p>The move applies to applicants through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It marked the <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/fhfa-crypto-mortgage-loan-assessment/\">first time the federal mortgage system formally recognized crypto</a> in asset assessments.</p><p>However, the program had limitations. Only crypto held on US-regulated custodial exchanges qualifies, while Bitcoin in cold storage, multisig setups, or self-custody wallets does not.</p><p>Applicants can also not pledge these assets as collateral, as crypto holdings count toward net worth in the assessment process.</p>Sponsored<p>Critics argue that the approach undermines Bitcoin’s core principle of self-sovereignty.</p><blockquote><p>“It looks like bitcoin held in self-custody will NOT count as an asset for consideration on home loans. This is a mistake Pulte; self-custody is fundamentally aligned w/American values. It’s trivial to prove ownership of BTC in self-custody,”</p><a href=\"\">wrote</a>self-custody expert Nick Neuman.</blockquote><p>Bitcoin financial services firm Swan echoed the concern. While Swan acknowledged the move as a win, it recognized the limitations.</p><p>Bitcoin does not exist in the eyes of mortgage underwriters unless it is visible on state-regulated custodial platforms.</p><p>For Swan, this reflects a larger pattern: first ignoring crypto, then adopting it, but only on terms designed for control.</p><p>Notwithstanding, supporters hold that the FHFA’s recognition still marks a breakthrough. By including crypto assets without requiring conversion to US dollars, the agency gave digital assets a foothold in one of America’s most systemically important markets.</p><p>For crypto holders, especially those who may be cash-poor but asset-rich, this could open a path to qualifying for mortgages that would otherwise be out of reach.</p><p>Still, the housing crisis highlights the limits of crypto’s role. The recognition came just as housing stress surged to levels unseen since 2008, and the narrow scope of eligibility means Bitcoin is unlikely to provide widespread relief.</p><p>Instead, crypto’s integration into mortgage credit may remain a niche tool.</p><p>On the one hand, it is symbolic of broader financial convergence. On the other hand, it remains far from a solution to the affordability crisis gripping American households.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/us-housing-crisis-bitcoin-mortgage-role-limited/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The outcome will largely depend on whether the intervention is too late to protect the labor markets. The labor market is slowing, but I wouldn’t call it a crisis yet. If that remains the base case, I suspect a 25bp cut over the next several quarters will be largely constructive for risk assets, including Bitcoin. By cutting, it creates room for other central banks to cut interest rates, aiming to keep their own currencies competitive with the dollar,” he said.</p></blockquote><p>In a statement shared with BeInCrypto, Blume explained that <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/rate-cut-roulette-0-25-50-bps-bitcoin-altcoins/\">a rate cut</a> would be positive for corporate BTC vehicles. Why? Because it can lift BTC prices and attract new funding towards risk assets. </p><p>Many of these firms rely on financing through PIPEs (Private Investments in Public Equity) and convertible debt, where investors expect to cycle in and out profitably. Thus, he added that,</p><blockquote><p>“The prospect of a continued bull market emboldens them to continue participating as well.”</p></blockquote><p>Thus, GDC’s acquisition of Pallas Capital highlights the growing trend of companies doubling down on Bitcoin reserves, even as the stock shows<a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility\"> signs of volatility.</a> While investor skepticism remains evident in GDC’s stock performance,  macroeconomic conditions and Bitcoin’s long-term value might validate its treasury strategy.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/gd-culture-group-bitcoin-treasury-acquisition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low.<a href=\"\">Inflation</a>has moved up and remains somewhat elevated.”</blockquote><p>Regarding the possibility of further rate cuts, it said:</p><blockquote><p>“In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.”</p></blockquote><p>The decision’s impact on Bitcoin may also positively affect the rest of the crypto market in the coming days.</p><h2><strong>A Positive Catalyst for Crypto?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The crypto market was cautiously optimistic before the Fed decided on interest rates. Now that <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/fed-rate-cut-crypto-impact/\">the cuts turn into reality</a>, good things may be in store for traders. According to data from CryptoQuant, investors have been getting ready to buy. </p><blockquote><p>“In general, a Fed cut is a positive catalyst for risk assets such as cryptocurrencies,” said Julio Moreno, Head of Research at CryptoQuant.</p></blockquote><p>Investors are holding onto their most valuable crypto assets, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. This move signifies that large holders are not panicking and <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/cryptos-signal-divergence-ahead-of-fed-rate-decision/\">likely expect prices to increase</a> after the cut. </p><blockquote><p>“For BTC and ETH, it seems that investors are expecting a rally as inflows into exchanges are at low levels–this means they don’t expect to sell,” Moreno added.</p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, money is flowing into stablecoins. Moreno explained that these assets are often used as cash on exchanges, which suggests that investors are getting ready to buy.</p><blockquote><p>“Higher</p><a href=\"\">stablecoin</a>deposits are the ‘dry powder’ of investors before deploying capital (buying),” he said.</blockquote><p>On-chain data also shows that some investors are cashing out on their less valuable assets, like altcoins. This indicates caution or a strategic move in preparation for the main event.</p>Sponsored<p>Most of the data aligns with how crypto markets have historically reacted to interest rate cuts. Lower borrowing costs have traditionally encouraged investors to seek higher returns in riskier, more speculative assets.</p><p>The rate cuts between 2020 and 2021, following the COVID-19 pandemic, serve as a key example of how this financial easing <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/quantitative-easing-unnecessary-say-experts-amid-current-market-turmoil/\">fueled a historic bull run</a> in cryptocurrencies. During that time, the influx of capital directly translated into an increased risk appetite among retailers. </p><p>However, the relationship between interest rate cuts and the crypto market is not always linear.</p><h2><strong>A Politically Charged Decision</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Powell’s announcement comes amid heightened tension between the Federal Reserve and the Trump administration. Since assuming office, Trump has repeatedly pressured the FOMC to cut interest rates, even trying to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook.</p><p>Just yesterday, the Senate confirmed Stephen Miran, a former top economic advisor to Trump, to the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors.</p><p>These consistent pressures have <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/fed-under-fire-dollar-in-danger-bitcoin/\">drawn scrutiny over the Fed’s independence</a> in its decision-making process. Whether Powell cut rates over the state of the economy or under executive pressure remains blurry. As such, experts remain divided over whether the cuts are even necessary. </p><p>If today’s decision was overwhelmingly taken out of political pressure, it will <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency/\">likely lead to higher inflation</a>, eroding Americans’ purchasing power and causing the economy to overheat. This <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/\">volatility</a> will also lower risk appetite, <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/us-ppi-data-inflation-lower-crypto-reaction-muted/\">drawing trading volumes away from</a> the cryptocurrency market. </p><p>That said, the American economy has been undergoing significant turbulence in recent months.</p><h2><strong>What’s Next for the American Consumer?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Recent data has shown a decidedly soft job market with slower employment growth than previously estimated. <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency/\">Inflation</a> also <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-climbs-us-inflation-data-lands-below-target/\">remains a significant concern</a>.</p><p>The Fed’s preferred <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency/\">inflation</a> measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, is expected to stay well above the central bank’s 2% target. This is partly due to Trump’s import taxes, which economists warn could further increase prices in the coming months.</p><p>The coming months will determine whether this fresh round of interest rate cuts will effectively balance the Fed’s dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. They will also be key in determining whether the crypto market will stand to profit this time.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-rises-as-us-federal-reserve-opts-for-25bps-rate-cut/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The firm’s data shows a stark divergence in coin volume, which has been observed in movements onto centralized exchanges over the past few weeks.</p><h2>Bitcoin and Ethereum Inflows Drop to Multi-Month Lows</h2>Sponsored<p>Bitcoin has seen a dramatic drop in <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/crypto-inflows-bitcoin-ethereum-sentiment-recovery/\">exchange inflows</a>, with the 7-day moving average plummeting to 25,000 BTC, its lowest level in over a year.

    "body": "<p>This summer, I reread the novel “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Aurora-Kim-Stanley-Robinson/dp/0316098094\">Aurora</a>,” by Kim Stanley Robinson, a science-fiction writer whom I <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/01/31/can-science-fiction-wake-us-up-to-our-climate-reality-kim-stanley-robinson\">profiled</a> a few years ago. Robinson has an ecological orientation, and “Aurora” is basically a book about how we fit into nature. It ends on a beach, with an extended description of swimming in big waves. It’s early morning, and the waves, as they rise, “turn a deep translucent green.” Freya, the novel’s protagonist, has never swum in the ocean, and over the course of the morning she learns how. She discovers that she can dive under a swell, “feel the tug of the wave’s underturn,” and shoot up when it has passed; that she can swim fast up waves that are about to break, then “crash through their crests and fall down their backsides”; and that she can surf, “sliding sideways ahead of the break and across the surface of the wave, which keeps rising up before her, steepening at just the right speed to keep her falling down across it.” This is amazing, like flying, but it can also go wrong: when waves crash down on her before she’s ready, she gets tumbled along the bottom, hitting the sand. Once, she almost drowns.</p>\n<p>Freya swims under, over, and along the waves, one after another. Each wave is its own event, difficult or ideal, but collectively they chain together in a soothing rhythm. Sometimes she has to rush to handle a fast set of waves, but such moments are rare; most of the time, she can navigate the wave in front of her, and then turn to the next. This rhythm is part of what makes the beach a special place. It’s a little miraculous that something as powerful as the sea can be, in some sense, predictable.</p>\n<p>In ordinary life, by contrast, the flow of time often feels irregular. At painful moments, time can drag with excruciating slowness; when the pressure rises, it accelerates. I find that the end of summer is a period in which time seems to go faster. Days get shorter, the holidays loom, and the months begin to blur. Recently, I sat down with the school calendar to plan meetings for my son’s Lego robotics team, which I’m helping to coach. Almost every week contains some special day—a science fair, a Thanksgiving celebration—that must be prepared for in advance. In her book “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pilgrim-Tinker-Creek-Annie-Dillard/dp/0060953020\">Pilgrim at Tinker Creek</a>,” Annie Dillard describes the speed with which the sun can seem to rise and set: it’s as though the world is run by a magician, who says, “Presto chango!” Time trips over itself. In place of steady waves, there’s just a churning sea.</p>\n<p>There are strategies for regularizing time, all of which are familiar. One possibility is to subdue it through planning, using calendars, lists, and the like, which encourage us to see the march of time objectively. Another is to try “living in the moment”—a way of giving every unit of time its due. I like my calendars, but they’ve never quite created in me a sense of what David Allen, the <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-rise-and-fall-of-getting-things-done\">productivity guru</a>, called “mind like water”; it’s more like my calendar app is a ticking time bomb, with a countdown I’m hesitant to check. Meanwhile, my attempts to live in the moment, even those abetted by meditation, have felt squishy, uncertain, and evasive. I find that I enjoy life most when it unfolds through regular, manageable units of time that are imposed from without.</p>\n<p>Over the past few years, I’ve discovered that my preferred solution is to live one day at a time. In some recovery programs, “one day at a time” is a mantra, expressing the idea that a daunting lifelong commitment to sobriety is best approached in daily steps. This is a little like what E. L. Doctorow <a href=\"https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2718/the-art-of-fiction-no-94-e-l-doctorow\">said</a> about being a novelist: Writing a novel “is like driving a car at night. You can see only as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way.” But I mean something different—that a day is wavelike. Each one comes forward with its own particular character. You can dive beneath it, or struggle up its face, or try to surf it, or get pummelled by it, but then another day comes, and another. We can usefully organize our experience by approaching it in terms of days. That’s obvious, isn’t it? But it isn’t always easy to do.</p>\n<p>To an extent, you can just tell yourself to take it one day at a time. You can literally think, <i>Take it a day at a tim</i>e—the thought alone does something. But that’s a little like telling yourself to “enjoy life.” It’s good to have a few techniques to sharpen your intention.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/open-questions/can-you-really-live-one-day-at-a-time\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In a dark library lit by a single lamp, four men, a young woman and three children crowd around a circular dais. They are staring at a clockwork contraption called an orrery, housed within giant bands of metal that suggest a celestial sphere. Below, tiny planets rotate around the Sun, orbited by pearl moons. Concentric plates allow the planets to move according to their relative speeds. The lecturer in his striking red gown is pointing to Jupiter’s moons, while a younger man in a purple coat and gold striped waistcoat assiduously takes notes. His notetaking implies the event isn’t run-of-the-mill, but something special and worth recording. A small lamp has taken the place of the central sun in the orrery and throws light upon everyone’s faces. We can only see it as a reflection below the elbow of the silhouetted youth in the foreground – a wick burning in a jar of oil. The lamplight adds an eager gleam to the eyes of the inquisitive young children and illuminates the contemplative gaze of the young man on the right. It highlights the edges of the young woman’s frilled bonnet and the cheekbones of the adolescent who leans over the edge of the orrery in front of us. It is his shoulder that we can look over without feeling as if we are intruding. The lamp illuminates all our faces as our minds are enlightened by the science we observe in action.</p>\n<p>Today, <i>A Philosopher Giving that Lecture on the Orrery, in which a Lamp is Put in the Place of the Sun</i> (1766)<i> </i>by Joseph Wright of Derby (1734-97) is rightly considered a masterpiece. When it was first exhibited at the annual exhibition of the Society of Artists in Spring Gardens, London, in 1766, reviewers singled it out for particular praise, saying it was ‘exceeding fine’. It attracted more attention than any other work on display, inspiring one reviewer to break out in rhyming couplets: ‘Without a rival let this “Wright” be known,/For this amazing province is his own.’ Wright’s <i>Orrery</i> was a huge statement from a young and ambitious artist. So why, then, was he overlooked when the Royal Academy of Arts was founded by George III just two years later? When Wright had been lauded as a ‘genius’ at that same year’s Society of Artists exhibition? Why was he not a founder member of the new august institution?</p>\n<p>The Royal Academy was founded in December 1768 by George III at the behest of a small number of artists and architects. Membership was limited to 40, meaning more than 160 members of the Society of Artists did not make the cut. The Society had formed only eight years earlier, in 1760, as a way for Britain’s leading artists to meet, converse, study and exhibit together in London. It’s hard to imagine but there were no regular public exhibitions of art before this time. Art was shown to discerning patrons in artists’ studios and viewed in private collections in aristocratic homes. The Society changed this and, for a shilling (around £5 today), anyone could scrutinise the finest paintings of the year. At its peak, it had more than 200 members, including the country’s leading landscape painter Richard Wilson, the ‘grand manner’ portraitist Joshua Reynolds and the architect William Chambers, who would later design the Great Room of the Royal Academy. It also included younger artists such as the American painter Benjamin West and the history painter Nathaniel Dance, as well as Wright himself and his friends John Hamilton Mortimer and Ozias Humphry. These young men were finding their feet by exhibiting in this new annual mixed exhibition. Wright was 30 when he was elected a member of the Society in May 1765, the year his first ‘candlelight’ painting, <i>Three Persons Viewing the Gladiator by Candlelight</i> (1765), was exhibited to favourable reviews. While he was known as a portraitist in his home town of Derby, where he lived and worked, it was his ambitious candlelight paintings that significantly raised his profile in the capital.</p>\n<p><i>Three Persons Viewing the Gladiator by Candlelight</i> (1765) by Joseph Wright. Courtesy <a href=\"https://derbymuseums.org/event/joseph-wright-life-on-paper/\">Derby Museums</a></p>\n<p>Wright’s friends in London were young and opinionated artists, who were members of the Howdalian Society, but his circle in Derby was older and more scientific. John Whitehurst, a horologist and geologist, lived at 22 Iron Gate, a few doors away from Wright at number 28, while Peter Perez Burdett, a cartographer and son of an instrument maker, lived in Full Street. Burdett was so familiar with Wright that he often borrowed money from him (and never seemed to pay him back). Many of Whitehurst’s friends – including the doctor Erasmus Darwin (grandfather of Charles Darwin) and the potter Josiah Wedgwood – were associated with the Lunar Society, a group of industrialists and natural philosophers who met regularly in Birmingham.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/joseph-wright-of-derby-put-science-at-the-centre-of-his-art?utm_source=rss-feed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The woman was seeking to have her foot surgically amputated and replaced with a prosthetic limb, when she encountered an unexpected impediment: Surgeons were reluctant to remove what they considered a healthy limb — even though the patient could not walk on it.</p>\n<p>\"And I thought that was interesting, the reluctance of the surgeons to remove a foot because it is an act with some finality to remove a foot,\" Roach says.</p>\n<p>Roach's book describes how advancements in gene editing and 3D printing technology might further make our anatomy \"replaceable.\" She profiles scientists in lab at Carnegie Mellon University who used a 3D printer to create a tiny ventricle, which was used to pump the heart of a mouse. But, she adds, the Trump administration's cuts to medical research threaten to interrupt the \"pipeline of innovation and discovery.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's going to have terrible effects further down the line,\" Roach says. \"Just looking forward to the future of innovation and medical care, it's very depressing.\"</p>\n<h3>Interview highlights</h3>\n<p>\n                Replaceable You: Adventures in Human Anatomy, by Mary Roach\n                <strong>\n                    \n                    W.

What happened in the '40s, '50s, '60s, there was a project, it was a collaboration between the Mayo Clinic, the Mayo Foundation, which was the research arm of the Mayo clinic, and the Hormel Institute, which was the research arm of pork. The goal here was to create a smaller pig, a pig that would be a good match in terms of not just the size of human organs, but the functions. There were all these studies were done looking at do pigs get coronary artery disease? And it turns out they do. In fact, the pig was described in one of their papers as a caricature of an obese human. In other words, gets heart disease, has heart issues, doesn't get enough exercise. …</p>\n<p>If you are going to use the pig as your model, as your stand-in for a human, then you want to be sure that these organs ... behave similarly, that they have a similar size. So this research, once it got rolling, and there were dozens and dozens of papers, three volumes of papers looking at kidney function, liver function. There was one on orthodontia where they had put braces onto pigs. So it was all toward the goal of creating an analog, a stand-in for a human being for trying out surgical techniques or not so much pharmaceuticals, but techniques and replacements. So the pig became the go-to creature. … I mean who knows, a goat might've been equally useful, but nobody started using goats.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>On preventing the body from rejecting a pig organ </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>With an organ that's coming from another species, the reaction is quite severe. It's called a hyperacute rejection, where, within minutes, the body starts to attack, the organ starts to turn black. You don't want to put a pig organ into somebody without it having been genetically edited. So one of the things that's edited is something called the alpha-gal protein. And this is a surface protein that the body, if you can knock that out, you're basically just making the pig organ seem a little less pig-like and a little more human-like. So now you're dealing with a level of rejection that you would get with a human transplant. In other words, taking some other human's organ and transplanting it. So the person is still on an immunosuppressive regimen, taking drugs to suppress the immune system. But on about the same level as they would with a human.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>On if a pig transplant is kosher </strong>\n    </p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/16/nx-s1-5530048/mary-roach-replaceable-you-anatomy-transplant\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

This week sees the release of several works of fiction that challenge or outright shrug off the hard rigors of the day-to-day, in pursuit of something far more <i>out there</i>: proof, at least in concept, that other worlds are possible.</p>\n<p>But this week's publishing calendar also offers help for readers seeking to understand, or simply cope with, <i>this</i> one. Because even if it isn't an escape, there's still value in applying a different, more deliberate lens to the — world, national, even personal — history that we can't help but live and breathe while we're around.</p>\n<p><i>The Book of Guilt,</i> by Catherine Chidgey</p>\n<p>Few historical forks in the road seem as consequential, or as seductive to speculative fiction, as the outcome of World War II. Only, the thought experiment is typically framed as a simple either-or, with the Axis powers subbed in as victors — as in Philip K. Dick's paragon of the form, <i>The Man in the High Castle</i>. Here, though, Chidgey imagines an outcome in which a treaty leaves no clear victor, and in which the U.K. carries on with the caveat that Nazi crimes have become useful scientific precedent. The New Zealand novelist centers the perspectives of teenage British triplets, caught several decades later in a turbid world where the line between political and scientific subject has become disturbingly unclear.</p>\n<h3>Buy Featured Book</h3>\n<p>Your purchase helps support NPR programming. <a href=\"https://help.npr.org/customer/portal/articles/2168887-how-can-my-online-purchases-support-npr-programming\">How?</a></p>\n<p><i>Dealing with the Dead: A Novel,</i> by Alain Mabanckou, translated by Helen Stevenson</p>\n<p>For years, fairly or unfairly, Mabanckou has gamely shouldered the mantle of \"African Samuel Beckett.\" Born in what's now the Republic of Congo, now based in the U.S., the francophone's nickname comes from his philosophical bent and keen sense of the absurd.

Joe Manchin, a Catholic up for re-election this year, was one of the Democrats who spoke out against the White House birth control policy before it was altered.</p>\n<p>Former West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin III says that, at a time when political polarization is the norm and violence against public officials and figures is happening more often, both Democrats and Republicans are to blame for the \"visceral hatred\" felt today.</p>\n<p>\"Basically both parties are guilty of a — and I say it's a business model,\" Manchin said in an interview with <i>Morning Edition.</i> \"This is a duopoly of [the] Democrat and Republican Party. That's why I'm a fiercely proud independent right now, that I can work with both sides.\"</p>\n<p>The former Democratic senator, turned independent in 2024, was known for butting heads with liberals and people within his own party, and often being an ally to the GOP. In his new memoir titled, <i>Dead Center: In Defense of Common Sense</i>, Manchin explains how a boy from a small coal mining community in Farmington, West Virginia became a significant figure in U.S. politics.</p>\n<p>In the book Manchin details private conversations, including a tense, expletive-laden back-and-forth with former President Joe Biden in 2021, who was, at the time, trying to pass the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/12/19/1065636709/joe-manchin-says-he-cannot-support-bidens-build-back-better-plan\">Build Back Better Act</a>. Manchin refused to support Build Back Better, though a renegotiated version called the Inflation Reduction Act <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/08/07/1116190180/democrats-are-set-to-pass-a-major-climate-health-and-tax-bill-heres-whats-in-it\">eventually passed with his support in 2022</a>.</p>\n<p>\"Joe Biden, whom I've known for quite a while, and I think the world of him, we just disagreed,\" Manchin told <i>Morning Edition</i>. \"I just never knew him to be that far left as his administration had moved.\"</p>\n<p>Manchin served U.S. Senate for just over 14 years and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/11/09/1211907129/joe-manchin-retire\">retired in January 2025</a>. From his perspective, he was just a man trying to bring common sense to sometimes nonsensical politics.</p>\n<p>He spoke with NPR's Michel Martin about his new memoir and why he believes it's time to create \"an American independent party.\"</p>\n<p><i>The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity. </i></p>\n<h3><strong>Interview Highlights</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Michel Martin</strong>: You wrote in the book, \"I have watched the Democratic Party leave me and my state, and I have watched the Republican Party lose itself to one man.\" Can you say more about that?</p>\n<p><strong>Joe Manchin</strong>: The party didn't make me. I'm the person I am. And my dad had great friends who had an R by their name, and I just saw nothing but Kumbaya. They were all good buddies, who had different ideas. So, I never looked at it that way.</p>\n<p><strong>Martin</strong>: When you say, \"I have watched the Republican Party lose itself to one man,\" what do you mean by that?</p>\n<p><strong>Manchin</strong>: One person can't always be right on everything. First of all, let me just tell you, I know President Trump. The first two years, I worked with him probably closer than any Democrat. I think one time he and I kidded around, I said, \"I'm a Democrat like you used to be a Democrat, a conservative Democrat.\" And we all worked together. So when they came to me with different things, and social services, there was so much give away, there was no one held accountable and responsible. If you want to get a person out of generational poverty, help them work themselves up. Change the financial cliff, the welfare cliff, to a slope. Let them work with some services until they get to a mean wage.</p>\n<p><strong>Martin</strong>: Is it possible, though, that part of it is that your view of politics is shaped by the fact that West Virginia is a very distinct place. Everybody knows everybody, like there's six degrees of separation. That just isn't the reality that a lot of people have, and a lot of your colleagues are working in very different environments. Is it possible that there are just things about their context that you don't understand?</p>\n<p><strong>Manchin</strong>: I'm sure of that. A lot of people are able to work in their comfort zones. Think about my state, the least diverse state in the nation, the whitest state in the nation. OK. And here I am, coming from an immigrant family, being a Catholic in a state that basically that's not the norm. So, I know that if you work hard and you try to give back more than what you're willing to take out, they're going to accept you. They'll love you. You'll be fine.</p>\n<p><strong>Martin</strong>: You have a whole chapter called \"I Got It Wrong.\" That was interesting. The one that really stood out to me is around Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court. You said, \"the decision to vote for Brett Kavanaugh did not just create problems for me professionally. My granddaughter Kelsey was living with us at the time and working on my campaign.\" You said that when you got home that day, she was rolled into a ball and cried for hours. And you said that many volunteers working on your campaign quit over that vote. Do you think you were wrong on that vote?</p>\n<p><strong>Manchin</strong>: No, not at all.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/16/nx-s1-5355803/joe-manchin-new-book-dead-center\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

An earlier painting of Niagara Falls had prompted a London paper to declare that “art wasn’t limited to Europe” and that “it was not necessary for genius to study in any school but that of nature.” His cloudscapes surpassed even <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/12/12/knud-baade-clouds/\">those of his Norwegian contemporary Knud Baade</a>. </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.redbubble.com/shop/ap/173956226\">\n        <graphic data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fredericedwinchurch_niagara.jpg?resize=680%2C316&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"316\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85814\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fredericedwinchurch_niagara.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fredericedwinchurch_niagara.jpg?resize=320%2C149&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fredericedwinchurch_niagara.jpg?resize=600%2C279&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fredericedwinchurch_niagara.jpg?resize=240%2C111&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fredericedwinchurch_niagara.jpg?resize=768%2C356&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p><i>Niagara</i>by Frederic Edwin Church, 1857.

Details of exquisite aliveness punctuate the vista — a blue-blooming shrub, a pendulous bird’s nest, a resplendent quetzal perched on a branch, lichen on the bark of a broken tree, two people kneeling before a white wooden cross — all of it awash in light that <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/12/12/knud-baade-clouds/\">only consciousness can see</a>, impossible for a camera lens to capture. </p>\n<p>\n      <i>The Heart of the Andes</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Rebelling against the stale convention of gilded frames, Church had invented a new kind of frame made of walnut wood, onto which he draped curtains to give the illusion of a window opening when the painting was being revealed. Silver reflectors focused gas lights onto the canvas to emulate the sunlit atmosphere of the landscape itself. The effect, <i>The New York Times</i> wrote, was “simply magical” — “a new sensation in art, giving a reality of atmospheric space to the picture, and a delicacy to the tones of the coloring, which must be seen to be at all appreciated or understood.” Before the days of easy travel, before color photography, most of the visitors had never seen and would never see with their own eyes nature so wild, mountains so majestic. Here was virtual reality — an immersion in light, color, and feeling that speaks not just to the eye but to the entire system of being we call soul. </p>\n<p>\n      <i>The Heart of the Andes</i>\n    </p>\n<p>For three weeks, people packed into Church’s studio, sometimes more than two thousand per day, gasping each time the curtain was drawn open, shuddering with the vertigo of the sublime. On the closing day, the line for admission curled around the block, around the clock.

Coordination is often the name of the game, from the viral treadmills in “Here It Goes Again” to 64 synced and choreographed smartphones in “A Stone Only Rolls Downhill.” For their latest release, “Impulse Purchase,” the group turned to another means of collaboration: open-source animation.</p>\n    <p>OK Go teamed up with animators <a href=\"https://www.lucaszanotto.com/\">Lucas Zanotto</a> (<a href=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/tags/lucas-zanotto/\">previously</a>) and <a href=\"https://wanderson.xyz/\">Will Anderson</a>, along with Blender Studio, to create a digital music video unlike any they’ve made so far. The song “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwzbIUffcR4\">Impulse Purchase</a>” takes Zanotto’s characteristic cartoonish characters, which roll and explode in a variety of playful, geometric shapes and combines the imagery with real-time motion captures of lead singer Damien Kulash’s face.</p>\n    <p>The video opens with a hint of the process behind the scenes, and the credits reveal even more insights into how the software captured the movements of all the band members.</p>\n    <p>Blender is an open-source software that enables dynamic 3D modeling and animation, instrumental in the recent Academy Award-winning film <i> Flow.</i> Zanotto and Anderson used a tool called Geometry Nodes, “a node-based way of creating complex geometry that can change dynamically, involve simulations, and ultimately drive a performance in an adaptive way,” Anderson told </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/ok-go-will-anderson-digital-film-project-150925\">It’s Nice That</a>.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Two years after the launch of ITVX, the broadcaster has introduced a refreshed identity that simplifies its design system, elevates Spark Yellow, and introduces a new motif called \"the apex\".</p>\n    <p>ITV has unveiled a new brand identity, created in collaboration with Cornwall-based Studio Kiln, marking the broadcaster's most significant design update since the launch of ITVX in 2022. The work simplifies the system, strips back sub-channel signposting, and places the ITV masterbrand firmly at the heart of its communications.</p>\n    <p>The decision comes as ITV marketing continues to stretch across more platforms and formats than ever before. From billboards and broadcast trailers to TikTok ads and CTV campaigns, the new system is designed to give ITV a consistent presence wherever audiences encounter it.</p>\n    <p>Spark yellow, first introduced with ITVX, has now been elevated as the lead colour, supported by a bold visual device called \"the apex\".</p>\n    <p>Studio Kiln's breakthrough on the project came with the creation of the apex, which is a sharp, angular device inspired by the geometry of the ITVX' X'. Once introduced, it changed ITV's whole approach to the brand.</p>\n    <p>\"Once we created a device that physically connected the ITV logo with content, the whole mindset changed,\" says Charlie Hocking, creative director at Studio Kiln. \"It meant ITV didn't need to lean on sub-channels or secondary signposting anymore – the brand had a unique and identifiable brand device that could do the heavy lifting.\"</p>\n    <p>The apex is not a single static mark but a flexible system with more than 50 dynamic variations. Panels drift, orbit, and expand around the ITV logo, creating a sense of energy and movement while allowing space for the content to shine.</p>\n    <p>Each fragment represents a different part of the broadcaster's universe, such as drama, sport, news, and entertainment, anchored by the ITV logo at the centre. A small easter egg connects back to the ITVX era, as the apex shares its underlying geometry with the streaming platform's icon, building continuity into the evolution.</p>\n    <p>One of the toughest creative calls was deciding how much of ITV's colourful brand world to retain. The company has long been associated with multiple channel identities and shifting palettes. Studio Kiln and ITV Creative eventually concluded that clarity mattered more than variety.</p>\n    <p>Charlie recalls: \"One of the toughest decisions was to reduce sub-channel indicators and choose a single colour – Spark Yellow. ITV had become known for multiple colours and multiple channels, but for clarity, we stripped this back.</p>\n    <p>\"We chose to keep the Spark Yellow from ITVX, because it already had the strongest brand recognition and felt noticeably different from competitors. Over time, the more we stripped away, the clearer and more usable the system became.\"</p>\n    <p>The streamlined approach makes the identity easier to implement across a vast marketing funnel, from long-lead campaigns to quick-turn social content. It also gives ITV the freedom to lead confidently with just the masterbrand, rather than leaning too heavily on sub-brands.</p>\n    <p>In practice, the new design had to work hard across hundreds of use cases, from TV trailers to outdoor billboards, and so the apex became the unifying tool. \"It could have felt overwhelming, but The Apex gave us a way to generate infinite variations without breaking consistency,\" Charlie explains.</p>\n    <p>For audiences, the effect is subtle but powerful, as the ITV logo now feels like the gravitational centre of a wider world of content, with the apex creating movement and discovery around it. On digital platforms, the motion language brings this to life, building recognition even in fleeting, scroll-stopping moments.</p>\n    <p>The project, led by ITV's in-house creative team in partnership with Kiln, reflects a wider shift in how the broadcaster sees itself. Tom Houser, executive creative director at ITV Creative, says: \"Having the opportunity to evolve the ITV brand like this and collaborate with Studio Kiln has been a real thrill. This project brought together teams from across ITV, from marketing to strategy, design to performance, who worked together to create a fantastic new look and feel that's brimming with potential.</p>\n    <p>\"Now the ITV masterbrand gets the attention it deserves, sitting confidently alongside all the incredible content we produce. I can't wait to see all the ways it'll come to life – watch this space.\" Studio Kiln believes that this project offers a valuable lesson that many brands can learn from.</p>\n    <p>\"Simplifying isn't about losing things — it's about giving the brand more confidence,\" Charlie says. \"ITV showed that by reducing their colours, typefaces and sub-channels, they didn't end up with less, they ended up with something stronger and more flexible.\"</p>\n    <p>The new identity represents the first time ITV's masterbrand has been applied consistently across the entire marketing funnel. In a competitive and fragmented entertainment landscape, this coherence aims to make ITV stand out as much for its identity as for its content.</p>\n    <p>Get the best of Creative Boom delivered to your inbox weekly</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.creativeboom.com/news/itv-unveils-evolved-brand-identity-with-studio-kiln/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p><strong>Breakneck</strong><i>, by Dan Wang (Norton)</i>. In recent decades, as China has laid down vast networks of high-speed rail and thrown up shimmering cities, Americans have developed a deepening sense that their own country struggles to get things done. In this ambitious account, Wang, a technology analyst with a journalist’s eye for color, uses studies of Chinese innovation to show how the two countries’ diverging paths and pathologies can be traced to their political cultures. Chinese leaders tend to be engineers who are capable of grand projects but liable to run roughshod over individual rights. The U.S., on the other hand, has become a society of lawyers, better at miring public infrastructure in proceduralism than at creating it. China’s example can remind Americans to treasure their country’s pluralism, Wang suggests, while also teaching them something about how to build.</p>\n    <p><strong>Threads of Empire</strong><i>, by Dorothy Armstrong (St. Martin’s)</i>. Carpets are “some of the world’s greatest symbols of authority and control,” Armstrong, a scholar of material culture, argues in this vivid history. She makes her case through profiles of twelve noteworthy specimens, including one frozen in the tomb of a Scythian chieftain; one photographed under the feet of Churchill, Stalin, and Roosevelt at the Yalta Conference, in 1945; and one crafted into a coat for a feudal Japanese warlord. The stories are fraught with violence and colonialism: Persian rugs, for instance, gained their glittering reputation in part from Victorian-era racial hierarchies. But Armstrong draws attention to the carpets’ original weavers, often female and illiterate, whose artistry remains a source of awe.</p>\n    <h2>\n      <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2025\">What We’re Reading</a>\n    </h2>\n    <p>\n      <i>Discover notable new fiction, nonfiction, and poetry.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>God and Sex</strong><i>, by Jon Raymond (Simon &amp; Schuster)</i>. In this lush novel, which reconsiders the meaning of an “act of God,” a moderately successful writer of New Age nonfiction decides to focus his next treatise on trees. As he conducts research, he insinuates himself into the lives of an ecology professor and his wife, soon beginning an affair with the latter. The writer and the professor’s wife (whose dalliances Raymond renders through a series of rather explicit coital vignettes) discover that they may have a transcendent connection, but then a forest fire seems to take the wife’s life. In the wake of catastrophe, the writer’s ambiguous relationship to God begins to reveal itself.</p>\n    <p><strong>Dominion</strong><i>, by Addie E. Citchens (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux)</i>. This début novel of Southern small-town life considers the hypocrisies forged in patriarchy’s crucible and the difficulty of reckoning with a father’s sins. Priscilla, the proud yet put-upon matriarch of the most powerful family in Dominion, Mississippi, and a quiet teen-ager named Diamond, whose future is as uncertain as her childhood has been tumultuous, share a love for the town’s golden boy, who is Priscilla’s son. The young man’s beauty, musical talents, and athletic prowess, however, belie volatile currents of desire and rage, which will eventually scandalize the community and unsettle Priscilla and Diamond’s faiths.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/09/22/breakneck-threads-of-empire-god-and-sex-dominion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In Agnès Varda’s film “Jane B. par Agnès V.,” from 1988, a nearly forty-year-old Jane Birkin, dressed in jeans, a white T-shirt, and a tweed blazer, her messy brown hair pinned back, sits in front of the Eiffel Tower and dumps out the contents of her purse. The purse, which she helped design, is named for her: it’s the Birkin bag, by Hermès, one of the most famous accessories in the world. Inside are loose papers, notebooks, a tube of Maybelline’s Great Lash mascara, a copy of Dostoyevsky’s “The Gambler,” a Swiss Army knife, pens and markers, a roll of tape. “Well,” Birkin says, in heavily accented French, “did you learn anything about me from seeing my bag?” Then a grin: “Even if we reveal everything, we don’t show much.”</p>\n<p>Throughout “Jane B.,” Varda draws attention to the elusiveness of her subject. Birkin, a British-born actress and singer best known, then as now, for the raunchy pop songs she recorded with her lover Serge Gainsbourg, comes across as both open and enigmatic, singular in a way that is hard to parse. Her beauty is undeniable, but its borders are vague. Proud of her own eccentricity, she is also shy and awkward, with the voice of a little girl—hushed, rushed, and airy. Varda dresses her up as Joan of Arc, Caravaggio’s Bacchus, the Virgin Mary, a cowboy, and a flamenco dancer, as if to suggest that Birkin’s mystery is itself a symbol, one as important to modern culture as Renaissance painting and the mother of Christ.</p>\n<p>Birkin, who died in 2023, had “it”: an undefinable, unmistakable glamour that shifts our collective sense of what’s cool, or at least of what’s worth paying attention to. Easily mingling English reserve and European sensuality, she had a sweetness that set her apart from contemporaries such as the bombshell Brigitte Bardot or the edgier Anna Karina. “She wasn’t a hippie,” the journalist Marisa Meltzer writes in her new biography, “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Girl-Life-Legacy-Jane-Birkin/dp/1668060280\">It Girl: The Life and Legacy of Jane Birkin</a>” (Atria), “but rather a rising star from the upper class,” someone who radiated privilege even when she dressed down. One of the first celebrities to be regularly photographed in her everyday clothes, Birkin was an early icon of street style, traipsing around Paris in sneakers and rumpled sweaters, wicker basket in hand. The outfits could be easily mimicked and therefore easily marketed. Today, when social-media influencers praise “the French-girl look”—wispy bangs, minimal makeup, bluejeans, <i>marinière</i> tops—the look they have in mind is hers.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2025\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Discover notable new fiction, nonfiction, and poetry.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2025\">\n        <picture class=\"ResponsiveImagePicture-cGZhnX jwYQWO ExternalLinkEmbedResponsiveImage-iLQTTl fltlts responsive-image\">\n          <graphic alt=\"\" class=\"ResponsiveImageContainer-eNxvmU cfBbTk responsive-image__image\" srcset=\"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/678fbdcfca68512c6e8002f3/1:1/w_120,c_limit/books-2025-site-share.gif 120w\" sizes=\"100vw\" src=\"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/678fbdcfca68512c6e8002f3/1:1/w_200%2Cc_limit/books-2025-site-share.gif\"/>\n        </picture>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Birkin, Meltzer writes, was “nonchalance personified.” If this was not exactly an illusion, neither was it the whole story. A lifelong depressive, Birkin often thought about—and at least once attempted—suicide. Her diaries, two volumes of which have been published, reveal a wonderful writer, lyrical and self-lacerating. They also reveal her struggles with the costs and compromises of the It Girl role, how it left her feeling as though she had—as she puts it in Varda’s film—“no exceptional talents” to offset her fast-fleeting youth. What Birkin did have is je ne sais quoi, to her misfortune as much as to her advantage. After all, being famous for your ineffable qualities is perilously close to being famous for no reason.</p>\n<p>Jane Mallory Birkin was born in London on December 14, 1946. Her father, David Birkin, came from a well-heeled military family. During his time in the Royal Navy, he helped support the French Resistance, smuggling members of de Gaulle’s government-in-exile between Dartmouth and the Brittany coast. Judy Campbell, Jane’s mother, was a film and theatre actress, a close collaborator of Noël Coward’s, and enough of a celebrity that, according to Birkin, when she and David married their wedding was filmed by a news crew. Although she worked steadily until her death, in 2004, the demands of raising three children—Jane, along with her older brother, Andrew, and her younger sister, Linda—took a toll on Campbell’s career. “My father swore that she could go on as an actress,” Jane recalled. “Promises, promises!”</p>\n<p>All three Birkin siblings went into the arts. Andrew became a screenwriter and director, Linda a sculptor. Their childhood was happy, though Jane had the requisite dismal experience at an English boarding school, where she lasted three years before her parents let her come home. In the early pages of her diaries, begun when she was ten, she is serious and introspective. “Am I really alive?” she wonders. “Is this all a dream?” Some days later: “I feel fed up, I don’t want to dance, don’t want to do anything. It’s horrid, everything is horrid. I feel like a lump of coal on the side of the road, a very busy road.”</p>\n<p>At fifteen, Jane became smitten with a middle-aged man named Alan, an “arty type” who lived across the street from her, in Chelsea. David Birkin let his daughter spend time at Alan’s apartment, certain he could see everything from the family’s balcony. Then Alan moved. “He invited me to his place, a basement,” Jane would say later.</p>\n<p>Afterward, Birkin wrote a poem called “Suicide Lost,” in which she presents herself as “a child who’s frightened to live . . . a person who can’t find a way out.” If Alan was the first arty, abusive man to whom she found herself drawn, he would by no means be the last.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/09/22/it-girl-the-life-and-legacy-of-jane-birkin-marisa-meltzer-book-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In <i>Waska</i>, the Ecuadorian filmmaker Boloh Miranda and the Kichwa filmmaker Elizabeth Swanson Andi capture Gualinga reflecting on the forms of extractivism and commodification imposed on her people from the world beyond it. This includes their territory, long exploited by oil companies and the Ecuadorian government, and spiritual traditions in the form of hayakwaska (ayahuasca), increasingly <a href=\"https://aeon.co/videos/for-an-amazonian-female-shaman-ayahuasca-ceremonies-are-a-rite-and-a-business\">marketed to tourists</a> who lack a connection to the sacred traditions surrounding it.</p>\n    <p>In voiceovers and in conversation with members of her community, Gualinga draws a connection between ancestral and spiritual knowledge and Sarayaku’s long resistance to oil companies, whose incursions threaten both territory and tradition. In doing so, the film reveals the ways in which environmental justice and Indigenous rights struggles are profoundly intertwined, as well as the deep resilience of the Sarayaku people.</p>\n

    "body": "<p>If you happened to be at the right place in southern Mexico in the early 1980s, you might have encountered a strange-looking hill poking up from a thick tropical jungle. Covered in trees, it was known as ‘El Chichón’, the Spanish slang word for a small bump.</p>\n<p>At the time, few realised the hill was a volcano, and those who did never expected it to do anything, since no activity had been observed in centuries. All that changed in the spring of 1982.</p>\n<p>El Chichón in 1974. Note the regular hilltop. Photo by Paul Damon/CC BY-NC-ND 4.0</p>\n<p>Back then, volcanoes were in the zeitgeist. Two years prior, the Mount Saint Helens volcano in the United States spectacularly blew half of its flank away. It would go down as one of the most iconic and studied eruptions in history, and an inflection point for modern volcanology. The fact that the blast was sideways was unexpected and killed 57 people, but the eruption itself was anticipated through monitoring, and authorities evacuated more than 2,000 people in advance.</p>\n<p>El Chichón, by contrast, caught everybody by surprise, with three separate explosive phases. It measured 5 on the volcanic explosivity index (VEI), which describes eruption scale – the same as Mt St Helens, as well as <a href=\"https://aeon.co/videos/from-eruption-to-obliteration-the-sights-and-sounds-of-48-fateful-hours-in-pompeii\">Vesuvius in 79 CE</a>. Hot avalanches of rock, ash and gas flattened whole swaths of the jungle, setting off fires, damming rivers and destroying buildings. Ash from the explosions covered regions 70 km away, collapsing roofs and creating mudflows (lahars), and volcanic particles even reached Guatemala. Little was known about the number of people living in this region at the time, but it is thought that at least 2,000 died and 20,000 were made homeless in Mexico’s worst volcanic disaster in modern times.</p>\n<p>In 2006, I found myself looking down over El Chichón’s kilometre-wide crater. While I was retrieving samples from the hot, bubbling, acidic lake, which alternated from cyan blue to emerald green throughout the year, the ground shook as the geothermal gases fought their way to the surface – an unsettling reminder that I was in the crater of a very active volcano. The trip was one of my most formative life experiences, and one story a local told me has stayed with me ever since. When the 1982 eruption began, their relatives had sought shelter in the village church from the heavy ash and pumice rain. They were found weeks later, along with dozens of other villagers – all dead under the collapsed roof, crushed under the weight of ash.</p>\n<p>Church in the village of Naranjo, located about 8 km south of El Chichón, 2 June 1982.

Photo supplied by the author</p>\n<p>The striking contrast between El Chichón’s peaceful appearance and its devastating history taught me that volcanoes often conceal their potential beneath a deceptive calm. And it’s not the only volcano to hide its true power – they are not as rare as one might think. Around 75 per cent of eruptions with an explosivity of VEI 5 (like El Chichón) were preceded by at least a century of silence. That percentage is even higher – 90 per cent – for volcanoes ranked VEI 6, which are 10 times more powerful<strong>. </strong>And in volcanic regions like the Pacific islands, South America and Indonesia, we can expect explosivity <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00445-022-01605-0\">every</a> seven to 10 years from a volcano with <i>no</i> previously recorded eruption.</p>\n<p>Volcanoes can have severe impacts worldwide: grounding aircraft, disrupting trade routes, altering the climate</p>\n<p>Yet scientific attention remains unevenly distributed. For example, there have been more studies <a href=\"https://www.jvolcanica.org/ojs/index.php/volcanica/article/view/173\">published</a> about Mt St Helens alone (1,437 studies) than all 123 Indonesian volcanoes combined (~1,326 studies). And most volcanoes are not monitored: only around 600 of the 1,302 volcanoes <a href=\"http://www.frontiersin.org/journals/earth-science/articles/10.3389/feart.2024.1284889/full\">known</a> to be active during the Holocene are equipped with any monitoring instruments. This stark disparity is mirrored in the media and popular culture, which focus on examples like Yellowstone, Etna, Kīlauea or Vesuvius. With their stunning lava displays and hydrothermal emissions, these famous volcanoes may be providing the ultimate misdirection, causing us to focus on the wrong characters in the story of Earth’s relationship with humanity.</p>\n<p>As of 2015, at least 340 million people worldwide live within <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/8/341\">30 km</a> of an active or potentially active volcano. Considering global population growth of more than half a billion since then, this estimate is now likely far too conservative – a troubling indication of just how vulnerable millions remain to unexpected volcanic disasters. But you don’t need to live near a volcano to be vulnerable. It’s become clear in recent years that volcanoes can have severe impacts worldwide: grounding aircraft, disrupting trade routes, and altering the climate. Meanwhile, historical and archaeological analysis has implicated volcanoes in droughts, population declines and even societal collapse.</p>\n<p>Over the centuries, our understanding of volcanoes has evolved significantly, but we are still failing to prepare for the fact that the next world-changing eruption could come without warning, emerging from a small bump in a barely monitored jungle that has been quiet for centuries.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/hidden-volcanoes-are-we-ignoring-the-next-big-eruption?utm_source=rss-feed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The incident made him reconsider the years he had spent reporting on the lives cut short by gun violence — and the stress it had put on his body.</p>\n<p>\"For the first time really, I had to look deep and engage with what was truly bearing down on my heart,\" he says. \"And for me that had been more than a decade of telling stories of Black death and survival.\"</p>\n<p>As a reporter in Trenton, Philadelphia and New Orleans, Lee covered the deaths of young men who looked like him. The victims were \"wearing my same sneakers, same haircut,\" he says. \"And you have to wrestle with seeing yourself in some ways, repeatedly gunned down, your body repeatedly falling. Tears for your death over and over and again.\"</p>\n<p>Lee's new memoir, <i>A Thousand Ways to Die: The True Cost of Violence on Black Life in America</i>, is part history, and part personal turning point. He traces the bloody history Black Americans have with firearms, recalls gun violence in his own youth and follows his ancestors' path back to Ghana. </p>\n<p>The book reads like a plea for people to see the humanity of those lost to gun violence — and for this country to care enough to act.</p>\n<p>\"We have an opportunity and we still have this opportunity to be the great nation that we've professed,\" Lee says. \"I'm not a policy maker. I don't profess to be an expert in gun policy. But what I do believe is that until we break our lust for these guns, nothing will change.\"</p>\n<h3>Interview highlights</h3>\n<p>\n      <strong>On President Trump's comments about the violence in majority-Black cities</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Hearing the president talk about Chicago and Baltimore and other cities, and he goes on to talk about how people in these communities were \"<a href=\"https://x.com/barrie4council/status/1963252762944143506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1963252762944143506%7Ctwgr%5E2e3b618ba1118b0fcf9919e8b3992e510e09ea24%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theroot.com%2Fprofessor-why-trumps-born-to-be-criminals-comment-shou-2000060818\">born to be criminal[s</a>].\" The violence is innate, right? There's something in these people that makes them inherently violent, and the gun is just their tool. </p>\n<p>But I think one of the biggest things that people miss or don't fully understand is that there is a direct pipeline from a slew of places with super lax gun laws that are poured right into Chicago. And that every one of these guns starts legally. And so along the pipeline, from the factory to the wholesale market, to the retail market, to stores, to gun shows, there are all these places where guns are siphoned off by the so-called good guys with guns. And so while there is violence in Chicago and there is criminality in Chicago, there's criminality that happens long before then to allow these guns to pour into these cities in ecosystems and environments already [twisted] and bound by so much systemic violence and so much lack and so much hunger, and so much trauma that folks are carrying.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>On speaking to the mothers of Black men and boys who were shot and killed</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>There was this string of killings, starting with like Trayvon Martin, and I got close enough to the families where they trusted me to tell their stories. In the middle of all the noise, I had a direct line to most of these families. And the look in a mother's eyes in particular who has lost a son to murder or violence, it's like nothing you've ever seen. And I still see those eyes. I've never been able to remove those eyes, right? The pain that you see in them, the ocean of emotion welling up in them. And that no matter what we do, all the humanizing, all of the, you know, making sense of the systems and the police and the law and all those things will not bring their child back.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>On the importance of showing respect to the victims of violence</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>And the actual process of gathering the information for your report is also tough because you have ask dumb questions. \"What did you see? What did you hear? What was it like the last time you talked to them?\" Questions that are intrusive and at the worst moment in someone's life. And then you're asking for a picture, right? And then, you're over there talking to the police.</p>\n<p>There's something exploitative by nature: I'm getting so much more out of this than you are. But I always wanted to do it humanely and with great respect. And then you have to take that back to the newsroom. And I literally had an editor once — it was after a shooting and one young person was killed and I think another one was wounded — and he said, \"Oh, that's just a garden-variety killing.\" He described the killing of a young teenager. And mind you, we don't have any context to the situation. ... We don't know how, why, who. We don't anything. But this was so routine that it wasn't worth covering. \"Don't worry about it, it's garden variety.\"</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>On struggling with the notion of \"objectivity\"</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/15/nx-s1-5539315/trymaine-lee-a-thousand-ways-to-die\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Since then, he's written 12 poetry collections, including 2025's <i>Into the Hush</i>.</p>\n    <p>In 2006, Sze became the poet laureate of Santa Fe, where he's lived for a long time. In 2015, he was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.

    "body": "<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n<p>If you’ve recently stopped paying attention to Bitcoin, now might be the time to tune back in. Behind the noise of regulatory headlines and fluctuating prices, a significant trend is emerging — smart money is quietly returning to the market. Specifically, Bitcoin ‘sharks’ — wallets holding between 10 and 1,000 BTC — have scooped up over <strong>65,000 BTC</strong> in just the past week. This surge in accumulation is far from random; it mirrors the stealth accumulation phases of previous cycles, notably at times when market sentiment was at its lowest and opportunity was at its highest.</p>\n<p>This pattern of accumulation by savvy mid-sized investors reveals a recurring theme in the lifecycle of Bitcoin: while the broader public remains uncertain or distracted, those with deeper insight and capital move strategically. This type of activity has preceded nearly every major bull run in the past decade. It’s often the precursor to the explosive phases in market cycles, long before retail traders catch on or mainstream outlets start covering the story.</p>\n<p>Despite Bitcoin’s recent sideways movement — a frustrating range for many retail investors — it’s critical to differentiate between price action and underlying fundamentals. Prices may seem stagnant, but activity within the blockchain tells a more nuanced and compelling story. The silent, persistent accumulation by wallets in the 'shark' category hints at growing conviction among institutional players and high-net-worth individuals. That’s not a signal to ignore; it’s one to investigate.</p>\n<p>Take a look back to early 2020, in the months following the COVID market crash. Bitcoin experienced a significant drop, and sentiment hit rock bottom. But what happened next was both telling and profitable for those paying attention. While many stayed on the sidelines, waiting for recovery, data revealed an uptick in accumulation by experienced crypto investors. Fast forward six to nine months, and Bitcoin was breaking through all-time highs, eventually soaring past the $60,000 mark. That accumulation phase offered a golden entry point — but only to those who recognized it while fear dominated the headlines.</p>\n<p>Today, a similar setup appears to be brewing.</p>\n<h2>Contrarian Opportunity: Betting Against the Crowd</h2>\n<p>Seasoned investors understand that public sentiment can often serve as a backward-looking indicator. In most cases, when confidence is low and narratives lean heavily bearish, the opportunity for value investing reaches its peak. Right now, various narratives dominate crypto conversations: the threat of regulation, shifting Federal Reserve policies, sticky inflation, and potential recession risks. While these concerns are valid, they often cause less experienced investors to retreat. But smart money behaves differently — it leverages fear to enter the market at a discount.</p>\n<p>Blockchain analytics provide a contrasting perspective, one that cuts through emotional noise. Key on-chain indicators are showing bullish signs: exchange reserves are falling, indicating that fewer coins are being sent to centralized exchanges for sale. Post-halving dynamics are kicking in, leading to reduced miner sell pressure. At the same time, long-term holders (LTHs) — wallets that haven’t moved their BTC holdings for months or even years — are showing increased conviction by continuing to hold rather than take profits.</p>\n<p>These combined metrics suggest a hidden strength in the Bitcoin network. When exchange reserves go down while long-term holding behavior intensifies, it often sets the stage for a supply squeeze. Pair that with increasing accumulation among wallets with high BTC balances, and you have the makings of another substantial rally — perhaps not imminent, but certainly in development.</p>\n<p>Institutional interest also appears to be on the rebound. Reports of new applications for Bitcoin ETFs, corporate treasury allocations, and growing interest in crypto hedge funds all support the thesis of quiet acceptance and adoption, even in the face of macroeconomic challenges. Institutions may not always be fast movers, but when they deploy capital, it's typically with an eye toward long-term appreciation, not short-term speculation.</p>\n<h2>Positioning Forward: What's the Play?</h2>\n<p>For retail investors seeking asymmetric upside in the next 12 to 18 months, the current phase may represent a timely entry. While no one can predict short-term price movements with certainty, historical data shows that accumulation periods with muted sentiment often coincide with the early phases of strong multi-month or even multi-year rallies.</p>\n<p>One strategy to consider is a disciplined <strong>Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)</strong> approach. Rather than trying to time the perfect bottom — a near impossible feat — DCA allows investors to reduce the impact of volatility while steadily building exposure. Implementing this during periods of on-chain accumulation has historically outperformed lump sum investing, particularly in bear and early bull markets.</p>\n<p>Beyond Bitcoin, other segments of the digital asset ecosystem appear primed for potential outsized gains. Several undervalued <strong>Layer 2 networks</strong> — including those improving Bitcoin’s scalability and utility — are gaining traction. Protocols focusing on Bitcoin-native DeFi solutions and scaling innovations could become the next growth areas as the broader market regains bullish momentum.</p>\n<p>Additionally, <strong>Bitcoin mining equities</strong> present a potentially lucrative play. Many firms in this space have restructured balance sheets, optimized operations, and are now benefiting from lower input costs post halving. In past bull markets, Bitcoin miner stocks have displayed higher beta than BTC itself, meaning they often rally harder and faster in the early stages of an uptrend.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bitcoin-sharks-buy-65k-btc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Every day brings new developments and opportunities in the fast-moving world of cryptocurrency. Whether you're an experienced <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/crypto-investor/\">crypto investor</a> looking to fine-tune your portfolio or a curious newcomer exploring ways to diversify your holdings, our daily digest is your premier source for market intelligence, data insights, and curated news stories that truly matter. We’re focused on delivering updates that help you stay one step ahead, identify profitable trends early, and manage risk with greater confidence in this ever-evolving digital asset space.</p>\n<p>The crypto markets have been anything but quiet this past week. Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines, having reclaimed the $115,000 price level amid a new wave of institutional capital flowing into Ethereum ETFs. This resurgence in large-scale buying activity suggests increasing confidence in the long-term growth of digital assets, particularly as traditional finance continues to integrate blockchain-based products into their offerings. Ethereum has benefited tremendously in recent days, with investors reacting to the approval and launch of new Ether-based exchange-traded funds that are already seeing high demand. The positive sentiment spilled over into the altcoin market, where several Layer-1 and DeFi tokens also registered double-digit gains.</p>\n<p>While the price performance has been impressive, it's important to understand the macro drivers behind this momentum. For a deeper dive, check out our guide on the characteristics of a <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bull-market/\">crypto bull market</a> and how investor psychology plays a key role in shaping price trends. Bear in mind, volatility remains elevated, so risk management should remain a top priority, even during upside rallies.</p>\n<p>Technical indicators are showing mixed results, with relative strength indexes (RSIs) approaching overbought territory on some leading coins, and funding rates on derivatives markets rising—a sign that leverage is coming back into play. While bulls may still be in control for now, caution is advised. Keep an eye on macro triggers such as interest rate decisions, regulatory shifts, and ETF inflows in the coming week.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>\"Web3 IPOs Remain Hot: Gemini’s 20X Oversubscription and Figure’s 24% Opening Surge Spark Investor Mania\"</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The Web3 investment narrative continues to gain traction as institutional and retail investors pour capital into blockchain-native projects making their way to public markets. Gemini, a long-standing pillar in the crypto space co-founded by the Winklevoss twins, recently saw its pre-IPO raise oversubscribed by a staggering 20 times. This signals incredibly strong demand for equity in companies operating at the forefront of crypto innovation.</p>\n<p>Not to be outdone, blockchain financial services firm Figure made headlines with an explosive debut, jumping 24% on its first day of trading. These IPO successes are not isolated—they point to a larger movement within the altcoin and decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. With more companies exploring blockchain integration and revenue decentralization, the traditional venture capital model is evolving. Tokenization, DAOs, and hybrid equity-token instruments are redefining how early-stage projects fundraise while giving broader investor access across geographical boundaries.</p>\n<p>These IPO trends also suggest a new phase of maturity in the Web3 space. As regulation becomes more defined, and investor protections improve through mechanisms such as smart contracts and on-chain audits, more traditional investors are becoming comfortable participating in blockchain-native equity plays. This transition could accelerate institutional inclusion in sectors such as crypto gaming, NFTs, decentralized infrastructure, and beyond. For a deeper dive into this evolving market dynamic, don’t miss our full report.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Top Gainers:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>RWA Tokens:</strong>Real World Asset (RWA) tokens posted an impressive rally this week, gaining 11% amidst broader DeFi strength. The surge was driven by increased interest in tokenizing physical assets such as real estate, art, and commodities. Institutional investors are finally warming up to the concept of on-chain ownership for traditionally illiquid assets.</li>\n      <li><strong>DOGE CleanCore Reserve:</strong>Dogecoin made headlines as the CleanCore treasury crossed the halfway mark in its goal of accumulating a 1 billion DOGE reserve. This fundamental milestone reflects growing community-driven financial engineering within meme coins, steering the narrative beyond simple internet satire toward serious utility and performance tracking.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <strong>Top Losers:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Bitcoin Momentum Indicators Turn Bearish:</strong>Analysts are closely watching technical charts as 8 out of 10 major<a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/history-of-bitcoin-bull-bear-market/\">Bitcoin bull market indicators</a>have turned bearish.

Inside was an American flag that had flown over the Capitol — sent as a gesture of appreciation for Xie Xide, the renowned Chinese scientist who had recently died. Xie had played a key role in fostering cultural and scientific exchanges between the two countries.</p>\n<p>Stories like this are almost inconceivable today in both the United States and China, as the tone of their bilateral relations has fundamentally shifted. But in the new book, <a href=\"https://cup.columbia.edu/book/chinese-encounters-with-america/9780231217194/\"> Chinese Encounters with America: Journeys That Shaped the Future of China</a>, profiles of 12 Chinese individuals remind us of the optimism that once defined the two countries' engagement. This optimism has faded away in recent years. </p>\n<p>The dozen profiles in this edited volume highlight the positive aspects of U.S.-China exchange, which began in earnest after diplomatic relations were established in 1979. These accounts range from academics like Xie Xide, to environmental activists like Ma Tianjie, and diplomats like <a href=\"https://apnews.com/general-news-f3ada042a03faf8523ff08d270e5e051\">Ji Chaozhu</a>, who served as an interpreter during President Richard Nixon's historic visit to Beijing in 1972.</p>\n<p>Today, as the U.S. and China find themselves in a period of intense competition, these stories may be interpreted differently, depending on the reader's own views on the once-popular engagement policy. Nevertheless, they serve as a reminder of a unique chapter in bilateral relations, however brief it may have been.</p>\n<p>The book's co-editors, Deborah Davis — a leading sociologist on China — and Terry Lautz, author of <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/americans-in-china-9780197512838\"> Americans in China</a>, argue that the book underscores the value of finding common ground. They express concern that both Americans and Chinese are losing sight of their shared interests and the benefits that have come from cooperation.</p>\n<p>In an email exchange with NPR, the editors sent joint responses to questions about the issues addressed in the book. Here is an edited version of the exchange.</p>\n<p><strong>NPR: You said you were concerned that both Americans and Chinese had lost sight of their shared interests. Why, in your view, did this happen?  </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Davis and Lautz:</strong> China's unexpected arrival as a major economic and military power triggered a downward spiral in the U.S.-China relations. Washington saw China's ascent and its hardline diplomacy as a challenge to the existing world order. Beijing viewed the United States as a threat to its interests, especially the PRC's claim to the island of Taiwan. This new power dynamic undermined the long-held assumption that Sino-American engagement would lead to positive, peaceful change. Instead, it produced a climate of fear and distrust. The aim of our book is to show the benefits of cooperation and mutual understanding despite our differences.</p>\n<p><strong>NPR: In short, how has encountering the U.S. changed these individuals —  and China itself?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Davis and Lautz: </strong>The impact varies over time. Those who returned to an impoverished China during the Cold War faced different challenges and had different motives from those who returned in the 1990s or 2000s when China was more open politically and prosperous. The consequences of their encounters also vary by occupation — from education, dance, and diplomacy to civil society, science, and sports.</p>\n<p>Their life stories are remarkable. For example, Xie Xide, a renowned physicist who received her PhD from MIT in 1951, became the first woman president of a major Chinese research university in 1983. But she also spent years cleaning floors during the Cultural Revolution. Wang Jisi, one of China's most prominent America watchers, spent seven years herding sheep in Inner Mongolia during the Cultural Revolution before entering Peking University in 1978. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/olympics/news/story?id=3726969\">Lang Ping</a>, a Chinese sports icon, coached the U.S. women's volleyball team to a silver medal at the Beijing 2008 Olympics, and then led China's team to gold at the 2014 World Championships. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2007/07/04/6647713/pianist-has-passion-for-performing-new-music\">Peng-Peng Gong</a> was trained at the Juilliard School in New York but walked away from a lucrative career as an international concert pianist and returned to China as the resident composer of the Shanghai Philharmonic Orchestra in 2014.

    "body": "<h3>By Maria Popova</h3>\n<p>On July 26, 2022, as I was living through a period of acute loneliness despite being a naturally solitary person, NASA <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/solar-system/nasas-lro-finds-lunar-pits-harbor-comfortable-temperatures/\">reported</a> that computer modeling of data from its Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) had revealed several cylindrical pits on the Moon with just the right shape to be shaded just the right amount to offer shelter from the extremes of the lunar surface. Because the Moon has no atmosphere to act as its thermostat, its temperature fluctuates dramatically as it faces and turns away from the Sun, rising to 260°F (about 127°C) in the daytime and plummeting to -280°F (about -173°C) at night. But these unique nooks, which are most likely collapsed lava tubes, are a cozy 63°F (17°C) inside — he feeling-tone of a crisp autumn day in Brooklyn, where I live. Images from the LRO suggested that these pits might unfold into caves that would make perfect sites for lunar exploration — campsites with a stable temperature, more protected from cosmic rays, solar radiation, and micrometeorites. </p>\n<p>There is something poetic in knowing that we evolved in caves and might one day inhabit caves on another celestial body, having invented the means to get there with the imagination that bloomed over millions of years in the lonely bone cave of the mind.</p>\n<p>There is also something poetic in knowing that as we fantasize about leaving for the Moon, the Moon is leaving us.</p>\n<p>The prolific English astronomer Edmund Halley first began suspecting this disquieting fact in the early 18th century after analyzing ancient eclipse records. Nobody believed him — the Moon looked so steady, so unlosable. It took a quarter millennium for his theory to be vindicated: When <i>Apollo</i> astronauts placed mirrors on the lunar surface and when laser beams were beamed a them from Earth, it was revealed that the Moon is indeed drifting away from us, at the precise rate of 3.8 centimeters per year — more than half the rate at which a child grows.</p>\n<p>The Moon is leaving us because of the gravitational conversation between it and the Earth: the ocean tides. The drag they cause slows down the planet’s spin rate. Because gravity binds the Moon and the Earth, as the Earth loses angular momentum, the Moon overcompensates in response; as it speeds up, it begins slipping out of our gravitational grip, slowly moving away from us.</p>\n<p>We know this thanks to Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity — the revelation that space is not flat, time is not absolute, and spacetime is a single fabric along the curvature of which everything, including light, moves.</p>\n<p>I thought of Einstein, who at sixteen, lonely and introverted, began wondering about the nature of the universe by imagining himself chasing a beam of light through outer space; I thought of the poet Rainer Maria Rilke, also lonely and also dedicated to the light, who at the same time was formulating his general theory of love as <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/06/29/rilke-letters-to-a-young-poet-macy-barrows/\">“two solitudes that protect, border, and greet each other.”</a> And I thought about how love is simply the solitary light between people, neither partitioned nor merged but shared, to light up the sliver of spacetime we have each been allotted before returning our borrowed stardust to the universe.</p>\n<p>Somehow it all felt like a children’s book that didn’t yet exist. So I wrote it, having always believed that every good children’s book is a work of philosophy in disguise, a field guide to the mystery we are a part of and the mystery we are — in the language of children, which is the language of curiosity and unselfconscious sincerity, such books speak the most timeless truths to the truest parts of us by asking the simplest, deepest questions to help us understanding the world and understanding ourselves so that we may be more fully alive.</p>\n<p>By one of those wrinkles in time and chance that we call luck, shortly after I sent the manuscript to my friend Claudia at <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/tag/enchanted-lion/\">Enchanted Lion Books</a>, I received a lovely note from a stranger named <a href=\"https://www.thesarahjacoby.com\">Sarah Jacoby</a> in response to my essay about <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/08/28/margaret-wise-brown-michael-strange-poems/\">Margaret Wise Brown’s complicated love with Michael Strange</a>. Sarah told me that she too had fallen under the spell of their singular love while illustrating <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/12/12/the-important-thing-about-margaret-wise-brown/\">a picture-book biography</a> of Margaret. I ordered it and, enchanted by Sarah’s soulful watercolors and tender creatures, spontaneously invited her to illustrate my lunar story of loneliness and love on nothing more than an instinct of creative kinship. She must have felt it too because, felicitously, she said “yes.”</p>\n<p>And so <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Coziest-Place-Moon-Maria-Popova/dp/1592704379/?tag=braipick-20\">The Coziest Place on the Moon</a> (</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/1499654611\">) was born.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>This is how it begins:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>It was on a Tuesday in July that Re woke up feeling like the loneliest creature on Earth and decided to go live in the coziest place on the Moon.</p>\n      <p>At exactly 7:26 — a pretty number, a pretty hour — Re mounted a beam of light and sailed into space.</p>\n      <p>It took exactly 1.255 seconds, because light travels at the speed of dreams, to land exactly where Re wanted to land.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>Across Sarah’s enchanted spacescapes, Re has a surprising encounter that takes the story to where it always wanted to go — a reckoning with how to bear our loneliness and what it really means to love.</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t—<br/>\n\t\t\tPublished September 12, 2025<br/>\n\t\t\t—<br/>\n\t\t\thttps://www.themarginalian.org/2025/09/12/the-coziest-place-on-the-moon/<br/>\n\t\t\t—\n\t\t</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2025/09/12/the-coziest-place-on-the-moon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>The cryptocurrency market is widely known for its volatility and unpredictability, making many traditional investors wary. However, for the <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/contrarian-investor/\">contrarian investor</a>, this volatility can represent significant opportunity rather than deterrence. Beneath the surface of public doubt, institutional capital continues to flow into digital assets, regulatory perspectives evolve, and new use cases emerge at an accelerating pace. Contrarians recognize that when the market is fearful or confused, it often fails to price in game-changing shifts. In this article, we delve into underappreciated crypto catalysts and investment angles that lie just outside of the mainstream narrative but hold the keys to potentially asymmetric growth.</p>\n<h2>Analyzing Performance Disparities Among Crypto-Related Companies</h2>\n<p>Investing directly in cryptocurrencies can be rewarding but comes with a unique risk profile due to price swings, regulatory ambiguity, and custody challenges. Alternatively, investors are turning their attention to publicly traded companies that offer exposure to the crypto economy—some overtly, others more subtly.</p>\n<p>Companies like <strong>MicroStrategy (MSTR)</strong>, which has aggressively built a Bitcoin-centric treasury strategy, have often outperformed during bull runs. With Michael Saylor’s leadership and the strategic pivot into holding BTC as a reserve asset, MSTR became a proxy for large-scale Bitcoin exposure. However, several other firms, such as <strong>Coinbase (COIN)</strong>, present mixed opportunities. While Coinbase remains the most trusted centralized exchange in North America and operates a highly secure platform, it also continually finds itself entangled with regulatory action from the SEC and other agencies, resulting in greater volatility in its stock value.</p>\n<p>In contrast, companies like <strong>Block Inc. (SQ)</strong> have quietly expanded their blockchain ambitions. Block isn’t just enabling Bitcoin transactions through Cash App; it’s also exploring decentralized financial (DeFi) infrastructure, stablecoin payment options, and hardware wallet integrations—all with far less public scrutiny. These firms reveal how crypto-centric innovation can exist in firms labeled as “fintech” rather than “crypto native.”</p>\n<p>Savvy investors can assess which companies are undervalued by analyzing treasury allocations, crypto-related patent activity, and product development roadmaps. Early recognition of blockchain integration or tokenized asset support can offer position advantages far ahead of public recognition.</p>\n<h2>Understanding the Impact of SEC Decisions on Crypto ETFs</h2>\n<p>The prospect of a spot crypto ETF has hung over the digital asset space like a cloud for years. Grayscale, Bitwise, and other major asset managers have submitted ETF applications only to face repeated delays or rejections from the SEC. However, the tide may be turning. Grayscale’s court victory concerning its GBTC product marks a symbolic and legal milestone that could pave the way for broader ETF approvals.</p>\n<p>The rationale behind a spot Bitcoin ETF is simple: it allows institutional-grade investment exposure via traditional brokerage accounts, removing complications related to wallets, private keys, and direct exchange risk. This ease of access could unlock billions—potentially trillions—of dollars that remain on the sidelines awaiting regulatory clarity. From pension funds and family offices to global asset managers, the demand for direct BTC exposure is ripe for realization once the SEC greenlights these vehicles.</p>\n<p>Forward-looking investors are already adjusting their strategies. Investment in ETF-adjacent products, like <strong>Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)</strong>, which often trades at a discount to NAV, serves as a speculative bridge between now and spot ETF approval. Additionally, infrastructure providers—firms involved in custody, compliance, blockchain analytics, and ETF administration—stand to benefit exponentially from a legitimized crypto investment sector. Gain deeper insights by consulting our complete analysis on the <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bitcoin-etf/\">Bitcoin spot ETF landscape</a>.</p>\n<h2>Evaluating Price Trends and Adoption Metrics of XRP</h2>\n<p>Ripple's native token, <strong>XRP</strong>, remains one of the most debated digital assets in the crypto market. Often overshadowed by high-profile legal proceedings with the SEC, XRP’s real-world adoption is quietly gaining momentum. Far from being purely speculative, XRP is increasingly functioning as utility currency for cross-border payment corridors, especially in emerging markets.</p>\n<p>Ripple Labs has formed strategic alliances with financial institutions in Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and Latin America to facilitate near-instant remittance platforms. These platforms are powered by on-chain liquidity tools and tokenization APIs that streamline complex, costly international banking operations. In jurisdictions where SWIFT services are slow or unreliable, XRP offers an actionable alternative. On-chain data substantiates this shift: the number of unique wallets interacting with the ledger continues to rise, along with transaction throughput and settlement volume.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, as global regulatory frameworks—especially in Europe and Asia—begin to offer more clarity than the U.S., XRP's position as a compliance-friendly solution is strengthening. Investors would be prudent to look beyond legal noise and focus on functional adoption metrics. Currency liquidity, regulatory environment, wallet size distribution, and repeat transaction frequency all support the case for a long-term value proposition that isn't just speculative—it’s operational.</p>\n<h2>Leveraging Mergers for Investment Growth in the Crypto Market</h2>\n<p>Mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) represent another under-discussed avenue of crypto market exposure. These strategic consolidations are reshaping how fintech and blockchain ecosystems are forming next-gen financial networks.</p>\n<p>Consider the recent merger of Asset Entities with Strive—a firm that announced a $1.5 billion BTC treasury strategy. Unlike buying crypto outright, exposure through merged entities offers investors potential equity-style upside without direct digital asset custody. These deals are often undervalued in initial stages, since traditional analysts may not fully understand the implications of a booming treasury or blockchain-engineered operational model.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/profitable-crypto-investing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>AltcoinInvestor.com Weekly Update: A Deep Dive into the Latest Crypto Market News &amp; Trends</strong>\n    </p>\n<h2>Opening Note</h2>\n<p>Welcome back to another edition of the AltcoinInvestor Weekly Update. As we step into a new week in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, it's crucial to pause for a moment and review the developments that just unfolded. Each week brings with it a wave of innovation, price movement, regulation updates, and of course, new investment opportunities. This week is no different, and we're here to guide you through everything you need to know to stay ahead of the curve in your crypto journey.</p>\n<p>Whether you're holding strong in Bitcoin, actively trading altcoins, or exploring decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, it's important to understand the larger market dynamics. Let's unravel the numbers, the narratives, and the nuances that shaped the crypto markets this week.</p>\n<h2>Market Recap</h2>\n<p>The cryptocurrency market saw another eventful week marked by periods of volatility, consolidation trends, and a slew of updates from both major and emerging blockchain projects. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of how the top digital assets performed:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Bitcoin (BTC)</strong><strong>:</strong>Bitcoin displayed relative strength despite widespread volatility in the market. BTC hovered around the $55,000 zone for much of the week, highlighting a critical support range that bulls are defending. Continued institutional interest and spot ETF discussions remain catalysts for potential price action.</li>\n      <li><strong>Ethereum (ETH):</strong>The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap saw price consolidation around the $3,500 level. The Ethereum network continues to benefit from increased layer-2 deployment and DeFi application usage. Developers have also been discussing potential upgrades to improve scalability and reduce gas fees, which may impact ETH's price in the medium term.</li>\n      <li><strong>Altcoins</strong><strong>:</strong>This week saw mixed performance across the altcoin market. While some tokens recorded double-digit gains, others experienced selloffs, reminding investors of the high volatility inherent to altcoin investing. Trends indicate a rotation into mid-cap tokens with utility in AI, gaming, and tokenization sectors.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Overall, once again, we’re reminded that the crypto sector is a dynamic and ever-evolving marketplace. Staying on top of weekly price movements can help identify both short-term trading opportunities and long-term investment themes.</p>\n<h2>Featured Insight: Regulatory Impact on Crypto Trends</h2>\n<p>The regulatory environment remains one of the most influential forces shaping the future of the digital asset space. Globally, we continue to see regulatory frameworks emerge, with countries taking varying approaches to classification, taxation, and adoption of cryptocurrencies. Regulatory clarity (or lack thereof) can significantly impact investor sentiment, market liquidity, and project legitimacy.</p>\n<p>In the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) remains a key player. The commission’s actions regarding Bitcoin ETFs, DeFi crackdowns, and stablecoin scrutiny underline the weight of regulation in this ecosystem. This week’s deferral on major ETF decisions (highlighted in the news section below) is just one more example of the power regulators hold over market momentum.</p>\n<p>In parallel, countries like Belarus and Hong Kong are exploring ways to embrace crypto technologies to counterbalance economic sanctions or stimulate financial innovation. These geopolitical movements demonstrate that crypto is increasingly intertwined with global economic policy and strategic planning.</p>\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/crypto-investor/\">crypto investor</a>, it is essential to assess the regulatory backdrop before making high-risk investments, especially in tokens associated with DeFi, privacy coins, and non-KYC exchanges—as these are frequently singled out by regulators.</p>\n<h2>Top Gainers &amp; Losers: This Week's Standout Performers</h2>\n<p>With heightened volatility comes opportunities for savvy investors. Here's a look at the biggest winners and losers in the altcoin space this past week:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Top Gainer:</strong><a href=\"#\">Asset Entities</a>surged after announcing a strategic merger with Strive. What caught investors' attention was the subsequent formation of a $1.5 billion Bitcoin treasury acquisition plan. This move signals further integration of crypto into corporate balance sheets and could trigger similar moves by competing firms.</li>\n      <li><strong>Top Loser:</strong><a href=\"#\">Sol Strategies</a>took a heavy blow, dropping 42% on the Nasdaq, just days after QMMM’s parabolic 1,700% rally following speculative retail bets. The correction was a harsh reminder of how swiftly herd psychology in the market can shift. Ensure to perform due diligence before getting swept up in social trading trends.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>The divergence in performance among altcoins showcases the importance of diversification and constant monitoring. Keeping a balanced portfolio spread across market caps and sectors can mitigate extreme downside risk while allowing for upside exposure.</p>\n<h2>News Highlights: Key Developments You Should Know</h2>\n<p>The past week was rich in news that will likely have ripple effects across the crypto ecosystem. Here are the top developments:</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/altcoin-news-2025-09-12t21-50-11-786z/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n<h2>Bitcoin's MACD Golden Cross: More Than Just TA Magic?</h2>\n<p>As the cryptocurrency market navigates through a complex web of regulatory scrutiny, macroeconomic fears, and global tensions, Bitcoin (<strong>BTC</strong>) has quietly formed a bullish technical pattern that many seasoned traders view as significant—the elusive <strong>MACD golden cross</strong>. While retail sentiment remains cautious and broader markets wobble amid confusion, this rare momentum signal could be offering a glimpse into Bitcoin’s next major move: a potential rally targeting <strong>$160,000</strong> by October 2024. But can this technical pattern be trusted? Or is it yet another indicator that only the most informed will recognize in hindsight?</p>\n<h3>Understanding the MACD Golden Cross</h3>\n<p>The <strong>Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)</strong> indicator is a tool designed to capture momentum trends and signal potential reversals in price action. Derived from differences between shorter and longer-term moving averages, the MACD line and its corresponding signal line interact dynamically to offer insights into market momentum. A <strong>golden cross</strong> occurs specifically when the MACD line crosses above the signal line, suggesting an emerging bullish trend.</p>\n<p>The significance of the current MACD golden cross lies in its <i>weekly timeframe</i> appearance. Technical patterns hold greater weight when they materialize on higher timeframes, and weekly MACD crosses are generally considered more reliable than their daily or hourly counterparts. In past cycles, a weekly MACD golden cross on Bitcoin has often preceded strong upward trends. A notable example occurred in the second half of 2020, just ahead of BTC rallying from under $12,000 to nearly $70,000 in a matter of months.</p>\n<p>Importantly, the golden cross doesn’t act in a vacuum—it needs confirmation from broader context. And right now, that context appears increasingly favorable for bulls who are keeping a close watch on institutional flows, the supply-side dynamics of Bitcoin, and the upcoming halving event.</p>\n<h3>The Bigger Picture: Bullish Momentum Amid Market Skepticism</h3>\n<p>The current market is filled with uncertainty. Inflation remains sticky in major economies, central banks continue to deliberate interest rate policies, and geopolitical risks rage on—from regional conflicts to shifting trade alliances. All of this weighs heavily on risk assets, and Bitcoin is no exception. In fact, for many, the presence of continued Bitcoin consolidation and a sluggish altcoin sector suggests that crypto's bullish potential has stalled.</p>\n<p>Yet it is precisely during these periods of disbelief that the biggest moves historically begin. Bitcoin has frequently demonstrated a contrarian nature: <strong>when sentiment is at its weakest, the asset often begins to build strength beneath the surface</strong>.</p>\n<p>In late 2020, Bitcoin’s rally took off under similar circumstances. The COVID-19 pandemic had altered financial landscapes, risk appetite was depressed, and yet, Bitcoin doubled and then tripled before retail investors fully caught on. Could we be witnessing a similar setup today? The MACD golden cross says it’s possible.</p>\n<h3>Key Catalysts That Could Push Bitcoin Toward $160K</h3>\n<p>If we zoom out from the charts and examine the fundamental landscape, there are clear drivers that could catalyze a sharp move to higher prices—even reaching the ambitious $160,000 mark that some analysts are already projecting.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Institutional Accumulation:</strong>On-chain data continues to show a shift from speculative hands to long-term holders. The number of wallets holding 1,000+ BTC has steadily increased, signaling that larger players are accumulating quietly. Institutional interest is no longer just anecdotal; it’s visible in wallet behavior and transaction consistency. When large entities buy and hold in a sustained fashion, they effectively reduce circulating supply and increase price floor.</li>\n      <li><strong>Spot Bitcoin ETFs:</strong>Since the approval of U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs, flows into these financial products have been strong. These ETFs, managed by major Wall Street titans such as BlackRock and Fidelity, act as buying conduits into the market, creating consistent demand. A unique feature of spot ETFs is that they require direct BTC purchases to back shares issued to investors—resulting in a price-supporting mechanism that wasn’t present in previous cycles.</li>\n      <li><strong>Bitcoin Halving and Supply Shock:</strong>Slated for April 2024, the fourth Bitcoin halving will reduce mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. This built-in supply contraction means that fewer new bitcoins will enter circulation daily. If demand stays constant, or—more likely—increases due to broader acceptance and ETF inflows, basic economic principles indicate that prices should rise.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h3>Why the Market May Be Misreading the Signals</h3>\n<p>Markets operate not just on data, but on perception. While some are still calling for deeper corrections or citing macro headwinds as reasons to stay out of the market, savvy investors know that most bull markets begin amid confusion—<strong>not confidence</strong>.</p>\n<p>Technical-grade indicators like the MACD are not infallible, but they are widely followed by professional traders for good reason—they often signal regime changes. A weekly golden cross doesn’t guarantee a rally to new highs, but it greatly increases the probability of a sustained upward trend. Combined with other favorable metrics—like diminishing exchange balances, miner accumulation, and shrinking volatility—it paints a picture of a market ready to move.</p>\n<p>Another factor often overlooked: regulatory clarity. As governments increasingly seek to establish frameworks for crypto assets, institutional deployment may accelerate even further. Clarity breeds confidence, and with both the legal and financial infrastructure lining up, Bitcoin could act as a magnet for global capital outflows from traditional assets like bonds and fiat currencies.</p>\n<h3>Don’t Wait for the Perfect Entry</h3>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/btc-macd-golden-cross-160k/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n<h2>Bitcoin’s Supercycle: A Contrarian Opportunity at the Edge of Explosion</h2>\n<p>In the notoriously volatile and short-sighted world of cryptocurrencies, patterns emerge that only the sharpest investors can recognize before the crowd catches on. Right now, an increasing number of seasoned analysts and contrarian investors believe that Bitcoin is entering what’s being called a “<strong>supercycle ignition</strong>”—a rare structural phase in its market evolution that precedes a parabolic price action. If the projections pan out, Bitcoin’s price could eclipse its previous all-time high and skyrocket to <strong>$360,000 or more</strong>.</p>\n<p>While skeptics may label such bold predictions as excessive speculation, history tells us that the Bitcoin market has always rewarded those who took early, calculated risks in moments of disbelief. As traditional market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, those with a contrarian perspective see opportunity—a massive one at that—on the edge of an explosive cycle.</p>\n<h3>The Technical Catalyst: Inverse Head-and-Shoulders Pattern</h3>\n<p>In technical analysis, certain chart patterns serve as significant indicators of potential price movement. One such formation currently being watched closely is the <i>inverse head-and-shoulders</i> on Bitcoin's multi-year chart. This bullish reversal pattern consists of three troughs: a lower low (the head) flanked by two higher lows (the shoulders), separated by intermediary peaks that form a resistance line known as the “neckline.” For Bitcoin, that neckline is currently hovering just under its previous all-time high of $69,000.</p>\n<p>If Bitcoin breaks and sustains a move above that neckline level, it would mark the completion of this chart pattern. Historically, such a breakout has often led to massive price expansions. More specifically, technical projections based on the height of the pattern suggest a potential move to the <strong>$300,000–$360,000</strong> range, implying a return exceeding 400–500% from current levels.</p>\n<p>For traders and investors familiar with historical breakout patterns, the setup is becoming increasingly hard to ignore. It is not simply about watching lines on a chart—it's about observing repeated behaviors in market psychology, and acting before the crowd reacts.</p>\n<h3>Institutional Involvement: A New Demand Curve</h3>\n<p>Unlike previous bull runs dominated by retail enthusiasm and speculative mania, the current phase features a powerful new catalyst: <strong>institutional investment</strong>. Following the landmark approval of the first U.S. <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bitcoin-etf/\">Spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> in early 2024, major asset managers such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco have entered the crypto arena with serious capital.</p>\n<p>These institutions are not in it for short-term profits or meme coin thrills. Their participation indicates long-term strategic positioning. Since January 2024, cumulative net inflows to spot Bitcoin ETFs have exceeded <strong>$15 billion</strong>, a sum that continues to grow weekly. This sustained institutional demand is not only absorbing current supply, but creating the conditions for a long-lasting bull market that operates under a vastly different regime than those of the past.</p>\n<p>It’s important to understand how this transforms the market structure. Unlike retail investors who often panic sell during corrections, institutions typically follow structured allocation strategies and rebalancing schedules, adding stability to both demand and price floors. This shift in buyer profile hints at a more mature, sustainable cycle—again aligning with the supercycle theory where Bitcoin’s scarcity and macro appeal are finally converging.</p>\n<h3>Historical Precedence: When Doubters Missed Windfalls</h3>\n<p>To understand where Bitcoin may go, one must study where it’s been. Historical precedent provides strong validation for the supercycle thesis. Take the 2015 inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, for example. It appeared during the aftermath of the Mt. Gox collapse, one of the darkest times in Bitcoin history. Yet, within a few years, BTC went on to surge from $200 to nearly $20,000—a <strong>100x return</strong> for early believers.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to 2020, amid the early COVID-19 panic, when Bitcoin was again written off by mainstream analysts. At the time, bottoming patterns formed on the macro chart, and those paying attention accumulated heavily. The result? A meteoric rise from under $5,000 to nearly $70,000 in just 18 months.</p>\n<p>What’s consistent in each of these cases is not just the technical pattern—but the sentiment. Low confidence in the market, mixed narratives in media, and mainstream skepticism preceded Bitcoin's most explosive growth phases. This cycle seems no different. To dive deeper into the context of these previous patterns, explore the full <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/history-of-bitcoin-bull-bear-market/\">history of Bitcoin bull and bear markets</a> for the 2008–2024 timeframe.</p>\n<h3>Macro Forces: The Perfect Storm for Bitcoin</h3>\n<p>Beyond technicals and institutional flows, macroeconomic conditions are also aligning in Bitcoin’s favor. Sovereign debt spirals, de-dollarization trends, inflationary pressures, currency instability, and geopolitical tensions are pushing both individuals and institutions to seek safe-haven and alternative assets. Historically, gold was the go-to hedge—but in today’s digital-first world, Bitcoin is fast emerging as <strong>“digital gold 2.0.”</strong></p>\n<p>MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor continues to double down on such narratives, often suggesting that Bitcoin could attract trillions in capital simply by diverting small allocation percentages from traditional asset classes like real estate, bonds, and gold. If Saylor’s thesis plays out, even a fraction of that capital could send Bitcoin well above $360K.</p>\n<p>The strategic case for Bitcoin is no longer niche. Global investors are rapidly rethinking what it means to preserve value in an uncertain era, and Bitcoin’s capped supply and decentralized nature make it a compelling answer amid growing distrust in fiat systems.</p>\n<h3>How to Position for the Supercycle</h3>\n<p>Navigating a potential supercycle requires more than just optimism; it demands a disciplined and strategic investment approach.

    "body": "<p>Even benevolent producers who give directors total freedom to make films can’t quite do so, by dint of the fact that they’re giving it; the imbalance of power is built into their generosity. Freedom can only be taken, at a price, and, for Francis Ford Coppola, the price of freedom to make the grand-scale political fantasy “<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/megalopolis-is-francis-ford-coppolas-artistic-rejuvenation\">Megalopolis</a>” was a hundred and twenty million dollars, which he raised by selling off part of his winery. He’d been trying to make the movie for about thirty years. He finally got to shoot it in 2022 and 2023, when he was eighty-three. As if its production were a solution to a long-puzzling problem, he made sure to show his work: he invited the director Mike Figgis to the set, near Atlanta, to shoot a documentary about the film. The result, “Megadoc,” which opens September 19th, is a fascinating, inspiring view of a filmmaker whose methods are as boldly original as his movie.</p>\n<p>With “Megalopolis,” the first freedom that Coppola seized was the freedom to fail. “Megadoc” opens with Coppola admitting that he’s scared, which he calls “a really good thing”: “I’m doing something I <i>don’t</i> know how to do.” He’s investing his own money—but he’s not scared of losing it; if commercial failure is what it takes for him to succeed, by his own lights, artistically, so be it. The example he cites is Jacques Tati, whose personal investment in his late-career masterwork, “<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/video/watch/playtime\">Playtime</a>,” forced him into bankruptcy. “But who cares if you die broke if you made something that you think is beautiful?” Coppola says. In order for Coppola to feel that he’s making something beautiful, the documentary shows, he needs to work in a way that delights him, too: “I want to have fun.”</p>\n<p>Before going on set, Coppola shows how he has fun with actors. He gathers members of his cast, including Aubrey Plaza, Shia LaBeouf, and Jon Voight, for so-called rehearsals that are more like loose acting classes. Coppola supervises them in improvisations and exercises (such as “sound ball”), and he sometimes joins in. He tries to relax the performers with a speech in which he turns Dante’s motto for Hell into a slogan for theatrical paradise: “Abandon <i>worry</i>, all ye who enter here.” Coppola tells the actors, “When you’re in this space, you’re not you, you are the character you’re playing.” It’s an instruction that preserves Method acting’s element of play but dispenses with its agonized self-scrutiny.</p>\n<p>In “Megadoc,” Figgis talks with Coppola and keeps a close watch on him at work. Unobtrusively conventional in form, the documentary is discerningly observant about Coppola’s interactions with the movie’s big personalities—including Dustin Hoffman, Giancarlo Esposito, and Nathalie Emmanuel. The actors also get time alone, in one-on-one interviews, to talk about the project. (The film’s star, Adam Driver, preferred to appear less often while shooting, but he, too, is interviewed.) Figgis also speaks with crew members and, in lieu of a voice-over narration, he puts himself on camera to reflect on what he’s seeing. Above all, what “Megadoc” reveals is that Coppola filmed the wildly unconventional story of “Megalopolis” in wildly unconventional ways, and that these methods are fully visible in the finished film.</p>\n<p>“Megadoc” is, at heart, a story of liberation. “Megalopolis” is Coppola’s pet project, which he conceived around forty years before shooting it. (Coppola’s biographer Sam Wasson, interviewed by Figgis, says that the project was born soon after the filmmaker lost control of his studio, American Zoetrope, following the catastrophic release of his 1981 musical, “<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/francis-ford-coppolas-one-from-the-heart-is-exactly-what-its-title-says\">One from the Heart</a>.”) He had tried and failed to get “Megalopolis” made before; Figgis includes clips from the early two-thousands showing a table read with Robert De Niro, Uma Thurman, and Billy Crudup, plus rehearsals of it with Anton Yelchin and Ryan Gosling. But what is liberated in the eventual production is an adventuresome process in keeping with the grand scale of the story that the film tells. “Megalopolis” is a futuristic fantasy of ancient Roman inspiration, in which a visionary artist-cum-scientist-cum-urbanist (Driver) faces political opposition for his utopian scheme of urban innovation from a plutocrat (Voight), a demagogue (LaBeouf), an ex (Plaza), and the mayor (Esposito), whose daughter (Emmanuel) he falls in love with. To realize his epic, Coppola launched a production of colossal dimensions. “Megadoc” shows that what’s truly utopian about “Megalopolis” is its mode of production; Figgis’s perceptive view of the shoot brings to the fore the artistic ideas that Coppola’s way of working embodies.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/megadoc-shows-francis-ford-coppola-going-for-broke-on-megalopolis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>It was November 2008, right before the holidays, when the police knocked on Katie Brandt’s door. Mike Brandt, 29, had left their small three-bedroom house in Center Barnstead, New Hampshire, a few hours earlier. He was supposedly meeting a client about his web design business – a side hustle from his high-school teaching job. Katie, also 29, thought this was a lie, but let it go.</p>\n<p>Katie feared the knock meant trouble – or worse, that her husband was dead. She remembers the officer saying: ‘We’ve clocked your husband going 90 miles an hour, and we can’t catch him. He stopped at Cumberland Farms, bought beer, urinated on the side of the building, and took off.’</p>\n<p>Minutes later, Mike pulled into the driveway, nearly hitting the deck. The officer coolly watched from the door as Mike, a hulking 6’ 3”, stumbled out of the car reeking of vomit, then threw up on the pavement.</p>\n<p>Katie didn’t know what to think. His strange behaviour had started during her first trimester of pregnancy, 11 months before that visit from the police. She noticed something was off – Mike didn’t share her excitement about the baby.</p>\n<p>At first, she brushed off his indifference as marital, like being ignored by a spouse glued to the game.</p>\n<p>But there were the weird moments: the earbuds he refused to remove during her labour, lost in a <i>Harry Potter</i> audiobook while she gave birth; the strange obsession with sweets.</p>\n<p>Then Mike quit his teaching job, ostensibly to grow his web design business. But when she checked his phone, she found a slew of unanswered messages from angry customers. His designs, once beautiful, had turned chaotic with ugly fonts and bizarre layouts. Worse, he didn’t seem to notice the drop in quality or care about his upset clients.</p>\n<p>There were smaller, stranger things: he started licking food off his fingers at dinner. He stopped brushing his teeth and let his beard grow wild. These weren’t just quirks.</p>\n<p>Looking back, it was the police incident that marked the end of the early days of Mike’s illness, when she could still recall how it had been before the intimacy between them was gone.</p>\n<p>‘It was like he was drifting far away,’ Katie said. ‘And I couldn’t reach him.’</p>\n<p>Katie and Mike at the Saint Anselm College Ball in 2001. Photo courtesy of Katie Brandt</p>\n<p>When I met Katie, 45, at Tatte Bakery &amp; Café in Brookline, Massachusetts, she had just finished a long afternoon on Beacon Hill, reciting her elevator pitch to state senators. She arrived for our meeting put together, in business casual, slightly weary from repeating her story.</p>\n<p>Katie is tall and lanky with a big, toothy smile. Her voice is warm and even, the kind that draws people in. She greeted me with practised calm, coffee in hand, then pulled up a chair and leaned in close to hear better over the din of voices in the bakery. We fell back into the conversation we had been unspooling for months – about caregivers and the systems that fail to support them, about the meaning of loving someone through cognitive decline.</p>\n<p>We had already met each other through a webinar we had co-hosted on family caregiving. She spoke as a national advocate for dementia care; I, as a palliative care physician and consultant to the National Center for Equitable Care for Elders. But I wanted to take our conversation beyond titles and talking points. I wanted to learn how she’d transformed her life, following the slow, devastating unravelling of her husband by a rare, fatal neurodegenerative disease, into a career shaping support structures for others. A path that led her to a position as the director of Caregiver Support Services at the renowned Frontotemporal Disorders Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.</p>\n<p>She’d suspected all along that ‘something was terribly wrong’ while the doctors shrugged</p>\n<p>Katie never sugarcoats her story. She replayed the timeline of events from 12 years ago, which had followed Mike’s diagnosis, at 31, with frontotemporal dementia – an illness that slowly erodes personality, judgment and emotional awareness.</p>\n<p>‘It had been two years of misdiagnoses before a doctor finally listened,’ Katie said. She’d suspected all along that ‘something was terribly wrong’ while the doctors shrugged. Depression, they said. Stress. Marriage problems.</p>\n<p>When a doctor diagnosed him with severe depression, the medications they prescribed made him sleepy and even more disconnected. She insisted that his psychiatrist order a scan of his brain. ‘Could he have a brain tumour?’ she asked. She remembers attempting to explain to the doctor the reasons for her concerns. But how do you explain that someone’s personality has vanished – when that person doesn’t even notice?</p>\n<p>No one listened. Not Mike. Not the doctors. And, as it turned out, that scan was the wrong kind to show signs of frontotemporal dementia.</p>\n<p>When Mike tried to fix their washing machine with a butane torch, she knew something needed to change, and fast. Desperate, Katie brought Mike to her father’s doctor, a neurologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.</p>\n<p>Katie coaxed Mike into the exam room with strategies that she had honed over the past year and a half. She never commanded him; instead, she made gentle suggestions like: ‘Let’s sit here. The chairs look comfortable.’</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/when-dementia-took-her-husband-she-took-on-his-story?utm_source=rss-feed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

As enlightening as it is arresting, his imagery straddles the line between science and art, as seen in his work as the in-house animator for the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne, Australia, and in his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn8AC8z2adU\">music video</a> collaboration with Björk. In this short, partially inspired by the classic science film <a href=\"https://aeon.co/videos/the-classic-1977-film-that-put-the-vastness-of-the-universe-into-perspective\"> Powers of Ten</a>, Barry provides a richly detailed visual rendering of a rather profound moment: a nematode worm’s egg cell resetting the biological clock to zero through self-fertilisation. Incorporating microscopy and modelling, the piece zooms from cellular to molecular levels to depict this process, which results in a form of biological immortality – not for the individual or even the

One can list the good stylists on one hand: <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/living-the-life-authentic-bernard-williams-on-paul-gauguin\">Bernard Williams</a>, for the clear frankness of his prose; Stanley Cavell, whose writing self-reflectively folds in on itself like origami; <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/what-nietzsche-learnt-from-diogenes-the-cynic\">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>, whose dazzle and exclamation seduce many people into questionable ideas. <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/hume-is-the-amiable-modest-generous-philosopher-we-need-today\">David Hume</a> is typically seen as part of this crowd. The 18th-century Scottish philosopher wrote in many genres: not only essays, dissertations and treatises, but dialogues, impersonated monologues and biographies. Hume adored the literary celebrities of his day, like the essayist <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/how-personal-letters-built-the-possibility-of-a-modern-public\">Joseph Addison</a>, who founded <i>The</i> <i>Spectator</i> magazine,<i> </i>and the French moralist Jean de La Bruyère. He was also unfailingly committed to finding a way to bridge the divide between scholars and society, between a world that was ‘learned’ and one that was ‘conversible’. However, it was Hume who helped to divide what we now call ‘literature’ from what we now call ‘philosophy’. He did so by posing a devastating challenge to the prestige of one literary tool that had long been considered a legitimate method in which to practise philosophy: the character sketch.</p>\n<p><i>Characters and Caricaturas</i> (1743) by William Hogarth. Courtesy the <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/392594\">Met Museum</a>, New York</p>\n<p>What is a character sketch? It is a short description of a person, a social type, which focuses on their habitual preferences and behaviours. Imagine describing a type of person: an incel, an intellectual, a mansplainer. You might start by saying that they are ‘the kind of person who…’ The incel is a kind of person who lives in their parents’ basement, who knows the latest memes, and who politically probably leans far Right, or at least libertarian. The intellectual is the kind of person who likes good coffee shops, reads high-brow magazines, and who politically finds themselves leaning liberal, or far Left. The mansplainer, to borrow the journalist Marin Cogan’s memorable expression, is the kind of person who has a ‘need to explain to you – with the overly simplistic, patient tone of an elementary school teacher – really obvious shit you already knew.’</p>\n<p>The character sketch is a genre that is descriptive by nature, and that today reads as a little sociological, a little literary, and more than a little comic. While a part of our everyday discourse, this genre has a long history, stretching all the way back to ancient Greece. Over the course of this history, the character sketch became entangled with another discipline entirely: moral philosophy, the branch of philosophy concerned with virtues and vices, with thinking about social customs and mores, and altogether with trying to work out what it takes to become good. For hundreds of years, the character sketch was understood as a standard method of practising this form of philosophy – until Hume challenged this assumption in 1748. With this, philosophy and literature started to split.</p>\n<p>The ancient Greek thinker who should be credited with establishing this curious form of writing is a little-known philosopher called Theophrastus, who sits within the canon of great philosophical stylists. His name, given to him late in life by his teacher Aristotle, means ‘divine speaker’. (He was formerly called Euphrastus or ‘good speaker’ but then he got upgraded.) Theophrastus directed his writerly talents to a dizzying range of topics. He wrote treatises on juice, as well as works of metaphysics, logic and politics. He is most renowned, however, for two things: inventing the science of botany, and writing a very short book that came to be known as the <i>Characters</i>.</p>\n<p>The <i>Characters</i> is a collection that sets out to define 30 vices. It does so by writing sketches of types who embody these qualities. In the <i>Characters</i>, Theophrastus considers vices like Bad Timing, Absentmindedness, and Idle Chatter, and then shows them in action. The Man with Bad Timing, for example, is someone who always chooses the wrong moment. He ‘is the sort who goes up to someone who is busy and asks his advice,’ who ‘sings love songs to his girlfriend when she has a fever,’ who, ‘when a man has just returned from a long journey,’ invites him to go for a walk.<sup> </sup>The Absentminded man is similarly maladroit. He is the sort of person who, when he’s in the audience at the theatre, ‘falls asleep and is left behind alone.’</p>\n<p>The <i>Characters</i> was a ‘guide’ to understanding what kind of people you should frequent and what kind to avoid</p>\n<p>As these examples hint, Theophrastus is not interested in glamorous vices, vices that make tragedies, vices that present clear problems like Envy or Lust. The qualities he depicts are linked together by the special quality of being ordinary: these are social sins that we commit at the scale of the everyday. Theophrastus’ vices are not only everyday, but they are explored without an eye to explanation. At no point does Theophrastus indicate why the Man with Bad Timing behaves as he does. These sketches are works of description alone.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/how-david-hume-split-literature-from-philosophy?utm_source=rss-feed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The dreams of the night clarify our lives. The dreams of the day complicate them, charge them with the battery of fear and desire, quiver them with the urgency of our mortality and the fervor of our lust for life. To dream is to dare traversing the roiling ocean between what is and what could be on a ramshackle raft of determination and luck. The price we pay for dreaming is the possibility of drowning; the price we pay for not dreaming is the surety of coasting through life in a stupor of autopilot, landlocked in the givens of our time, place, and culture. The dreamer, then, is the only one fully awake to life — that bright technology of the possible the universe invented to prevail over the probable amid the cold austerity of eternal night. </p>\n    <p>But what may be even harder than getting what you dream of is knowing what to dream of, annealing your imagination and your desires enough to trust that your dreams are your own — not the second-hand dreams of your parents, not your heroes’ costumes of achievement, not your culture’s templates of success. “No one can acquire for another — not one,” Walt Whitman <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2025/03/29/whitman-self/\">reckoned with how to own your life</a>, “not one can grow for another — not one,” while two hundred miles north Thoreau was <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/07/12/thoreau-on-success/\">reckoning with the nature of success</a>, concluding: If the day and the night are such that you greet them with joy, and life emits a fragrance like flowers and sweet-scented herbs, is more elastic, more starry, more immortal — that is your success.”</p>\n    <p>They are nothing less than patron saints of the human spirit, those who protect our dreams from the false gods of success.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/arundhatiroy_TheMarginalian.jpg?resize=680%2C680&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><strong>Arundhati Roy</strong> is one such modern patron saint. Half a lifetime before taking up the complicated question of success in her exquisite memoir <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mother-Mary-Comes-Arundhati-Roy/dp/1668094711/?tag=braipick-20\">Mother Mary Comes to Me</a> (</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/1531990609\">) — what success means and looks like in the deepest sense, how its shallow metrics can turn a person into “a cold silver figurine with a cold silver heart,” why “making friends with defeat” is “the very opposite of accepting it” and so-called failure might actually be worth striving for — Roy captured the crux of our confusion about the real metrics of our lives a passage from her 1999 book</a>\n    </p>\n    <i>public library</i>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Cost-Living-Arundhati-Roy/dp/0375756140/?tag=braipick-20\">(</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong/>\n    <i>The Cost of Living</i>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/42049224\">).</a>\n    </p>\n    <i>public library</i>\n    <p>Recounting a conversation with an old friend in the wake of the disorienting success of her novel <i>The God of Small Things</i>, Roy finds herself suffocated by the intimation that “the trajectory of a person’s happiness… had peaked because she had accidentally stumbled upon ‘success'” — a notion “premised on the unimaginative belief that wealth and fame were the mandatory stuff of everybody’s dreams.” She tells her friend:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>You’ve lived too long in New York… There are other worlds. Other kinds of dreams. Dreams in which failure is feasible. Honorable. Sometimes even worth striving for. Worlds in which recognition is not the only barometer of brilliance or human worth.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>The people who are less successful “in the most vulgar sense of the word,” she observes, are often more fulfilled — like her beloved uncle, who had become one of India’s first Rhodes scholars for his work in Greek and Roman mythology but had chosen to give up his academic career in order to start a pickle, jam, and curry-powder factory with his mother and build balsawood model airplanes in his basement.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.almanacofbirds.org\">\n        <graphic data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Red-HeadedWoodpecker_purpose.jpg?resize=680%2C1052&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"1052\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85784\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Red-HeadedWoodpecker_purpose.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Red-HeadedWoodpecker_purpose.jpg?resize=320%2C495&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Red-HeadedWoodpecker_purpose.jpg?resize=600%2C929&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Red-HeadedWoodpecker_purpose.jpg?resize=240%2C371&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Red-HeadedWoodpecker_purpose.jpg?resize=768%2C1188&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Red-HeadedWoodpecker_purpose.jpg?resize=993%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 993w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Red-HeadedWoodpecker_purpose.jpg?resize=680%2C1052&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.almanacofbirds.org\"/>\n    </p>\n    <i>An Almanac of Birds: 100 Divinations for Uncertain Days</i>\n    <p>When Roy’s friend meets her point with raised eyebrows awning a look of slight annoyance, she takes a moment to distill her thoughts, then writes them on a paper napkin for her friend to hold on to, formulating with that rare and exultant combination of passion and rigor what success really means:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>To love. To be loved. To never forget your own insignificance. To never get used to the unspeakable violence and the vulgar disparity of life around you. To seek joy in the saddest places.

    "body": "<p><strong>April Zhu: </strong>Let’s start with the charges. <i>UnHerd </i>columnist Kat Rosenfeld wrote that we editors who resigned in protest had reached with our “hot little hands” for “the censor’s pen.” According to <i>Washington Post</i> media critic Erik Wemple, we were outraged by “the humane reflections of a Jewish woman seeking reconciliation and recovery in her community.” And in <i>The Atlantic</i>, journalist and novelist Phil Klay alleged that by resigning, we had bent our literary magazine to “the narrowest polemical and moralistic approaches to literature.”</p>\n<p><strong>Sarah Khatry: </strong>It’s worth clarifying that each of us chose to resign from our volunteer positions because we believed that <i>Guernica </i>should not have published the piece in the first place. We learned of the essay only after it was published and had no part in its retraction, any more than we did in its solicitation and publication.</p>\n<p><strong>AZ: </strong>In any case, the media metabolized the upheaval of an online literary magazine into a culture war talking point.</p>\n<p><strong>SK:</strong> And as always happens, the controversy became an opportunity to stage the same old questions: Is good literature fundamentally apolitical? Do politics make for bad art? How could art that calls for empathy ever be a thing worth protesting? Is reading itself a fundamentally moral act, one that can “build bridges” through empathy in times of strife? And a new question, or at least one that felt and continues to feel deeply urgent: What are the political and ethical responsibilities of literature and literary institutions during genocide?</p>\n<p>These questions were far above our paygrade—which was zero—as <i>Guernica </i>editors. But what <i>was </i>part of our job was weighing in on whether a nonfiction piece should be in the magazine or not.</p>\n<p><strong>AZ</strong>: The work of editing is, by design, not very visible, and the irregular way in which this particular process unfurled meant that our internal decisions were adjudicated very publicly. It also made clear that many people don’t understand what literary magazine editors do.</p>\n<p><strong>SK</strong>: In an interview with Ezra Klein last year, Adam Moss, the former editor-in-chief of <i>New York</i>, described editing as “a heightened level of sensitivity to reaction. . . And it’s not just an intellectual thing—it’s also very much an emotional thing.”</p>\n<p>At first, a reaction along two dimensions: emotional, intellectual. An editor is supposed to examine that reaction, to find its source, and to evaluate it in the context of the magazine’s identity, its house style and purpose.</p>\n<p><strong>AZ: </strong>At <i>Guernica</i>, as at many other publications, the process of editing involved circulating a submission among many readers, each of them scanning for content and craft. Nonfiction essays were sometimes submitted directly to an editor, as Chen’s was, but more often they came in cold, from the slush pile. At least two readers read every slush submission and, if they endorsed it, would send it along with a brief memo to another round of editors, who would in turn write another memo framing the piece for discussion in an editorial meeting.</p>\n<p><strong>SK:</strong> So much of editing is about tapping into what’s already strong about an essay, even if some of that strength is still latent. Its veins of beauty, urgency, surprise; its capacity for insight. The work of editing is recognizing these remarkable qualities and bolstering them, while stripping away other qualities that may inhibit them.</p>\n<p><strong>AZ:</strong> Let’s say Chen’s essay came in and you had to write the memo for it. What would you have written?</p>\n<p><strong>SK:</strong> Maybe something like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>This personal essay by Joanna Chen, an Israeli translator of Hebrew and Arabic, focuses on her difficulty “tread[ing] the line of empathy, to feel passion for both sides” (Israelis and Palestinians). Tonally, the essay is melancholic and generally restrained, with flashes of lyricism that do not, for me, tip into overindulgence given the weight of its subject. It begins and ends with the memory of Chen’s auntie Sheila, who instilled in Chen the significance of small but concrete acts of generosity, of “lending a hand when needed.” The essay tracks the arc of Chen’s ambivalent and often conflicting emotions in the weeks following October 7, after which she stops her volunteer work, driving Palestinian children from the border to Israeli hospitals for lifesaving medical procedures. In the midst of communal grief, Chen practices care, first for her neighbors who were victims of the October 7 attack and then also for Palestinians, by resuming her volunteer work and contacting a Palestinian friend. She reflects on what bridging both sides might look like, concluding that it feels ever more impossible during war, but committed to “still find empathy and love in this broken world.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>The memo would start like this, followed by a paragraph highlighting the essay’s shortcomings and its potential. In the paragraph I would have explained how the piece flinches from engaging with its larger historical and political context, because that context poses a threat to the neat arc of the author’s moral journey.</p>\n<p>Then, in our next editorial meeting, we would have discussed the memo as a group and decided whether to move the piece forward to publication.</p>\n<p><strong>AZ:</strong> Our inquiry always boiled down to the following question: could this become a <i>Guernica </i>essay?</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/a-document-of-complicity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

And so we love <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/03/31/how-to-love-thich-nhat-hanh/\">without knowing how to love</a>, wounding ourselves and each other.</p>\n    <p>Over and over, in her novels and her essays, in her letters and her journals, Woolf tried to locate love, to anneal it, to define it in order to reinstate it at the center of life.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/virginiawoolf.jpg?resize=680%2C935&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>“To love makes one solitary,” she wrote in <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> a generation before Sylvia Plath contemplated <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/06/18/sylvia-plath-journals-loneliness-love/\">the loneliness of love</a> — because “nothing is so strange when one is in love… as the complete indifference of other people.” </p>\n    <p>Two years later, she set out to “throw light upon the question of love” in <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/04/03/virginia-woolf-to-the-lighthouse/\"> To the Lighthouse</a>, to illuminate its “thousand shapes.” </p>\n    <p>Nothing, she wrote, could be “more serious… more commanding, more impressive, bearing in its bosom the seeds of death.”</p>\n    <p>Against “the heat of love, its horror, its cruelty, its scrupulosity,” she pitted the kind of love “that never attempted to clutch its object but, like the love that mathematicians bear their symbols or poets their phrases, was meant to be spread over the world and become part of the human gain.” She found it “helpful” and “exalting” to know that people could love like that.</p>\n    <p>At its best, at its truest, the experience of falling in love partakes of that exaltation, that transcendent participancy in the order of things. She captures the phase transition as her characters flood with “being in love”:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>They became part of that unreal but penetrating and exciting universe which is the world seen through the eyes of love. The sky stuck to them; the birds sang through them. And what was even more exciting [was] how life, from being made up of little separate incidents which one lived one by one, became curled and whole like a wave which bore one up with it and threw one down with it, there, with a dash on the beach.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>Above all, perhaps, love is a function of time and chance, time and choice — an equivalence that Woolf conjures up on the pages of <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/tag/orlando/\"> Orlando</a>, drawing on her relationship with Vita Sackville-West to compose what Vita’s son would later call </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/07/28/virginia-woolf-vita-sackville-west/\">“the longest and most charming love letter in literature, in which [Virginia] explores Vita, weaves her in and out of the centuries, tosses her from one sex to the other, plays with her, dresses her in furs, lace and emeralds, teases her, flirts with her, drops a veil of mist around her.”</a>Here, to love someone is to choose them again and again day after day, century after century, as they change and morph and fluctuate across the spectrum of being, to continue to see and cherish the kernel of the person beneath the costume of personality,</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/09/12/virginia-woolf-soul/\">the soul beneath the self</a>. In this sense, love is a revelation of the essence — “something central,” she wrote in</p>\n    <p><i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>, that permeates the fabric of a person, “something warm” that breaks up the surface and ripples the “cold contact” between people:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>It was a sudden revelation, a tinge like a blush which one tried to check and then, as it spread, one yielded to its expansion, and rushed to the farthest verge and there quivered and felt the world come closer, swollen with some astonishing significance, some pressure of rapture, which split its thin skin and gushed and poured with an extraordinary alleviation… an illumination; a match burning in a crocus; an inner meaning almost expressed.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>The great tragedy of human life is that we ask of love everything and gives us an almost; the great triumph is that we know this, know the price of the illumination, and we choose to <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/03/22/love-anyway/\">love anyway</a>. </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.almanacofbirds.org\">\n        <graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GreatWhiteEgret_love.jpg\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GreatWhiteEgret_love.jpg\"/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.almanacofbirds.org\"/>\n    </p>\n    <i>An Almanac of Birds: 100 Divinations for Uncertain Days</i>\n    <p>\n\t\t\t—<br/>\n\t\t\tPublished September 9, 2025<br/>\n\t\t\t—<br/>\n\t\t\thttps://www.themarginalian.org/2025/09/09/virginia-woolf-on-love/<br/>\n\t\t\t—\n\t\t</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/themes/themarginalian/images/tm_monogram_print.png?20250727\" alt=\"BP\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2025/09/09/virginia-woolf-on-love/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Join McNally Jackson and n+1 for an evening with contributor <strong>Philip Connors</strong> as he launches his latest book, <i>The Mountain Knows the Mountain.</i></p>\n    <p>Connors had been a fire watcher in the Gila Wilderness for fourteen straight summers when he sustained an injury and was forced to miss a year recovering. When he returned, he resolved to see the mountain with fresh eyes and to keep a detailed notebook. The result is <i>The Mountain Knows the Mountain</i>, a meticulously observed experience of one fire season chronicled in <i>haibun</i>, the centuries-old prose form dating from Basho’s <i>Narrow Road to the Interior</i> that recounts both inner and outer journeys and incorporates traditional haiku as an occasional element of narrative counterpoint. Though only a beginner in the practice of haiku, Connors deftly weaves close observation, personal reflection, and memory with hard-won knowledge of the forest, of the mountain, and of fire.</p>\n    <p><i>The Mountain Knows the Mountain</i> is both mythic and immediate, a chronicle of daily events granular in their specificity but connected to larger themes of the observed world and the inner life of the observer. Connors captures the various moods of a long season on a mountain; plays with language and ways of seeing; and includes contributing perspectives from his partner, Mónica Ortiz Uribe, and his friend the late editor and publisher Bobby Byrd. Together with the author’s own simple drawings, the resulting snapshots offer incisive visions of how to be intimate with the wild.</p>\n    <p>Connors will discuss the book with writer (and fellow n+1 contributor) Nina MacLaughlin. <a href=\"https://www.mcnallyjackson.com/philip-connors-nina-maclaughlin\">RSVP via McNally Jackson</a>.</p>\n    <p><strong>Tuesday, September 16</strong><br/> <strong>7 PM</strong><br/> <strong>McNally Jackson Williamsburg 76 N 4th St Brooklyn</strong></p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.nplusonemag.com/online-only/events/philip-connors-and-nina-maclaughlin-in-conversation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>With the construction next door at 505 Haggart Street, I’d thought things were turning a corner. But now construction has begun at 503, two doors down from me. On Saturday there were people coming out of 503 with debris and throwing it into a dumpster in front of my building. Which was distressing, because at least at 505 there has never been weekend work, except once for the emergency chimney intervention. Whereas at 503 they’re doing off-hours work right off the bat, in the demo phase, which bodes poorly.</p>\n    <p>Of course, saying that 505 Haggart is <i>next door</i> is not really adequate. The preposition that can capture the relationship between my apartment and 505 Haggart Street doesn’t exist. The only thing separating my apartment from 505 right now is about three layers of lead paint. That has been true since the first day of the demo, when they stripped out the walls on their side, leaving a negligible and highly permeable barrier. If you leave any object in my hall or bathroom, it has a fine layer of what looks like moondust all over it in perhaps four days, which was not the case before. Fumes get through freely, too.</p>\n    <p>But most importantly, there is <i>no </i>sound insulation between the two structures. None. I easily hear people talking in their inside voices over there. My building is no more than twenty feet wide, so that’s as far away from it as I can get, when I’m home. So we’re talking full-on construction, in my immediate proximity, with no acoustic buffer at all. Granted, there are no steel girders or heavy machinery. For the most part it has just been men with tools. Drills and hammers and of course saws. My hatred of power saws is a passion for the ages, which neither time nor death itself can quell. I’ll probably become a ghost after I die, and someone will consult a medium and say, “Why won’t she lie quiet in her grave?” and the medium will say, “It’s because she hates power saws so much.”</p>\n    <p>So the noise is horrific, but you also <i>feel</i> every sound. It’s odd. One day I could tell they were trying to move a very long heavy plank or beam through the first floor. I could feel one end knocking into one wall, and another end knocking into another wall. Without even thinking about it, I was reading the tremors, and they were giving me a 3D map of what was happening next door. I suppose it’s something people can just do, but I’d never quite realized it before. Under these circumstances, it’s not a pleasant sensation. It is not a mode of perception you want to have.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-51/fiction-drama/construction/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <h2>The Post Horn Always Blows Twice</h2>\n    <p>Dear Editors,</p>\n    <p>I was delighted to read Gemma Sack’s thoughtful essay on five novels by Vigdis Hjorth (“Officially Good People”) in Issue 50 of <i>n+1</i>. Sack is right to focus on Hjorth as, among other things, a writer of Scandinavian social democracy, a perspective that works particularly well for <i>A House in Norway</i>. I also like the way she brings out the psychoanalytic preoccupations in Hjorth’s texts. </p>\n    <p>However, Sack misses a crucial dimension of Hjorth’s 2012 novel <i>Long Live the Post Horn!</i>,<i> </i>namely the way the novel responds to the most horrific event in Norwegian history after World War II. This is not a criticism of Sack, for most foreign readers wouldn’t necessarily see the connections. (I didn’t immediately see it myself when I first read the novel in North Carolina. It took a trip to Norway to enlighten me.) Yet the aftermath of that historical moment permeates the novel. </p>\n    <p>On July 22, 2011, a Norwegian right-wing terrorist detonated a car bomb outside the government buildings in Oslo, murdering eight people and seriously injuring ten more. (Dozens suffered minor injuries.) Then he drove toward Utøya, the tiny island where the Norwegian Labour Party’s youth organization was hosting its annual summer camp. Disguised as a policeman, he took a ferry to the island, where he shot and killed sixty-nine young people at close range and injured another sixty-six. Many of the injured will be maimed for life. The youngest children killed were 14 years old. Thirty-three victims were under 18. Most of the others were in their early twenties.</p>\n    <p>The trauma inflicted on the usually peaceful Norwegian society by Utøya defies description. What words could express the shock, the horror, the feeling that this was simply unthinkable in boring and tranquil Norway? How could art respond to something like this?</p>\n    <p>Hjorth began work on <i>Long Live the Post Horn!</i> shortly after Utøya. Set in the year preceding the terror action, the novel tells the story of Ellinor, a communications consultant who, numb with depression, struggles with language. Words have become meaningless; “communication” increasingly impossible, not just at work, but in her private life too. Death enters the novel when a colleague and friend commits suicide. This isn’t just another case of Scandinavian gloom. There are strong reasons to read Ellinor’s depression as a figure for the state of mind of Norwegians after Utøya. </p>\n    <p>Ellinor gets hired by Postkom, the trade union of the postal workers in Norway. Her task is to help them oppose the third European postal directive, which will introduce neoliberal notions of market-driven competition into the egalitarian Norwegian postal system. As a result, full-time postal workers will lose their jobs, and mail between large cities will get priority over mail to far-flung fjord and mountain communities. Postkom’s goal is to persuade the delegates to the ruling Labour Party’s annual congress, scheduled to meet in April 2011, to vote against the party line and reject the European postal directive. Trade unions and the Labour Party: the bastions of Scandinavian social democracy, and, absolutely not coincidentally, also the terrorist’s targets.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-51/letters/dont-mute-the-post-horn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>At the end of May, my students shared their designs. I paused over the thick coverchief, pleated wimple, and gaudy green beads for the nun. They looked more medieval on the workbenches, by the awls and needles. We would take them to Drama, a black box theater designed to resemble a barn. There, the limp forms would wait for a pair of shoulders to give them warmth and shape.</p>\n    <p>Every six months, the parents paid the price of a luxury car for their children to blow glass or sing madrigals. The students were exceptional at everything they did. I taught them fashion design and needlework. When they fit a swatch of charmeuse to the limbless torso of a dress form or hand-sewed a fell stitch along the hem of a gown without slipping, I marveled. In those moments, every pricked fingertip and ripped waist paid itself back.</p>\n    <p>After class, I walked with the seniors to Gardening. They sat in a ring by the sugar maples and began slicing rootstock for grafting. Next year’s students would espalier the saplings against fences in front of the school, where each tree would bear two different types of fruit. The parents loved demonstrations of value like this. Watching my students work with wax, twine, and folding knives, it was easy to forget they suffered the ways every adolescent did. They dated, bickered, and pled guilty to misdemeanors. They invented horrible words for their teachers and themselves. When they left one another for college, they wept without reservation. They did this every year, as sure as the wind or rain, to the exclusion of all advice. No matter how many times I counseled them across the arms of a sewing cabinet, no matter how common I told them these troubles were, they each believed themselves alone in them.</p>\n    <p>I wouldn’t see the seniors graduate this year; instead, I would drive four hours south to attend a trade show in Boston. Before that, I agreed to visit my friend, Bailey, for her birthday. I hadn’t seen Bailey in five or six years, and the thought of returning to Boston filled me with guilt. I associated the city with the witless girl I used to be, which was maybe why I lingered on the lawn by all the grafts that didn’t take. Noticing a change in my expression, one of my students set her gloves, wire, and folding knife in the grass and approached me. Thank you, Portia, she said. Thank you for everything.</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>A few times a year, the trans women of Boston convened to remember who they were without anyone else to tell them.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>Bailey lived in East Somerville — another flinty street in the shadow of an auto body shop. On the way, I daydreamed into a wrong turn by Assembly Row, and it took me half an hour to finesse my car to the right side of the Mystic River. It didn’t matter how often I used to make this drive; experience of a place did not amount to knowledge of it. I could assign a memory to almost every street corner I passed. Remembering them all at once was like walking on knives.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-51/fiction-drama/the-mermaids-singing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>M texted me from the adjacent bedroom at 8 AM: “Wake up.” In the kitchen, he combed out his beard and ate a banana, which his people’s warriors ate to feel full, he told me. I pointed to a stray hair that stuck out of the side of his neck. “I keep meaning to pluck it,” he said.</p>\n<p>We arrived at 26 Federal Plaza just after 9 AM. M was wearing clean sneakers, khakis, and a brown suede jacket over a blue button-up. In Mauritania, he had opened a men’s clothing store, a career he hoped to return to here. (His poetry, he said, would never make any money.)</p>\n<p>The security guards working the entrance on the west side of the federal building are aggressive to the point of cruelty. They speak loudly at all times, somewhere between a raised voice and a shout. They are for the most part only willing to speak English, though many of them can speak other languages. When somebody doesn’t understand what they are saying, they repeat the English word louder and more quickly. One guard, trying to pass through the metal detector in the wrong direction, yelled at a woman in a state of half dress who had just passed the right way through the metal detector. Her arms were full of the clothes and bags that she had just run through the scanner. The guard approached her quickly, yelling in rapid succession, “Move Move Move MOVE MOVE MOVE MOVE!” The woman did not speak English, and he had boxed her in, so she had to back out through the metal detector to make way for him, with all of her things in her arms, at which point the alarm went off and the guard on the other side of the detector yelled at her, “What do you think you’re doing?!”</p>\n<p>M and I walked through the main atrium, where small clusters of men in plain clothes stood with their phones out. This was also new. Unlike the security team for the building, who are mostly Caribbean, South Asian, Arab, or Eastern European immigrants or Black Americans, all the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents I saw in the atrium were white, of medium height and build, and many wore plain baseball caps. They were all men and they stuck out because they displayed an exceeding level of stillness and homogeneity in a room with a flow of people from all over the world, people who were always in motion and who mostly looked different from one another. I could see that one man in each group was holding a stack of papers with headshot photos. M had been seeing the messages and videos circulating in WhatsApp groups about ICE rounding up migrants at the courts. I’d also begun receiving messages from people telling me that their friends had been taken by ICE. Friends were forwarding blurry photos of ID cards, with messages reporting that this or that person has a nearby bed in the shelter and hasn’t returned in three days. A minor had been arrested and my friend was on the phone with the kid’s mom back in Guinea, who hadn’t stopped crying for three days. M said, “I don’t care what they do to me. Only God decides.” He was both lying and telling the truth.</p>\n<p>I didn’t point out the agents to M, since my experience in immigration court has so far been that displays of conviction are important to the judge, and that if you hesitate too much or phrase something incorrectly, whether because you are nervous or don’t understand the question or you are in fact lying, it could bring decisive consequences.</p>\n<p>M’s hearing had originally been scheduled to be on the twelfth floor, which is a windowless set of hallways. We wandered around looking for his courtroom and around every corner we found the same plainclothes groups, but on this floor I saw an occasional woman and/or nonwhite person. In the end we learned that M’s case had been moved up to the fourteenth floor, also a windowless set of hallways, also peopled at every turn by small clans of plainclothes agents.</p>\n<p>The waiting room was filled with about forty people: single men, couples, parents with kids, grandparents with their adult children and grandchildren there to do the translating.

One hour passed, and then two, and people began casting glances, then asking questions, cracking jokes. The Spanish speakers laughed at the differences between their dialects and as they did so a baby who liked making eye contact was passed around so everyone could coo at her in their own ways. The gravity of the room was centered on a tall, handsome Dominican man with scars on his face. He wore a Lakers jersey and he was accompanied by a blonde American who seemed to be his girlfriend and who was learning Spanish.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-51/politics/at-immigration-court-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>In the English countryside there is a mock-Tudor manor with a room containing eight strangers and ten chairs and a big clock on the wall. I walk in and take the ninth chair.</p>\n    <p>When the second hand hits the hour, a staff consultant enters and sits. We wait, but she stares at the blue carpet and says nothing. As the minutes pass, it becomes clear that she has no intention of calling this session to order. One of us will have to talk. The air in the room feels like gelatin: no one wants to make the first move.</p>\n    <p>After a few minutes of painful silence, one of us suggests introductions. We are a psychoanalyst, a bank manager, three organizational consultants, an artist, a pediatric oncologist, a prison executive, and me, a freelancer who has cobbled together several grants to cover the staggering cost of sitting in this circle. I am the second-youngest in attendance and a rare novice.</p>\n    <p>For the next fourteen days, forty-eight strangers and I will spend twelve hours a day sitting in groups like this, talking about nothing in particular. It is a prestigious social experiment, run every year by the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations, a British research and consulting organization. Of the many conferences like it held all over the world, this one, the Tavistock conference, is by far the oldest, longest, and most intense. It is the ultimate pilgrimage for devotees of the practice known as “group relations,” a subculture obsessed with studying the unconscious dynamics of groups.</p>\n    <p>Technically, I came to this conference for dissertation research. While deciding whether to go to grad school, I had read “Experiences in Groups,” a 1948 work on group psychotherapy by the psychoanalyst W. R. Bion, who studied small groups at the Tavistock Institute starting in the 1940s, when it split off from the NHS-run Tavistock Clinic. In the psychoanalysis world, Bion is the patron saint of group relations, and “Experiences” is its sacred text. Many of Bion’s intellectual predecessors thought that groups dulled individuals’ capacities (Gustave Le Bon, observing the French Third Republic) or that being in a group was like being hypnotized (Freud, observing the rise of Lenin). Deriding groups became a favorite line of cold war anti-revolutionaries, who panicked about “collectivism” as though it would melt Americans into soup like popsicles in the sun. Capturing a fear of groups that persists today on the right and center, Barry Goldwater called collectivism a “swampland” in which the nation would “stagnate.”</p>\n    <p>By contrast, Bion argued that a group is a sophisticated form with a subtle psychic logic of its own. Moreover, group life is inescapable: “No individual, however isolated in time and space, can be regarded as outside a group or lacking in active manifestations of group psychology.” At the Tavistock Institute, Bion and his colleagues devised a method: put a bunch of people in a room and give them no clear agenda, formal roles, worldly project, or facilitation. If you want to efficiently create a swamp, you start by creating a void.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-51/essays/experiences-in-groups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Fue el estado—the state did it. A decade ago, this slogan became indelibly linked in Mexico to the disappearance of forty-three students enrolled at a teacher’s college in Ayotzinapa, in the state of Guerrero, who were kidnapped on the night of September 26, 2014. Only three students’ remains have been identified; the rest number among the more than 125,000 disappeared people in Mexico. Since the start of President Felipe Calderón’s “war on drugs” in late 2006, mass graves and missing-persons posters have become part of everyday life.</p>\n    <p>Amid this incalculable suffering, the Ayotzinapa victims became symbols of a larger culture of official impunity. Protesters regularly invoked their memory to demand state accountability. Writing in 2015, the Mexican anthropologist Claudio Lomnitz considered the tragedy “the nodal point of the most important social movement to appear in the country since the beginning of the war in 2006.” The students’ disappearance, he wrote, sparked a crisis that “runs even deeper than the events of 1968 or 1994 — the year of the Zapatista rebellion — and that has made the clamor for justice resound more strongly, more painfully, and more urgently than ever.”</p>\n    <p>In an interview last year, Lomnitz struck a less optimistic note. “The social movement that emerged . . . did not manage to create transitional justice,” he said. “It could have happened, but it did not.” Lomnitz had hoped the response to Ayotzinapa could be “a springboard” for something like Argentina’s postdictatorship reckoning; but he no longer believes such a development is possible.</p>\n    <p>The problem is not one of deadlock or stagnation. In the past decade Mexico has undergone a major political shift, with President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (universally known as AMLO) leading his upstart Morena party to a decisive victory at the polls in 2018, solidified by the election of his successor, Claudia Sheinbaum, in 2024. AMLO, an idiosyncratic left populist, claims to have inaugurated a transformative new era in government. Yet ordinary Mexicans remain just as vulnerable to violence and barred from justice as they were before. The first hundred days of Sheinbaum’s presidency saw some 4,000 new disappearances — an average of forty a day.</p>\n    <p>What does it mean to chant <i>fue el estado</i>? What is the state, and what did it do? In Mexico, these are hardly straightforward questions, and they lie at the heart of Lomnitz’s recent research. In his view, the slogan is both true and misleading. The state’s fingerprints are all over cases like Ayotzinapa, where institutions at every level — local police, the municipal government, the army units deployed in Guerrero, and the military and civilian authorities who orchestrated a botched cover-up — all bear responsibility for the crime and the failure of justice that followed. Yet <i>fue el estado</i> also presumes a wishful notion of what Lomnitz calls “a vertically integrated state,” where a clear chain of command connects the president to the institutions that ordinary people interact with. Mexico’s hyperpresidential system helps sustain that illusion, but most of what the state <i>does </i>is carried out by a jumble of competing and internally divided power centers rather than a single hierarchy. Lomnitz agrees that the state is finally responsible, but believes that achieving accountability requires a clearer understanding of what kind of structure that state is and how it works.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-51/reviews/the-deepest-state/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Earlier this year, I finally got around to reading <i>The Source of Self-Regard</i>. “Authoritarian regimes, dictators, despots are often, but not always, fools,” Toni Morrison begins. “But none is foolish enough to give perceptive, dissident writers free range to publish their judgments or follow their creative instincts.” Authoritarians regularly censor writers, Morrison continues, whether through control of media industries, incarceration, or murder. They prevent plays from being staged and films from being shown. If the threat is sustained and generalized enough, writers may never put pen to page, not even in private. Novels, poems, and more go unwritten. In Morrison’s account, this epistemic violence affects those under authoritarian rule and those residing in other countries, even if the degrees of violence are different. Neither group can know all the artwork that might have been made under other, less oppressive forms of government.</p>\n    <p>Morrison’s characterization of art under authoritarianism gained new salience for me this February, when I heard from Andil Gosine. Andil is a professor whose book <i>Nature’s Wild</i> considers how anxieties about animals have contributed to the disciplining of sexuality. He is also a visual artist. I first met him in 2022, to discuss an exhibition of Caribbean artists that he had curated and which resulted in a profile in the<i> New York Times</i>.<i> </i>In part because we both descend from indentured laborers and seek to represent that heritage in our art, we became friends, occasionally wandering through galleries in New York City and texting regularly, often about Nicki Minaj. Andil and Nicki share a homeland, Trinidad. I do not hold that against him. On many occasions, we tried to find a way to collaborate. This phrasing is overly generous. I attempted to write about Andil’s art and curation several times but failed.</p>\n    <p>This time around, however, it seemed that we had finally succeeded. In January, I interviewed Andil for <i>BOMB</i> about an exhibition, also titled <i>Nature’s Wild</i>, scheduled to go up at the Art Museum of the Americas (AMA) on March 21. I was just about to email my editor the draft when Andil called. He told me that AMA had just canceled his exhibition and another show, titled <i>Before the Americas</i>, in response to an executive order from the Trump Administration. The<i> Washington Post</i> was about to break the story. Andil’s show, which he had worked on for three years, would never go up. Visitors would never see his art.<i> </i></p>\n    <p>But I had. To prepare for the <i>BOMB</i> interview, Andil had sent me photographs of his work, some of it solo-created and some produced in collaboration with the artists Lorraine O’Grady, Kelly Sinnapah Mary, and others. I’d also read the essays from the catalog, which would now never be published. I had studied art and writing that was — and I mean this literally, fully aware of the irony, given the past decade’s hand-wringing over political correctness — canceled. I happened to know intimately the cultural objects that the Trump regime was repressing. I could describe them rigorously and with precision.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-51/essays/lifetime-achievement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But then there are people who have nothing and have achieved a lot.’</p>\n    <p>The sugar mill towns, or <i>bateyes</i>, of the Dominican Republic were built in the early 20th century to house workers – particularly seasonal labourers from neighbouring Haiti. In the wake of the sugar industry’s decline in the region, these communities have faced crumbling infrastructure, poverty, a lack of job opportunities and limited access to education, electricity and clean water.</p>\n    <p><i>Los Niños del Batey</i> follows 12-year-old Wilkin Bautista as he guides viewers through his neighbourhood, Batey de San Luis, on the outskirts of Santo Domingo. Part of Pequeños Dibujos Animados (PDA) – a project to bring children’s creativity to life through animation, drawing and music – the film captures Wilkin’s reflections on his surroundings, including his two greatest passions: baseball and rap music. Blending Wilkin’s footage and endearing narration with lively animations inspired by local children’s drawings, the film offers a revealing look at how joy and hardship coexist in this

How did the Universe evolve into what we can see today: a ‘cosmic web’ of stars, galaxies, planets and, at least on one pale blue planet, what sometimes passes for intelligent life?</p>\n<p>Not so very long ago, these kinds of existential questions were judged to be without scientific answers. Yet scientists have found some answers, through more than a century of astronomical observations and theoretical developments that have been woven together to give us the Big Bang theory of cosmology. This extraordinary theory is supported by a wide range of astronomical evidence, is broadly accepted by the scientific community, and has (a least by name) become embedded in popular culture.</p>\n<p>We shouldn’t get too comfortable. Although it tells an altogether remarkable story, the current Big Bang theory leaves us with many unsatisfactorily unanswered questions, and recent astronomical observations <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/scientists-are-no-longer-sure-the-universe-began-with-a-bang\">threaten to undermine</a> it completely. The Big Bang theory may very soon be in crisis.</p>\n<p>To understand why, it helps to appreciate that there is much more to the theory than the Big Bang itself. That the Universe must have had a <a href=\"https://aeon.co/videos/was-there-any-before-before-the-big-bang\">historical beginning</a> was an inevitable consequence of concluding that the space in it is <i>expanding</i>. In 1929, observations of distant galaxies by the American astronomer Edwin Hubble and his assistant Milton Humason had produced a remarkable result. The overwhelming majority of the galaxies they had studied are moving away from us, at speeds directly proportional to their distances. To get some sense of these speeds, imagine planet Earth making its annual pilgrimage around the Sun at a sedate orbital speed of about 30 kilometres per second. Hubble and Humason <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1931ApJ....74...43H/abstract\">found</a> galaxies moving away at tens of thousands of kilometres per second, representing significant fractions of the speed of light.</p>\n<p>Hubble’s speed-distance relation had been anticipated by the Belgian theorist Georges Lemaître a few years before and is today known as the Hubble-Lemaître law. The constant of proportionality between speed and distance is the <i>Hubble constant</i>, a measure of the rate at which the Universe is expanding. In truth, the galaxies are not actually moving away at such high speeds, and Earth occupies no special place at the centre of the Universe. The galaxies are being <i>carried</i> away by the expansion of the space that lies between us, much as two points drawn on a deflated balloon will move apart as the balloon is inflated. In a universe in which space is expanding, everything is being carried away from everything else.</p>\n<p>The Big Bang story is almost as fascinating as the story of the Universe itself</p>\n<p>To get a handle on the distances of these galaxies, astronomers made use of so-called Cepheid variable stars as ‘standard candles’, cosmic lighthouses flashing on and off in the darkness that can tell us how far away they are. But in the late-1920s, these touchstone stars were poorly understood and the distances derived from them were greatly underestimated, leading scientists to overestimate the Hubble constant and the rate of expansion. It took astronomers 70 years to sort this out.</p>\n<p>A Hubble image showing RS Puppis, a Cepheid variable star. Courtesy <a href=\"https://esahubble.org/images/heic1323a/\">ESA/Hubble</a></p>\n<p>But such problems were irrelevant to the principal conclusion. If space in the Universe is expanding, then extrapolation backwards in time using known physical laws and principles suggests there must have been a moment when the Universe was compressed to a point of extraordinarily high density and temperature, representing the fiery origin of everything: space, time, matter, and radiation. As far as we can tell, this occurred nearly 14 billion years ago. In a BBC radio programme broadcast in 1949, the maverick British astronomer Fred Hoyle called this the ‘Big Bang’ theory. The name stuck.</p>\n<p>Of course, it’s not enough that the theory simply tells us when things got started. We demand more. We also expect the Big Bang theory to tell the story of our universe, to describe how the Universe evolved from its beginning, and how it came to grow into the <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/how-to-see-the-cosmic-web-here-on-earth\">cosmic web</a> of stars and galaxies we see today. The theorists reduced this to a simple existential question: <i>Why do stars and galaxies exist?</i> To give a proper account, the Big Bang theory has itself evolved from its not-so-humble beginnings, picking up much-needed additional ingredients along the way, in a story almost as fascinating as the story of the Universe itself.</p>\n<p>The Big Bang theory is a theory of physical cosmology, constructed on foundations derived from solutions of Albert Einstein’s equations of general relativity – in essence, Einstein’s theory of gravity – applied to the whole universe. Einstein himself had set this ball rolling in 1917. At that time, he chose to fudge his own equations to obtain a solution describing an intellectually satisfying static, eternal universe. Ten years later, Lemaître rediscovered an alternative solution describing an expanding universe. Although Einstein rejected this as ‘quite abominable’, when confronted by the evidence presented by Hubble and Humason, he eventually recanted.</p>\n<p>Albert Einstein and Willem de Sitter in Pasadena, California, in January 1932.

This truth sits at the heart of <i>Hindsight</i>, a film by the Ukrainian director Max Rykov, who is now based in the United States. For this intimate project, he dusted off his parents’ long-buried VHS recordings, most of them shot before he was born, after the fall of the Iron Curtain. The footage depicts the pair as their homeland was experiencing a fragile new sense of hope, and follows them on their travels while working for the World Bank, documenting journeys to countries including Vietnam, India and Cuba. As Rykov expresses in drifting, lyrical narration, this experience teemed with contradictions – between freedom and poverty, and between emerging globalism and indelible heritage – that grew more complex with each border crossed. Releasing the film amid the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war, Rykov brings a circularity to the work, once again placing the audience in a precarious moment that gestures towards a deeply uncertain

    "body": "<p>Kenya’s arid north has always stirred the imaginations of those who visit. Its open, scorched bushland distributed over exposed geological formations and crosscut by riverine tentacles never fails to elicit impressions of emptiness and remoteness. To most outsiders, this is a timeless land. It is beautiful but unproductive, so the imaginary goes. It is backward. Its vulnerabilities – drought, famine, conflict, poverty – are inherent. Radical change is needed: a new way of doing things to unlock vast untapped potential and bring prosperity.</p>\n<p>This is not a new idea. In Kenya’s north, the idea has been shaped by generations of development workers and policymakers. Its legacy today is diverse, surfacing through transformative large-scale investments and interventions across the private and public sectors. But this vision of prosperity also surfaces in the very earth itself, in the form of an invasive shrub, <i>Prosopis juliflora</i> (recently renamed <i>Neltuma juliflora</i>) or <i>etirae</i> in the local Turkana language.</p>\n<p>A kind of mesquite native to South America, <i>Prosopis</i> was first introduced in this part of Kenya in the early 1980s at the height of a catastrophic famine caused by drought. The reason for its introduction, as cited by the NGOs spearheading the planting programmes, was to address a suite of pressing concerns made even more urgent by the protracted drought: fuelwood shortages, soil erosion and a lack of fodder for the livestock of local pastoralists.</p>\n<p>These were real problems. But to the organisations who intervened, the issues seemed to suggest that the crisis was not really a product of chaotic environmental shifts or longstanding marginalisation. Instead, catastrophic famine served as evidence of pastoralism’s inherent vulnerability. Confirmation, that is, of a kind of fragility that lay at the heart of local people’s livelihoods and was inconducive to true prosperity. The obligation to respond to immediate hunger – to help – quickly became a desire to change, to improve, to make what was there more ‘sustainable’ or, in the more recent language of development agencies, ‘resilient’. The introduction of <i>Prosopis</i>, then, was part of a wave of interventions that sought to transform pastoralism, setting it on a new path towards a prosperity that is fixed, predictable and under control.</p>\n<p>But in the decades since, the shrub has become one of Africa’s worst invasives, strangling rural livelihoods across the continent. Encroaching on farmland, forest and range, it has brought ill-health both to people and their livestock, outcompeting local flora and disrupting longstanding ways of life.</p>\n<p>You might think the ideas that led to such a catastrophe would wither with time, but the opposite is true. Like the shrub itself, they’ve grown ever more tenacious, tangling together dissonant things in stubborn sprawling shoots that refuse to offer any resolution. This is a story about the thicket that is left behind, and what it conceals.</p>\n<p>The banks of the Kerio river in southern Turkana County, Kenya, covered in dense <i>Prosopis</i>. Photo supplied by the author</p>\n<p>For the past 12 years, my research has explored the history of development projects in Kenya’s northwest and the changing course of mobile pastoralism. I’ve interviewed hundreds, perhaps thousands of people, seeking to understand what binds together diverse mobile economies.</p>\n<p>When I first began this anthropological work, it was in a thicket of <i>Prosopis</i> on the bank of the Kerio river, which arcs through the plains of Turkana County before draining into Lake Turkana. This is an area, I came to learn, that was once covered in spacious gallery forest, where regular floodwaters washed across cultivation plots laid out on meander scars, depositing in their wake rich alluvial silts. Sorghum, a common grain crop in Turkana, grew here in tall stems and flowed outward from the riverside, carried across plains, hills and scrubland by herders who loaded it into goatskin bags attached to their donkeys. Only in the harshest, cruellest of dry seasons did this resource fail the people of Turkana.</p>\n<p>Since the 1980s, the world in which sorghum thrived has mostly been crowded out. The process began when government agencies, supported by NGOs and international donors, first introduced <i>Prosopis </i>to combat desertification. Projects supported by the Kenyan Forestry Department and the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation planted the shrub across riverine areas and rangelands, promoting it as a natural solution to ecological and economic challenges. Before long, <i>Prosopis</i> had invaded native forests and areas cleared for cultivation. Then reports began to emerge of serious gastrointestinal problems and tooth decay in the livestock who ate it. By the early 2000s, farmers and herders across northern Kenya were voicing concern, but it was not until 2008 that the Kenyan government classified the plant as an invasive species.</p>\n<p>‘Porridge. People were fat from eating it. I can’t remember the last time we had it here’</p>\n<p>When I arrived in Turkana in 2012, the Kerio river was strangled in relentless green. So were the old cultivation plots, which now lay fallow – it had been impossible, for many, to clear them in time for planting. Thick green walls towered over the ghosts of past rhythms and relationships.</p>\n<p>Emeri Lowasa, whom I have interviewed on innumerable occasions, and whose family I’ve lived and worked with for many years, began cultivating this land in the 1960s when she was a young woman newly married. Now her home stands like a rocky bluff in a rising tide.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/how-an-invasive-shrub-derailed-visions-of-prosperity-in-kenya?utm_source=rss-feed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

And suddenly, there in the lacuna between love and reason, in the warmth between her palms, I found myself reckoning with the meaning of faith — this ancient need for something to keep us from breaking the possible on the curb of the known, to keep the heart from breaking on the cold hard floor of a world that has always mistaken the limits of the imagination for the limits of reality.

Every choice we make in our political and personal lives is a prayer. All change is prayerful action toward a different kind of world — an act of faith toward the future and an act of heresy toward the status quo.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://society6.com/product/altarpiece-by-hilma-af-klint-1907_print?curator=brainpicker\">\n        <graphic data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/HilmaAfKlint_Altarpiece_1907.jpg?resize=680%2C900&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"900\" class=\"size-full wp-image-77634\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/HilmaAfKlint_Altarpiece_1907.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/HilmaAfKlint_Altarpiece_1907.jpg?resize=320%2C423&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/HilmaAfKlint_Altarpiece_1907.jpg?resize=600%2C794&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/HilmaAfKlint_Altarpiece_1907.jpg?resize=240%2C318&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/HilmaAfKlint_Altarpiece_1907.jpg?resize=768%2C1016&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/HilmaAfKlint_Altarpiece_1907.jpg?resize=1161%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1161w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p><i>Altarpiece</i>by Hilma af Klint, 1907.

She loved a woman a generation younger than her, loved a world millennia older than hers, loved ideas epochs ahead of her time. Virginia Woolf was taken by “her superb high thinking agnostic ways.” In the nascent evolutionary theory, which Harrison she insisted every thinking person should read, she saw a lens on the human soul and its constellation in societies, saw “how the whole of animal life sets towards the making of the individual, and yet how the individual never is, never can be, complete,” saw how science and spirituality both reach for that “invisible prepotent force on which and through which we can possibly act, with which we are in some way connected.” She believed in the power of collective consciousness and equally in “the value of each individual manifestation of life,” and above all in the merging of the two in “the strange new joy, and even ecstasy, that comes of human sympathy.” </p>\n<p>She cherished the “inward and abiding patience” of science, its “gentleness” in understanding the true timescales of change, how long it takes to uproot an invasive untruth from the garden of culture. Religion she regarded as a “necessary step in the evolution of human thought,” but she detested its dogmas — its “net of illusive clarity cast over life and its realities,” the way its doctrines “distract attention from that divinity which is ourselves.” She sought to understand the need for it: “Man,” she wrote when we were all men, “feels and acts, and out of his feeling and action, projected into his con­fused thinking, he develops a god.” Her god was not our maker but our making, not a pacifier for the lonely confusion of being a self but a clarifying force for the cosmos of connection between us and everything that is — that recognition of universal consciousness she believed not only is “the new religion for which the world wait” but “already is, if unconsciously, our religion.” She insisted that in order to attain “real freedom and full individual life, life based on sympathy and mutual interdependence,” we must place this recognition at the center of our institutions. “Repression, vengeance, disunion, are the keynotes of our old disastrous system,” she warned in the first year of the world’s first global war, urging us to take “a step, and a big one, out of the prison of self.”</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://society6.com/product/i-do-not-know-what-it-is-except-that-it-is-grand-and-that-it-is-happiness_print?sku=s6-8967947p4a1v45?curator=brainpicker\">\n        <graphic data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass13.jpg?resize=680%2C854&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"854\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64206\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass13.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass13.jpg?resize=240%2C301&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass13.jpg?resize=320%2C402&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass13.jpg?resize=768%2C964&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass13.jpg?resize=600%2C754&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2018/04/11/leaves-of-grass-margaret-cook/\">rare 1913 edition</a>of Whitman’s</p>\n<p><i>Leaves of Grass</i>.

These days, reporters conduct much of their research before someone dies, to better highlight his or her importance. The newspaper has already decided that the deceased deserves to count among history's greats.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ledevoir.com/opinion/chroniques/906721/propos-pierre-nora\">version</a>of this column originally ran in</p>\n<p><i>Le Devoir</i>on August 4, 2025. Translated from the French by Elettra Pauletto.</p>\n<p>When I was a young reporter, I envied my elders’ ability to write obituaries of famous people. Having the last word on someone renowned seemed to me like high-end journalism, especially when it appeared in leading newspapers like <i>Le Monde </i>and<i> The New York Times</i>. These days, reporters conduct much of their research before someone dies, to better highlight his or her importance. The newspaper has already decided that the deceased deserves to count among history’s greats.</p>\n<p>This was clearly the case for French historian Pierre Nora, who died on June 2. Featured on the front page of <i>Le Monde</i> with a prominent photo of the subject, Nora was celebrated ceremoniously as “a figure of Parisian intellectual life,”—author, founder of the journal <i>Le Débat</i>, and revered at “the prestigious publishing house” Gallimard, “where he curated collections on human sciences.” “One will no longer encounter the elegant figure” of this member of the Académie Française on Rue Gaston-Gallimard, a man who “called the shots on the life of ideas in France,” who “had become the essential ‘public historian’ for journalists to call on when they needed an opinion on changes in national sentiment.”</p>\n<p>You have to dig deep into Pierre Nora’s dazzling career to find the slightest hint of anything unseemly: <i>Le Monde</i> reports that “the English essayist Perry Anderson criticized <i>Le Débat</i> for its ‘consensual blandness’” without mentioning Anderson’s leftist politics and the controversy sparked by Nora’s public refusal to translate and publish <i>The Age of Extremes</i>, a highly acclaimed book written by English historian and Marxist Eric Hobsbawm. If <i>Le Monde</i> had referenced the Hobsbawm affair, they might have been obliged to quote Serge Halimi’s preface to the 2020 French edition, in which he comments on Nora’s “editorial fatwa” against Hobsbawm: “Published in an issue of his journal <i>Le Débat</i> largely devoted to Hobsbawm’s book, his pro domo plea constitutes one of the most enlightening—and most embarrassing—texts in the contemporary history of French intellectual life. Launching an 84-page debate in a publication that one edits about a work that one has previously refused to publish, and therefore to make known, constitutes, in itself, a form of exploitation.” However, “the main intellectual oddity […] lay elsewhere. […] his plea first invoked the ‘commercial’ reasons that would have prohibited the translation of the book in France.” Nora predicted sales of around 800 books. The edition of <i>The Age of Extremes</i> published by <i>Le Monde diplomatique</i> in 1998 sold more than 50,000 copies.</p>\n<p>A narrow-minded, anti-communist ideologue who succumbed to capitalist blindness? I’m not sure, but I want to add my part to his posthumous embarrassment.</p>\n<p>In January 1971, Stanley Hoffmann, a French-American historian at Harvard University, wrote a letter to his “friend” Nora at Gallimard summarizing a manuscript by a young colleague at Columbia University, Robert Paxton, which Hoffmann considered “of the highest order. It is a comprehensive study of the Vichy regime. […] in my opinion the most brilliant contribution to date on this sad regime. Mr. Paxton has done what no French author has thought of doing: he has studied the German archives and has drawn from them an interpretation that is both irrefutable and much more sinister than anything the regime’s opponents had said about it. In the process, he demolishes years and thousands of pages of Vichyist self-justification. […] It seems to me essential that his book be published in France.”</p>\n<p>Encouraged by Hoffmann, Paxton sent his book to Nora on February 11, 1971, telling him it would be published in the United States by the prestigious publishing house Alfred A. Knopf. Nora responded on June 15, writing, “Your thesis has some merit and provides very useful insights. However, as I wrote to Stanley Hoffmann, in my opinion, it would need to be reworked to be published in French by a literary publishing house, since the French people still have access to some older, but still valid works. In short, I believe your book is neither general enough nor monographic enough to be easily publishable. I imagine that this mixed character is, conversely, what will make it successful in the United States.”</p>\n<p>Not quite. The book Nora thought would be so hard to publish in France caused a sensation there and completely transformed French people’s perception of their darkest national episode—indeed, “collaboration” with the Nazi occupiers turned out to be not so much double dealing as a deliberate effort by Marshal Pétain’s government to preempt the Germans in their anti-Jewish and fascist ambitions and involve France in a “full partnership in the new European order” and to start its own “national revolution.”</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://harpers.org/2025/09/speaking-of-pierre-nora-john-r-macarthur-publishers-note/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Young people around the world are experiencing an unprecedented crisis of unhappiness and poor mental health. Many observers blame the expansion of social media that began in 2012-13, as well as the long-term negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the social lives of the young, and no doubt those things have exacerbated the decline in mental health. But the causes of the current crisis run deeper. They have to do with the increasingly uncertain futures that the young face due to the changing nature of jobs and the more complex skill sets required to succeed in them; extreme political polarisation and misinformation; an erosion of global norms of peace and cooperation; the uncertainties posed by climate changes; and the decline in traditional civil society organisations – such as labour unions and church groups. Meanwhile, families play a bigger role in providing financial and social support in poor and middle-income countries than in rich ones, serving as a buffer in the face of this perfect storm of trends.</p>\n<p>There are many ways in which this crisis of unhappiness expresses itself. One is the recent disappearance of a long-established U-shaped curve in the relationship between age and happiness. Until recently, the nadir or low point was in the mid-life years, and both the young and the old had higher levels of happiness and other dimensions of wellbeing. This relationship <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-021-02773-w\">held</a> in most countries around the world, except for those that are extremely poor, have high levels of political violence, or both. Yet, since 2020, the relationship has <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w32337\">become</a> a linear upward trend in many countries in North America and Europe – and several in Latin America and Africa as well as Australia. This means that the least-happy group in these countries is now the young (those aged 18-34) and the happiest are those over the age of 55.</p>\n<p>A more extreme manifestation has been the increase in suicides, rise in reported anxiety and depression, and ‘epidemic’ levels of loneliness among the young, particularly in the <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37792968/\">United States</a> and the <a href=\"https://whatworkswellbeing.org/projects/loneliness-and-wellbeing-in-young-people/\">United Kingdom</a>. The US already has a crisis of ‘deaths of despair’; first identified as a problem of middle age by the economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton in 2015, such premature deaths due to suicide, drug overdoses and alcohol and other poisonings are now being <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7206a4.htm\">seen</a> in <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39352699/\">greater numbers</a> in the young, especially those Americans between the ages of 18-25. Youth unhappiness trends are particularly extreme in the US, in part due to its much more limited social support system for those who fall behind, the exorbitant costs of higher education and healthcare, and very high levels of gun violence – including in schools. As a result, there is a large and growing <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w31236\">mortality gap</a> between Americans with and without college degrees. Those with degrees live eight more years, on average, than those without. These are potentially overwhelming challenges for young people to navigate.</p>\n<p>This crisis matters because of the human costs, such as reduced longevity and significant gaps in quality of life, because those with mental illness are much less likely to complete higher education, and more likely to be in poor health and experience homelessness and other kinds of deprivation. They are also less likely to be in stable jobs and/or long-term relationships. Yet it also has deeper and more far-reaching implications as it reflects a lack of hope for the future among an entire generation in many countries, suggestive of a broad systemic failure that we do not fully understand.</p>\n<p>My research – and that of some <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39742439/\">others</a> – <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35125666/\">shows</a> that hope is a key factor in health and longevity, productivity, educational attainment and stable social relationships, among other things. The reason hope is so important, even more than current levels of wellbeing, is that integral to hope (as opposed to optimism) is having agency and potential pathways to a better future. Psychiatrists, for example, while they don’t provide examples of how to restore hope, <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-psychiatric-treatment/article/hope-in-psychiatry/324DF7F5D18B4EC148DD21D5619F4BB4\">note</a> that it is the critical first step to recovering from mental illness. Individuals with hope are more likely to believe in their futures and to invest in them, as well as to avoid risky behaviours that jeopardise them. In contrast, people in despair have reached a point where they literally do not care whether they live or die. Several studies find direct or indirect linkages between despair and other mental health disorders and <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-021-00006-y\">misinformation</a> and radicalisation, although there are also some studies that dispute the claim. While these manifestations are particularly extreme in the US, many other countries – especially in Europe – are also experiencing them.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/mentorship-and-hope-can-solve-the-youth-mental-health-crisis?utm_source=rss-feed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>The jukebox got its start earlier than you might think, but it truly became iconic when rock ‘n’ roll took over in the 1950s</h2>\n<p>Lisa Guerriero</p>\n<p>In 1889, a San Francisco tavern called the Palais Royale debuted a hot new attraction: a modified Edison phonograph that, when a customer inserted a nickel, played music from a single wax cylinder. Electrical sound amplification was still years away, so customers had to insert stethoscope-like tubes into their ears to hear anything, ideally toweling down the tubes afterward to remove earwax ahead of the next listener.</p>\n<p>Despite this unwieldy setup, the machine reportedly brought in more than $1,000 (some $34,000 today) in less than six months, and coin-operated music machines soon proliferated in bars, at drugstores and even in new listening parlors across the country. Alas, poor sound quality meant selections couldn’t be soft or subtle, so popular offerings included such earsplitting numbers as John Philip Sousa marches and the novelty whistler John Yorke AtLee performing popular ditties of the day. By the early 1900s, the machines struggled to compete against player pianos and other automated instruments that could entertain whole venues with higher-quality audio—and without requiring patrons to stick foreign objects into their delicate ear canals.</p>\n<p>But record players continued to improve in quality and volume, and pay-to-play phonographs made a huge comeback in the 1920s, paving the way for the jukebox era. In 1927, the Automatic<br/>\nMusical Instrument Company unveiled the first amplified, multi-record coin phonograph. Jukeboxes—they took on this nickname in the 1930s in reference to African American “juke joints” of the South—introduced the world to music on demand, for far less than buying a record (and on better equipment than people had at home). The boxes also reshaped the recording industry, as labels began releasing music specifically designed for post-Prohibition barrooms and cafés. Danceable big-band numbers and tunes like the “Beer Barrel Polka” were early hits, and the irrepressible popularity of jukeboxes soon rocketed artists like swing impresario Glenn Miller to national fame, creating an audience for loud, catchy, rollicking tunes, often played on newly electrified instruments, shaping what would become country, R &amp; B and rock ’n’ roll. </p>\n<p>Jukebox operators came to account for a majority of record sales, as they frequently changed out selections to keep customers dropping nickels. Using meters within the machines, operators could track which tunes were most popular at which locations, and they programmed boxes accordingly, offering a mix of national hits and more regionally specific selections. The latter included many tunes by Black and working-class musicians, in folk genres such as country and blues that tended to get scant airplay on the radio of the day but soon found appreciative listeners on jukeboxes.</p>\n<p>By the early 1940s, about 500,000 jukeboxes dotted the country, sometimes inspiring <i>too</i> much of a ruckus: Newspapers frequently reported on bar fights over music selections and complaints about noise. Snootier critics, meanwhile, voiced more petulant grievances: “The contrivance is everywhere and is always booming its inanities,” one <i>Los Angeles Times</i> writer lamented in 1941.</p>\n<p>But jukeboxes had a chance to prove their patriotic bona fides during World War II, when they provided vital entertainment on military bases and at troops’ canteens, sometimes on machines donated by public-spirited American operators—not a single nickel required. “Not even the cacophony of war can dull the magic power of Wurlitzer Automatic Phonograph music,” boasted a 1944 ad. At the same time, a number of jukebox manufacturers, including Wurlitzer, retooled factories for weapons production.</p>\n<p>After the war, stylish and streamlined jukebox cabinets in diners let teenagers listen to rock ’n’ roll at volumes generally impossible (or at least inadvisable) to achieve at home. Jukeboxes became indelibly associated with 1950s youth culture, the songs selected as easily as ordering a diner burger or milkshake. Jukebox operators now furnished teenage canteens, modeled after the military rest spots where the boxes had helped entertain the youth of the previous decade. The format of hit-after-hit music queues also helped inspire teen-friendly Top 40 radio, replacing older formats that defaulted to playing several songs in a row by a single artist.</p>\n<p>Over the next couple of decades, jukeboxes would see their numbers dwindle as fans turned to other sources of entertainment, including increasingly high-fidelity home stereos, television and the transistor radio, where Top 40 countdowns now introduced listeners to hits. “Sound of jukebox is fading melody,” reported one Associated Press headline in 1982, estimating jukebox numbers in the United States had fallen by more than half since the 1950s, while video games became the main draw in coin-operated entertainment. Yet decades later, jukeboxes—many now digital—continue to ring out across the U.S. And the idea that public establishments should offer a curated selection of recorded music, whether individual patrons like it or not, has become nearly ubiquitous. We’re living, and listening, in a world these machines created.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>While America thronged to the jukebox, mobsters often controlled the action</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>By Teddy Brokaw</i>\n    </p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/colorful-scandalous-true-history-machine-created-american-pop-180987173/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The Latin root of <i>notice</i> is to begin knowing, to have an instrument of recognition, and yet human consciousness is <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/06/20/the-experience-machine-andy-clark/\">a prediction machine</a> that recognizes only what it already knows, sees what it expects to see, lensed through its anticipations and past experience. “Right now, you are missing the vast majority of what is happening around you,” cognitive scientist Alexandra Horowitz wrote about <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/08/12/on-looking-eleven-walks-with-expert-eyes/\">the science of looking</a>. “To see takes time, like to have a friend takes time,” Georgia O’Keeffe wrote a century earlier about <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2018/11/15/georgia-okeeffe-flower/\">the art of seeing</a>. </p>\n<p>It does not come easily to us, true noticing — that transmutation of looking into seeing. We must apprentice ourselves to it daily. It is our life’s work.</p>\n<p>The best apprenticeship I know is spending time in nature, there amid the ceaseless quivering of phenomena and quickening of aliveness, the deep stillnesses and broad silences, all the dazzling othernesses with their myriad <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/10/21/iris-murdoch-unselfing/\">occasions for unselfing</a>. The second best is poet Lia Purpura’s magnificent essay collection <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Looking-Essays-Lia-Purpura/dp/1932511393/?tag=braipick-20\">On Looking</a> (</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/779828929\">) — an invitation to see the world whole by apprehending its details and the dialogue between them: church spires and glaciers and seventeenth-century Dutch paintings, the wings of the house fly “gently veined like a fine pen drawing of tributaries,” the late-afternoon light silvering the sardines in the open can. What emerges is a reckoning with the way “events crosshatch” and “particulars mingle, particulars assert, conspire, assemble,” so that “the moments go layering up” to stratify life into the shape of being.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Purpura writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If looking… is a practice, a form of attention paid, which is, for many, the essence of prayer, it is the sole practice I had available to me as a child.

    "body": "<p>Sound is life. The sound of God’s voice created life, in Christian understanding. In the womb, sound is the first of the senses to apprehend the world beyond the body: a fetus is able to hear their mother’s voice, while a chick in the egg hears the song of its parent birds. Hearing is thought to be the last sense to leave us in our dying, and we speak of the silence of the grave.</p>\n<p>Healing has traditionally been associated with sound, from the psychological medicine of a lullaby to the chants of monks and nuns in the early hospitals of monasteries, convents and religious centres. The incantations of shamans are some of the oldest of medicines. Melody and song are understood to have healing qualities, ancient and modern, from gong baths to Brian Eno’s album <i>Ambient 1:</i><i> Music for Airports</i> (1978). When something is well, we say it is ‘sound’.</p>\n<p>The body is well when it is in harmony with itself, in its inner balance of homeostasis. In traditional Navajo culture, medicine people are known as ‘Singers’ whose healing work seeks to restore harmony within the individual, and more widely to attune a person with other humans and the world.</p>\n<p>Nature’s sounds are healing. The sound of a rainforest; the flowing of a stream; a cascade of a waterfall; frogsong, insect rhythms and birdsong: these heal and salve. We humans as a species were born into our existence hearing the mother-voice of nature and the primal song of the animal musicians who were there before us, drumming, carolling, whistling and hooting.</p>\n<p>Hearing the sounds of animals, whose bodies thrum with their calls, we experience viscerally the truths of our existence: that we are manifested creatures, wholly embodied, and that ours is but one voice among many in a gorgeously plural world-choir, where giraffes hum in low voices caressing each other on a savannah evening, where bitterns boom at dawn by a quiet lake, where hedgehogs snore, in a rising half-voiced wheep and exhaled whiffle. Even when the sounds are in the deep infrasound range of elephants, lower than our hearing, we can still feel, right inside us, the deep pulses that throb the air.</p>\n<p>Through the sounds of nature, we may move into the fullness of what it is to be a person. That word ‘person’ is from the Latin, <i>persona</i>, the mask worn over the face in ancient classical theatre. <i>Persona</i> is understood to mean the sound (<i>son</i>) coming through (<i>per</i>) the mask. But arguably there is something deeper going on. We are resounders, and perhaps to be a true and fully well person includes being permeated by the sounds that pass through us, being a sounding-board for millipede, muntjac and muskrat. A person is an instrument of listening, played by the everything that surrounds them, resonating with goat-song and puffin-joke and camel-carol. Our bodies rung by the wild voices, the bells, blowings and buglings of life, conducting us to that place both electric and tender where we can feel most fully alive.</p>\n<p>In the sickening days of the COVID-19 pandemic, people heard – as if newly – the birdsong. Momentarily, in that world-hour, our droning machinery and technics fell quiet, and we could hear the voices of life in its self-befriending, and the soaring spiritedness of the music of birds lifted people’s morale. Not cured but surely healed.</p>\n<p>Birds embody the very quick of things, vitality intensifying the living air that is their element</p>\n<p>Birdsong is the quintessential <a href=\"https://psyche.co/guides/learn-to-tune-into-birdsong-respite-and-fascination-await\">healing sound</a> of nature. In myth, the Irish goddess Clíodhna cared for three magic birds with songs so sweet they cured every illness. In Welsh myth, the birds of Rhiannon sang so exquisitely that their music banished sadness and, listening to them, 80 years would slip by as if it were a day, and there was no memory of sorrow. In Berlin in times gone by, people said, if someone was sick or near death, they would ask to be carried out into the streets at night to hear a nightingale sing for them. Berlin today is the capital city of nightingales, home to more of the birds than almost any other European city.</p>\n<p>Birdsong is both fleet and fleeting, fast and evanescent. Quick and quickening, it touches the quick of the spirit. It quickens the woodlands with liveliness, as to be quick also means to be alive, as in ‘the quick and the dead’. Birds embody the very quick of things, vitality or the life force intensifying the <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/why-birds-dont-buy-bentleys-and-we-humans-will-never-fly\">living air</a> that is their element. A world without birds is not only silent, it is dead and deadening.</p>\n<p>Researchers from King’s College London have <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-20207-6\">demonstrated</a> that seeing or hearing birds improves mental wellbeing and helps to lift depression, and the healing effect can last for up to eight hours. A <a href=\"https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/geo2.127\">study</a> based on data from Michigan in the United States found that areas with lower bird diversity have more hospitalisations for mental health conditions than areas with higher bird diversity, suggesting that declining biodiversity may be intricately connected with anxiety and mood.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/why-we-should-tune-into-the-orchestra-of-the-animal-world?utm_source=rss-feed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Photo: Phoebe d'Heurle</p><p>The Rape of the Sabine Women, an episode in which Rome’s legendary founders forcibly abducted brides from a nearby community, has been a popular subject in painting and sculpture since the Renaissance—so popular, in fact, that we may miss the brutality of the original myth. “There’s almost this sense of familiarity-blindness to these stories,” says American artist Jesse Mockrin, who depicts the Sabine drama from the perspective of the women themselves in her large-scale 2024 painting <i>The Descent</i>, one of more than 12 new works on view in a solo exhibition opening at Toronto’s Art Gallery of Ontario in September.</p><p>Riffing off 16th- and 17th-century Baroque artists like Caravaggio and Peter Paul Rubens, who brought new levels of technical virtuosity and theatrical flair to scenes from the Bible and mythology, Mockrin asks viewers to reconsider themes of sex, gender and violence that run through the Western canon. At the same time, she resists the contemporary cultural impulse to tear down statues and reject our past for its flaws. “I think the old masters were masters. … I feel like a fan to some extent,” she confesses. “I also feel like I can be critical of the messages inherent in those works, and conscious of trying to update them to a female perspective, in this moment.”</p><h4>Did You Know?

    "body": "<h2>In eastern Massachusetts, flooded wetlands cover the landscape as farmers collect the crop that features on Thanksgiving tables nationwide</h2>\n<p>Each fall in eastern Massachusetts, people gather to watch the cranberry harvest. The berries grow in a dry bog over the course of 16 months, and in October or November, farmers flood the area with water. A machine known colloquially as an eggbeater knocks the tiny red orbs off of their vines and they float to the surface, making it easy for workers to corral them and pump them into a nearby truck. It’s a visually mesmerizing process, and photographer Joanna L. Steidle knew she wanted to capture it from above with a drone. “Carver, Massachusetts, is home to the Ocean Spray cooperative, and it’s enormous,” Steidle said, referring to the company that sells the leading brand of cranberry juice. “The farms were up and down the whole road. As we were flying the drone, we could see massive, empty trucks coming into the bogs and full trucks leaving.”</p>\n<p>Long before the descendants of European colonists began growing cranberries on such a grand scale, the native Wampanoag people used to pick the wild varieties called <i>sasumuneash</i>, adding them to squash, puddings, breads and meat. They also used the berries medicinally, to reduce fevers and swelling. </p>\n<p>Cranberries may well have been on the table at the first Thanksgiving dinner in 1621, when newly arrived English families sat down with their Wampanoag neighbors to celebrate the harvest. The berries became a staple of the autumn holiday, mainly because they ripened at the right time of year. The 1796 edition of <i>American Cookery</i>, the first cookbook published in the United States, included a recipe for a cranberry dessert, as well as recipes for turkey, potatoes and apple pie. (The author, Amelia Simmons—who described herself as “an American orphan”—also gave detailed instructions on how to cook and dress a turtle, but that dish never made it to the traditional Thanksgiving table.)</p>\n<p>Photographer Joanna Steidle has advice for other drone photographers who want to find the best shots in new areas.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>&#13;\n\t<p>Be aware of privacy issues, especially if you’re shooting a scene you can’t easily see from the road.</p></li>\n      <li>&#13;\n\t<p>Before you start shooting pictures, take the drone up and film a 360-degree video of the scenery. Then analyze the footage to find hidden gems in the landscape.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Nobody actively cultivated and marketed cranberries until 1816, when Henry Hall, a Massachusetts farmer and Revolutionary War veteran, noticed that the wild cranberries on his property thrived when sand blew over them. The sand helped push the roots of the vines more deeply into the earth, which made them more productive. It also proved to be a natural form of pest control and suppressed weeds and fungi. Hall started intentionally growing the berries this way, and others copied his methods.</p>\n<p>Massachusetts soon became known for its enormous cranberry industry. In the early days, harvesting the berries was extremely labor-intensive. Farmers and their families had to pick each individual berry by hand. In the 1880s, people began making use of a newly invented cranberry scoop. The top of the tool was designed to rake through the vines, loosening the berries, which would then fall into a receptacle. During cranberry-picking season, local schools excused children so they could help their families scoop up all the berries.</p>\n<p>In 1912, Marcus L. Urann, the head of the United Cape Cod Cranberry Company, began canning cranberry sauce for year-round use. He also innovated the cranberry syrup that became a staple for mixed drinks. Over time, Urann joined forces with other cranberry companies and the enterprise evolved into Ocean Spray, which began producing its now-familiar jellied cranberry “log” in 1941. Ocean Spray is still a cooperative of around 700 separate cranberry growers.</p>\n<p>Starting in the 1960s, farmers began flooding their bogs, which cut down dramatically on labor. Most types of berries can’t be harvested in this way—they would sink to the bottom. But each cranberry has four air pockets inside, an evolutionary feature that makes it easier for the berries to float downstream and spread their seeds to new areas. Farmers in previous eras had figured out that they could separate ripe cranberries from overripe and underripe ones by testing how well they bounced. That same buoyancy allowed ripe berries to float to the surface of a flooded bog, making it much easier for harvesters to scoop them up and transport them to the processing plant.</p>\n<p>When Steidle set out to photograph the harvest last fall, she contacted Betty Wiley, a fellow photographer she knew and admired via Instagram. Wiley had lived on Cape Cod for nearly two decades, and she’d spent many autumn days documenting the cranberry harvesting process. “I have images at ground level, lying on my stomach with the cranberries flying,” Wiley said. “When it’s sunny outside and the light hits the cranberries, they’re just this brilliant shade of red. It’s absolutely beautiful.”</p>\n<p>The scene was entirely different from high above, as Steidle and Wiley watched workers use long, movable barriers called booms to nudge the cranberries together. “We’re getting bit by bugs, we’re feeling the sun on our face, we’re watching these people hard at work, not missing a beat with all this machinery—and then the berries are floating up in all different abstract designs and swirls,” Steidle said. “You’re just sitting there, and the whole shape is changing.”</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/photos-harvesting-cranberries-transform-annual-ritual-shimmering-spectacle-180987170/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Publications including “Mademoiselle,” “Glamour” and the long-forgortten “Charm” first emerged in the 1930s to satisfy an emergent force in the workplace</h2>\n<p><i>Charm</i>amid traffic on Park Avenue. William Helburn / Getty Images</p>\n<p>Sometime during the Great Depression, a high school student named Helen Ralston complained to her father that she and her friends were fed up with <i>Vogue </i>and <i>Harper’s Bazaar</i>. The French couture and luxurious lifestyles promoted in their pages were unattainable, she said, while the articles did not speak to the interests of young women or girls her age. There were another 40-odd women’s magazines on the market, but all were aimed at housewives. </p>\n<p>Luckily for Helen, her father, Henry W. Ralston, a vice president of the New York publishing company Street &amp; Smith, was in a position to address her concerns. Since the 19th century, his firm had been turning out men’s and boys’ fiction by authors like Horatio Alger and Bret Harte, plus pulps and comic books like <i>Detective Story</i> and <i>Buffalo Bill</i>. Fired by this bracing wisdom from his daughter, in February 1935, Henry and his colleagues introduced <i>Mademoiselle</i>, the country’s first magazine for young women, which also became the first “career-girl” magazine in the United States. </p>\n<p>The extraordinary early history of <i>Mademoiselle</i>, and of the similar publications it inspired, is little known. A close study of their archives reveals an era of remarkable advancements for American women—poignant, as it proved so fragile. Nonetheless, these women writers and editors helped write an early and important draft of 20th-century American feminism. And they did it in style. </p>\n<p><i>Mademoiselle</i>’s first issue, conceived by a primarily male editorial team, got off to an inauspicious start. Later a newsagent told the editors that its few buyers were mostly men who, drawn by the saucy French name—and perhaps also by the cover photo, of a woman in a backless evening gown—mistakenly assumed it was a “girlie book.” Instead, the issue contained a grab bag of material concocted for a youthful female reader, including fashion sketches, girls’ adventure stories and overwrought tales of romance, one concerning a Southern gent who shocks himself by falling for a Yankee at a ball. Humiliated by low sales, the editors swiftly withdrew the sorry experiment from newsstands and halted publication for a month to regroup. </p>\n<p>Thankfully, by then they had hired Betsy Talbot Blackwell, a 29-year-old journalist with more than a decade’s experience in fashion reporting and marketing. Blackwell also had an adolescent stepdaughter, an impressive bullpen of writer friends on whom she could call and above all a keen sense of what young women wanted: something totally unlike their mothers’ magazines.</p>\n<p><i>Mademoiselle</i> originally targeted women between the ages of 18 and 30, all of whom had come of age knowing they could vote. “What nobody seemed to have noticed was that women had changed,” Blackwell later reflected. “Younger women were in revolt. Their ideas were different from their mothers’....They were not interested solely in recipes or babies. They were going to college. They were getting jobs.” </p>\n<p>She went after college women, publishing first-rate writing by authors like the wildly popular French writer of the day known as Colette, and pulling together an advisory “College Board” of students, who sent in tips about fashions and social trends. The magazine drew more eyeballs with an annual August “Guest Editors” issue, also assembled by students. This gambit, for which <i>Mademoiselle</i> is best remembered today, later helped launch literary stars like Sylvia Plath and Joan Didion. </p>\n<p>Other attention-getting ploys included a series in which a Hollywood makeup artist revealed beauty tricks used by actresses, adapted for home use. When a self-described “homely” nurse wrote in, begging <i>Mademoiselle</i> to transform her “from ugly duckling even into a pale pink swan,” the editors created the first makeover. Nurse Barbara’s metamorphosis made national news, winning a page of admiring coverage in <i>Time</i> magazine. </p>\n<p>While more makeovers followed, <i>Mademoiselle’s</i> early success was born of Blackwell’s radical notion that women were thinking, independent-minded beings, not mere domestic helpmeets. From the very first issue, she also championed the cause of what she later termed “a fast-growing, forgotten minority group, the career girl.” Not long before, unemployment had been so dire, overtaking a quarter of the population in 1933, that school boards and banks and many other employers fired married women to ensure jobs went to men, says Nelson Lichtenstein, a historian at the University of California, Santa Barbara. “They said, ‘We’re defending the family,’” Lichtenstein observes of these employers. “They weren’t ashamed.” </p>\n<p>Now came <i>Mademoiselle</i>, offering frank advice about where and how savvy women could find work. Its career column, flippantly titled “I Don’t Want to Play the Harp,” was aimed at those who “would rather fly an ocean, split an atom, set a style” than stay home cultivating feminine charms. Written by Helen Josephy—a well-known journalist, like most <i>Made</i><i>moiselle</i> contributors—the first offered a deeply reported account of how to break into radio. Josephy covered a different profession each month. </p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/first-magazines-written-for-career-women-reveal-portrait-immense-creativity-hope-180987174/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In 2000, Bill Joy, the co-founder and chief scientist of the computer company Sun Microsystems, sounded an alarm about technology. In an article in <i>Wired</i> titled ‘Why the Future Doesn’t Need Us’, Joy wrote that we should ‘limit development of the technologies that are too dangerous, by limiting our pursuit of certain kinds of knowledge.’ He feared a future in which our inventions casually wipe us from the face of the planet.</p>\n<p>The concerns expressed in Joy’s article, which prompted accusations of Luddism from tech advocates, sound remarkably similar to those now being voiced by some leaders in Silicon Valley that artificial intelligence might soon surpass us in intelligence and decide we humans are expendable. However, while ‘sentient robots’ were a part of what had spooked Joy, his main worry was about another technology that he figured might make that prospect imminently possible. He was troubled by nanotechnology: the engineering of matter at the scale of nanometres, comparable to the size of molecules.</p>\n<p>In fact, it would be more accurate to say Joy was troubled by the version of nanotechnology that he had read about in the book <i>Engines of Creation </i>(1986) by the engineer K Eric Drexler, a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. At the close of the 20th century, it was nanotechnology, not AI (which didn’t seem to be getting very far), that loomed large as the enabler of utopias and dystopias. Drexler’s book described a vision of nanotech that could work wonders, promising, in Joy’s words, ‘incredibly low-cost solar power, cures for cancer and the common cold’ as well as ‘[low-cost] spaceflight … and restoration of extinct species.’</p>\n<p>But Joy had learnt from the inventor Ray Kurzweil (now a scientific adviser to Google) that Drexler’s nanotech promised something yet more remarkable: the singularity, a point at which our accelerating technological prowess reaches escape velocity and literal marvels become possible – in particular, immortality through the merging of human and machine, so that we could upload our minds to computers and live forever in a digital nirvana.</p>\n<p>‘[N]anotechnology-based manufacturing devices in the 2020s will be capable of creating almost any physical product from inexpensive raw materials and information,’ Kurzweil wrote in his book <i>The Singularity Is Near </i>(2005). The technology ‘will provide tools to effectively combat poverty, clean up our environment, overcome disease, extend human longevity, and many other worthwhile pursuits.’</p>\n<p>But, Joy learned, there was a downside to all this. Drexler’s nanotechnology could get out of hand, unleashing swarms of invisibly tiny nano-robots that blindly start pulling everything apart, atom by atom, until they have reduced the world to what Drexler called ‘grey goo’. In the late 1990s, the grey-goo problem was the golem that, like ‘superintelligent AI’ today, might bring about our hubristic downfall.</p>\n<p>You might have noticed that none of this has happened. No cures for cancer, no mind-uploading immortality, but no grey goo either. This is because Drexler’s vision of nanotechnology was a chimera. It was like the philosophers’ stone of the alchemists: magic dressed in the science of its time, by means of which almost anything becomes possible. I call these <i>oneiric technologies</i>: they do not and quite probably cannot exist, but they fulfil a deep-rooted dream, or a nightmare, or both.</p>\n<p>These techno-fantasies are central to the utopias regularly forecast by tech billionaires</p>\n<p>These are not simply technologies of the future that we don’t yet have the means to realise, like the super-advanced technologies that Arthur C Clarke said we would be unable to distinguish from magic. Rather, oneiric technology takes a wish (or a terror) and clothes it in what looks like scientific raiment so that the uninitiated onlooker, and perhaps the dreamer, can no longer tell it apart from what is genuinely on the verge of the possible. Perpetual motion is one of the oldest oneiric technologies, although only since the 19th century have we known why it won’t work (this knowledge doesn’t discourage modern attempts, for example by allegedly exploiting the ‘quantum vacuum’); anti-gravity shielding is probably another.</p>\n<p>The oneiric technologies currently in vogue in Silicon Valley include the notion of <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/we-will-never-be-able-to-live-on-another-planet-heres-why\">terraforming</a> other planets, transforming their geosphere and atmosphere to render them inhabitable; <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/is-it-rational-to-think-we-can-cheat-death-with-cryonics\">cryonic freezing</a> of your head after death so that your consciousness can one day be rebooted; and the related idea of <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/what-are-our-ethical-obligations-to-future-ai-simulations\">mind-uploading</a> to computer circuits. These techno-fantasies are central to the utopias regularly forecast by tech billionaires. They interconnect in a nexus to which Drexlerian nanotechnology is central.</p>\n<p>It is worth looking into that particular dream, not just because of the parallels with the fantastical claims and fears about AI today, but because even now Drexlerian nanobots have not gone away. Kurzweil still cites them as the reason why his singularity is even ‘nearer’ – in 2024, he put it at 2045, at which point it will be possible to go (that is, to send nanobots) ‘inside the brain and capture everything in there.’ This implausible form of nanotechnology is still a part of Silicon Valley’s magical thinking, the aim of which, as the science writer Adam Becker says in his book <i>More Everything Forever</i> (2025), is to ‘tame the universe, to make it into a padded playground.’ No suffering, no death, no physical limits: a paradise shaped by ultra-libertarian – some say quasi-fascist – politics in which no one will tell you that anything is forbidden or impossible.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/no-suffering-no-death-no-limits-the-nanobots-pipe-dream?utm_source=rss-feed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>‘Most people are other people,’ wrote Oscar Wilde. ‘Their thoughts are some one else’s opinions, their lives a mimicry, their passions a quotation.’ This was obviously meant as a criticism, but what exactly is the criticism? Most people <i>are</i> other people, in a different sense to how Wilde meant it: the vast majority of people are not me. The enormous size of this majority – billions to one – guarantees that there will be somebody better than me at anything I can think of. If I make a dress for the first time, I am wise to follow a pattern. If I cook a meal for the first time, I am wise to follow a recipe. This is (as far as I know) my first time living as a human being, so why wouldn’t it be wise for me to emulate a successful model of living, especially when there are so many candidate models, past and present?</p>\n<p>When Wilde was writing, literary culture had reached the pinnacle of Romantic individualism. In that culture, it was obvious what’s wrong with being other people: doing so is a betrayal of your<i> true self</i>. Each of us was thought to possess a unique, individual identity, sewn into the very fabric of our being. Walt Whitman celebrated ‘the thought of Identity – yours for you, whoever you are, as mine for me,’ and defined it as: ‘The quality of BEING, in the object’s self, according to its own central idea and purpose, and of growing therefrom and thereto – not criticism by other standards, and adjustment thereto.’</p>\n<p>In the 20th century, the assumption would be famously challenged, for example by <a href=\"https://aeon.co/videos/sartre-and-the-existential-choice-in-fashioning-myself-i-fashion-humanity\">Jean-Paul Sartre</a>, who proclaimed that humans come into existence with no definite identity – no inborn ‘central idea and purpose’ at all: ‘man is nothing else but that which he makes of himself’. This is a logically tricky point, since it’s unclear how something devoid of all identity could ‘make itself’ into anything. We can’t suppose, for example, that it makes itself according to its whims, or inclinations, or desires, since if it has any of those then it already has an identity of some sort. This gets us into a quandary. <a href=\"https://aeon.co/videos/im-against-all-forms-of-oppression-simone-de-beauvoir-in-her-own-words-from-1959\">Simone de Beauvoir</a> – Sartre’s <a href=\"https://aeon.co/ideas/being-and-drunkenness-how-to-party-like-an-existentialist\">partner</a> in philosophy, life, and crime – responded to it by admitting that self-creation can work ‘only on a basis revealed by other men’.</p>\n<p>But popular culture has by and large responded by retreating uncritically to the old Romanticism. Apple’s Steve Jobs advised a graduating class at Stanford not to ‘let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice’ and to ‘have the courage to follow your heart and intuition’, which ‘somehow already know what you truly want to become’. Advertisements for shampoo and travel money apps advise you to dig deep inside and find the True You. The question of how we each came to be pre-programmed with this unique true identity, this articulate inner voice, is left aside, as is the more troubling question of how the advertisers can be so confident in betting that your true self is going to love their products.</p>\n<p>How would things look, philosophically, if we cleared this Romantic notion out of the picture? I think we can get a sense of it by looking at the great philosophical tradition that flourished before the formation of the Qin dynasty in what is now China. The most well-known philosopher from this tradition is Confucius (<i>Kong Qiu</i>, 孔丘), classically believed to have lived from 551 to 479 BCE. In reality, books ascribed to him were probably written by multiple authors over a long period. The most famous of these, the <i>Analects</i>, propounds an ethical ideal based on emulating admirable examples. The philosopher Amy Olberding wrote a whole book devoted to this topic, <i>Moral Exemplars in the Analects</i> (2012). For Confucius, being ‘other people’ is precisely what you <i>should</i> be aiming at – as long as you emulate praiseworthy people like the great sage-kings Yao and Shun or indeed Confucius himself. The objection that this would betray your true inborn identity doesn’t come up. The idea that we each have an individual, inborn, true identity doesn’t seem to appear in this tradition.</p>\n<p>Detail from a handscroll painting illustrating the ‘Nushi zhen’ (‘Admonitions of the Instructress of the Ladies in the Palace’), a text composed by Zhang Hua <i>c</i>232-300 CE.

Napoleon hated him for his impassioned anticolonial and abolitionist views.

Amid the scrumptious engravings of mountains, volcanos, and archeological artifacts is a series of strange, scintillating fragments from ancient Incan and Aztec pictorial hieroglyphics, full of faces and bodies, affect and action. </p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/aztechieroglyphics1_sm.jpg?resize=680%2C444&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/aztechieroglyphics2_sm.jpg?resize=680%2C628&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>The alphabets of most writing systems begin as pictograms. Europeans had certainly seen other ancient hieroglyphics — particularly the Egyptian, though the Rosetta Stone was yet to be decoded — but they were languages of symbolic logic composed of unfeeling graphic elements. Here was an entirely different visual alphabet of emotion and interaction — the OG emoji.</p>\n<p>Humboldt, who believed that we must “trace the mysterious course of ideas” across history in order to apprehend the world we live in, must have recognized the significance of this visual language for he devoted nearly half of the book’s expensive engravings to it, effectively introducing the ancient invention of emoji into the modern world.</p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/aztechieroglyphics4_sm.jpg?resize=680%2C525&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/aztechieroglyphics3_sm.jpg?resize=680%2C981&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    </p>\n<p><i>Vues des Cordillères</i> was so popular that its English translation was published by London’s trendiest publisher, who had brought Lord Byron to the world. </p>\n<p>Darwin was fifteen when he acquired his copy.</p>\n<p>No one can trace perfectly the golden threads of influence that link minds across generations and disciplines, or measure the unconscious quickenings of inspiration in the mind of another, or know the germination period of an idea. We only know that, as a young man, Darwin paged with a passionate curiosity through his scientific hero’s record of ancient emoji and, as an old man, he created a pioneering visual dictionary of human emotion.</p>\n<p>Although he had intended it as a chapter in <i>The Descent of Man</i>, he recognized the singular importance of the subject and published <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2011/11/11/darwins-camera/\"> The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals</a> as a stand-alone book a year later — one of the first scientific books illustrated with photography, a practice Anna Atkins had pioneered a generation earlier with </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/04/08/anna-atkins-algae/\">her self-published study of sea algae</a>.</p>\n<p>Depicting basic emotions like fear, anger, joy, sorrow, and disgust as “movements of the features and gestures,” Darwin’s dictionary of affect shares one crucial aspect with the Incan pictograms — both portray emotion as a phenomenon of the total human being, head to toe.</p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/darwin_emotionexpression1.jpg?resize=680%2C631&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/darwin_emotionexpression.jpg?resize=680%2C592&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/aztechieroglyphics4_detail.jpg?resize=680%2C194&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>“A purely disembodied human emotion is a nonentity,” William James would write a decade after <i>Expression</i> in his <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/01/11/what-is-an-emotion-william-james/\">landmark investigation of the physiology beneath the psychology of feeling</a>. The paradox of our time is that although we now know that <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/12/24/feeling-knowing-damasio/\">consciousness itself is a full-body phenomenon</a>, we have continued our campaign of denying the animal nature of the human animal by negating the significance, the relevance, the very fact of the body. Encountering each other as faces on screens, scaling startups rather than mountains, outsourcing our experience of the world to the disembodied pseudo-minds of AI, we have become disembodied ourselves. Our emoji reflect this willing amputation of the body, this cult of the head. “By its predilection for symbols,” Humboldt had written in <i>Kosmos</i> contemplating ancient cultures, “[the imagination] influences ideas and language.” Our symbols influence our ideas about what it means to be human and shape our imagination in turn. If we are to reclaim our creaturely aliveness, it may be time to reimagine our visual language and invent a new alphabet of embodied emoji. </p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t—<br/>\n\t\t\tPublished August 31, 2025<br/>\n\t\t\t—<br/>\n\t\t\thttps://www.themarginalian.org/2025/08/31/aztec-humboldt-darwin-emoji/<br/>\n\t\t\t—\n\t\t</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2025/08/31/aztec-humboldt-darwin-emoji/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Sanjay Patel enjoyed success on YouTube with his colorful shorts and is about to release a richly illustrated book that tells the story of the longest poem in the world</h2>\n<p>The<i> Mahabharata</i> is the longest epic in recorded history, seven times the length of Homer’s <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> put together. The Sanskrit verses, attributed to the ancient sage Vyasa (who is also a character in the tale), describe the events leading up to a massive war. The story, set some 5,000 years ago, is loaded with so many divinities, characters and subplots that one European scholar, writing in 1922, <a href=\"https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015074796577&amp;page=root&amp;view=1up&amp;size=100&amp;seq=8\">characterized</a> the <i>Mahabharata</i> as “the most monstrous chaos: Alongside the main narrative, there were veritable jungles of smaller narratives, as well as countless and endless teachings.”</p>\n<p>Sanjay Patel, an artist and former Pixar animator, cuts through these verbal jungles with clear, powerful images. His <a href=\"https://amzn.to/476vmyb\">2010 version of the  Ramayana</a>—another (shorter) Hindu epic—has already been </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DBJY6n-tQR8/\">added</a>to grade school classrooms across the United States. His animated 2023 YouTube series, “</p>\n<p><i>,” introduced Hindu stories to preschoolers, depicting the gods as adorable children. In his richly illustrated 400-page</i></p>\n<p><i>, Patel’s imagery takes on a more somber tone, with sharper angles and darker hues.</i></p>\n<p>It’s a serious story, but Patel hopes his retelling will capture the imaginations of middle schoolers like his oldest son, Arjun (who shares the name of the <i>Mahabharata</i>’s hero). “You have to remix these ideas,” he says, “if you want them to survive.”</p>\n<ul><li>The <i>Mahabharata</i>focuses on the Hindu concept of<i>dharma</i>—living in accord with one’s specific purpose on earth.</li></ul>\n<p>Patel spoke with <i>Smithsonian</i> magazine in advance of the book’s release this October.</p>\n<p><strong>You grew up in San Bernadino, California, with Indian immigrant parents. Did they read these epics to you when you were a kid?</strong></p>\n<p>Nothing was ever formally taught, but my parents had rituals. Every day, I’d have to participate in a meditation or puja practice. But I didn’t understand or appreciate what was behind these symbols and rites and rituals.</p>\n<p><strong>I remember that from “ Sanjay’s Super Team,” your Pixar animated short nominated for an Academy Award in 2016. You showed yourself as a little kid, imagining that the gods your father was worshiping were like the superheroes you liked to watch on TV. </strong></p>\n<p>Part of that story was poetic license. I absolutely was required to participate in these rituals. But my epiphany really came later on when I picked up a book of Hindu miniature paintings. Art was the medium that finally unlocked all these stories and philosophies. That was the context where it finally made sense to me. I started to see these gods as characters, and I sort of got underneath the philosophy that way.</p>\n<h3>\n        <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZ13P5X2?tag=smithsonianco-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\">\n          Mahabharata: Designs of Dharma\n        </a>\n      </h3>\n<p>Adapted and illustrated with both humor and heart for a contemporary audience, this stunning visual retelling of the Indian epic the Mahabharata features more than 400 pages of illustrated text in Academy Award-nominated animator Sanjay Patel’s iconic style.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZ13P5X2?tag=smithsonianco-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\"/></p>\n<p><strong>The Hindu gods are obviously very visual. They have multiple faces, or multiple arms holding weapons or books or musical instruments. That visual element seems to be built into the religion, as a way to understand what the gods represent. </strong></p>\n<p>I honestly think one of the strengths of Hinduism is that there’s no one dogma. There are a lot of symbols and rituals, but in many ways, it’s like a buffet of diverse options. There’s room for people to bring what they want to these symbols and images. If you want more, obviously there are thousands of years of writings about what these symbols and images mean. If you don’t want more, that’s fine too. You can just hang out with a cool image of elephant-headed <a href=\"https://amzn.to/47EvpBv\">Ganesha</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell me about the illustration from your  Mahabharata book where Krishna becomes enormous. </strong></p>\n<p>That’s the theophany [a deity manifesting himself in front of human beings]. I love that moment. I had the great fortune of getting a lot of guidance from <a href=\"https://www.religion.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/arti-dhand\">Arti Dhand</a>, a professor at the University of Toronto. She’s a <i>Mahabharata</i> scholar, and she has an amazing <a href=\"https://www.themahabharatapodcast.com/\">podcast</a>. Anybody who knows the text would know about one scene where Krishna reveals his cosmic form to the hero, Arjuna. But not as many people know about this other moment, a second theophany, where he reveals himself to the antagonist, Duryodhana. He’s trying to get Duryodhana to change his ways, to not start a war. Sadly, he doesn’t succeed.</p>\n<p><strong>You show Duryodhana as a tiny little wispy figure, silhouetted against Krishna’s huge image.</strong></p>\n<p>That’s the idea—a big cosmic form, a really intimidating image of Krishna—this fierce aspect of him looming over Duryodhana.</p>\n<p><strong>The open mouth is something you see a lot in images of Hindu gods, like  Kali, the fierce goddess who is usually shown with her tongue sticking out. </strong></p>\n<p>I love this idea of the mouth, of eating. We recycle energy, and we eat it, and then it gets reborn. There’s a story where Krishna is a baby. His mom catches him eating some dirt, and when she looks in his mouth, she sees the entire universe, all this cosmic energy. In my preschool show, “Ghee Happy,” I was excited about putting that grand, brain-breaking idea into a form little kids could understand. There’s a whole episode about something getting lost in Krishna’s mouth. Krishna has a portal mouth.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/veteran-pixar-animator-newest-book-epic-undertaking-began-5000-years-ago-180987179/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>The famously reclusive novelist amassed a collection of thousands of books ranging in topics from philosophical treatises to advanced mathematics to the naked mole-rat</h2>\n<p>Cormac McCarthy, one of the greatest novelists America has ever produced and one of the most private, had been dead for 13 months when I arrived at his final residence outside Santa Fe, New Mexico. It was a stately old adobe house, two stories high with beam-ends jutting out of the exterior walls, set back from a country road in a valley below the mountains. First built in 1892, the house was expanded and modernized in the 1970s and extensively modified by McCarthy himself, who, it turns out, was a self-taught architect as well as a master of literary fiction.</p>\n<p>I was invited to the house by two McCarthy scholars who were embroiled in a herculean endeavor. Working unpaid, with help from other volunteer scholars and occasional graduate students, they had taken it upon themselves to physically examine and digitally catalog every single book in McCarthy’s enormous and chaotically disorganized personal library. They were guessing it contained upwards of 20,000 volumes. By comparison, Ernest Hemingway, considered a voracious book collector, left behind a personal library of 9,000.</p>\n<p>What makes McCarthy’s library so intriguing is not just its size, nor the fact that very few people know about it. His books, many of which are annotated with margin comments, promise to reveal far more about this elusive literary giant than the few cagey interviews he gave when he was alive. For as long as people have been reading McCarthy, they have speculated about which books and authors informed and inspired his work, a subject he was loath to discuss. They have wondered about his interests and true personality because all he presented to the public was a reclusive, austere, inscrutable facade.</p>\n<p>When Bryan Giemza, a scholar of literature and humanities at Texas Tech University, offered me exclusive journalistic access to McCarthy’s library and the cataloging project, what he was really offering was an unprecedented insight into McCarthy’s life and work. As a further enticement, he said that Cormac’s younger brother Dennis McCarthy would be there. “Dennis probably knew him as well as anyone,” Giemza said.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Cormac McCarthy is an award-winning novelist whose works often explored the American West with darkness and complexity. Among McCarthy's many awards are a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1969, a MacArthur Fellowship in 1981, a Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2007 for <i>The Road</i>and a National Book award in 1992 for<i>All the Pretty Horses</i>.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>I parked behind the house between a silver 1966 Buick Riviera rusting on deflated tires and a weathered red Lincoln Mark VIII. These were among the last survivors of McCarthy’s little-known vehicle collection. Dennis had sold 13 other cars, including two Allard racing cars from the early 1950s, a 1992 Lotus and a Ford GT40 racing car. McCarthy, who labored in obscurity and chronic poverty until he was 60, became a multi-millionaire later in life and freely indulged his desires and obsessions, with classic sports cars high on the list. Most of the money came from Hollywood, which turned three of his novels—<i>All the Pretty Horses</i>, <i>No Country for Old Men</i> and <i>The Road</i>—into star-studded movies.</p>\n<p>I knocked on the imposing front door, an Indo-Portuguese antique made of teak and fortified with iron strappings, metal studs, flattened nails and small chains. There was no response, so I tried the handle. The door swung open and revealed a dimly lit hallway reduced to a narrow passage by head-high stacks of cardboard boxes on both sides. All those boxes were packed with books.</p>\n<p>The first room off the hallway—the room where McCarthy died at age 89—was now so crammed with book boxes that it was impenetrable. Scholars called it “the Beast Room.” The next room was nearly as full. One open box showed volumes about the architect Frank Lloyd Wright, country houses in Ireland, schizophrenia, African history and British antique rifle barrels.</p>\n<p>In the dining room, underneath a beautiful hanging light fixture of wood and colored glass that McCarthy designed and built himself, scholars were sitting at the table, scanning books’ ISBN bar codes through their phones into the library cataloging software on their laptops.</p>\n<p>I found Giemza in the living room, wrestling with an internet connectivity problem. “Cormac didn’t have Wi-Fi in the house, so we had to bring our own,” he said. Nor did McCarthy use a computer—ever. He typed out his pages on a cheap, durable Olivetti typewriter and, I learned later, did most of his work propped up on pillows in bed.</p>\n<p>The living room, like the house in general, had a sturdy, old-fashioned and decidedly masculine feel, but its clean lines were obscured by a chaotic overlay of clutter—mainly books, but also piles of nameless junk and hundreds of bowls, glasses and kitchenware items still in their packaging. Some of the book boxes and loose books had been moved into the room for the cataloging project, but not the rest of it. One of the first discoveries made by the visiting scholars was that McCarthy was something of a hoarder. His particular fixation on kitchenware, much of it bargain kitchenware, remains mysterious and a mark of his eccentricity.</p>\n<p><i>The Orchard Keeper</i>.

    "body": "<h3>By Maria Popova</h3>\n<p>“The book of love is full of music,” sing The Magnetic Fields. “In fact, that’s where music comes from.”</p>\n<p>The book of love is written in the language of wonder — our best means of loving life more deeply. To love anything — a person, a pond, the world — is to see the wonder in it, to hear the music in it. Both love and wonder are in mysterious conversation with the deepest substrate of us, the complete message of which is unintelligible to the analytical mind, inaccessible by any explanatory model. Both require a surrender to the musicality of the experience — a trust that the music is the message.</p>\n<p>In the late 1960s, just before philosopher Thomas Nagel challenged our notions of more-than-human consciousness with his catalytic essay “What Is It Like to Be a Bat?” and long before Robert Macfarlane challenged our notions of animacy by asking <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2025/05/30/robert-macfarlane-is-a-river-alive/\">whether a river is alive</a>, the Finnish sound researcher Antti Jansson began wondering about the inner life of water, of its unheard creatures. As John Cage was <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/07/05/where-the-heart-beats-john-cage-kay-larson/\">discovering the musicality of silence</a> while listening to his own nervous system in a sensory deprivation tank, Jansson — possibly a distant relative of beloved Moomins creator Tove Jansson — discovered the musicality of ponds. He grew particularly interested in the water boatman beetle <i>Cenocorixa</i>, capable of producing an astonishing 85 decibels — the noise level of New York City traffic — by rubbing its genitalia against its own body, much as <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/05/05/cicadas/\">cicadas play themselves</a>. </p>\n<p>Here was a whole new universe of bioacoustics, never before heard by human ears.</p>\n<p>Half a century later, philosopher and musician David Rothenberg picked up where Jansson left off, bringing rigor and tenderness to the world of animal sounds. After his fascinating exploration of <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/01/30/why-birds-sing/\">why birds sing</a>, he turned his compassionate curiosity to the most neglected recesses of nature’s sonic consciousness — the ponds that punctuate forests, savannas, and suburbs alike. </p>\n<p>As the human world grew quiet in the early pandemic, Rothenberg decided to drop a hydrophone into his local pond and just listen. To his astonishment, he discovered a portal into a secret universe of what he calls “undersound,” evocative of Rachel Carson’s landmark 1937 essay <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/02/28/undersea-rachel-carson/\"> Undersea</a>, which invited the terrestrial imagination for the first time to consider the hidden lives of the water world. </p>\n<p>“In the great silence of the brackish waters behind our homes,” he heard the voices of myriad unknown creatures joining together in something between the buzzing of the nervous system in an anechoic chamber and the wistful moan of the gyaling, the Buddhist oboe. He heard photosynthesis itself — the regular rhythm of plants exchanging oxygen through the water, a metronome for the wild symphony orchestra of insects. And all of it he rendered in sonograms — maps of sound frequency against time — revealing the layered complexity of undersound, “music between, music no one species could make alone.” He writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Go deep looking for one sound and you may find the meaning of all of them. Everything sings, everything sounds; it all swirls around us together.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>Hungry to discover more of this bioacoustic cosmos, he traveled to ponds all over the world, recording the bubbling of a passing turtle in Russell Wright’s Lost Pond in upstate New York and the late-night underwater calls of the painted frog in a pond at the Botanical Garden of Paris.</p>\n<p>Soon, as cellist Beatrice Harrison <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/06/05/the-cello-and-the-nightingales-beatrice-harrison/\">had done with the nightingales</a> a century earlier in what became the world’s first recorded interspecies musical collaboration, Rothenberg <a href=\"https://terranovamusic.bandcamp.com/album/secret-songs-of-ponds\">began accompanying the pond orchestra</a> — sometimes with his beloved contralto clarinet, sometimes with electronic instruments. </p>\n<p>It is mysterious, this universal impulse to join in with music, to sing along, to dance together. Conversation doesn’t seem to impel us in the same way. There, the impulse is often to counter and contradict rather than harmonize. Peter Gabriel (who has a magnificent cover of “The Book of Love”) articulates this perfectly when he runs into Rothenberg at an MIT conference:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>With music, people dance, fall in love, sing along. With words on a page, you make enemies. People turn their back on you and get ready to argue.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps this is because music trades in mystery, while conversation trades in opinion — that subterranean species of certainty. Rothenberg’s undersound is a “cavalcade of lilting unknowns” — no sonogram can discern exactly which creature makes which sound and for what reason. A century and a half before him, Thoreau had captured this while pacing Walden Pond:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>All sound heard at the greatest possible distance produces one and the same effect, a vibration of the universal lyre, just as the intervening atmosphere makes a distant ridge of earth interesting to our eyes by the azure tint it imparts.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>In his fascinating multimedia record of the project, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Secret-Sounds-Ponds-David-Rothenberg/dp/B0CPJM1221/?tag=braipick-20\">Secret Sounds of Ponds</a> (</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/1427259810\">), Rothenberg reflects:</a>\n    </p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2025/08/26/david-rothenberg-pond-sounds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Reality is not what you think it is. It is not the foundation of our joyful flourishing. It is not an eternally renewing resource, nor something that would, were it not for our excessive intervention and reckless consumption, continue to harmoniously expand into the future. The truth is that reality is not nearly so benevolent. Like everything else that exists – stars, microbes, oil, dolphins, shadows, dust and cities – we are nothing more than cups destined to shatter endlessly through time until there is nothing left to break. This, according to the conclusions of scientists over the past two centuries, is the quiet horror that structures existence itself.</p>\n<p>We might think this realisation belongs to the past – a closed chapter of 19th-century science – but we are still living through the consequences of the thermodynamic revolution. Just as the full metaphysical implications of the Copernican revolution took centuries to unfold, we have yet to fully grasp the philosophical and existential consequences of entropic decay. We have yet to conceive of reality as it truly is. Instead, philosophers cling to an ancient idea of the Universe in which everything keeps growing and flourishing. According to this view, existence is good. Reality is good.</p>\n<p>But what would our metaphysics and ethics look like if we learned that reality was <i>against</i> us?</p>\n<p>Apparently, life flourishes on Earth.<strong> </strong>Across the vast expanse of evolutionary time, living things seem to have veered toward greater complexity, diversity and abundance. Single-celled organisms gave rise to dense communities of bacteria. Trilobites evolved compound eyes with crystalline lenses of calcite. Animal brains split into two hemispheres, opening new frontiers of thought. Even after five mass extinctions swept the planet, life returned again and again, branching into countless variations of form and function in a ceaseless unfolding of renewal. When we look, we can find this ‘creativity’ all around us: in the weeds forcing their way through cracks in city pavements, in the scent of wet earth as fungi bloom, in the sound of children learning to speak.</p>\n<p>Such accounts of life on Earth suggest there is a logic to all this change: the Universe is not static, but always <i>becoming</i>, always moving toward new orders, new complexities, new forms of life and thought. This vision of reality as something generative – perpetually changing for the benefit and flourishing of all it creates – has dominated Western philosophy since its inception. It lies at the heart of our metaphysics (the speculative science of what it means to be), as well as our ethical intuitions and aesthetic ideals. Indeed, from Plato onwards, philosophers have generally agreed that living well means aligning with the rational order of the cosmos. ‘Live in accordance with nature,’ Marcus Aurelius urges in his <i>Meditations. </i>For these thinkers, <i>nature </i>serves as the ethical guide for our actions and the lodestone of our aesthetic ideals because it embodies something good.</p>\n<p>Our most excessive actions as a species are perfectly in keeping with the ultimate aims of the Universe</p>\n<p>Even in the 21st century, this picture of the Universe informs how we think we should live. It fuels our moral handwringing over the so-called Anthropocene, the notion that our planet has been fundamentally altered by human action. It motivates our attempts to develop ‘sustainable’ environmental policies and drives our escapist fantasies of ‘getting back to nature’. All that is wrong might be put to rights, we think, if only we could find a way to live within the purely creative and inherently benevolent order of existence.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, these long-held assumptions and aspirations are no longer tenable. In fact, our most excessive actions as a species – destroying rainforests, causing widespread extinction, altering the ocean’s chemistry, ‘time-bombing the future’ with forever chemicals and more – are perfectly in keeping with the ultimate aims of the Universe.</p>\n<p>Reality, as we now understand, does not tend towards existential flourishing and eternal becoming. Instead, systems collapse, things break down, and time tends irreversibly towards disorder and eventual annihilation. Rather than something to align with, the Universe appears to be fundamentally <i>hostile</i> to our wellbeing.</p>\n<p>According to the laws of thermodynamics, all that exists does so solely to consume, destroy and extinguish, and in this way to accelerate the slide toward cosmic obliteration. For these reasons, the thermodynamic revolution in our understanding of the order and operation of reality is more than a scientific development. It is also more than a simple revision of our understanding of the flow of heat, and it does more than help us design more efficient engines. It ruptures our commonly held beliefs concerning the nature and value of existence, and it demands a new metaphysics, bold new ethical principles and alternative aesthetic models.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/philosophers-must-reckon-with-the-meaning-of-thermodynamics?utm_source=rss-feed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In this work, the Australian animator Nelson Armstrong adapts images painted on their pottery into lush moving visuals capturing life in this remote, beauteous landscape, where the seasons are split between Eturna (hot season) and Lhurrpa (cold season). These colourful, intricately patterned images are paired with immersive sound designs depicting heavy rains, people swimming in rivers, sea life swimming below fishing lines, birds nesting and squawking, lizards scraping red desert sand and more. The result is a rich and wondrous depiction of the landscape, born of the artists’ deep knowledge of and connection to the natural world.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a

    "body": "<h2>A man of the people, the artist put his money where his mouth was by visiting prisons around the country and performing the song</h2>\n<p>On July 30, 1955, a relatively unknown Johnny Cash stepped up to the microphone at Sam Phillips’ <a href=\"https://www.sunstudio.com/\">Sun Studio</a>, accompanied by the Tennessee Two (Luther Perkins on guitar and Marshall Grant on bass), to <a href=\"https://folsomcasharttrail.com/the-trail/blog/the-song-that-changed-a-nation-67-years-of-folsom-prison-blues\">record</a> “Folsom Prison Blues”—an original song he’d written while serving in the U.S. Air Force, feeling a similar kind of loneliness and isolation to a prisoner. There was no money for a drummer, so, to create a snare drum sound, it’s said he <a href=\"https://americansongwriter.com/on-this-day-in-1956-johnny-cash-debuted-the-dollar-bill-trick-that-would-define-his-signature-sound/#:~:text=Cash%20didn\"t%20have%20access,and%20play%20it%20that%20way.\">stuck a dollar bill</a> under his guitar strings that he would strum. Though the single went on to moderate success on<i> Billboard</i>’s country and western chart, reaching No. 4 in 1956, it wouldn’t achieve international acclaim until Cash performed the song for prisoners at Folsom Prison, about 20 miles northeast of Sacramento, on January 13, 1968. The live recording on his <i>At</i> <i>Folsom Prison</i> album reached No. 1 on the country singles chart later that year, on July 20.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Johnny Cash testified at a U.S. Senate judiciary subcommittee hearing on prison reform in 1972, advocating to keep minors out of jail and to focus on rehabilitating inmates.</li>\n      <li>The musician performed concerts at more than 30 prisons over the course of his career.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Throughout his five-decade career, Cash <a href=\"https://www.library.ca.gov/collections/online-exhibits/johnny-cash/#:~:text=Dozens%20of%20Prison%20Concerts,a%20California%20prison%20in%20Soledad.\">performed</a> for thousands of incarcerated people across the country, appearing in-concert at over 30 prisons, where he’d always include “Folsom Prison Blues” in his set. By showing them his respect, the inmates often felt he was one of their own and treated him in kind. Though he’d been arrested seven times for minor offenses, some due to his struggles with substance abuse, he never served prison time. Yet somehow, he found a way to relate to and empathize with prisoners while the rest of society turned their backs on them. He even <a href=\"https://www.library.ca.gov/collections/online-exhibits/johnny-cash/\">testified</a> before a U.S. Senate subcommittee on prison reform in 1972 and <a href=\"https://www.aca.org/common/Uploaded%20files/Publications_Carla/Docs/Corrections%20Today/2019%20Articles/Corrections_Today_Jan-Feb_2019_Johnny_Cash_By_Molly_Law.pdf#:~:text=Cash%20took%20every%20chance%20to%20talk%20about,reform%20and%20he%20did%20not%20stop%20at&amp;text=Like%20father%2C%20like%20daughter%2C.%20Roseanne%20Cash\"s%20%E2%80%9Cmind%20is%20on%20what%20it%20takes%20to.\">continued to advocate</a> for prison conditions with six sitting presidents.</p>\n<p>“My dad’s legacy endures because his particular combination of authenticity, empathy and great artistry is a rare and beautiful confirmation of the best parts of our humanity,” says daughter <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/rosanne-cash-discovering-new-artistic-terrain-180953047/\">Rosanne Cash</a>, “and those traits endure outside the cycle of trends and fads.”</p>\n<p>No matter the state of his popularity or size of the stage, Johnny Cash felt a duty to speak on behalf of all common folk. He felt a closeness toward often ignored and downtrodden segments of America, regardless of their color, creed or affiliation. “His lyrics appealed both to the likes of the men for whom he sang in Folsom Prison and to some of the world’s most respected political and religious leaders,” says Dan Rogers, senior vice president and executive producer of the <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/how-grand-opry-put-uniquely-american-music-center-stage-180986562/\">Grand Ole Opry</a>, where Cash first performed in 1956 and, despite a temporary ban due to an onstage light smashing incident in ’65 as a result of his addiction battles, was welcomed back a few years later.</p>\n<p><i>At Folsom Prison</i>album in 1968. Donaldson Collection/Getty Images</p>\n<p>Speaking truth to power, Cash decided, in 1964, to follow up the commercial success of his album <i>I Walk the Line </i>with a protest album titled <i>Bitter Tears: Ballads of the American Indian</i>, which featured songs by folk artist and activist <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1965/10/29/archives/peter-la-farge-33-folk-song-writer-is-found-dead-here.html\">Peter La Farge</a> and dealt with some of the injustices Indigenous people were speaking up against during the mid-1960s alongside other important campaigns, including the civil rights movement and women’s rights movement. Its lead single, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEwSwQtSmDQ\">“The Ballad of Ira Hayes,”</a> would find an audience, but not without a fight. When radio disc jockeys refused to play the song due to resistance toward and fear of publicly supporting Native Americans, Cash took out an ad in <i>Billboard</i> in the form of a personal letter and <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/racial-justice/where-are-your-guts-johnny-cashs-little-known-fight\">called them out</a>, asking “Where are your guts?” He bought back thousands of copies and decided to hand-deliver them to radio stations along with a note included. The song would eventually climb toward the top of the country charts.</p>\n<p>Throughout the ’60s and early ’70s, Cash felt closely identified with the American folk music revival, appearing at Newport Folk Festival in ’64 and ’69. He also formed a friendship with <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-real-story-behind-a-complete-unknown-and-bob-dylans-early-career-from-his-arrival-in-new-york-city-to-when-he-went-electric-180985672/\">Bob Dylan</a>, who was equally interested in country music, and appeared on Dylan’s <i>Nashville Skyline </i>album. Though their worlds appeared far apart, both men shared a deep bond over music and admiration for one another’s craft, as recently depicted in James Mangold’s Oscar-nominated film <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11563598/\"> A Complete Unknown</a>, co-written by Jay Cocks.</p>\n<p>Each time Cash faced a gatekeeper, he was determined to pick the lock or simply kick the door open with all of his might. Where musical genres helped categorize, and sometimes pigeonhole, artists in the industry, he seemed uninterested in being labeled as a singular musician. Country, gospel, folk, soul, blues, rock ’n’ roll, rockabilly and so on—it didn’t matter to him, because he loved and incorporated all of it, continuing to record and experiment with words and sounds that moved him into his final days in 2003.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/seventy-years-ago-johnny-cash-recorded-folsom-prison-blues-and-became-a-folk-hero-for-the-ignored-and-downtrodden-180987059/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>As the United States stood on the brink of World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt recognized the urgent need for innovative military strategies to effectively confront the impending global conflict. Observing the unfolding events in Europe, he realized that defeating the Axis powers would require pioneering approaches to warfare. Roosevelt turned to William J. Donovan, a trusted advisor and former informal emissary, to develop a visionary plan for a global intelligence collection agency.</p>\n<p>Donovan, a WWI veteran, drafted the “Establishment of Service of Strategic Information,” a detailed document outlining a groundbreaking framework for a centralized intelligence organization to coordinate the entire government and gather essential data for strategic planning. In his plan, Donovan emphasized that “strategy, without reliable information, is helpless. Likewise, information is useless unless intelligently directed toward strategic purposes.”</p>\n<p>Impressed by Donovan’s insight, President Roosevelt established the Coordinator of Information (COI)—the nation’s first national intelligence agency. This marked a pivotal moment in US history, as Roosevelt’s foresight and Donovan’s strategic acumen laid the groundwork for creating an entity that would revolutionize how the United States managed conflict during peacetime and war. Operating under the President’s Executive Office, the COI collected and analyzed information crucial to national security.</p>\n<h2>Breaking Boundaries: The Transition from COI to OSS</h2>\n<p>A year later, Donovan presented a transformative proposal to restructure the COI into an organization that included covert and clandestine operations in addition to intelligence gathering. He envisioned a new hybrid organization that would shift warfighting from traditional military tactics to unconventional approaches using sabotage, espionage, guerrilla warfare, and psychological operations. Believing in Donovan’s strategic expertise, President Roosevelt approved the proposal, thus creating the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) on June 13<sup>th</sup>, 1942. The OSS would operate under the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a committee of senior military leaders formed during World War II to advise the President and coordinate military efforts.</p>\n<p>Under Donovan’s leadership, the OSS bridged the realms of diplomacy, intelligence, and the military. He recruited technology, economics, psychology, and finance experts to provide specialized knowledge to military operations. Donovan firmly believed in a two-pronged strategy: physically attacking the enemy’s military forces and targeting their morale and spirit. The OSS quickly became a hotbed of innovation, employing diverse specialists, including intelligence analysts, linguists, and field operatives.</p>\n<p>Inspired by the British Special Operations Executive (SOE), Donovan developed a unique training methodology. He prioritized specialized training for recruits to operate behind enemy lines and carry out sabotage missions. They underwent rigorous training in organizing and supporting guerrilla and partisan resistance forces. At the core of the OSS were the Strategic Services Operations (SSO), consisting of six units, each with its specialized areas of expertise and responsibilities. Notably, units like the Special Operations (SO) and the Operational Group (OG) eventually led to the formation of the twelve-person Operational Detachment-Alpha, commonly known today as the Green Berets.</p>\n<h2>From the Shadows to the Waterfront</h2>\n<p>During Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa, the OSS demonstrated its strategic prowess. OSS members infiltrated Vichy French Northwest African territory, gathering vital information about enemy forces and defenses, directly influencing the invasion’s planning. The OSS also established and maintained robust contacts with local resistance groups and the Free French forces, significantly undermining the Axis stronghold in the region. Further, through unconventional warfare, the OSS successfully disrupted enemy activities and diverted resources, hindering Axis forces from mounting an effective defense against the main invasion.</p>\n<p>However, Operation Torch also exposed some of the OSS’s shortcomings. They underestimated the resistance from the Vichy French forces, resulting in two days of intense, unexpected fighting. Additionally, they overestimated the disruptive potential of the French resistance against the Axis forces, leading to strategic missteps. Some intelligence provided by the OSS also proved to be incorrect or unreliable, causing further complications in the operation’s planning and execution. Despite these setbacks, the experiences from Operation Torch provided invaluable lessons for future operations, including Operation Jedburgh.</p>\n<p>During Operation Jedburgh, a covert operation involving clandestine activities, the OSS provided personnel, equipment, and training to three-man teams. These teams were airdropped into occupied Europe, primarily focusing on France, to disrupt German military operations, gather intelligence, and support the larger Allied campaign. Consisting of a commander, an executive officer, and a radio operator, they played a pivotal role in leading local resistance movements against the Germans and carrying out acts of sabotage and guerrilla warfare. Notably, one team member always possessed fluency in the local language, ensuring effective communication and coordination with regional allies.</p>\n<p>In addition to providing personnel and training, the OSS handled logistics, the deployment of the teams, and the ongoing supply drops. Much like in Operation Torch, the effectiveness of the teams in Operation Jedburgh varied. They successfully disrupted German communications and logistics in some regions, significantly undermining the German response to the Allied invasion. However, German countermeasures, geography, and local conditions made their efforts less effective in other areas. Nevertheless, Operation Jedburgh showcased the potential of unconventional warfare and marked a successful collaboration between the OSS, the SOE, and the Free French.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.historynet.com/celebrating-the-legacy-of-the-office-of-strategic-services-82-years-on/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The word “Seminole” is derived from the Muscogean word <i>simanó-li</i>, or “runaway,” reflecting a common heritage, as Upper Creeks from Alabama, Lower Creeks from Georgia, other affiliated tribes and escaped African slaves all sought sanctuary in Spanish Florida. There they mixed with one another, adapted to their surroundings, traded with Britain, Spain and the United States and came to be collectively recognized as one of the Five Civilized Tribes (along with the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw and Creek/Muscogee) of the American Southeast. Not civilized enough for some, apparently, for when the United States acquired Florida in 1821, it began herding the Seminoles, through a succession of treaties, to progressively smaller and less desirable parts of the state. Ultimately, in 1834 federal officials set Jan. 1, 1836, as a deadline for <a href=\"https://www.historynet.com/on-removing-seminoles/\">removal of the Seminoles</a> from Florida to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). When a 110-man detachment of the 4th U.S.<sup> </sup>Infantry under Brevet Maj. Francis L. Dade set out for Fort King to oversee that final removal, however, it was ambushed by 180 Seminoles led by Halpatter Tustenuggee (Alligator) on Dec. 28, 1835. The ensuing slaughter of all but two of Dade’s men marked the beginning of the longest campaign fought between the U.S. Army and American Indians, a mix of pitched battles and guerrilla warfare.</p>\n    <p>In <i>Seminole Warrior versus U.S. Soldier: Second Seminole War, 1835–</i>42 (No. 61 in Osprey’s <i>Combat</i> series) military historian Ron Field compares the tactics, arms, equipment and fighting techniques used by both sides. In addition to what whites termed the “Dade massacre,” re-examined here through a more impartial lens, Field relates two other major engagements—at Lake Okeechobee, on Christmas Day 1837, and the second of back-to-back clashes at the Loxahatchee River, on Jan. 24, 1838. </p>\n    <p>Set in what might be more appropriately called the “Wild South,” the Second Seminole War was something of a learning process for both sides. Several notable future U.S. Army figures had their first taste of Indian warfare and, for that matter, their first combat experience during the conflict, lessons they would apply during the Mexican War. The Seminoles likewise developed guerrilla tactics they would employ as scouts during the Army’s later run-ins with other tribes on the Great Plains. Backed by Osprey’s usual fine array of illustrations and maps, <i>Seminole Warrior versus U.S. Soldier </i>offers <i>Wild West </i>readers a peek at the dress rehearsal for Indian campaigns to come. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.historynet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/91xdazMwZL._SL1500_-1-753x1024.jpg\"/>\n    <h2>Seminole Warrior vs. U.S. Soldier</h2>\n    <p>Second Seminole War, 1835–42</p>\n    <p>By Ron Field, Osprey Publishing, 2022</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>If you buy something through our site, we might earn a commission.</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.historynet.com/seminole-warrior-vs-us-soldier-book-review-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

(Photo: Scott Zimmerman)</p>\n<p>Share This Article</p>\n<p>When the Central Overland California and Pikes Peak Express Co. launched the Pony Express on April 3, 1860, fanfare for the new express mail service made newspaper headlines from New York to San Francisco. The cheers came loudest from California where proponents hailed its commencement as a vital step forward in linking the Far West with the rest of the country. The advertised delivery time between St. Joseph, Mo., and Sacramento, Calif. was 10 days, accomplished by a fast-horse relay. Way stations spaced 10 to 20 miles apart provided couriers with fresh horses, enabling them to carry the mail across the West at the speed of a galloping horse. And that’s nearly the way it shook out.</p>\n<p>A Bureau of Land Management signpost in Nevada denotes the trace of the original mail route.\n(Photo: Tom Fowlks)</p>\n<p>The Pony Express was the greatest display of American horsemanship ever to color the pages of a history book, but it was short-lived. Each of the nearly 190 stations had to be stocked with horses, provisions and stock tenders. Fifteen of the stations had no viable water source; water for the horses and the men looking after them had to be hauled in by mule-drawn wagons. The mail ran twice weekly, both eastbound and westbound, and after a year in operation it was eating up $5 for every $1 that it earned. It was prohibitively expensive, and on Oct. 26, 1861, the Pony Express hung up its spurs. But it cast a long shadow. As author William Banning wrote about that era in his 1928 book Six Horses, “A more glamorous contribution to our historic West than that of this ephemeral Pony would be difficult to name.”</p>\n<p>In 1860 and ’61, the Pony Express provided a connection between the East and the West. In 2019 the route afforded a way for me to connect the modern West and its recent history, presenting a roughly 2,000-mile avenue between past and present. I’ve been a horseman since I was old enough to know the term, and I decided the only way for me to see the country was from the back of a horse. On a personal level, I wanted to meet the people who lived along the trail, to fill in the map, and to do it slowly. Whereas the riders of the Pony Express compassed the same distance in 10 days, I’d spend all summer in the saddle. Doing so, I reckoned, would give me an end-to-end perspective of the West, a thorough look at all the country between Missouri and California. And so, on May 5, with two good horses, Chicken Fry and Badger, I pulled out of St. Joseph, bound for Sacramento.</p>\n<p>What ensued was an intimate grittiness. I camped at old Pony Express stations, in farmers’ yards and ranchers’ pastures, and in desert valleys so dry and quiet that dawn broke like a pistol shot over the salt pans. I wore out my boots and my shirt and half a dozen pairs of wool socks, but I did not wear out my horses. On September 22, when I arrived at the base of the bronze statue of a Pony Express rider on the Old Sacramento waterfront, their eyes were bright and their coats shiny, and though both were trail-weary, neither horse was diminished for the journey. The Last Ride of the Pony Express is the story of who I met, what I saw and what I learned by crossing the West by horseback.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.historynet.com/pony-express-ride-will-grant/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In 1854 father Isaac moved the family to Kansas Territory in search of a better life. There young Will watched a wagon train embarking on the Oregon Trail and declared that was what he wanted to do. Three years later, at age 11, he did just that with a freighting operation. It was the first of many such trips.</p>\n    <h2>2. Will Meets the Kickapoos</h2>\n    <p>Young Cody’s earliest encounters with American Indians were with <a href=\"https://www.historynet.com/mackenzies-raid-mexico/\">Kickapoos</a> who did business at his father’s trading post. Will also befriended Kickapoo classmates. Such positive encounters informed the way he approached Indians the rest of his life. </p>\n    <h2>3. Family Opposition to Slavery</h2>\n    <p>Isaac Cody opposed allowing slavery in Kansas Territory and was stabbed in 1854 while speaking against it. Pro-slavers continued to persecute the family until Isaac’s death three years later. Will regarded his father as a martyr and idolized his mother for having persevered. Following their examples, he later championed equal rights for women and Indians.</p>\n    <h2>4. Riding With the Pony Express</h2>\n    <p>Just what role Cody played in <a href=\"https://www.historynet.com/pony-express/\">the Pony Express</a> is open for debate, but it was important enough to him to emphasize in his 1879 autobiography, by which time the mail service was but a memory. It might have remained a footnote in American history had Cody not promoted it in every performance of Buffalo Bill’s Wild West over a 30-year span. </p>\n    <h2>5. Becoming ‘Buffalo Bill’</h2>\n    <p>In 1867, during a hiatus as a scout for the U.S. Army, Cody landed a contract to supply bison meat for work crews on the Kansas Pacific Railway. He proved such an adept hunter that the workers bestowed on him the nickname “Buffalo Bill.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.historynet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/buffalo-bill-cody-scout-709x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Buffalo Bill Cody\"/>\n    <h2>6. A Taste of the Good Life</h2>\n    <p>After fulfilling his contract with the railroad, Buffalo Bill returned to scouting for the Army. In January 1872 he led a hunt for Lt. Gen. Phil Sheridan in honor of Russian Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich. Among the guests were wealthy New Yorkers who introduced Cody to gourmet dining, something he’d enjoy the rest of his life. Within weeks he traveled to Manhattan, where he dined at Delmonico’s, stayed in fine hotels, partied with millionaires and took in several plays.</p>\n    <h2>7. Taking the Stage</h2>\n    <p>One of the plays Cody went to see while in New York was <i>Buffalo Bill, King of the Border Men</i>, at the Bowery Theater. He attended with <a href=\"https://www.historynet.com/meet-ned-buntline-the-novelist-who-was-lynched-by-an-angry-mob-and-lived-to-tell-the-tale/\">Ned Buntline</a>, who wrote the dime novel series on which the play was based. At Buntline’s urging, Cody embarked on an acting career that December. </p>\n    <h2>8. Birth of Buffalo Bill’s Wild West</h2>\n    <p>After a decade onstage Cody reflected, “Immense success and comparative wealth, attained in the profession of showman, stimulated me to greater exertion and largely increased my ambition for public favor.” That ambition led to his most successful enterprise. Beginning in 1883, Buffalo Bill’s Wild West introduced the region’s people, animals and stories first to all Americans and then to the world. The show transformed Cody into history’s first international celebrity.</p>\n    <h2>9. Buffalo Bill Conquers Europe</h2>\n    <p>In 1887 Cody was invited to bring his Wild West to London and perform as part of Victoria’s Golden Jubilee, celebrating her half century as Britain’s queen. Afterward, Buffalo Bill <a href=\"https://historynet.com/buffalo-bill-italy-tour\">toured the Continent</a> with his troupe, introducing Europeans to the American West. In each nation tens of thousands of curious spectators flocked to the celebrated showman’s arena performances. </p>\n    <h2>10. World’s Columbian Exposition</h2>\n    <p>Cody’s success in Europe only boosted his status at home. Back Stateside he planned a grand homecoming at Chicago’s 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition, but its aloof organizers denied the showman a place on their grounds. For nearly a year the Wild West performed just outside the main gate, drawing far larger crowds—18,000 people to each of its two daily shows. Buffalo Bill left the “Windy City” a millionaire with a legacy extending beyond his own lifetime.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.historynet.com/buffalo-bill-pivotal-events/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In his two-volume <i>Propaganda: The Art of Persuasion: World War II</i>, Anthony Rhodes notes the “barrage of posters” produced by government agencies like the United States Office of War Information as well as private companies during the war. And, observe Saunders and Timmers, “Both the British and the American governments strove to cement the idea of their national characteristics as unwaveringly plucky, with humour more likely to be employed than fearmongering.” </p>\n    <p>If you had any doubt about what you should be doing—or not doing—as an American to help the war effort, there was probably a poster that could point you in the right direction. Should you buy war bonds? (The answer was emphatically yes.) How about driving to work by yourself? (No! “When you ride ALONE you ride with Hitler!”) If you were a farmer, what should you produce? (Corn! Sugar beets! Milk!) Was it okay to chat about your work with that affable stranger at the bar? (Absolutely not! “Loose talk can cost lives.”) Colorfully eye-catching, the posters exhorted Americans to work harder, produce more war materiel, save gasoline and scrap metal, support their soldiers and sailors, and stop complaining about shortages. In one poster titled “Of course I can,” a young woman clutches her home-jarred food and says, “I’m patriotic as can be—And ration points won’t worry me!” (One thing that did not appear to be in short supply during the war was exclamation points.)</p>\n    <p>Perhaps the poster that best distilled all the exhortations into one single message showed a bloodied soldier pointing at a battle going on behind him and exclaiming, “More!

Eventually it became a competitive rodeo event in which working cowboys pitted their skills against wild horses—and each other. The king of the Texas broncobusters was a diminutive fellow named Samuel Privett Jr., known to history as “Booger Red.” While certain details and dates of his life differ due to faulty memories and inconsistent records, the central narrative of his life is consistent—and, oh, what a life he led!</p>\n<p>Samuel Thomas Privett Jr. was born on the TP Ranch in Williamson County, Texas, on Dec. 29, 1858—or maybe it was 1862, or 1864. Again, the records vary. He grew up on ranches, riding and roping. As a boy of barely 12 Sam was already breaking horses, his conspicuous shock of red hair landing him notice as “that redheaded bronc-riding kid.” He was 13, or perhaps 15, when a tragic event led to his lifelong nickname, “Booger Red.” He and a pal were fooling around with a homemade firework, having packed a stump with gunpowder, when it blew up prematurely, killing the friend and disfiguring Sam’s face. On catching sight of “Red” after the accident, one boy commented how “boogered up” his face was.</p>\n<p>Amusing moniker aside, Red’s injuries were anything but humorous. The blast had scorched off his eyebrows and part of his nose. His eyelids were reduced to slits, and he lost most of the sight in one eye. It took six months and multiple skin grafts to salvage what remained of his face. Anyone else would have retreated into seclusion, but Red was made of sterner stuff. For the rest of his life, while he was understandably camera shy and wore a wide-brimmed hat pulled low over his face, he embraced the nickname and even joked about it. His boogered-up face was just one of the curves life threw at him. The next curve was harder. By his mid-teens both of his parents had died, forcing the orphan to strike out on his own.</p>\n<p>On his bowed legs Red stood about 5 feet 5 inches, and he weighed little more than 150 pounds soaking wet. He was also soft-spoken, leading many to underestimate him. Those who had seen him in the saddle knew better, and Red found steady work breaking horses for ranchers. With his earnings he bought a wagon yard and stable in San Angelo, though he “officed” out of a pool room in a saloon. He also broke horses for the U.S. Army, which for decades to come would mount its cavalry on animals rather than motor vehicles. As for pay, the Army offered Red a choice: $50 a month, or $1 a horse. He took the second offer, and by the end of his first day was reportedly owed $75. The Army quickly rescinded its offer. Anyway, Red could make more freelancing for ranchers.</p>\n<p>He soon found an even more lucrative and entertaining way of making a living—riding competitively in small-town fairs and stock shows. Ranchers and cattlemen brought their wildest horses to such events and offered prize money to anyone who could gentle them. There were no arenas in those early days, just a patch of open prairie with poles stuck in the ground and rope strung between them. Spectators stood or sat in buggies or on camp stools. The only “box seats” were the saddles of those watching from horseback. Bets laid on both horse and rider were collected only when a rider went sailing or a horse quit bucking. The odds either way were about even, unless Booger Red was aboard. He took on any animals, even those with reputations as man-killers. Mounting was a challenge in itself. As there were no chutes—the side-opening chute came along years later—a rider had to get on while fellow cowboys held the animal by its ears and covered its eyes. As soon as the rider was in the saddle, the others let go and scattered. Red rode one notorious bronc that pitched and bucked across several acres before finally coming to a halt, its sides heaving, its head low and mouth flecked with foam. Rider and horse were equally exhausted, but Red walked away with a nice purse.</p>\n<p>These impromptu, open-air gatherings eventually morphed into organized rodeos that charged admission and programmed the various events—bronc riding (saddle and bareback), steer wrestling (aka bulldogging), roping and trick riding. As the frontier faded into history, rodeos and Wild West shows sprang up to keep the memory of the old days alive. Such shows were a combination of nostalgia and genuine cowboy skills.</p>\n<h2>Starting a Family and a Business</h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.historynet.com/booger-red-privett-rodeo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <h2>Books</h2>\n    <p><strong>Buffalo Bill: Scout, Showman, Visionary </strong>(2010, by Steve Friesen) <br/>This is my biography of William Frederick “Buffalo Bill” Cody, written when I was the director of the Buffalo Bill Museum &amp; Grave. What sets it apart is a wealth of original photographs and images of artifacts and documents associated with the showman’s life, making it equally at home on a reference bookshelf or coffee table. </p>\n    <p><strong>Wild Bill Hickok &amp; Buffalo Bill Cody: Plainsmen of the Legendary West</strong> (2022, by Bill Markley) <br/>Buffalo Bill Cody and friend James Butler “Wild Bill” Hickok were, and still are, often confused with one another. Author Bill Markley does an excellent job of distinguishing their life paths and exploring the relationship between them. Two biographies in one, the book is a well-researched and highly readable analysis of two legendary Westerners. </p>\n    <p><strong>Buffalo Bill’s America: William Cody &amp; the Wild West Show</strong> (2005, by Louis S. Warren) <br/>The thickest tome among these picks, Louis Warren’s book is chock-full of information about the famed showman, all carefully documented with extensive footnotes. My only problem with the book is the author’s emphasis on Cody’s “imposture.” Merriam-Webster defines that word as “the act or practice of deceiving by means of an assumed character or name.” While Buffalo Bill may have been Cody’s show business persona, it was not a deception and indeed based on real-life exploits. </p>\n    <p><strong>The Life of Hon. William F. Cody, Known as Buffalo Bill, the Famous Hunter, Scout and Guide: An Autobiography</strong> (1879) <br/>Cody’s autobiography has been reprinted many times since 1879. Some historians regard it as largely a work of fiction. I am not one of them. Written in an era dominated by dime novels, it has its exaggerations. But it is useful as a primary source, since it is his autobiography. All in all, it is an educational and entertaining read. </p>\n    <p><strong>Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic and Madness at the Fair That Changed America</strong> (2004, by Erik Larson) <br/>This is the only book in this list that does not devote itself primarily to Buffalo Bill. But author Erik Larson has carefully woven Cody into the central narrative of Chicago’s 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition and the deadly deeds of one of the nation’s first mass murderers. It is a nonfiction book that reads as entertainingly as a novel. </p>\n    <h2>Movies</h2>\n    <p><strong>The Life of Buffalo Bill</strong> (1912, on YouTube)<br/>Produced on three reels by the Buffalo Bill &amp; Pawnee Bill Film Co., this silent film was the first feature about Cody and included both real and fictional scenes from his life. Though an actor portrays Buffalo Bill through most of the film, it opens and closes with appearances by the aging showman himself and is worth watching for that alone. </p>\n    <p><strong>Young Buffalo Bill</strong> (1940, on DVD and YouTube) <br/>Directed by Joseph Kane and starring Roy Rogers and George “Gabby” Hayes, this oater bears absolutely no resemblance to Buffalo Bill’s actual life, nor does it intend to. Running just under an hour, it is a film version of the many 19th century dime novels about Cody, offering the thinnest of plots and plenty of action. </p>\n    <p><strong>Buffalo Bill</strong> (1944, on DVD and YouTube) <br/>Directed by William Wellman and starring Joel McCrae in the title role and Maureen O’Hara as wife Louisa, this Western is as accurate as one can expect from a Hollywood effort. It is loosely based on an article written by Frank Winch, who knew Cody and created an early chronology of his life. Though it strays from that chronology, expect to be entertained. </p>\n    <p><strong>Annie Get Your Gun</strong> (1950, on DVD and Blu-ray)  <br/>This MGM musical comedy, directed by George Sidney with music by Irving Berlin, stars Betty Hutton as Annie Oakley and Howard Keel as Frank Butler. Though primarily a love story about the two performers, who did marry in real life, it is set within the context of Buffalo Bill’s Wild West and presided over by Cody (played by Louis Calhern). Among the popular songs on the soundtrack is “There’s No Business Like Show Business,” indeed a theme for Buffalo Bill’s life. </p>\n    <p><strong>Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull’s History Lesson</strong> (1976, on DVD) and <strong>Hidalgo</strong> <br/>(2004, on DVD and Blu-ray) According to Sandra K. Sagala’s book <i>Buffalo Bill on the Silver Screen</i>, as of 2013 more than 80 film and television productions have included Cody in some form. Most don’t even feign accuracy, which is fine, as long as they are presented as entertainment. These two films profess to include truth, but they are so full of falsehoods, I cannot recommend them.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.historynet.com/top-books-films-buffalo-bill/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Norman Crockatt is not a well-known name, but the British intelligence officer was responsible for one of the most controversial decisions of World War II.</p>\n<p>When the War Office in London created Military Intelligence Section 9 (MI9) on December 23, 1939, it chose the 45-year-old Crockatt to head the new organization. The former head of the London Stock Exchange, he was seen as “the right sort of chap” for the post despite his scant experience in military intelligence.</p>\n<p>MI9’s mission was to help British military personnel escape and evade the enemy. That might mean smuggling maps and miniature compasses to prisoners of war held in Nazi camps or assisting shot-down airmen in enemy territory to evade capture and get back to Britain or Allied-controlled territory. MI9 was a small branch of British intelligence, but in June 1943 Crockatt had the responsibility of making a momentous decision about the fate of 80,000 Allied POWs incarcerated in I<a href=\"https://www.historynet.com/following-in-the-footsteps-of-italys-escaped-pows/\">talian prison camps</a>. The Allies were gearing up to invade Italy and Crockatt had to decide whether the POWs there should stay put and wait for the arrival of Allied troops or break out and try to make their own way to freedom. </p>\n<p>Crockatt chose the former option, stating in an order issued on June 7, 1943, that “officers commanding prison camps will ensure that prisoners of war remain within camp. Authority is granted to all officers commanding to take necessary disciplinary action to prevent individual prisoners of war attempting to rejoin their own units.” Several factors influenced Crockatt’s final decision. First was the physical state of the prisoners, many of whom were believed to be malnourished after years in captivity. Then there was the prospect of tens of thousands of prisoners on the loose, providing easy targets for vengeful Nazis and fascist Italians loyal to <a href=\"https://www.historynet.com/the-importance-of-being-mussolini/\">Mussolini</a>. Above all, Crockatt believed that the Allies’ advance north through Italy would be swift and British and American troops would quickly liberate the camps. Why risk a mass breakout and jeopardize the lives of so many men? </p>\n<p>To get word to the POWs of what they should do, Crockatt used a secret code contained within the script of a popular BBC program, <i>The Radio Padre</i>, a favorite among the prisoners. But what MI9 didn’t do, remarkably, was inform British prime minister <a href=\"https://www.historynet.com/world-war-ii-winston-churchills-vision-of-victory/\">Winston Churchill </a>or his War Cabinet of his decision. From the outset of negotiations with Italy Churchill had made plain his wish to see POWs returned to the Allies once the Armistice came into force. Article 3 of the Italian surrender agreement stipulated that prisoners were to be “immediately turned over to the Allied commander-in-chief and none of these may now or at any time be evacuated to Germany.” When the Armistice was made public on September 8 the Italian War Ministry kept faith with its obligations and told 80,000 Allied prisoners that they were free to leave. But the majority remained in their camps, where they risked falling under the control of the Germans. </p>\n<p>Churchill was aghast when he learned of Crockatt’s order for POWs to stay put, but by then it was too late for many prisoners. Contrary to what Crockatt had anticipated, the Germans had wasted little time in taking over most of the camps and were soon hunting the estimated 30,000 who had defied the stay-put command and taken flight.</p>\n<p>Nothing could be done now to liberate the prisoners in the camps, but Churchill demanded a plan to rescue the fugitives. The man chosen to lead the operation was Lieutenant Colonel Charles “Tony” Simonds, who had joined MI9 in 1941 after fighting alongside General Orde Wingate in what is now Ethiopia. Based in Cairo, Simonds was in charge of A Force, which had responsibility to set up escape lines for Allied prisoners across occupied Europe. Summoned to Allied Forces HQ in Algiers on September 23, Simonds received orders to devise a plan to rescue the thousands of escaped Allied prisoners roaming Italy. He had at his disposal personnel from Britain’s 1st Airborne Division, Second Special Air Service Regiment (2SAS), and Special Operations Executive (SOE), as well as the American Office of Strategic Services (OSS). The mission received the codename Jonquil.</p>\n<p>Simonds established his headquarters at Brindisi, a port on the eastern heel of the Italian boot, and arranged a meeting with officers from 2SAS, billeted 75 miles northwest in the coastal city of Bari. This elite British special forces unit had been formed in North Africa in 1941 by brothers David and Bill Stirling, and while stationed in Cairo Simonds had heard tales of their effectiveness in raiding Axis targets deep inside their territory. David Stirling had been captured in January 1943 but Bill, in command of 2SAS, sent two of his officers, Major Felix Symes and Captain Peter Power, to Brindisi to discuss the rescue operation.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.historynet.com/sas-rescue-mission-italy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The California Gold Rush. The very words evoked the strong reaction of an American populace driven by adventure and a lust for easy riches. Drawn inexorably west in the wake of the Jan. 24, 1848, strike at Sutter’s Mill were argonauts from every walk of life—shopkeepers, former soldiers, fallen women and those willing to parade their talents onstage for bemused hardscrabble miners. Among the latter was the Robinson Family, a husband-and-wife acting duo with four kids in tow. The youngest of the brood would become one of the most celebrated performers in the annals of Victorian theater in the American West. With her onstage portrayals Sue Robinson brought to a viewing public the humor, angst and subtle realities of everyday life in that time and place.</p>\n<h2>The “Fairy Star”</h2>\n<p>Born in suburban Chicago on Jan. 14, 1845, Robinson moved west at age 6 with her parents and siblings, who were soon performing for Gold Rush audiences composed primarily of young men starved of family life. The Robinson Family trouped the length and breadth of the mother lode settlements, from northernmost Georgetown south through Coloma, Angels Camp, Murphys and countless other hamlets since lost to history, their names—Bottle Hill, Poverty Bar, Limerick, etc.—reflecting both the struggles and humor of the era.</p>\n<p>The touring life held little of the perceived glamour of the entertainment world. On July 4, 1855, the Robinsons found themselves performing atop a giant sequoia stump for a raucous crowd in the Sierra Nevada foothills. Three years later the family drew such a throng to Poverty Bar’s Treadway Hall that its main stringer and floor joists gave way. Even when performances fell short of expectations, Sue in particular garnered flattering notices from the various camp presses, which regularly lauded her as the “jewel” of the family troupe. One reporter ascribed her popularity to a combination of factors:</p>\n<p>“She is only 8 years old, yet she appeared to understand all the fascinating qualities of her sex of a more experienced age. This in connection with her sprightly and graceful dancing, as well as her natural beauty and sweet disposition, is sufficient not only to make her a favorite among us, but also to endear her to the hearts of all with whom she is acquainted.”</p>\n<p>Recognizing the appealing innocence of their star attraction, Sue’s parents billed her alternately as the “Fairy Star” or “La Petite Susan.” Yet, the endless trouping in the rough-hewn mining camps scarred the young girl’s psyche. At age 8 she was severely injured while exiting a stage in Grass Valley when she brushed past the open flame of a footlight and caught her clothes on fire. Rushing to her rescue, her parents themselves were scorched in the effort. Fortunate to have survived, the Fairy Star was soon back onstage, though from then on she was prone to fleeing the stage at the mere hint of trouble.</p>\n<p>From an early age the youngest Robinson recognized the importance even a few coins could mean to the survival of her struggling theatrical family. One evening, as she completed the Scotch lilt for an appreciative audience of Placerville miners, the men showered the stage with coins. Ignoring a bouquet of flowers thrown to her, Sue didn’t exit till she had retrieved every last coin, even filling her shoes with them.</p>\n<p>The multitalented young girl’s singing embraced everything from sentimental ballads to grand opera, while her dance specialties included jigs, flings, clogs, the cancan, <i>“La Cachucha”</i> (performed with castanets), “Fisher’s Hornpipe” and a double “Sailor’s Hornpipe” performed with older brother Billy. Among her most popular numbers was a burlesque of Irish dancer and actress Lola Montez, who had reportedly taught both Sue and contemporary child star Lotta Crabtree the infamous Spider Dance, during which Montez would writhe and cavort to rid her flimsy costume of spiders, to the delight of appreciative male audiences.</p>\n<h2>Tragedy and a Rivalry</h2>\n<p>Sue was only 10<strong> </strong>when her mother fell ill and died on Aug. 22, 1855, while on tour in Diamond Springs, sending the family fortunes into a tailspin. Economic uncertainty was and remains a stressor in the acting profession, but his wife’s death pressured Joseph Robinson to take dire measures to provide for his children. In addition to trying his hand at theater management, Sue’s father opened a dance school in Sacramento, advertising his daughters, “La Petite Susan” and Josephine, as potential dancing partners for gentlemen customers. As survival took precedence over propriety, father Robinson—characterized by one period newspaper as a peripatetic “bilk,” a Victorian-era term for an untrustworthy individual—appears to have abandoned any feelings of paternal responsibility for his daughters’ welfare.</p>\n<p>Another formative factor in Sue’s childhood was an ongoing, unspoken competition with Crabtree, who rose to become a nationally known actress and variety star. Both girls experienced insecure childhoods spent relentlessly touring the mining settlements to perform before mostly male audiences. They occasionally crossed paths. Sue played the hand organ in a troupe that supported Lotta’s first professional performance, and in the mid-1850s Robinson performed in a saloon opposite Crabtree in a neighboring saloon. In a painful memory for Sue, the miners abandoned her performance, crossing the street en masse to watch the charismatic, slightly younger Lotta. Dressed in green and wielding a miniature shillelagh onstage, Lotta became the darling of the newly immigrant Irish then fueling the labor force in the camps.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.historynet.com/sue-robinson-actress/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Fresh from robbing the Deadwood Stagecoach, the Sioux performers of Buffalo Bill’s Wild West changed into loose-fitting Chinese garb and attached long single braids to the backs of their heads, mimicking the clothing and hairstyle of the Boxers then rebelling halfway around the world. Thus was the stage set for the “Western Easterners” to man a wall and defend their position against U.S. Army re-enactors in a scene played out in Cody’s “Rescue at Pekin.”</p>\n<p>Pittsburgh was the host city this day in late May 1901, and the big-city crowd did not disappoint. As the action unfolded, spectators stomped their feet so hard as to send vibrations through the grandstand. During the climactic scene, as the Army re-enactors scaled the artificial wall, the jingoistic roar from audience members swelled to ear-throbbing intensity, and they surged over the railings to join performers on the arena floor.</p>\n<p>The drama depicted actual events of the ongoing 1899–1901 Boxer Rebellion. Emerging as a violent response to increasing foreign incursion into China, the Boxers (nicknamed for their martial arts skills, though officially known as the Society of Righteous and Harmonious Fists) sought to eradicate all signs of modern progress (railroads, telegraph lines, etc.) and called for the liquidaton of foreigners, particularly Christian missionaries (and their Chinese converts).</p>\n<p>On June 20, 1900, the Boxers besieged foreign embassies in the Legation Quarter of Peking (present-day Beijing), trapping within its walls nearly 500 foreign civilians, 400 military personnel and 3,000 Chinese Christians. Fifty-five days into the siege eight nations, including the United States, sent some 20,000 soldiers to relieve the siege. In battle that August 14 and 15 <a href=\"https://www.historynet.com/calvin-titus-boxer-rebellion/\">they defeated the Boxers</a> and then divided the capital city into occupation zones, sending occasional punitive forays into the countryside. Not until Sept. 7, 1901, did representatives of the allied nations and China’s Qing empire sign the Boxer Protocol, officially ending the rebellion.</p>\n<p>Ever the savvy showman, Cody was quick to draw a correlation between the Boxers and American Indians. As the rebels had resisted foreign incursion, he reasoned, so Plains Indians had resisted the westward tide of Anglo settlement, cutting telegraph lines, attacking railroad crews and battling U.S. soldiers. Fueled by superstitious ideology, the Boxers believed they could induce spirits to enter their bodies and render them invulnerable to bullets, much like Plains Indian adherents of the “Ghost Dance” movement believed their ceremonial shirts would protect them. The latter movement ended in tragedy on Dec. 29, 1890, with the battle turned massacre at Wounded Knee, S.D., all but ending the American Indian wars.</p>\n<p>Buffalo Bill was a stickler for the authentic, wherever possible employing real soldiers, cowboys and Indians performing with real weapons. But as he had no access to real Boxers, the duty fell to those Sioux already in Cody’s employ. They were perfect for the role, one <i>New York Sun</i> reporter quipped, as they were “used to dying” in each show. “They die in the cowboy battles about the emigrant wagon, and they die again in the chase of the Deadwood coach,” he wrote. “They made no objection to…dying the death of Boxers this year.” A <i>New York Evening Sun</i> reporter noted, tongue in cheek, “Some of them seemed a little ill at ease in their Chinese makeup, but they kept themselves entirely in the landscape, positively refused to scalp a single member of the allied forces and never even indulged in so much as the ghost of a war whoop.”</p>\n<p>American Indians had long featured in promotions for the Wild West, which urged potential ticket buyers to come see the “horde of warpainted Arapaho, Cheyenne and Sioux Indians” (though after convincing the infamous Hunkpapa Lakota leader Sitting Bull to tour with him in 1885, Cody had hired only Sioux from the Pine Ridge Agency). Why did Plains Indians who had violently resisted “foreign incursion” agree to perform in the Wild West shows? For starters, those working for Buffalo Bill earned a decent wage, while employment prospects on and around the reservations were limited. In addition, room, board and travel were free. Finally, performers’ immediate families were welcome to join them on tour.</p>\n<p>In the fall of 1900, drawn like so many Americans by the dramatic events in China, Cody proposed to his theatrical manager, Nate Salsbury, that they incorporate a reenactment of the allied victory over the Boxers in the forthcoming season of the Wild West. The pair put their heads together and came up with “The Rescue at Pekin.”</p>\n<p>On April 2, 1901, opening night, they debuted the Chinese-themed spectacle at New York’s Madison Square Garden. After a fortnight’s run Cody took the show on the road, and by the time the season wrapped in late October the troupe had performed in arenas from upstate New York to the South and across much of the Midwest. In 1902, with few changes to the program, Cody and company performed for audiences in the Western half of the country.</p>\n<p>The twice-daily shows were an enormous draw, attracting on average some 20,000 to 30,000 patrons, not counting those turned away at the gate. The audience often exceeded the population of the host cities, as people from surrounding areas packed the stands. The June 4 edition of Pennsylvania’s <i>Reading Herald </i>reported that crowds began to gather in the early morning, by showtime transforming into a “great huddled mass.”</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.historynet.com/boxer-rebellion-wild-west/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
