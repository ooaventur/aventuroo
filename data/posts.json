    "body": "<h2>Two nearly identical artworks, at least one of them by the renowned Dutch master, hang side-by-side for the first time in three centuries</h2>\n<p><i>The Guitar Player</i>(left) and its mysterious doppelgänger (right) are on display together for the first time at London's Kenwood House. Historic England / Philadelphia Museum of Art</p>\n<p>For decades, art historians have debated whether a <a href=\"https://philamuseum.org/calendar/exhibition/vermeer-highlight\">painting of a woman strumming a guitar</a> was the work of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Johannes-Vermeer\">Johannes Vermeer</a>, the renowned 17th-century Dutch master. At a new exhibition in London, you get to be the judge.</p>\n<p>Two almost identical paintings, at least one of them by Vermeer, hang side-by-side for the first time in 300 years in “<a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/whats-on/kenwood-double-vision-vermeer-1-sep-25-11-jan-26/\">Double Vision: Vermeer at Kenwood</a>,” which runs through January 2026.</p>\n<p>In both paintings, a woman in pearls and a fur-trimmed yellow outfit plays a small guitar, her gaze affixed sideways to something out of the frame.<strong> </strong>Behind her hangs a gold-framed painting of trees, and a few books are piled on a table near the window. The paintings, like many Vermeers, bring the viewer intimately close to the scene at hand.</p>\n<p>But there are key differences between the two works. The most notable change is the woman’s hair. In one painting, it’s braided atop her head. In the other, it hangs in ringlets near her shoulders. The former painting’s colors are more muted than the latter’s, which is in much better condition. Crucially, the latter painting is signed by Vermeer himself, while the former has no signature at all.</p>\n<p>The 17th-century artist’s most famous works include <i>Girl With a Pearl Earring</i><i> </i>and <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2009/vermeer\"> The Milkmaid</a>.</p>\n<p>For many years, both paintings were thought to be Vermeers. That changed in the 1920s, as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/sep/01/vermeer-or-not-new-display-lets-visitors-decide-who-painted-almost-identical-artworks\"> Guardian</a>’s Esther Addley reports. Experts agreed that the signed painting, which hangs at </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/kenwood/\">Kenwood</a>, a stately home in London, was a Vermeer. But they came to the conclusion that the unsigned version, which belongs to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, was a 17th- or 18th-century copy by an unknown artist.</p>\n<p>The mystery was further complicated in 2023, when a Dutch art researcher <a href=\"https://www.essentialvermeer.com/vermeer_events_past.html\">published an article</a> arguing that the Philadelphia Museum of Art’s <i>Guitar Player</i> may be a Vermeer after all. The researcher, <a href=\"https://independent.academia.edu/ArieWallert\">Arie Wallert</a>, notes that artists reproducing their own pictures was an established practice in the 17th century.</p>\n<p>Inspired by Wallert’s work, both the Philadelphia museum and English Heritage, which manages the Kenwood collection, have been testing their respective paintings in hopes of uncovering whose hand is behind the Philadelphia artwork. The results of those analyses are expected within a few months, per the <i>Guardian</i>.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, the debate continues at Kenwood, where the two paintings hang next to each other, creating “a rather beautiful confusion,” as Wendy Monkhouse, English Heritage’s senior curator at Kenwood, tells the <i>Guardian</i>.</p>\n<p>“[The debate] is balanced on a hair’s breadth,” Monkhouse tells the <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/culture/art/article/vermeer-identical-paintings-display-rfbftp239\">London  Times</a>’ David Sanderson. “There are a whole series of arguments based on the science, and you can see where they have used the same pigments in the same place and the same strokes.”</p>\n<p>One complicating factor is that the quality of the Philadelphia painting has deteriorated over the years, while the Kenwood piece remains in remarkable condition for an artwork from more than 300 years ago.</p>\n<p>In the past, skeptical experts have cited the difference in hairstyles between the two paintings as evidence that the Philadelphia painting couldn’t have been done by Vermeer, the <i>Times</i> reports. Ringlets, some argued, fell out of fashion only after Vermeer’s death in 1675. However, Monkhouse doesn’t think a difference in hair alone can provide a satisfactory answer.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think anybody has <i>Cosmopolitan </i>from 1680 that shows exactly how the hair styles are massively changing,” she tells the <i>Times</i>.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/did-vermeer-make-a-copy-of-his-own-painting-a-new-exhibition-invites-you-to-be-the-judge-180987282/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But scientists still don’t fully understand how a bee colony strategizes to build its honeycombs.</p>\n    <p>A team of researchers set out to investigate how honeybees adapt to different building conditions and collaborate with each other to construct structurally sound hives. “We’re trying to tackle these questions by creating impossible puzzles for the bees,” says study co-author <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/biofrontiers/orit-peleg\">Orit Peleg</a>, a computer scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder, to Jacey Fortin at the <i/>.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>New York Times</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Peleg and her colleagues 3D-printed plastic honeycomb foundations with a hexagonal pattern. To make things tricky, some of these weren’t ideal for the bees—the six-sided cells <a href=\"https://www.the-scientist.com/bees-strategize-how-to-build-the-best-honeycomb-73309\">ranged</a> from three-quarters of their preferred size to three times larger. As the bees interacted with these blueprints, the scientists used X-ray microscopy to analyze how the insects built their own structures on top.</p>\n    <h4>Need to know: The complexity of beehives</h4>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Honeybee hives are <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003253\">built with the combined efforts</a>of thousands of individual bees, and the insects must optimize the process to use a limited amount of wax.</li>\n      <li>To secrete one pound of wax, bees would have to consume about <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003253#:~:text=In%20particular%2C%20to%20secrete%20just%201%20lb%20(454%20g)%20of%20wax%2C%20honeybees%20need%20to%20consume%20about%208%20lbs%20(3.8%20kg)%20of%20honey\">eight pounds of honey</a>.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>The bees employed three main strategies, depending on the foundation: If the foundation was too small, the bees would merge cells together to create spaces closer to the size of their natural cells. The researchers called this technique merging. When the cells were about twice as big as preferred, the bees built their cells at an angle. This method—which the researchers called tilting—allowed the bees to shrink the opening of the cells while preserving the space inside.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/ZxXP07zxEG31GO0ZrhV0YloCjrQ=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(1440x1371:1441x1372)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/80/7e/807ed25e-ee1f-4ab0-99eb-bb2088898286/busy-bees-can-build-th-1.jpg\" alt=\"a hive on top of a plastic panel\"/>\n    <p>Finally, if the cells were even bigger—up to three times as big as a natural cell—the bees built a new layer of cells on top of the foundation, using it as support. They constructed a cell atop each of the six vertices of the 3D-printed hexagon, with a spot in the middle for a seventh cell, using the space efficiently.</p>\n    <p>“These tiny builders seem to have an intuitive understanding of the physics behind collective construction,” Peleg adds in a <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2025-08-busy-bees-hive-tricky-foundations.html\">statement</a>. “We’re just beginning to understand the rich set of strategies they use—tilting, merging, layering—to shape structures that meet their needs in remarkably adaptable ways.” The findings were published in the journal <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003253\"> PLOS Biology</a> on August 26.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/B4Y_fiRZbJq8rzAbvzk5E_ltkoM=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(1440x919:1441x920)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/cb/9b/cb9bb7b3-5bfe-496c-842b-7da050e4cb40/busy-bees-can-build-th-2.jpg\" alt=\"a hive on top of a plastic panel\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/9ceCJMaXepxOBwzRGS1iCjkO5XQ=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(959x1388:960x1389)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/57/58/5758c4aa-15d9-4f9b-91fe-27d1902c0ba7/busy-bees-can-build-th-3.jpg\" alt=\"a hive on top of a plastic panel, showing the layering technique\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://smithbeelab.com/pages/people/\">Michael L. Smith</a>, a biologist who specializes in bees at Auburn University and was not involved in the work, tells the <i>New York Times </i>that while the study was “impressive,” it doesn’t reveal how bees are able to coordinate with each other. He adds that the behaviors described in the study could simply be ingrained, rather than a sign of a special cognitive ability.</p>\n    <p>“The analogy I give in my animal behavior classes is: If you wanted to understand if beavers are architects, you’d have to see if they could build a bridge,” Smith tells the publication, “not if they could build a dam.”</p>\n    <p>Still, the researchers suggest their findings could have implications outside the field of biology. They might inspire further research on self-organized collective behavior in animals and even <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/seven-scientific-discoveries-from-2024-that-could-lead-to-new-inventionsfrom-indestructible-tardigrades-to-body-merging-comb-jellies-animals-can-teach-humans-so-much-about-medicine-robotics-aging-and-survival-180985741/\">advance human engineering</a>, per the paper.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>Nonstick pans are a staple in most kitchens for a reason. They make cooking easy, cleanup quick, and eggs practically glide right out of the pan. But if you’re looking for something that lasts longer and gets even better with use, it’s worth considering carbon steel. The best carbon-steel pans offer all the convenience and ease of a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-nonstick-pans\">nonstick skillet</a> with even more durability and versatility.</p>\n<p>Think of carbon steel as a lighter, more agile cousin to <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-cast-iron-skillet\">cast iron</a>. These pans are easier to maneuver, with wide, flat cooking surfaces that are perfect for frying eggs and <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/how-to/article/perfect-french-omelet-hint-will-butter\">omelets</a>, flipping crepes, searing meat, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/quick-recipes/slideshow/25-quick-stir-fry-recipes-cook-weeknights\">stir-frying vegetables</a>—the list goes on. When properly seasoned, carbon steel is every bit as slick as ceramic or PTFE-coated pans, but unlike those, it will actually get better the more you use it.</p>\n<p>Carbon steel is tough and durable, compatible with induction cooktops, and can withstand high heat. There’s no need to worry about scratching its cooking surface, either, which makes it a smarter long-term investment than most traditional nonstick pans—provided you care for them properly.</p>\n<h2>Our top picks</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>The best traditional carbon-steel pan:</strong><a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/RADNkTB2Qu42QU3Nj1Q4bQyWbXBM6ipbtPVzCo5xhLgGNr2qe9H9PgZ2t1V84sW8U1YN5cjf788M2i4da2NPMDUn8a85Aq3fUVASxCHMJFGfmHy2rAcxgWppxG2DgMpprcw6aMxhDFwpSqvjh1udnmrn484X2i9qZd81thK8Nbbg8mbE7DByY7CEPhgNrn1bbE5F8jbQ8KhoBqZ97DeNfBS4Fs4mqJcCc7c8JwmtVpgZ81T7BzswvC2548631eAvJvnKfntdUP4qunpWP2BdV9xJbpSNjJZxSoRuDPUH2j9aUJMUdnH2FVfMbBLHrepD5e9YFakkpJbAkeBkTx8cvkBiR4mWPE8yJQRkGZtXdFv3ZFjDMwpgMx\">De Buyer Blue Carbon Steel Fry Pan</a>→<a href=\"#best\">Read more</a></li>\n      <li><strong>The best budget carbon-steel pan:</strong><a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/3j63gbMkR4nGRWLmxBu6KXTj1CSxTb2d3XaaX7vnu47wC13GQdBLjaJeA2WSKgMsQ8VdeCYpc6E1mwGmUMYY89CnANv47veJZT3guEuzcBAn9C7uThYeLGgRGqtkQG6XstUgG8oZ2AeiY4qpcvCVDmZHJZtvLFwcxGJ1Ryjw4drRQP3wKF2ouBAToRTCLV5QWH3JfY5CxfzgrBTyrWQV7beGgVy6FNb9XhHJiCG76tywHToJMPcJyA53WCAJgXyuFoUkXmmmdr9jEb5mTwyB5QL5Tw8Edd2gyFoMKY2Rte28PmRfL9bbVWYyLxJj6zvh5RmqHypLRTUebdK9JQuHs2r8SfEJsh2z7YE1qLUws6yThkFh9bBFu1dm7Lok\">Oxo Obsidian Pre-Seasoned Carbon Steel Skillet</a>→<a href=\"#budget\">Read more</a></li>\n      <li><strong>The best nonstick alternative carbon-steel pan:</strong><a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/2QKuUE9XrFFi1YXiFEpQ9ebQfCyN2fgucXsUoQ5cS2gAMEAzKMktw84gJ82keBnbSFp3VWc3YysZd7w4QzmYPpJT4Cq1k8pLsVtkXYyPDGwCGCNn5TiuZ5g27CHj3LimLh9WgUwk5EmmNRUrUTXkymJoTw3S1Ud9Py49RNRDpqEzJWENcUQtC4y5NjaFnh7RcthaBhZ2eAHPvx4Ax2Gm8sNiXqgDxpv47aNKzekp7vv3sUu4xQcMuvmczJFveKX1YR5XfNiSbsphHiUZPTPmC5XkY6SKMBV1CjNNWbDJ6sGGZ7omZddJqzyNMZXLpez1TNaRXJm8pNW\">The Misen Carbon Nonstick</a>→<a href=\"#Misen-Carbon-Nonstick\">Read More</a></li>\n      <li><strong>A new-and-improved (but slightly unorthodox) alternative:</strong><a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/EAi7madmZTTZPaWY7PTfVqDnmM8DwTxXB2gwnpvuh3WARWjmw2M146qUuopYeeRFkQ9TpunRt3uMeyjmxCdqDgUsi1a7e6DozKwDEBYNNZeJvizCPcqhTadEtxiVvCauPMXUVNw4AcFWZFyW5H1cGD86mVxYXGeYYtQYaR55sNcyT7Aju6jCZsojXgqJnwt5VoZCed2uvSJCCYVAyz9NEYLd7U7dXBdg5YieFbyCYCRHNkPokxz5y4xrHWJfzMbGRpAc2Sa4GcoN5YEQvWL4ZBFW1dJAQKjaTfudCXP8vKfntrCrCZFzEP3Ey3ykBhQrC6KsMaEV6fRKVgev65vChdUxgh1eYLurp6EtpgYGs5zMqHfVZgEuN1g2eDXUihQxz7Y2kVb5ZLpa\">The Strata Pan</a>→<a href=\"#a-new-and-improved-but-slightly-unorthodox-alternative-the-strata-pan\">Read more</a></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>We get that not every home cook wants to <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/carbon-steel-gift\">season carbon-steel pans</a>.

De Buyer is an old-school name in the cookware world, and the brand’s carbon-steel pan is probably its best-known product. “I love these as an alternative to all but the <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-cast-iron-skillet\">best cast irons</a>,” Morocco says. “They are lighter, easier to use and handle, season faster, and start out with slicker surfaces.”</p>\n<p>The blue carbon-steel pan is the most affordable pan in de Buyer’s lineup, and it’s a bit more user-friendly than the higher end Mineral B and Mineral B Pro lines. One big plus about this pan is that you don’t have to go through the same initial process that completely unseasoned carbon-steel pans require as it comes with a light layer of bluing as opposed to the traditional beeswax coating that can be a minor hassle to remove. That being said, we’d still recommend seasoning this pan yourself before using it, as during testing, the surface became much slicker following a few rounds of cooking. The pan also has a welded handle—no lumpy rivets in the way—which makes it easy to clean, and broad-angled sides ideal for tossing and flipping foods in the pan without a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-silicone-spatula\">spatula</a>. If you want a professional quality carbon-steel pan that isn’t too intimidating, this is the one.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-carbon-steel-pans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A zippy sherry-vinegar-based dressing is emulsified with a generous amount of richly intense blue cheese. While this dressing might be too heavy and overpowering for a romaine or butter lettuce, it’s the perfect foil for bitter, crisp <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/what-is-radicchio\">radicchio</a>. Sweet chunks of roasted squash and bits of fragrant rosemary bring this cozy, perfect-for-fall salad together. Toasted hazelnuts give crunch, thin slivers of shallot offer freshness, and if you’re craving even more blue cheese, go ahead and finish the salad with a few salty crumbles.</p>\n    <p>This recipe is endlessly adaptable. Any crisp, slightly bitter radicchio will do the trick. And if another squash catches your eye at the grocery store, butternut can be swapped out for delicata, acorn, or even roasted chunks of sweet potato. Hazelnuts bring their own fatty depth, but walnuts, pecans, or even almonds would stand in nicely. While blue cheese is what gives this salad its <i>oomph</i>, another soft, rich cheese would also be lovely if you’re not a fan of the funk. Robiola, goat cheese, or brie would lead you to a similarly glossy, rich vinaigrette. Once it comes time to plate, use your hands to carefully pile the salad into a tall, centerpiece-worthy plate of greens.</p>\n    <h2>Recipe notes</h2>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#main-content\">Back to top</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/radicchio-salad-with-blue-cheese-dressing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>What does “feel-good food” mean? It depends on whom you ask. That’s why each month our  Feel-Good Food Plan—with delicious recipes and a few wild cards—is hosted by someone new. This month restaurant editor Elazar Sontag shares the dinner that welcomes him home after months on the road.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Restaurant scouting is the rare gig that’s every bit as fun as it sounds. There’s no part of my job I enjoy more than hitting the road for two months in search of the year’s Best New Restaurants. <i>New Orleans. Oakland. Austin. Asheville. Charleston.</i> The trips blur together, but the thrill never fades. Neither do the stomachaches. After so many double dinners, a great restaurant salad is my salvation. Luckily, chefs were seriously into salad this year. Everywhere I went were hyper-seasonal, beautifully arranged mountains of greens I happily scaled. Of course, I also ate more pounds of <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/best-fried-chicken\">fried chicken</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/creamy-pasta-with-crispy-mushrooms\">cream-thickened sauces</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/siu-yuk-cantonese-roast-pork\">crackly pork belly</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/double-dark-chocolate-no-churn-ice-cream\">ice cream</a> than any amount of greens could counteract.</p>\n    <p>When I finally came home from this year’s dining frenzy, I craved freshness. Pulling inspiration from some of my favorite restaurant salads, this <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/radicchio-salad-with-blue-cheese-dressing\">squash-and-radicchio number</a> has become my return-to-home comfort food. Sherry <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/three-minute-red-wine-vinaigrette\">vinaigrette</a> is cut through with hunks of creamy <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/tomato-toast-blue-cheese-butter\">blue cheese</a>, a trick inspired by my favorite salad at <a href=\"https://www.viacarota.com/\">Via Carota</a> in New York City's West Village. Instead of eating straight out of the mixing bowl like I normally do, I take a page from <a href=\"https://www.meetinghousebeer.com/\">Meetinghouse</a> in Philadelphia, a standout bar where the stately green salad nearly touches the ceiling, and pile my leaves high on a platter. The salad goes in the middle of the table like a centerpiece, and my partner and I cozy up, casually eating with our fingers. After so many weeks of restaurant meals, it’s what I’ve missed most.</p>\n    <h2>More Feel-Good Finds for the Month</h2>\n    <p>I refuse to wear pants to the office in New York’s hottest months, which means my coworkers see a lot of knees (sorry!). How do you make jean shorts and a t-shirt feel… serious? The answer came to me in a pair of <a href=\"https://www.ghbass.com/collections/weejuns/products/6000-2819c01\">G.H. Bass penny loafers</a>. With no painful, heel-bleeding break-in and a handsome shine that makes me feel like a serious menswear guy, they render even my comfiest fits work-appropriate.</p>\n    <p>When I’m on the road scouting for Best New Restaurants, I drink a lot of coffee—three cups a day is the minimum to keep me energized through the heavy-weight eating. This year in DC, I fell in love with <a href=\"https://lostsockroasters.com/collections/coffee/products/tw0-steps-forward-espresso-blend-12oz\">Lost Sock Roasters</a>, a cafe and small roaster that makes the best cup I’d had in months. When I got home, I put in a recurring order for four bags of the shop’s exemplary Two Steps espresso blend. Once a month, right as I’m hitting the bottom of my last bag, I get the delivery I’ve been waiting for.</p>\n    <p>If you searched my bag right now, you’d find <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/e11ement-Hypochlorous-Eczema-Procedure-Cleanser/dp/B09RBCWRXH/ref=sr_1_1_sspa\">a bottle of hypochlorous acid</a>. Come over, and you’ll peep another next to my face products. To somebody who failed chemistry in high school, the antimicrobial spray seems like straight-up magic. It’s gentle enough to spray around the eyes, but stronger than bleach when it comes to disinfection. It goes in my gym bag to cleanse my face after a heavy sweat; was a key part of aftercare for my latest tattoo; and even keeps my pesky summer eczema away. I have yet to find a challenge it can’t spray away.</p>\n    <h2>Next Time</h2>\n    <p>November’s Feel-Good Food Plan will be hosted by <a href=\"https://milliepeartree.com/about/\">chef Millie Peartree</a> who’s sharing how pre-workout meal prepping actually feeds her whole family. We’ll see you next month!</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/feel-good-food-plan-september-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Imagine one giant, ring-shaped éclair that’s perfect for slicing and sharing. This version swaps the traditional praline mousseline filling for a banana diplomat cream (just a fancy term for pastry cream lightened with whipped cream) and layers it with candied nuts and slices of banana, cramming everything good about <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/best-banana-pudding\">Southern banana pudding</a> into a flashier, French package.</p>\n<p>The recipe is our showiest to date, and will teach you how to master pate à choux, a base you can riff on to make classic <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/chocolate-eclairs\">éclairs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/cream-puffs\">cream puffs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/churros-with-bittersweet-chocolate-sauce\">churros</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/cheddar-and-herb-gougeres\">more</a>. You’ll also learn how to infuse pastry cream with intense banana flavor using one of Jesse’s party tricks: steeping the peels in milk. Yes, the <i>peels</i>.</p>\n<p>Paris-Brest is a labor of love, but after a year of celebrating your Bake Club successes, we think it’s time for a true project. So get yourself a piping bag, let your bananas ripen, and strap in; it’s well worth the effort.</p>\n<h2>August 2025: Peach-Blueberry Crumb Pie</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/gallery/no-bake-desserts-recipes\">No-bake</a> this, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/gallery/no-cook-pasta-sauce-recipes\">no-cook</a> that.

The time is now, I tell you. So turn on the air conditioning, because we’re making a lovely, homey peach and blueberry pie.

It is a classic French dessert created in the early 20th century to commemorate the bicycle race connecting Paris and Brest. It’s traditionally composed of a giant wreath made of pâte à choux (the same dough used to make eclairs and cream puffs) and a praline crème mousseline. The ring bakes and expands dramatically in the oven; once it’s removed and cooled completely, the ring is sliced in half and filled with a light and fluffy cream. It’s a showstopping dessert that can’t help but take center stage. This version, an ode to the classic, imbues it with notes of ripe banana and salty-sweet candied nuts for a fun take on banana pudding.</p>\n    <p>The dessert is essentially three separate recipes: The first, the choux, is a simple yet hardworking dough that gets cooked both on the stovetop and in the oven. The initial stovetop cooking step helps the dough puff in the oven, so don’t skip it. And piping the dough into connected puffs in lieu of one continuous ring allows guests to pull off just the right amount with ease. The banana cream filling gets its bold flavor by steeping the peels (yes, the peels!) in milk before turning it into a pastry cream and lightening it with whipped cream, a concoction known as diplomat cream. To finish it off, candied nuts—made by coating pecans in whipped egg white and sugar, then baking them until crisp—adds a welcomed crunch. (But feel free to use 1 cup store-bought candied nuts to make life easier.) It’s no doubt a project, but you can make one or all of the components at least a day before to get ahead.</p>\n    <h2>Recipe notes</h2>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#main-content\">Back to top</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/banana-pudding-paris-brest\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>We may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article.</p>\n<p>Though I’m a sucker for sundresses and sandals, this year I’m feeling ready—and excited—for <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/fall-2025-fashion-trends/\">fall fashion</a>. Getting creative with layering, embracing warm shades of olive greens and chocolate browns, and breaking out my favorite barn jackets and boots feels like the reset I’ve been craving. One of the best parts about fall style is that the pieces are all built to last—a good sweater or tailored coat can stay with you for years, while summer pieces like raffia and linen always seem to need replacing. Last year, I built a foolproof <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/fashion/wardrobe-essentials/fall-capsule-wardrobe-2024/\">10-piece</a> fall capsule wardrobe, and instead of feeling the urge to shop for newness this season, I’m more inspired to reimagine the staples I already own and love.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Camille Styles folding fall capsule wardrobe pieces.&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/style/fall-capsule-wardrobe/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fall-capsule-wardrobe-865x1296.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>10 Timeless Fall Essentials:</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li>The Everyday Jeans</li>\n      <li>The Leather Boot</li>\n      <li>The Lightweight Layer</li>\n      <li>The Suede Bag</li>\n      <li>The Statement Belt</li>\n      <li>The Basic Blazer</li>\n      <li>The Tailored Trouser</li>\n      <li>The Neutral Sweater</li>\n      <li>The Classic Loafers</li>\n      <li>The Knit Dress</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>With these 10 essentials, I’ve found there are endless ways to get dressed for the moments that matter most this time of year: coffee dates, <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/friendsgiving-recipe-ideas/\">Friendsgiving dinners</a>, college game days, and cozy weekend getaways. </p>\n<p>Ahead, I’m sharing how I’m styling my fall capsule wardrobe for six occasions you’re likely to have on your calendar—using pieces you probably already have in your closet.</p>\n<h2>Your 10-Piece Fall Capsule Wardrobe, Styled for Every Occasion</h2>\n<h2>Cozy Morning Coffee Date</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Everyday Jeans + Neutral Sweater + Classic Loafers</i>\n    </p>\n<p>There’s nothing cozier than grabbing a cappuccino on a crisp fall morning, and this outfit is my go-to for those casual moments. A soft sweater and broken-in jeans feel effortless, while loafers add just enough polish that I still feel put together. I’d also layer on some socks with my loafers for added warmth and texture. It’s cozy, classic, and takes all of two minutes to throw on.</p>\n<h2>Office-to-Dinner Transition</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Tailored Trouser + Basic Blazer + Statement Belt</i>\n    </p>\n<p>When your day doesn’t stop at five, this outfit works overtime. Tailored trousers and a blazer give structure for the office, but come happy hour, I’ll button the blazer and cinch it at the waist with a belt—it instantly feels more styled and flattering. To finish the transition, I swap my loafers for kitten heels and add a bold lip. Just like that, I’m ready for a night out.</p>\n<h2>Friendsgiving Dinner Party</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Knit Dress + Leather Boot + Suede Bag</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Friendsgiving is my favorite excuse to get a little dressed up while still staying comfortable. A knit dress is cozy enough for hours at the dinner table but feels elevated with tall leather boots. I’ll carry a suede bag to add texture—and to sneak in a bottle of wine or some homemade pumpkin sourdough for the host.</p>\n<h2>Warm Weekend Getaway</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Everyday Jeans + Neutral Sweater + Lightweight Layer</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Whether you’re heading to the countryside with your SO or a cabin with your friends, this outfit is all about ease. A lightweight layer over denim and a sweater keeps you cozy in shifting temps, while still looking photo-ready. It’s proof that packing from your fall capsule wardrobe means less stress and more adventure. I’m obsessed with cuffed, dark denim for fall, and this houndstooth jacket is neutral and versatile, while still making a statement.</p>\n<h2>Festive Gameday</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Knit Dress + Statement Belt + Leather Boots</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Game days in fall call for an outfit that’s spirited but stylish. A knit dress belted at the waist adds shape without sacrificing comfort, and boots keep things practical whether you’re in the stands or at the tailgate. Obviously you might have to tailor the color scheme to root for your team of choice (hook ’em horns), but the formula feels festive without leaning too casual.</p>\n<h2>Brunch &amp; Shopping</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Neutral Sweater +  Tailored Trouser + Classic Loafers</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/fall-capsule-wardrobe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n    <p>For a French superstar chef whose eponymous NYC restaurant has received two Michelin stars, Daniel Boulud’s demeanor is unexpectedly laid-back and jovial.</p>\n    <p>His Zoom profile photo shows two versions of Boulud staring at each other through a mirror—one in black and one in white—clearly meant to denote good and evil. While he says the depiction is “very me on both sides,” you really wouldn’t know it from talking to him. Boulud is laughing as he turns the camera on his phone around to show me his lunch spread, which consists of butter chicken and a large glass bottle of Evian. “I grew up on Evian in France—and I grew up as a young chef in restaurants drinking it,” says Boulud.</p>\n    <p>Along with Evian and American tennis star Francis Tiafoe, Boulud organized a Daniel-approved viewing experience for the final rounds of the US Open, with <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-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\">a limited-edition menu</a> at <a href=\"https://www.danielnyc.com/\">Restaurant DANIEL</a> (for a little treat for those outside of New York, boxes featuring some of the menu’s flavors are available on <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-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\">Goldbelly</a>).</p>\n    <p>We caught Boulud just before his menu launched and, as ever, he was a fount of knowledge about what people should keep in their kitchens. Below, he shares his favorite kitchen utensils, as well as the one ingredient that he believes separates the good from the great in his favorite cocktail.</p>\n    <h2>Daniel Boulud Kitchen 12\" Stainless-Steel Frying Pan</h2>\n    <p>Boulud partnered with cookware brand Sardel for his own line of pots and pans, and he’s delighted to tell me that he uses them in his own home. “I like to cook a one-pot meal,” he explains. “So you always need a great collection of pots and pans—it's definitely a must.”</p>\n    <h2>Sabatier French knives</h2>\n    <p>When it comes to knives for the home cook, Boulud is wary about recommending Japanese knives saying he finds them “uncomfortable.” In what will be a surprise to no one, he usually reaches for a French knife, with Sabatier being one of his preferred brands.</p>\n    <h2>Michel Bras paring knife</h2>\n    <p>If you’re really drawn to the tempered steel often found in Japanese knives, Boulud recommends the “half Japanese, half French” sets made by French chef Michel Bras. “It's a beautiful knife, and the steel is a tempered steel that is not Damascus steel, but it's very similar and it's really fantastic.”</p>\n    <h2>A really good wooden spatula</h2>\n    <p>One thing that Boulud is really passionate about having around at all times in the kitchen is a wooden spatula. Aside from the fact that wood is “soft, never gets warm or hot, and it’s natural,” Boulud has a sentimental tie to the object.</p>\n    <p>“After my father retired as a farmer, he bought wood tools and a wood machine from his uncle that was getting too old to work with it,” explains Boulud. “He started to make all kinds of tools, including wood spatulas. Thirty years ago when I opened Cafe Boulud he surprised me with a box full of wood spatulas, and he burned the Cafe Boulud logo into all of the handles. Even today, I still cook with his spatulas always.”</p>\n    <p>Boulud also explains that a wooden spatula is the ideal tool to use when making <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/how-to/article/best-scrambled-eggs\">scrambled eggs</a>, which is the one dish he really believes everyone should be able to make. “Scrambled eggs can be delicate, buttery, rich and you can marry that with other things—toast with brioche, with smoked salmon, caviar, truffle—you name it.”</p>\n    <h2>The perfect cocktail addition</h2>\n    <p>I'm a Negroni guy, but I like the white Negroni with gin and Suze, and we put a little bit of dry vermouth and a little bit of lemon,” Boulud says. “It’s my way to go because I love the bitterness of Suze.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/daniel-boulud-favorite-kitchen-tools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Bon Appétit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>Here’s one thing about me: I’m a big cereal person. I grew up on Honey Nut Cheerios, Special K, Life, and Chex, and I still remember the glee with which I’d tear through those <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mini-Cereal-Boxes-Variety-Pack/dp/B0CQC4BSMM/\">mini boxes</a> of sugar cereal that my mom would buy for my brother and me as a treat on (very) rare occasions. So when I started hearing about a new class of cereals popping up—ones labeled “protein cereal” and listed promises like “high fiber” and “grain-free”—I was intrigued.</p>\n<p>We’re living in a high-protein world now, at least according to grocery store shelves and my email inbox, so the protein-ification of the cereal aisle is hardly surprising. But do any of these cereals actually taste good? I set out on a mission to find out. After tasting over a dozen varieties, I’m here to report back.</p>\n<h2>The best protein cereal overall: Seven Sundays</h2>\n<p>Specs (Super Fruity Oat Protein Cereal)</p>\n<p><strong>Serving size:</strong> 1 cup<strong>Calories:</strong> 160<strong>Protein:</strong> 5 grams<strong>Fiber:</strong> 3 grams<strong>Sugar:</strong> 7 grams<strong>Price per box:</strong> $9<strong>Favorite flavor:</strong> Super Fruity</p>\n<p>Out of all of the cereals I tried, Seven Sundays is the one I will definitely be buying for myself in the future. Founded way back in 2011, the brand positions itself as an alternative to traditional cereals. It offers a few different cereal product lines, including Little Crispies and the more protein-forward Sunflower Cereal and Oat Protein Cereals, all of which are refined-sugar free.</p>\n<p><strong>What we love:</strong> Unlike some other cereals here, Seven Sundays’ ingredient list is short and simple and consists of items you’d recognize—think coconut oil, sunflower or oat protein, corn, almonds, and cassava. There’s no monk fruit, stevia, or artificial sweeteners in sight here. Instead, Seven Sundays uses maple syrup, dates, or wildflower honey. The brand’s take on Fruit Loops is coated in a mix of real fruit powder and citrus extracts rather than any “natural flavors.” Of course, none of this would matter if the stuff didn’t taste good; but those ingredients translate to A-plus flavor. This is cereal that tastes nutritious in a good way, a grown-up take on the ultra-processed versions I grew up on.</p>\n<p><strong>What we’d leave:</strong> With only five grams of protein in the Oat Protein and Sunflower cereals, Little Sundays has the same amount of protein as a serving of good old-fashioned Cheerios—which is to say, not that much. That said, it’s a delicious cereal in its own right, which is why it’s our top pick.</p>\n<h2>The best high-protein cereal: Magic Spoon</h2>\n<p>Specs (Fruity)</p>\n<p><strong>Serving size:</strong> 1 cup<strong>Calories:</strong> 150<strong>Protein:</strong> 13 grams<strong>Fiber:</strong> 1 gram<strong>Sugar:</strong> 0 grams<strong>Price per box:</strong> $10<strong>Favorite flavor:</strong> Fruity</p>\n<p>If five grams of protein isn’t going to cut it for you, meet Magic Spoon. Self-described as “the high-protein, keto-friendly, gluten-free, grain-free, soy-free, wheat-free, naturally flavored, totally delicious, childlike cereal for grown-ups” (that’s a mouthful!), it’s got up to 14 grams of protein per serving and comes in flavors like Fruity, Cinnamon Toast, Frosted Cereal, and Blueberry Muffin.</p>\n<p><strong>What we love:</strong> To put it simply, Magic Spoon is the protein cereal for protein powder and bar lovers. Its primary ingredient is a milk protein blend made up of casein and whey protein concentrate, which is how it gets 12–14 grams of protein per serving—more than any other cereal on this list. It’s sweetened with a blend of allulose and monk fruit, making it sugar-free, and it has some added inulin for a small boost of fiber (1–2 grams, to be exact).</p>\n<p>If you’re an OG Fruit Loops lover, you’ll be pleased to know that, flavor-wise, the Magic Spoon Fruity Cereal was the closest thing I tried that compared to the original. It was my favorite of the flavors I tried, though the Cocoa and Peanut Butter were also pretty tasty.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-protein-cereals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>Story highlights</h3>\n<p>Olympian Allison Schmitt struggled with depression after the 2012 London Games</p>\n<p>The swimmer decided to open up after her cousin's suicide</p>\n<p>\n            Imagine that swimming is what you’ve loved for more than 15 years, but whenever you dive into the pool, you feel like a disappointment, unmotivated to go forward. The feeling is almost destructive. That was what was going on in <a href=\"http://www.teamusa.org/usa-swimming/athletes/Allison-Schmitt\">Allison Schmitt</a>’s mind during training after the 2012 London Olympic Games. \n    </p>\n<p>It hasn’t always been that way.</p>\n<p>To Schmitt, swimming is a lifestyle, not a responsibility. Even when she felt stressed, she wouldn’t see swimming as a burden. Instead, she looked at it as something fun.</p>\n<p>“It’s what keeps me going,” she said.</p>\n<p>In and out of the pool, Schmitt keeps a positive attitude. She prefers to be a happy person, not the downer. “Laugh it off” is her go-to coping mechanism.</p>\n<p>Jack Bauerle, Schmitt’s coach at the University of Georgia until 2013, has known her since 2005. He calls her a giver. “Sometimes, she puts her feelings in the back burner so that she could help others,” Bauerle said.</p>\n<h2>Road to the Olympics</h2>\n<p>A swimming career that would net eight Olympic medals started when Schmitt was 9. As “the kid that wanted to [play] every sport,” Schmitt was a soccer player but didn’t end up making the team. She decided to devote her athletic spirit and talents to the pool.</p>\n<p>In fact, Schmitt didn’t quite like swimming at first; she was just following her older sister, Kirsten. Her fondness for swimming grew as she made friends on the team, and those relationships became an increasingly important part of her life.</p>\n<p>Growing up swimming, Schmitt has always been disciplined. No matter how busy the training, she made sure that she finished schoolwork and didn’t miss classes.</p>\n<p>It was a surprise when she found out that she made the Olympic team for the 2008 Beijing Games. She thought she wouldn’t be qualified because she was the “slow kid.” She didn’t feel like she belonged on the team and even had a “breakdown” during the training camp.</p>\n<p>Winning a bronze medal in the 4x200-meter freestyle relay and almost making it to the 200-meter freestyle final during the Games gave her confidence.</p>\n<p>Between 2008 and 2012, she trained as hard as she could while studying psychology at the University of Georgia. Before the London Games, she took a year off from school to concentrate on preparing for the game.</p>\n<p>Her effort paid off: She hauled in three golds in the 2012 Games.</p>\n<h2>The shadows of depression</h2>\n<p>The London Olympics marked a high point in Schmitt’s swimming career. After that, depression crept in.</p>\n<p>She became cranky and got irritated at minor problems. She remembered getting mad at not having the sports drink that she liked on the day of training and thinking, “This is the worst day ever.”</p>\n<p>She began to sleep more and more. When she entered the water, she didn’t feel motivated, instead thinking she was a disappointment.</p>\n<p>Schmitt didn’t want others to notice. All she wanted was for her team to achieve its goal and to do what she could as a good teammate.</p>\n<p>“Allison is the last person you would think that will get depressed,” said Bob Bowman, Schmitt’s coach since 2006. “She just has a bubbly, happy and smiling personality.”</p>\n<p>He knew something was off when he got calls from a crying, upset Schmitt after the London Games.</p>\n<p>Her performance in the pool also tipped her off. “The spirit wasn’t there,” said Bauerle, Schmitt’s Georgia swimming coach. “You could just see the difference sometimes.”</p>\n<p>Bauerle thought it was just a passing phase, “post-Olympic blues.” But for Schmitt, this “phase” lasted a little too long.</p>\n<p>She had kept her struggles from friends and family. The hidden pains, however, didn’t fool fellow Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, her surrogate brother.</p>\n<p>In January 2015, Schmitt was at what she calls the breaking point. She would dive into the water, thinking, “oh, my gosh, I can’t do this anymore.” She became angrier and more isolated. Then Phelps reached out, telling Schmitt that he would be there to help if she needed anything. Coaches and teammates also came to her aid.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/09/health/turning-points-allison-schmitt-depression-struggle/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The participants were asked to taste different liquid solutions of simple and more complex carbohydrates under normal conditions and then while the sweet receptors on their tongues were blocked.</p>\n<p>The researchers discovered that even when the sweet taste receptors were blocked, the study participants could still detect a starchy taste.</p>\n<p>It was previously assumed that starch was tasteless, but the new findings suggest that starch is broken down into glucose oligomers by an enzyme in our saliva, called alpha-amylase, and these so-called glucose oligomers can be tasted, Lim said.</p>\n<p>Some of the study participants described the taste of glucose oligomers as cereal-like, bread-like or rice-like and generally “starchy.”</p>\n<p>“It has long been assumed that simple sugars are the only class of carbohydrates that humans can taste. Thus our findings are surprising,” Lim said.</p>\n<p>“At the same time, I am not surprised, because humans use starch as a major source of energy, which enables the body to perform its functions.”</p>\n<p>The team noted its study shows the first direct demonstration that humans can taste glucose oligomers and reveals that human taste is much more complicated than previously thought.</p>\n<h3>Content by Food &amp; Wine</h3>\n<p/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"http://www.foodandwine.com/fwx/slideshow/most-insane-restaurants?xid=pd_cnn_sept16_healthtest\">The most insane restaurants</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"http://www.foodandwine.com/slideshows/best-pizza-unexpected-places?xid=pd_cnn_sept16_healthtest\">The best pizza in unexpected places</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"http://www.foodandwine.com/slideshows/best-burgers-us?xid=pd_cnn_sept16_healthtest\">Best burgers in the US</a>\n    </p>\n<p>For instance, “as much as we know that glucose oligomer detection is not through the sweet taste receptor, we do not yet know the exact mechanism of how we detect them,” Lim said.</p>\n<p>As the mechanism remains a mystery, some scientists said they are dubious about the new study.</p>\n<p>\n            “It is not likely to be a sixth taste. Instead it is probably just another version of sweet taste initiated by the taste cells that respond to sugars, noncaloric sweeteners and sugar polymers,” said Dr. <a href=\"http://www.monell.org/faculty/people/margolskee\">Robert Margolskee</a>, director and president of Monell Chemical Senses Center, who was not involved in the study. \n    </p>\n<p>“Mechanistically it is plausible that there is either a glucose oligomer receptor … or that it is from enzymatic breakdown within the oral cavity of the glucose polymers into glucose that then gets transported into the sweet-responding taste cells,” he said.</p>\n<h2>Other candidates for the sixth taste</h2>\n<p>It isn’t the first time scientists have made the case for a sixth taste.</p>\n<p>\n            Last year, researchers at Purdue University published a study in <a href=\"http://chemse.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/07/02/chemse.bjv036.abstract\">the journal Chemical Senses</a> that suggested we can detect fat as a taste.\n    </p>\n<p>For the study, which involved two separate experiments, researchers asked 102 adults to taste multiple cups of solutions that each contained a compound for either sweet, sour, salty, bitter, umami or fatty tastes. The study participants were asked to sort each solution into the taste group to which they believed it belonged.</p>\n<p>\n            The researchers noticed the participants succeeded in <a href=\"http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2015/Q3/research-confirms-fat-is-sixth-taste-names-it-oleogustus.html\">grouping the fatty acids together</a> and separately from the other solutions.\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/07/health/starchy-sixth-taste-discovered/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The VIP program consists of workbooks, documentary viewing, four educational sessions and caring for interactive baby dolls over the weekend, from Friday afternoon to Monday morning. \n    </p>\n<p>The fake baby cries when it needs be fed, burped, rocked or changed and tracks mishandling and how well the doll is cared for. At the time of the study, each doll cost about $1,200 Australian, equivalent to about $900 US.</p>\n<p>The study found that 8% of girls who cared for the model babies had given birth at least once by age 20, compared with only 4% of those who took the standard classes. Similarly, 9% of girls in the baby simulator group had at least one abortion, compared with 6% of the non-baby group.</p>\n<p>\n            This is the first long-term study to look at pregnancy outcomes of the program throughout girls’ entire teenage years until they turn 20, said epidemiologist <a href=\"http://telethonkids.org.au/our-people/staff-student-index/b/sally-anne-brinkman/\">Sally Brinkman</a> of the Telethon Kids Institute at the University of Western Australia and lead author of the study. \n    </p>\n<h2>‘Clearly, the program doesn’t work’</h2>\n<p>The researchers took into account the girls’ socioeconomic status, family type, prior sexual experience, prior baby-caring responsibility, level of psychological distress, smoking and alcohol use, and education, but the difference between the two groups remains significant.</p>\n<p>“It is definitely more than just a trend,” Brinkman said. “Clearly, the program doesn’t work.”</p>\n<p>According to the study, schools in over 89 countries use the Realityworks baby simulator program, including the United States.</p>\n<p>The president and CEO of Realityworks, Timm Boettcher, said the study recklessly associated its products with the Australian health agencies’ adapted versions.</p>\n<p>The study “was not a representation of our curriculum and simulator learning modality, but the researchers’ ‘adaptation’ and is consequently not reflective of our product nor its efficacy,” Boettcher said in a statement. “The RealCare Program, is a combination of curriculum and hands-on aids, and if they are being tested and judged for effectiveness should be judged in their entirety.”</p>\n<p>Brinkman said that although her study didn’t involve as many educational sessions as Realityworks’ programs, what the researchers did for the study is overall “very similar” to what Realityworks recommends. “I would be surprised to see a couple of more educational sessions would make a difference on the results,” she said.</p>\n<p>She and her colleagues have advocated for an end to the fake baby program, but some schools asked whether the program should be tweaked or the girls should have the fake babies for longer.</p>\n<p>Brinkman is not sure whether such amendments would have an impact and compared the scenario to testing a drug. If research evidence has clearly pointed out adverse effects, “it’s generally not a thing for people to say ‘oh, they just need more of the drug.’ “</p>\n<p>Brinkman considers this a cautionary tale and hopes long-term studies can be conducted in the future to evaluate the effectiveness of educational programs before they are widely implemented and cost taxpayers’ money.</p>\n<h2>‘Maybe it wasn’t that bad’</h2>\n<p>Due to the anonymous nature of the study, researchers were unable to pinpoint reasons why the program might not work as well as planned.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/08/30/health/baby-simulator-teenage-pregnancy/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>Story highlights</h3>\n<p>Pediatric group concludes that violent video games increase aggression</p>\n<p>Alternatively, some research shows that gaming may decrease violence</p>\n<p>President Donald Trump said Thursday during a White House meeting on school safety that the nation needs to address what young people are seeing.</p>\n<p>“I’m hearing more and more people saying the level of violence on video games is really shaping young people’s thoughts,” he said. “And then you go the further step, and that’s the movies. You see these movies – they’re so violent, and yet a kid is able to see the movie if sex isn’t involved.” Killing, though, is involved, he said.</p>\n<p>His remarks were dismissed by Chris Grady, a survivor of the February 14 shootings at Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida: “I grew up playing video games … first-person shooter games, and I would never, ever dream of taking the lives of any of my peers.”</p>\n<p>\n            In Munich, Germany, an <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/24/europe/germany-munich-shooting/index.html\">18-year-old gunman</a> who killed nine people in July 2016 was a fan of first-person shooter video games, according to reports. This detail led many to worry that violent video games may be negatively affecting their own children. \n    </p>\n<p>What is the truth?</p>\n<p>Both the American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics take a firm stance against children and teens playing violent video games.</p>\n<p>The psychological group reports that more than 90% of children in the United States play video games. Among kids between the ages of 12 and 17, the number rises to 97%. More important, 85% or more of video games on the market contain some form of violence. The titles seem to say it all: “Manhunt,” “Thrill Kill,” “Gears of War” and “Mortal Kombat.” However, even the seemingly benign “Pokemon Go” requires players to go to battle.</p>\n<p>\n            The American Psychological Association observed in an August 2015 <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/about/policy/violent-video-games.aspx\">policy statement</a> that research demonstrated a link “between violent video game use and both increases in aggressive behavior … and decreases in prosocial behavior, empathy, and moral engagement.”\n    </p>\n<p>\n            In its July 2016 <a href=\"http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2016/07/14/peds.2016-1298\">guideline</a> on media violence,<strong> </strong>the American Academy of Pediatrics warned that violent media set a poor example for kids. Video games, the academy noted, “should not use human or other living targets or award points for killing, because this teaches children to associate pleasure and success with their ability to cause pain and suffering to others.”  \n    </p>\n<p>Overall, the academy’s summary of the results from more than 400 studies revealed a “significant” link between being exposed to violent media (in general) and aggressive behavior, aggressive thoughts and angry feelings.</p>\n<p>These clear, no-nonsense arguments appeal to many parents. However, they may not represent the views of the entire field. Some social scientists have come up with more unexpected results.</p>\n<p>Whitney DeCamp, an associate professor of sociology at Western Michigan University, says the evidence points to either no relationship between playing video games and violent behavior or an “insignificant” link between the two.</p>\n<p>Sure, he said, some studies have revealed a connection between kids playing violent video games and violent behavior. But there is a problem with “looking at those two things in a vacuum”: Kids who like to play brutal video games may have a predisposition toward aggression, he said.</p>\n<p>The real question, he said: Does playing violent games cause a person to act violently?</p>\n<p>\n            In his <a href=\"https://ee46fd3b-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/tbdresearch0/2015iac.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7coiC166BHf1_4d37vjzqpdBgGYQAM9IQp9Ds-dp2wXK9VCcZB07bqxxvO8Txw_HSfFAfSn8HfoQXzXhR7XbzGn04D0irmzaX9fBpQh6Xt3WYha69hDusr2EmuVcOxu1fQC3nqIU_ZyqMhmat9Cmzlv-dSNPtKXfhMbOVFKALQf9ipOcIicrTQLkQejBLh-MomCPMH8vK2Ut6kW3kPf2YH39s1jdjA%3D%3D&amp;attredirects=0\">own study</a>, he examined that question using data from the 2008 Delaware School Survey, which included responses from 6,567 eighth-graders. Among the questions, students were asked whether they had played violent video games in the past year. DeCamp factored out the propensity to play violent video games (due to a natural attraction to brutality) along with other factors, such as gender and family relations. \n    </p>\n<p>He discovered that playing video games, no matter how bloody, did not predict violent behavior.</p>\n<p>Christopher Ferguson, associate professor and co-chairman of the Department of Psychology at Stetson University, supports this view. In fact, he goes so far as to suggest that violent video games may help reduce societal violence rather than increase it.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/07/25/health/video-games-and-violence/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Bargibant’s pygmy seahorses look almost exactly like the gorgonian corals they live in, thanks in part to their unusually stubby snouts</h2>\n<p>Pygmy seahorses, among the smallest vertebrates in the world, are exceptional camouflage artists. At an <a href=\"https://oceana.org/marine-life/pygmy-seahorse/\">average size</a> of just 0.55 to 1.06 inches, these tiny creatures live symbiotically with <a href=\"https://www.sbnature.org/publications/blog/2/posts/82/sbnature-blog\">gorgonian corals</a> in the western Pacific Ocean, appearing with textures and colors that match the branching reefs. They blend in so well with their surroundings that researchers only discovered the animals within the last 60 years.</p>\n<p>To broaden the still limited understanding of pygmy seahorses, researchers from the University of Konstanz in Germany and the South China Sea Institute of Oceanology investigated the genetics of the <a href=\"https://australian.museum/learn/animals/fishes/pygmy-seahorse-hippocampus-bargibanti-whitley-1970/\">Bargibant’s pygmy seahorse</a> (<i>Hippocampus bargibanti</i>) to uncover the basis of its special mimicry ability.</p>\n<p>The work, published August 25 in the journal <i> PNAS</i>, suggests the tiny seahorse’s camouflage and other traits are driven in part by genetic loss, rather than gain.</p>\n<p>“In all of these adaptations, we see examples of massive gene losses and a seemingly paradoxical release of evolutionary creativity,” <a href=\"https://www.evolutionsbiologie-uni-konstanz.com/prof-dr-axel-meyer.html\">Axel Meyer</a>, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Konstanz and co-leader of the study, says in a <a href=\"https://www.uni-konstanz.de/en/university/news-and-media/current-announcements/news-in-detail/why-the-pygmy-seahorse-has-a-snub-nose/\">statement</a>, “which ultimately explains the unusual appearance and remarkable biology of these creatures.”</p>\n<p>Seahorses are bony fish with an unusual appearance, featuring horse-like heads and curling, prehensile tails. They lack scales and only have a couple of fins to help them move, making them the <a href=\"https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/70705-slowest-fish\">slowest fish in the world</a>.</p>\n<p>While seahorses typically have a long, horse-like snout, the snouts of Bargibant’s pygmy seahorses are short and stout—exactly like the polyps on the gorgonian corals that host them. This isn’t a coincidence—in fact, the seahorses have polyp-like knobs elsewhere on their bodies, too. If the creature had a regular snout, predators would have an easier time spotting it.</p>\n<p>Pygmy seahorses also have a strange biological quirk: It’s the males that carry embryos—and they nourish them inside their bodies. Other male seahorses also carry their young, but they often do so in pouches on their tails.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/newly-discovered-pygmy-seahorse-species-size-fingernail-180975001/\">pygmy seahorses</a> are “just something very odd and interesting and in need of explanation,” Meyer tells the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/25/science/evolution-genetics-seahorses.html\"> New York Times</a>’ Carl Zimmer.</p>\n<p>Meyer and his colleagues wanted to discover which genes are responsible for the pygmy seahorse’s atypical traits. To examine the camouflage ability, they analyzed the animal’s gene expression pattern during the growth of its snout region.</p>\n<p>Like some mammals, seahorses have short heads with squat facial proportions in their early development that align with the “<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/baby-schema\">baby schema</a>,” a set of features that trigger caregiving responses. The pygmy seahorse’s head, however, stays in this “childlike” developmental stage into adulthood, Meyer explains in a <a href=\"https://www.uni-konstanz.de/en/university/news-and-media/current-announcements/news-in-detail/why-the-pygmy-seahorse-has-a-snub-nose/\">statement</a>.</p>\n<p>“Normally, a combination of different genetic components causes the snout of a seahorse to grow proportionally faster than other parts of the body from a certain age and thus become elongated,” he adds. “In the pygmy seahorse, however, we have now discovered that these different growth rates are suppressed.”</p>\n<p>This suppression comes from the loss of a gene called <i>hoxa2b</i>, which the team also demonstrated by using a genome editing tool called <a href=\"https://www.yourgenome.org/theme/what-is-crispr-cas9/\">CRISPR-Cas9</a> on zebrafish.</p>\n<p>But that wasn’t the only gene lost: The team also studied the genetics behind the seahorse’s skin color, skin knobs and immune system. They revealed that the tiny vertebrates, which branched off from full-sized seahorses around 18 million years ago, evolved to lose an uncommonly large amount of immune genes. What’s more, they discovered that pygmy seahorses have the smallest known set of immune system-related genes of all vertebrates.</p>\n<p>According to the statement, this is likely related to the animal’s tolerance to coral toxins. These toxins protect the seahorses from microbes, so their immune systems don’t need the genes that would normally provide this protection.</p>\n<p>Additionally, for male pygmy seahorses to carry their young inside their bodies, they likely needed to lose immune genes so that their immune systems don’t attack the eggs, which are foreign tissue.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/these-bumpy-little-seahorses-are-amazing-camouflage-artists-scientists-pinpoint-the-gene-loss-behind-their-special-traits-180987274/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>Story highlights</h3>\n<p>An effort aims to use agriculture to bring residents back to Georgia's Sapelo Island</p>\n<p>The Red Pea Project boosts production of local heirloom crops</p>\n<p>Off the coast of Georgia lies a quiet island, accessible only by boat and home to about 50 year-round residents – all descendants of slaves.</p>\n<p>Sapelo Island is a tangle of marsh and farmland, and its residents are known as Saltwater Geechees.</p>\n<p>This remote culture has survived years of displacement and migration from their island. With little resources available, Saltwater Geechees have learned to live off the land, fishing local waters and growing much of their own food.</p>\n<p>“I’m what you refer to as a ‘beenhere,’ ” joked Cornelia Walker Bailey, a Sapelo resident and vice president of the Sapelo Island Cultural and Revitalization Society. “It means I’ve always been here.”</p>\n<p>Bailey is one of the last residents born and raised in Hog Hammock, the sole community still owned by residents on Sapelo. Many are moving to the mainland to be closer to schools and possible income.</p>\n<p>In an effort to revitalize the island and preserve their culture, Bailey wants to bring residents back by using agriculture, specifically the Sapelo Island red pea. Red peas, their origins in Sierra Leone, have been growing in residents’ gardens for centuries.</p>\n<p>“We will always have a backyard or a side yard with red peas in it. We want to grow more … so we can hire young people, so they can come back home and plant peas,” Bailey said.</p>\n<h2>A pea with history</h2>\n<p>Bailey has paired up with Dr. William Thomas, physician and owner of the Sapelo Island Birdhouses. The man known affectionately as Doc Bill has invested many years in the revitalization of Sapelo. When this opportunity came up, he joined Jerome Dixon of Georgia Coastal Gourmet Farms to start the Sapelo Island Red Pea Project.</p>\n<p>“To get people involved in a project, they have to have an interest in it. It has to be something they identify with,” Thomas said, “and the red pea is something they brought from Africa to the Georgia coast, and that has strong ties.”</p>\n<p>He says everyone in the community is familiar with the pea. “They eat it in dishes, they know how it grows, and they have a whole culture of planting and harvesting it.”</p>\n<p>Now in its third year, the Red Pea Project has increased overall production land to 5 acres.</p>\n<p>A large part of this growth is the partnership with the mainland’s Georgia Coastal Gourmet Farms. Dixon’s family came from Sapelo generations ago and has farmed this area of the mainland for more than 60 years.</p>\n<p>Today, the project grows three heirloom crops with history in Georgia: Sapelo Island red peas, Sapelo Island purple ribbon sugar cane and sour oranges.</p>\n<p>“I’m really excited about the purple ribbon sugar cane,” Dixon said. “My grandfather directly planted that particular variety. To be able to handle things he handled is exciting.”</p>\n<h2>Preserving Geechee foodways</h2>\n<p>Dixon remains closely tied to the Geechee culture and enthusiastic about preserving Geechee foodways.</p>\n<p>“Sapelo Island red peas were brought to Sapelo Island by slaves from Africa who worked on the plantation,” he said. “You look at stuff that has not been grown since the 1800s, when slaves were forced to grow the crops. Now, people like myself are able to do it at our leisure.”</p>\n<p>Heirloom crops, like the Sapelo Island red pea and purple ribbon sugar cane, are more than just history. The diversity of the products give chefs more options.</p>\n<h3>Join the conversation</h3>\n<p/>\n    <p>Sapelo Island red peas are about the same size as any other pea. “However, they are genetically distinct from commercial or modern varieties. They are unique in color, texture and taste,” Dixon said, elaborating on the significance of diversity. “By eating and seeing this crop grow gives consumers a sense of importance to making sure another great heirloom variety thrives 50 more years.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/14/health/sapelo-island-red-peas/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

America watched the president’s recovery intently, and <a href=\"http://hms.harvard.edu/news/harvard-medicine/harvard-medicine/play/backstory\">exercise paired with a healthy diet</a> became a new mantra to ward off heart disease. The following year, Eisenhower was elected to a<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/presidents/dwightdeisenhower\"> second term</a>, and America’s focus on heart health – and, specifically, what constituted a heart-healthy diet – burgeoned.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            But by the 1960s, two opposing ideas about what caused heart disease emerged. John Yudkin, a British physiologist and nutritionist, suggested that sugar consumption was linked to incidence of and mortality rates from coronary heart disease: Specifically, eating too much sugar might boost levels of <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/triglycerides.html\">triglycerides</a>, a type of fat found in blood.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Meanwhile, Ancel Keys, an American physiologist, argued that heart disease was related to scarfing down too many <a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-truth-about-fats-bad-and-good\">bad types of fat</a>, as such fats may raise cholesterol and possibly cause a heart attack.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Keys’ theory became more widely accepted than Yudkin’s. Keys even graced a <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19610113,00.html\">1961 cover of Time magazine</a> and was one of the first scientists to champion the health benefits of the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3684452/\">Mediterranean diet</a>.\n    </p>\n<p>Whatever happened to Yudkin’s theory? Researchers suggest that when the sugar industry “manipulated” the scientific debate on heart disease, his theory – along with other sugar consumption research – was swept under the rug.</p>\n<h2>Old letters reveal new secrets</h2>\n<p>The new paper was led by Cristin Kearns, a postdoctoral researcher at the UCSF School of Dentistry, who collected letters dating from 1959 to 1971 between executives at the Sugar Research Foundation and various scientists.</p>\n<p>\n            Some of the letters, about 319, were in correspondence with <a href=\"http://archives.library.illinois.edu/ead/ua/1505023/1505023f.html\">Roger Adams</a>, an organic chemist at the University of Illinois who died in 1971, and about 27 documents were in correspondence with <a href=\"http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~med00138\">David Mark Hegsted</a>, a nutritionist at Harvard University who died in 2009.\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/12/health/sugar-industry-heart-disease-research/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Since movies, TV shows, books, video games, and social media are such a huge part of kids’ lives, it makes sense that kids can learn important lessons about character through media.</p>\n    <p>\n            <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/blog/100-ways-to-help-kids-learn-grit-determination-and-resilience?utm_source=cnn&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_campaign=advice\">100+ ways to help kids learn grit, determination and resilience</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>Here are some specific things you can do or say to reinforce character:</p>\n    <h2>Watch sports.</h2>\n    <p>Not only can watching sports with kids be a really fun way to bond over a favorite team or player, it can be a perfect opportunity to point out character strengths from teamwork to perseverance. After cheering over a big touchdown or basket, point out how important the linebackers or passers were to the score: Even though they don’t get all the attention, the team wouldn’t be successful without the admirable work of supporting players.</p>\n    <p>\n            <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/blog/how-movies-can-build-kids-character-and-the-ones-that-do-it-well?utm_source=cnn&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_campaign=advice\">How movies can build kids’ character – and the ones that do it well</a>\n    </p>\n    <h2>Share social media.</h2>\n    <p>From Facebook and Instagram to YouTube, social media is ripe with character lessons. If you notice a post, photo, or video of something especially touching or beautiful, share it with your kid and comment on how much courage it took for the poster to share their story or creative expression.</p>\n    <p>Discuss the risks involved with putting yourself out there and how important it is to take (reasonable) risks to be true to yourself, even though you might face criticism.</p>\n    <h2>Expand your horizons.</h2>\n    <p>Watching documentaries or movies about people who live very different lives can trigger empathy, compassion, and humility. During a family movie night, choose something out of the ordinary – a story about someone of a different race or religion, or about a community that’s less fortunate than yours, or a subculture with different values or beliefs than yours – and encourage discussion afterward.</p>\n    <h2>Play video games together.</h2>\n    <p>Gaming as a family offers the chance to practice teamwork, problem-solving, communication, and perseverance, while also having fun. Choose multiplayer games where gamers are required to work together to win. Model positive, respectful communication during the game (try “I need help over here” instead of “you idiot!”). If kids are trying over and over again to achieve a game goal, you can recognize their effort as well as their success.</p>\n    <p>\n            <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/video/modal/4996841?utm_source=cnn&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_campaign=advice\">Can TV and games teach kids patience and empathy?</a>\n    </p>\n    <h2>Take a time-out.</h2>\n    <h3>Join the conversation</h3>\n    <p/>\n    <p>Most households are abuzz as various mobile devices alert us to text messages or Instagram posts. But we can help teach our kids self-control by resisting the urge to respond immediately. Next time you hear a text message alert (and you know it’s nothing urgent), say out loud, “I don’t need to check that right now.” This lesson can work on social media, too. If you’re a Twitter or Facebook user and you see something that makes you mad, talk through with your kid why you don’t want to respond right away (“I might say something I regret because I’m upset” or “I’d rather tell my friend that this bothers me privately instead of publicly on Twitter”).</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/09/health/kids-character-digital-world/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She made the decision to get a Mirena intrauterine device, known as an IUD; it’s more than 99% effective in preventing pregnancy and lasts for five years.<strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Those facts are part of a concerted effort by the <a href=\"https://thenationalcampaign.org/\">National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy</a>, working in conjunction with entertainment outlets such as MTV, to educate teens and young women about the range of birth control methods available to them.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            But judging by the results of <a href=\"http://www.urban.org/research/publication/knowledge-gaps-and-misinformation-about-birth-control-methods-persist-2016\">a new survey by the Urban Institute,</a> far too many women still don’t know anything about the so-called longer-acting reversible contraceptives, the IUD and the implant, which are more effective at preventing pregnancy than birth control pill and condoms.\n    </p>\n<p>While 90% and 86% of women 18 to 44 were very aware of condoms and the pill respectively, only 31% said they heard a lot about IUDs and implants, according to the Urban Institute survey of roughly 800 women.</p>\n<p>“It’s not a surprise that women were most aware of the condom and birth control pills, but the lack of awareness of IUDs and, in particular, implants was definitely surprising,” said Adele Shartzer, a research associate at the Urban Institute and one of the co-authors of the survey. “I guess I just assumed that most women have at least heard of these methods, but it seems like they really haven’t.”</p>\n<h2>‘The IUD is not the IUD’ of the past</h2>\n<p>According to the survey, 32% of women didn’t know anything about the effectiveness of the implant, a tiny rod inserted in the arm that releases a hormone to prevent pregnancy. Nearly 20% said the same about the IUD.</p>\n<p>As for safety, 21% of the women surveyed said the IUD was either somewhat or very unsafe, and 23% felt the same way about implants.</p>\n<p>\n            “Part of it is that the IUD is not the IUD that it was 20, 30 years ago,” said Ginny Ehrlich, chief executive officer of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. In 1974, the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10308671\">Food and Drug Administration suspended the sale of an IUD known as the Dalkon Shield </a>after reports of deaths and infections among users.\n    </p>\n<p>“And so if young women in particular are getting information from their mothers and their parents, the IUD and implant information that their mothers and parents have might not be accurate,” she said.</p>\n<p>\n            The <a href=\"http://www.acog.org/About-ACOG/News-Room/News-Releases/2011/IUDs-Implants-Are-Most-Effective-Reversible-Contraceptives-Available\">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, in recommendations to doctors in 2011, </a>said IUDs and implants are the most effective reversible contraceptives available and are safe to use by almost all women of reproductive age. These birth control methods can have some side effects, including irregular bleeding or no periods for <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mirena/basics/risks/prc-20012867\">Mirena IUD</a> users, heavy bleeding or anemia for <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/paragard/basics/risks/prc-20013048\">copper IUD</a> users, or back pain and changing bleeding patterns for <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/contraceptive-implant/basics/risks/prc-20015073\">implant users</a>.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            In 2009, 8.5% of women in the United States used an IUD or an implant, <a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/contraceptive-use-united-states#9\">according to the Guttmacher Institute.</a> That’s up from 5.5% in 2007 and 2.4% in 2002.\n    </p>\n<p>It’s hard to know to what extent women head into their doctor’s office with perceptions about IUDs and implants based on family or friends and already have said “yes or no” to themselves about different birth control options based on those perceptions, Shartzer said.</p>\n<p>“IUDs, they’re very safe now, but they do have, kind of from way back, a history of less-than-safe products, and if you’re talking to your aunt or your grandmother about it, that may be kind of their perception. That’s not in line with what the current products are,” she said.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/14/health/iud-birth-control-knowledge-gaps/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Do I need any more proof of the power of advertising?</p>\n<p>Now, with the release of a study showing a direct correlation between a kid’s exposure to alcohol advertising and how much of those alcohol brands they consume, I’m thinking it’s time to start recording football games and watching them via our DVR so we can fast-forward through the commercials.</p>\n<p>\n            “For a long time, a lot of people said, ‘Well advertising doesn’t really make a difference,’ ” when it comes to the impact on underage drinking, said <a href=\"http://www.bumc.bu.edu/care/faculty/timothy-naimi/\">Dr. Timothy Naimi, </a>the lead researcher on the new study and an associate professor at Boston University’s Schools of Medicine and Public Health.\n    </p>\n<p>Now, there is a good body of evidence showing that when kids are exposed to advertising for a particular brand, they’re more likely to drink that brand, he said. What’s been missing until now is an exploration of whether the alcohol ads don’t just influence the brands underage drinkers tend to choose but how much they drink in total.</p>\n<p>\n            The new study, published in the <a href=\"http://www.jsad.com/doi/abs/10.15288/jsad.2016.77.723\">Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs</a>, was based on a sample of more than 1,000 13- to 20-year-olds from across the country who said they had alcohol in the past month. Researchers then asked if they watched any of the 20 most popular non-sports television shows and how much they consumed of the 61 alcohol brands showcased in commercials during those shows.\n    </p>\n<p>What they found is those underage drinkers who didn’t see any alcohol ads drank about 14 drinks per month. That number rose to 33 drinks per month for the young people who had seen what amounts to an average amount of alcohol advertising, said Naimi. Underage drinkers exposed to the greatest amount of alcohol ads drank 200-plus drinks in the past month, he said, though very few of those in the study drank that much.</p>\n<p>\n            After factoring out that kids who watch more television may be more likely to drink anyway, researchers concluded that the more exposure kids had to these alcohol ads, the greater the amount they consumed of those brands. These findings are even more significant when you consider <a href=\"http://www.jsad.com/page/news/may2016\">the findings of another study</a>, which found that kids ages 11 to 14 typically see two to four alcohol ads per day.\n    </p>\n<p>“I think the message is that this adds to evidence that alcohol advertising matters in terms of youth drinking and it demonstrates good support for the idea that alcohol advertising is not only related to which brands kids might choose to drink but how much they choose to drink in total,” said Naimi.</p>\n<h2>\n        <strong>Parents the greatest influence on a child’s drinking</strong>\n</h2>\n<p>\n            Ralph Blackman is president and chief executive officer of <a href=\"http://responsibility.org/\">Responsibility.org</a>, a not-for-profit organization funded by the country’s biggest distillers. The organization is devoted to reducing drunken driving and underage drinking and promoting responsible drinking among people who are legally allowed to consume alcohol. \n    </p>\n<p>While Blackman said he and his team had not been able to review the findings of this newest study to determine their validity, he said parents – more than advertising – play the biggest role in determining a kid’s decision to drink.</p>\n<p>\n            Parents were found to wield 71 times more influence over their children’s decision to drink versus advertising, according to the <a href=\"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2016/images/09/07/influencesonyouthsdecisionsaboutdrinking-2016-03-11.pdf\">2016 Roper Youth Report</a> (PDF).\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/07/health/kids-alcohol-ads-impact-underage-drinking/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>Story highlights</h3>\n<p>Babies with multiple birth defects were born to US women infected with the rubella virus in the 1960s</p>\n<p>What these families have needed may signal what's in store for Zika babies</p>\n<p>One side of the bedroom is an explosion of pink, from the hair accessories and dangling trinkets to the stuffed animals and laundry hamper. The other, starting with the fuzzy pillows and puffy comforter, is an ode to purple.</p>\n<p>Kim Woodford is the pink aficionado in this well-kept townhome in Brooklyn. She’s 51 and believes in Santa. Her roommate, Darvena Idlet, is the same age; they’ve lived together for about 45 years.</p>\n<p>What bound these women together so long ago was an illness that struck while they were in their mothers’ wombs. It robbed them of their hearing and much of their vision, and it damaged their brains.</p>\n<p>They have congenital rubella syndrome, which they acquired during an outbreak of the rubella virus, or German measles. The epidemic swept across America from late 1963 into 1965, infecting an estimated 12.5 million people. And though the symptoms of the virus are generally minor, if detected at all, it takes its harshest toll on the unborn babies of infected pregnant women.</p>\n<p>The story of Kim and Darvena, and thousands of others like them, has largely been forgotten in the United States. But the threat posed by a new virus, Zika, has those intimately familiar with the 1960s rubella outbreak asking pointed questions.</p>\n<p>Who is going to take care of the babies irreparably damaged after being born to Zika-infected women? What resources will be available to their families, whose lives will be forever changed? Who’ll step in to help those mothers left alone after fathers walk away? And what will become of these children when they are adults still in need of around-the-clock care?</p>\n<p>What happened more than a half century ago, they say, should serve as a warning now.</p>\n<h2>Hoping for the best</h2>\n<p>Florence Woodford knew her baby might be harmed when she contracted the rubella virus early in her pregnancy. A doctor with the health department who paid a visit to her Brooklyn home told her as much. If her child survived, he said, she or he could be saddled with a long list of disabilities.</p>\n<p>\n            Though it was largely illegal at the time, the doctor suggested Florence consider having an abortion. The US medical community was finding ways to work around restrictions; ultimately the <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/09/health/rubella-abortion-zika/\">rubella virus helped make abortion legal</a>. \n    </p>\n<p>But abortion wasn’t an option for Florence, a devout Catholic. She chose to hope for the best and believed by keeping her baby she’d be rewarded. When Kim was born with cataracts, she rejoiced.</p>\n<p>“Oh, that’s wonderful. That’ll be OK. We could fix that,” Florence, 76, remembers saying about her second born. “And then as time went on, we found out it was a lot more than that.”</p>\n<p>Kim was among the 20,000 US-born babies harmed by congenital rubella syndrome in the mid-’60s. They faced a lifetime of defects including deafness, blindness, heart disease, neuromuscular tightness and spasticity, intellectual disabilities, autism and more. During the same period, there were 2,100 neonatal deaths and 11,250 abortions and miscarriages, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>\n<p>Kim “looked different,” Florence recalls. She was unable to roll over or sit up. She couldn’t hear. When Florence held her, Kim threw back her head as if she were struggling to see. She cried more than other babies.</p>\n<p>The challenges Kim and her family faced would only grow as she did. Some of the earliest doctors who saw her said she’d never walk or be toilet trained.</p>\n<p>But then a social worker showed up, first prodding and later insisting that Florence take Kim into Manhattan, where Dr. Louis Cooper headed up the Rubella Project, a long-term research and care effort he founded at Bellevue Hospital.</p>\n<p>Florence wept the entire ride there. She was sure Kim would be taken away from her. Instead, with the doctor’s help, she found hope.</p>\n<h2>Desperate for answers</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/08/health/rubella-house-zika-babies-future/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><strong>Modern Love</strong><br/>By David Waters</p>\n<p>I lock the door, hike up my dress, roll down my pantyhose, and perch on the toilet in the bathroom of Ed Dwyer’s Victorian townhouse. I look around. The only bright colors emanate from the Mondrian design on the shower curtain. It has mold along the bottom edge and two of the shower hooks are off the rail. An orangish stain hangs from the lower corner of the window casement, like the hanging tail of an animal who got caught there long ago and perished. I inhale to convince myself that I can’t smell it beneath the lilac air spray. I look for toenail clippings on the floor, but instead see a thin line of ants making the undulating trek from under the bathtub, across the tile floor, and out through the crack under the door. Everyone in San Francisco has ants when it rains. From the street the muffler of a lowrider grumbles, clears its throat, and the wall in front of me trembles in sympathy. The song I hate most, <i>One Less Bitch</i>, by N.W.A., pops into my mind.</p>\n<p>I pee, put myself together, and wash my hands. To the left of the sink I notice a package of Rogaine, an electric toothbrush, the lilac air spray, and a plastic bag of Dude Bombs, something to drop in the toilet to mitigate bad smells, I learn from reading the label. There is no medicine cabinet, but bottles of pills are lined up on the right side of the sink. I see losartan and amlodipine, that would be for blood pressure, and metformin and sitagliptin, that would be for diabetes. Should I worry about this dude’s health, I ask myself? Can he get it up? Not for nothing did I go to nursing school. I dry my hands and check out the second row of meds. A bottle of Viagra, that’s encouraging, but also Cialis and Levitra? That’s scary. If he has all three, are none of them working?</p>\n<p>I see a narrow line of dust behind the sink and know instantly that a photograph was there, and that he moved it. I find her in the cupboard beneath the sink, a woman in a white bikini who looks disturbingly like me, tall, blonde, older. She had a lot of work done. Is that what a Brazilian butt lift should look like? Those super boobs are as unlikely to move as the Pyramids of Giza, and her lips appear painfully bloated and unnatural.</p>\n<p>I remind myself that he just cooked dinner for me, boeuf bourguignon from scratch, and it wasn’t bad. He chose a nice pinot noir. He’s a lawyer for the ACLU, so his politics are impeccable. He’s interesting. He listens to me. That’s rare in men nowadays. And I just passed 60. Nobody clamors for older women and that vibrator can only take me so far.</p>\n<p>I look back at the bathroom and see a slim paperback that I hadn’t noticed before, on the floor beside the toilet, butterflied open to page 62. It is poetry, something modern, a poet I don’t know. The book is marked up, dog-eared, worn. I glimpse him sitting there, engrossed in a poem, his undies around his ankles, his little dick peering down into the vast abyss. The image forces me to smile. I carefully and lovingly, yes lovingly, replace the book exactly as it was. I unlock the door and step out, careful not to disturb the parade of ants.</p>\n<p><strong>Living Room</strong><br/>By Simon Petrie</p>\n<p>While the humans were away, the room moved through the house. It was slow going, impeded by the house’s other rooms to the extent possible. And, though it sought to navigate with utmost care, the room could not help but knock down some items from shelves and tables and mantelpieces in the rooms through which it moved. It hoped these objects were not valuable, or if valuable were not breakable, or if both breakable and valuable were not emotionally prized by the house’s humans; or if all three, that it could credibly place the blame for the damage on one of the other rooms.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brilliantflashfiction.com/2024/06/30/june-2024/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><strong>Softee</strong><br/>By Elizabeth Gassman</p>\n<p>Anthony arrived in his truck on a Tuesday in June. It was the summer I learned to shave my legs.</p>\n<p>I was working the register at Bodiddley’s market, where I had to wear a stiff, red cotton vest and khaki shorts. No denim. Mr. Bodiddley—Al Peterson was his name, but everyone, including his wife, called him Mr. Bodiddley—was very strict about this. In his truck, Anthony wore a white tank top curdled with sweat and chocolate stains. It was an ice cream truck. And even though there was a freezer full of desserts I could purchase for 25% off at the market, I bought a drumstick from Anthony every day for the rest of the summer after I saw him that first afternoon.</p>\n<p>He was hairy, unlike any other man I’d seen. When I told him this two weeks or so after he started showing up, while I counted out the cash for my cone, he laughed.</p>\n<p>“That’s cause they keep ’em clean shaven down here. Boot camp ready.”</p>\n<p>“But don’t you get hot?” I asked when he handed me my change back in a hand shadowed by coarse black hair.</p>\n<p>“It might be hot out there, but it’s cold in the truck,” he said, “It’s a freezer on wheels.”</p>\n<p>He started driving me home not too soon after. He told me about Atlantic City. The bets he made, the bets he lost. He explained to me the importance of the gold Virgin Mary token around his neck. He said that the best ice cream was really in Ocean City. Kohr Brothers was the name he told me to remember. I sat in the passenger seat listening with my knees tucked under my chin trying to stay warm. He’d been right. The truck was a freezer on wheels. In the twenty minutes it took for him to bring me home, stubble poked through the skin of my legs and each night I had to shave it down even though it wasn’t long enough. My mother, who bought extra moisturizer to soothe the razor burns, told me to be more careful. I promised I would.</p>\n<p>I had Anthony drop me off two blocks away from home. Sometimes, we talked while the truck idled before he had to head over to the baseball fields to catch the boys after practice. See, he couldn’t turn it off. If the engine stopped the freezers stopped and he couldn’t risk showing up to the fields with melted popsicles. Those boys were his best customers. If we sat in the truck, talking over the grumbling engine he let me pick anything out of the freezer I wanted.</p>\n<p>“Just not the fudgsicles,” he’d remind me, “They go crazy for the fudgsicles.”</p>\n<p> If Anthony wasn’t telling me about the slots in AC, he was asking me questions about town. Who had money? Why were all the streets in certain neighborhoods named after trees and in others after nothing? Where did Al Peterson come up with the name Bodiddley’s? Why did Mrs. Bodiddley act so high and mighty all the time? Did <i>everyone </i>really go to church on Sundays? </p>\n<p>I had never been considered an expert before. It was, I’m sure, the first time anyone assumed I knew anything at all. Even when I was ringing up groceries, Mr. Bodiddley had a habit of coming by my register and asking if I knew all the codes for discounted fruit. I do, I’d insist. Even if I didn’t, he’d printed and laminated a sheet of them for me at the start of the summer.</p>\n<p>I answered Anthony’s questions with the seriousness of Tom Brokaw on the nightly news. If there was something I did not know—say, if I he wanted to know the name of the Petersons’ German Sheppard—I’d took it upon myself to find out. I took his interest in town as an interest in me. I started leaning across the armrests, trading him for a lick of his orange creamsicle for a spoonful of my Italian ice. I told myself come September he’d offer to bring me back to Jersey with him. We’d find a new town with new cravings. We’d chase the cold.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brilliantflashfiction.com/2024/03/31/march-2024/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I do remember the walk back through the woods, the feeling of his arm round my shoulder, the excited fizz of that. At a certain point we stopped and he kissed me. But I don’t remember what that felt like. There’s a lot I don’t remember. But I remember the cold of that winter. The biting cold. And the icicles that hung from the high gutters of the houses in the street where I lived in a student flat. They grew downwards, like stalactites. He said they could be stalagmites. I knew they couldn’t, knew that the way to remember which was which was by thinking of the French words—‘tomber’ to fall and ‘monter’ to rise up. I knew I was right; I was the one studying French, not him. But I didn’t argue, because I wanted him to like me. I remember that. With a sinking feeling. And a sadness for my young self.</p>\n<p>We were both eighteen, or maybe he was nineteen. I don’t remember. This is what I do remember: there was a party just before the end of my first term at university, in one of the tutors’ houses. My flatmate, who was tired of me being in every evening when she wanted to bring her boyfriend back to the house, said I was to go and not come back until I ‘had a man.’ Those were her exact words. I remember that. (Though she denied it later, of course she was going to do that, she didn’t want to feel responsible.) So I did what she said. Not that I managed to bring him into the house. He dropped me off at the door, with a ‘See you around.’ I remember the words, played them over and over in my mind when I was back home for Christmas, wondering what he’d meant. I don’t remember giving him my home address, but a Christmas card arrived from him. I remember that, and the little fizz that it brought, which I hugged to myself in my chilly little childhood bedroom.</p>\n<p>After that, everything blurs and folds in on itself in my memory. Maybe it was the cold. The wretched pain of it in my nostrils and under my thumb nails. The only things that are clear-cut in the pictures I see of the following January and February are the icicles, rows of them. From my bedroom window I could see them on the houses the length of the road. Every day they grew longer. I went to lectures, some days. Other days I walked around until I saw him, the man who was really just a boy. And probably just as uncertain about everything as I was, but was never going to say so. We went to the cinema together. We sat in my room and listened to the music he liked and I looked out at the icicles as they got bigger and bluer. Maybe I asked him what made them blue; he was studying chemistry, he would know, probably. If I did ask him I don’t remember the answer.</p>\n<p>How long the cold lasted I don’t remember, but this much I know: the relationship melted with the icicles, drop by painful drop. He told me, the boy-man, that there was no future in it, this relationship. Not that it really merited that designation. And like the icicles when they had completely melted, there was nothing left of it afterwards. Apart from what I remember, of course. Though they do say that we remake our memories every time we bring them to mind, so who can say what is real, or ever was.</p>\n<p><strong>Mother’s Day</strong><br/>By Rory Say</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brilliantflashfiction.com/2024/01/31/january-2024/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Garcia-Navarro asks Roy a series of questions about her persecution in India, including threats of arrest and the banning of her book, <i>Azadi</i>, in Kashmir.

It’s like they’re always trying to trip people up and trying to prevent you from thinking clearly. This culture of fear is everywhere here. People are arrested for things they say on Facebook, on Twitter, or what they don’t say. In the U.S., it seems new to you, but we have been living with this, and it’s increasingly becoming normalized. It’s a very disturbing situation, especially for Muslims, where it doesn’t stop with just court cases and jail.

    "body": "<p>Reviewed by Melissa Oliviera</p>\n<p><graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image1-4.png\" alt=\"cover of Crafting the Lyric Essay: Strike a Chord by Heidi Czerwiec\"/><i>The Next American Essay</i> series as well as a handful of wonderful magazines including this one, <i>Brevity</i>, <i>The Seneca Review</i>, <i>River Teeth</i>’s “Beautiful Things,” and others.</p>\n<p>Generally, before anthologies like Randon Billings Noble’s excellent <i>A Harp in the Stars: An Anthology of Lyric Essays</i> came on the scene, I just sought out practitioners whose work I enjoyed and learned by following their work and finding, in the other places they wrote, more people to read. My all-you-can-read lyric essay buffet was satisfying but full of digressions and, to be honest, I didn’t feel like I really understood it as a genre. Over time, the bin in my brain marked “lyric essay” expanded ever further. I couldn’t really pin down what a lyric essay <i>was, </i>though I knew I loved it. Still, when it came to <i>talking</i> about the lyric essay, I didn’t quite have the right vocabulary.</p>\n<p>In Heidi Czerwiec’s wonderful <i> Crafting the Lyric Essay: Strike a Chord</i> (Bloomsbury; March 2024), I found a whole education on the topic of what we could mean when we talk about lyric essays. It’s a genre that has been growing now for over 20 years, but the term “lyric essay” could still be used to describe a nonfiction piece with any or all of the following: pretty writing, hybrid form, heavy use of imagery, more associative (less rigidly narrative) in mode, use of white space, and so on.</p>\n<p>But is a beautifully written essay automatically a lyric essay? Does any nonfiction prose work that is experimental or unconventional count as a lyric essay? Is every miscellaneous, messy, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink essay also a lyric essay, or can we identify stricter formal concerns? As Czerwiec writes, “Lyric thinking, composed of these patterns, may shape itself into various forms, but ultimately, the lyric essay is a structure of thinking, a way of functioning on the page and in the ear, not a form.” <i>Crafting the Lyric Essay </i>serves as a kind of hybrid craft book and anthology of the lyric essay, and I can’t recommend it enough.</p>\n<p><i>Crafting the Lyric Essay</i> offers a smart, simple way of thinking about the lyric essay: if you want to understand what a lyric essay is, look to the lyre. Or as Czerwiec, a poet by training, puts it herself, “the lyric essay depends on the lyre, on lyric mode — a focus on patterning, and on resonances of sound and silence and image on the level of the language.” In other words, we can look to poetry and poetics to help us talk about lyric essays. Czerwiec’s book, itself born of conversations, is itself a kind of conversation, with dialogue built into the structure of it. Chapters move back and forth between more traditional craft essays about some topic and hybrid essays showing those craft topics at work.</p>\n<p>So, for example, the lyric craft essay “Mind the Gap: Writing Around Absence” invites us to think about and experience gaps in time and memories, and the traditional craft essay “Negative Capability” (part of which originally appeared in <i>Hippocampus</i> as “<a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2022/04/craft-of-fragments-and-segments-by-heidi-czerwiec/\">Of Fragments and Segments</a>”) talks more directly about white space. In this way, Czerwiec builds these dialogues between craft and practice, her book moving through discussions of time, space, punctuation, imagery, form, and so on. There’s also an epilogue with suggestions on actually performing your work, which typically doesn’t get anywhere near enough attention.</p>\n<p><i>Crafting the Lyric Essay</i> isn’t dogmatic about genre boundaries, though. Czerwiec writes, “I’ve tried to amass in this book the discussions taking place, creative nonfiction is still fairly theory-less, still in its early stages.” <i>Crafting the Lyric Essay, </i>then, is intended to open the conversation, to urge it beyond the <i>The Next American Essay</i> series and towards “having a shared language to discuss these distinctions.” It’s very successful at this, as in the process of reading we experience two aspects of the craft, and two ways of understanding it: one more theoretical and one more experiential.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/review-crafting-the-lyric-essay-strike-a-chord-by-heidi-czerwiec/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Also included are excerpts of the many journals she kept as a child. Each chapter is structured similarly: Tarpley details her anecdotal experiences of living with and recovering from anorexia, and then after a break she weaves in the relevant research with each stage of her journey.</p>\n    <p>While it sounds it would be jarring to read, it’s not, and Tarpley seamlessly connects her lived experience to past and present scientific research. Her extensive journals allow her to compare her treatment with current standards, and, more importantly, what has and has not changed. She acknowledges in the book’s introduction that some of the entries she references can be triggering. If you are actively suffering from an eating disorder, I would skip this one.</p>\n    <p>After her successful recovery at age 16, Tarpley continues to detail the various ‘relapses’ throughout her adult life, including how anorexia has influenced sex, romantic relationships, and motherhood for her. As she notes in the text, we often have a limited and binary view of sickness narratives: we are sick, then we are well. There is no intermediary stage, and narratives that do include it often gloss over it for a tidy resolution. This all or nothing reasoning oversimplifies the true nature of eating disorders. Many of the subjects interviewed for this book do not consider themselves in full recovery from an eating disorder; just as many do.</p>\n    <p><i>Slip’s </i>most important contribution is putting a name to a phenomenon that many sufferers of chronic illness will know intimately: the middle place. Tarpley argues for a more nuanced understanding of what recovery looks like, especially as recovery from an eating disorder looks markedly different than recovery from drug or alcohol abuse. Someone with an eating disorder will ultimately need to eat again; meaning the possibility for disordered behaviors always lurks. “I’m further along than I ever thought I would be,” she writes in the introduction. “But my disorder isn’t gone.” The middle place is neither active addiction or disorder, nor is it full recovery. It is not perfectionism but acceptance, and for a disorder that relies so heavily on the idea of perfection, this mental shift is critical to ongoing maintenance.</p>\n    <p>Ultimately, the ‘middle place’ that Tarpley describes can be applied to any illness or addiction. I have an anxiety disorder and Ehler-Danlos Syndrome, neither of which will ever be cured. Like many of the interview subjects in <i>Slip</i>, I cannot put my life on hold to wait until they resolve themselves. They won’t. The only way forward is to make peace with their existence and create a life that’s both livable and enjoyable, despite the illnesses in its midst. That’s ultimately the greatest lesson from <i>Slip: </i>that the middle place is attainable, and preferable, to active illness, and that there’s no shame in living there.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image2-2.jpg\" alt=\"Marissa Gallerani \"/>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/review-slip-life-in-the-middle-of-eating-disorder-recovery-by-mallary-tenore-tarpley/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Johnson by Tourmaline; marsha surrounded by flowers\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>Well, this is the biography of Marsha P. Johnson; the P stands for “Pay It No Mind,” one of Marsha’s favorite maxims. That’s exactly what I did with my rule, turning first thing to the photos in Tourmaline’s <i> Marsha: The Joy and Defiance of Marsha P. Johnson </i>(Tiny Reparations Books, 2025).</p>\n<p>Like this biography, the photos arranged in rough chronological order—except, like the story, when they aren’t. Tourmaline gives us a Marsha without limits, a Marsha who gets to be the multitudes that she contains in whatever sequence makes sense. Chaotic? Sometimes. Compassionate, exuberant, and inspiring? Always.</p>\n<p>Tourmaline foregrounds Marsha’s story with her own in her introduction. Drawn to the heart of the West Village after college in the early 2000s, Tourmaline found Christopher Street to be a “sanctuary for young queer and trans people of color like myself, buzzing with an electrifying joy.” The more she spent time in the neighborhood as an activist and artist, the more she began to hear about Marsha.</p>\n<p>What results is as perfect a union of biographer and subject as I’ve read. Tourmaline assembles facts as if they were small tiles that create a glorious mosaic of Marsha. Beginning in Elizabeth, New Jersey in 1945, we follow young Marsha to Sunday school—throughout her life, she professed a deep love of Jesus. She’s in her element in full drum major regalia leading parades at her high school.</p>\n<p>But she’s not accepted, at least not early on, by her mother, who beat and stripped Marsha of her female clothing. New York C/ity was just a bus ride away, Marsha began sneaking there while still in high school.</p>\n<p>Decades before Disney coopted it, the area around the Port Authority and Times Square was a dangerous place. Sex workers, which Marsha would eventually become, were preyed upon not just by johns but by corrupt and brutal cops. New York’s bizarre “three items” law—you could be arrested for not wearing three items of clothing associated with the gender assigned you at birth—provided justification for abusing the trans community.</p>\n<p>Yet Tourmaline credits Marsha’s often harrowing experiences in the city as an essential part in her evolution, the place where she began to create what would become a huge found family. “So much of the intention behind what came later in Marsha’s and other girlies’ lives—the bright international stage, the social movement work, the freedom to move around without being harassed—was dreamt up on Forty-Second Street.”</p>\n<p>Music and dance lured Marsha down to the West Village and the Stonewall Inn, a gritty Mafia-owned bar that was one of the few places where trans people could get a drink and not be harassed; even in the gay community, transphobia was common. It’s in “The Stonewall Rioter” chapter that Tourmaline the reporter hits breathtaking stride. Her blow by blow of the actual Stonewall Riot, from the first shot glasses thrown—one of which almost certainly came from Marsh’s hand—to the liberation that followed is riveting reading, the excitement, danger, and joy of the moment pulsing off the page.</p>\n<p>Tourmaline clarifies Marsha’s Stonewall pivotal role in the historic uprising, one downplayed throughout her lifetime and after it, partly because in Marsha’s own telling she muddled the dates. Rather than turn Marsha’s words against her, Tourmaline addresses the slippery aspect of memory, as well as the roles that Marsha’s own trauma and mental health issues played in her inability to remember things precisely. “Marsha’s account, with all its fire and chaos, was like a fever dream of the raid and the riots. Let Stonewall be both firmly in the early morning hours of June 28 and on her August birthday. Let her be there, throwing the shot glass heard ‘round the world, and uptown at a party, celebrating life.”</p>\n<p>Stonewall lit activist fire in Marsha. When one of the biggest advocacy groups to form in Stonewall’s wake, the Gay Activists Alliance, spurned trans people, STAR— Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries, “transvestite” being the term by which Marsha referred to herself—was born. The Black Panthers’ dedication to community and freedom from poverty inspired her to write the STAR manifesto, a concise statement of rights that remains tremendously relevant.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/review-marsha-the-joy-and-defiance-of-marsha-p-johnson-by-tourmaline/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, this time was different when she realized he’d slept in the guest room…for the very first time: <i>“</i>No matter how badly we’d argued before or how many times I’d gone to bed drunk, he was always by my side the next morning.” Images of him leaving her and custody battles flashed through her mind, punctuating the seriousness of her intoxication.</p>\n<p>Her child at risk of drowning and her marriage at risk for ending, Stephens faced the fact that she had to make a drastic change: “I couldn’t believe what I was considering: I was going to have to quit drinking…forever.”</p>\n<p>In her debut memoir,<a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/4094/9798897409990\">  Uncorked: A Memoir of Letting Go and Starting Over</a> (Sibylline Press; Aug 2025), Stephens, a television writer-producer and MFA in creative writing recipient, shares her deeply personal story of embarking on the path to sobriety, transitioning from Fun Mary to Sober Mary.</p>\n<p>The narrative begins with a prologue taking readers to a hospital in Dublin, Ireland in 1988, when Stephens is 23 years old. She is studying abroad, and one night she endures a frightening and debilitating accident landing her in the ER for months. This scene is significant, because it permanently alters the course — and quality — of her life, and possibly becomes the catalyst to her decades-long alcoholism.</p>\n<p>Following the prologue, the book is organized chronologically with chapters aptly titled by the content, and ending with the epilogue, which is “present-day” in 2022. In the first chapter, “My Last Drink(s),” we are propelled to that day in 2011 (when Stephens is 45 years old) when she consumes her last alcoholic beverages (mentioned in the opening scene above). This is where we first encounter Fun Mary, the life of the party, free of inhibitions and responsibility, and in subsequent chapters we eventually meet Sober Mary, the self-respecting and sensible wife and mother. The two often collide, as Stephens writes, “Sober Mary sat like an angel on one shoulder, while Fun Mary perched like the devil on the other.”</p>\n<p>Stephens’ memoir discloses her experiences in Alcoholics Anonymous and her encounters with numerous, perpetual triggers challenging her goal of sobriety. In a world that reveres alcohol, the temptations were <i>everywhere</i>. She writes, “How was Sober Mary supposed to forget about booze when it was literally in my face all the time?” She likens the exposure to an ex. “Like after a breakup, I saw my ex everywhere. At the entrance to the grocery store, there were floor-to-ceiling shelves of wine, Gloria Ferrer’s Champagne billboard sparkled enticingly, and the restaurant wine menus were so extensive that they needed binding, yet not a single non-alcoholic drink was listed.”</p>\n<p>Her voice shines in her cleverly crafted sentences interspersed throughout, such as describing a cherished moment with close friends, “The last time we saw them, we spent a liquid afternoon in our hot tub, drinking Champagne and laughing over parenting stories. By the time we got out, I was pickled (in more ways than one).” Her use of imagery and description is vivid, and it’s easy to imagine pictures in our minds. Of her mother, she writes, “She stood only five feet tall; I bent slightly to kiss her downy cheek. Everything physical about her was soft—her sweater, her posture, her gaze—but inside, she was tough Iowa farm stock.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/review-uncorked-a-memoir-of-letting-go-and-starting-over-by-mary-alice-stephens/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But that’s the tip of the proverbial iceberg. This non-genre-specific, just under 500-page tome covers all phases and aspects of the writing journey, including helpful responses to most of the questions new writers and writers new to a community tend to ask (like, how do I find a writing partner or critique group, where are the literary events, the classes and workshops, and, how do submissions work?) There’s also an index for searching specific terms, names and concepts.</p>\n<p>Throughout, the author’s observations and advice are supplemented with references and quotes from the many interviews she conducted with authors and subject matter experts while conceiving <i>Imagine a Door</i> – such as literary agent Daniel Lazar, publishing industry expert Jane Friedman, authors Lidia Yuknavitch, Rosanne Parry and Beth Kephart (who provides the book’s Foreword), among many others.</p>\n<p>Like many writers, I have amassed a bookshelf of craft books, some well-thumbed, some less so. That said, I can’t think of another writing resource that covers so much terrain and from such a variety of perspectives. It isn’t only the breadth of topics —from initial concept, drafting and revising, to querying, publication paths and more — that makes <i>Imagine a Door</i> such a rich resource. Apart from the information, tips and lessons learned, Stanfill’s refreshing philosophy, her belief in the importance of community, generosity, gratitude and accessibility for all writers, published and not, mainstream and otherwise —provide an open invitation.</p>\n<p>Stanfill writes, she’s “been there, done that, and here’s what I want to share with you.” She brings the accumulated knowledge acquired during her own writing and publishing journey: from journalist to struggling to be published in literary journals and find community, coping with rejection and imposter syndrome, to book author in search of a press, then published author finding the right way for her, as a neurodivergent author, to show up in the world while protecting her physical and mental health. Add to <i>that </i>journey, Stanfill’s experience in publishing, as editor and founder (in 2012) of a small press (Forest Avenue Press).</p>\n<p>“From this place, in the middle of my publishing journey,” she writes, “I hold out these pages to you. I hope they recalibrate your sense of success and help you feel less lonely.” With passages like the following, she does just that:</p>\n<p>\n      <i>“I’ve seen author defined as someone who has a signed book contract, someone who makes money from writing, and/or someone who has been published. Writers, these guides suggest, are the rest of us. Depending on the person trying to establish the hierarchy, how published you are might matter too. Like, a full-length book would count: congrats, you’re an author! But an essay in a small-circulation journal might not. But I say all of it counts. If you’re writing, that’s as legitimate a practice as anyone else’s. Hierarchical definitions pit us against each other. They make some of us doing the work of writing feel smaller or lesser. They also are intended to shore up outdated societal structures—ones that have historically promoted racist and ableist thinking.”</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/review-imagine-a-door-by-laura-stanfill/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The twittering of birds in the treetops pauses as one voice, as if the forest is holding its breath.</p>\n<p>A lone eagle wheels silently overhead. Then the sun pierces the clouds, scattering drops of gold across the misty valley, and with a lusty yawp from the eagle, the forest begins its song anew.</p>\n<p>I suck in a breath of the bright, sunny air. Dinosauric ferns waft their brown-speckled leaves in the gentle breeze. The rocks and tree trunks are covered with blankets of emerald lichens. The sound of rushing water fills my ears.</p>\n<p>“What do you say, Mac? I told you it wasn’t so bad out here.”</p>\n<p/><p>The radiance of Selene’s milk-white complexion and her perfectly messy black hair is mirrored by the glory that surrounds us.</p>\n<p>“I say I’m an idiot for doubting you,” I answer as I take her hand, her close-trimmed nails kicking up sparks as they brush against my painted ones.</p>\n<p>Something about my hands is different. They’re smaller than I remember. Or thinner?</p>\n<p>Selene squeezes my fingers and I’m yanked back into the moment. I can feel the goofy smile on my lips.</p>\n<p>We amble up the long, grassy incline, watching the mountains rise in the distance. I follow Selene’s outstretched finger to the family of deer crossing the river that cuts across the valley.</p>\n<p>“God, I haven’t been anywhere like this since I was a kid,” I breathe. “I can’t even remember how long it’s been since I’ve seen a real tree. Why did you wait so long to bring me here?”</p>\n<p>The words spill out of me, but the last question sticks in my throat. I have plenty of memories of our relationship—of bumping into her at a dive bar and spilling both our drinks, of spending the next forty-eight hours with her in a beautiful adrenaline haze, of late-night confessions and forgotten meals and delirious PDA on empty commuter maglevs. But when I focus on the specific days and dates, I realize the larger passage of time has slipped my grasp completely. What month is it? How long has it even been since Selene came into my life?</p>\n<p>Then Selene gives me that delinquent’s smile and my cares vanish. “You know me, babe. I like to make you wait for the really good stuff.”</p>\n<p>I close my eyes and breathe in the forest air, pushing away any lingering thoughts about what came before. “Yeah. Guess I’ve just been stuck in the city for too long.”</p>\n<p>I open my eyes to gaze into Selene’s, but I see her looking at something behind us with an expression of concern I’d never seen before. A lone figure wearing dark clothes, maybe as far off as a mile but heading in our direction. There’s a flash of sickly artificial green, something that itches, a memory from the Bad Times that I try to rebury.</p>\n<p>“Ugh. Come on, babe. Let’s go somewhere more private,” Selene grumbles, her arm snaking through mine and pulling me up the path. I don’t argue.</p>\n<p>It’s a long uphill walk, and by the time we stop our bodies are slick with sweat under our jackets. I roll out the blanket on a bed of soft brown pine needles, and we sit to take a rest and appreciate the view. Down the sharp incline, a waterfall slashes through the air, its white spray painted with rainbows as it catches the sunlight for its shining moment of pure freedom.</p>\n<p>Selene says my name, and we recline against the fabric as one body.</p>\n<p>Our fingers roam across one another’s skin, lazy, lackadaisical. I feel my own motions mirrored in her, feel her pull back even as her small muscles tense with the drive to push forward, to grab hold fiercely before this good thing is taken away.</p>\n<p>But that instinct is no longer needed, I remember—not here, not anymore. There’s no need to rush. We have all the time in the world, Selene keeps telling me, and I vow I’m going to start believing that even if it takes me a few thousand years.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/08/22/escape-pod-955-endymion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But Papa Joe was a romantic.</p>\n<p>Chandra’s Game roots in the side of a barren asteroid moon like a tick. Over the years we’ve burrowed deeper into rock and ice until poor Chandra is mostly Game. We loop the twin wormholes, Gehenna and Tartarus, roundabout in a figure eight, ready to catch the freighters as they escape from hell’s dark maw. We strip them of goods and drink their heat, load them up and send them into another hell. It’s a profitable game, Chandra’s.</p>\n<p>My mother smuggled me into Chandra’s Game without patronage and compounded her error by dying without permission; I was Terra-born unless she was lying, which was likely enough. I joined the other unregistereds down in the Warrens: ferals that lived off the Mayor’s Dole and by odd-jobs when that wasn’t enough. Papa Joe fed us, and sometimes the tunnels were glorious with the smell of meat, and if you were smart or hungry enough you didn’t ask from what. Where there’s humanity there are rats, and Joey wasn’t a rich man, not then. But food is food, and he’d bunk you if he could, and if all he asked in return for the latest Warren scuttlebutt or a few sticks of ephedrine off a freighter’s load, what of it? Saints are few and far between in Chandra’s Game.</p>\n<p/><p>Papa Joe always liked me: I stayed a bit feral, tomboy—nothing like his daughters. He had them late in life, when he got rich, and they were elegant, lux level creatures. Not like Joey, not like Mrs. Joe. She was quiet and kind, and if she knew a nano of Joey’s business she never let on. When Gregor Straphos died I died a little. But Mrs. Joe died all the way.</p>\n<p>I’d been legit for years. I still snooped, but in an upright way. Helped the Company Men find bits of their loads that went astray between Gehenna and Tartarus, passed on Warren talk to the prefects when some smart kid got out of hand, pointed the way to speedwell labs that weren’t circumspect about what went into their product. Nothing that would disturb the delicate balance between the business of the Family, the Companies and the Mayor.</p>\n<p>Joey had his own snoops, payroll loyal. So when a grubby-faced feral knocked up my crib, saying Joey wanted a word, I had to wonder why. I hadn’t seen him in years. Not since Gregor was cremated.</p>\n<p>Papa Joe never lived on the lux levels: too far away from his daily business. His crib was in that middle span twixt Warren and lux, where the heavy, humid smell of humans going about their dailies pervaded. Inset into the dull rough rock of Chandra’s tunnels, his entry was like mine but for the over-muscled toughs that bracketed it, giving me a once-over glare but no guff. Past his door it was different.</p>\n<p>Good living thickened him. He gripped me by the shoulders, hard, and shook me, his heavy gold rings bruising my shoulders.</p>\n<p>“It’s been a long time, Sarabet,” he rumbled. “Too long.”</p>\n<p>He pushed me into an overstuffed sofa, and I looked at the crib with a professional eye. The room was luxurious, almost frivolous. The walls had been polished smooth, and intricate patterns were visible in the surface that looked so dull in the tunnels. The furniture, Terran-antique, could’ve kept me living high for years. A thick Thantopian carpet covered the floor, cut from the surface of a place Joey and me would never see—it was the probably the most precious thing in the place, beautifully marbled in blue and green. The warmth of it struck up through my thin corridor slippers.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/08/15/escape-pod-954-chandras-game-flashback-friday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She tried to make the octopus or squid feel as comfortable as possible, so that its behavior in response to stimuli might approximate what it would do in the wild. It wasn’t what she had expected when she trained as a marine biologist, but frankly she preferred it to dissection, experimentation by electric shock, or even anything that required interacting with animals captive in tiny tanks.</p>\n<p>This particular job started out only slightly unusual. For most jobs she was given a specific research interest. Sometimes they told her exactly what to do to elicit the behaviors they wanted to study, and sometimes they let her design the approach, but either way it meant some narrow focus for her attention. Natalia always tried to give the cephalopod some play time around their interactions – if challenged on this, she told her employers that it led to more natural responses than repeating the same cues over and over again – but their time was very much directed by research.</p>\n<p>On this job, they told her just to play with the octopus.</p>\n<p>“Get comfortable with each other,” said the guy who hired her. “Make friends.”</p>\n<p>Natalia had nodded and deliberately not asked any more. She tried to ignore her suspicions about why they were being so nice to this octopus. Maybe the company had a policy about giving all captive research subjects a certain amount of leisure time. (<i>Maybe they were doing something extra terrible.) </i>She had done too many of these jobs to believe that the research lab cared very much about the comfort of an individual octopus in the face of SCIENCE, but she tried to convince herself that her role helped the animal more than hurting it. (<i>Maybe the experiments required the octopus to be relaxed, and Natalia was complicit.</i>)</p>\n<p>Her employers were probably going after those specific research interests when Natalia wasn’t there. The octopus she thought of as Vainilla was shut into a (decent-sized, but still) tank before and after her sessions. One day Natalia got to the center early and saw them peeling electrodes off of Vainilla’s flesh.</p>\n<p>That day she was as gentle as she knew how to be, careful not to initiate any contact as she and Vainilla twisted in distant tandem through the water of the shallow, netted bay.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t unexpected, or even necessarily sinister. Electrodes <i>could</i> be used for very non-invasive types of research. And in any case Natalia had long been used to the precarious or tormented lives of animal research subjects. She resisted any suggestion that she, for example, <i>stop naming </i>them, although since that seemed to particularly incense some people she mostly stopped telling her employers about it. She told herself that to do her job right she needed to face the current state of animal research. Sometimes it did not work out well for everyone.</p>\n<p>After the electrode day the tone of that daily hour changed. There was still pleasure in their interactions, but it was definitely in a minor key. Natalia had slipped into thinking of her role as akin to that of a hospice caregiver: bringing Vainilla some marginal comfort in the interstices of a catastrophe beyond the cephalopod’s control.</p>\n<p>So Natalia was surprised when David Gilcrest, one of the honchos at the center, , sought her out after her post-swim shower one day and asked if she had availability to expand her commitment with them.</p>\n<p>“You want me to add more swim time?” Natalia said, squinting up at him as she toweled her hair.</p>\n<p>“Not exactly. Well, yes, more swim time, but we were wondering if you’d be willing to participate more directly in our experiment.”</p>\n<p>“What experiment?” Natalia asked reluctantly, not really wanting to know what horrors were being inflicted on Vainilla.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/08/08/escape-pod-953-sturdy-ladders-and-lanterns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Her daughter went cross-eyed trying to look at it and started chewing on the corner of her thumb, smiling at the game.</p>\n<p>“Okay.” Shaundra placed her hands on her knees and leaned forward to look her daughter in the face. “What’s supposed to be in the box?”</p>\n<p>Dineisha tried a little longer to look at the top of her own head, giggled, and took the box down to read the label. “Thirty-four, no, three-quarter something nuts.”</p>\n<p>“That’s right.” Dineisha replaced the box on her head. “But the box is empty. Do we know why the box is empty?”</p>\n<p>Dineisha shrugged and gnawed at her thumb.</p>\n<p>“I want to make sure that we know that just because we don’t say something with our words doesn’t mean we aren’t lying. Momma asked you where the three-quarter something nuts were. So if you know, you need to tell me.”</p>\n<p>“I <i>planted</i> them,” Dineisha said around her thumb.</p>\n<p/><p>“You buried them? Why? I needed those to finish this engine!”</p>\n<p>“I didn’t bury them. I <i>planted</i> them. I wanted to grow you a whole tree.”</p>\n<p>Shaundra pulled the thumb from her daughter’s mouth. “It’s a different kind of nut, sweetie. Now I need to buy some new ones. Are you going to pay for them?”</p>\n<p>“They started growing.”</p>\n<p>“I’m sure they did,” Shaundra replied, beginning to turn back around to her worktable.</p>\n<p>“You shouldn’t tell people they’re liars,” Dineisha admonished. She knew better than to raise her voice to her mother, so she had quickly acquired the skill of giving her softly spoken words a ringing tone of disapproval.</p>\n<p>“All right. Show me.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t step on the grass,” Dineisha said solemnly. “It’s very sharp.”</p>\n<p>“Alright, you show me where to step.”</p>\n<p>They left the garage hand-in-hand and went around the house to the backyard, which had not seen a lawn mower in a month. It was high, green, and studded with weeds, yellow blossoms and white puffs waving gently in the breeze. They looked so soft. Shaundra reached down to pluck one, for her daughter to blow a wish on, so they could wish for more “three-quarter-something nuts.” She saw her blood pulse bright onto the blossoms, felt the blades deep in her hand, long before she felt the pain.</p>\n<p>Three minutes later, they were inside the house, doors locked, windows drawn, and Shaundra had a bandage on her cleanly sliced palm. Dineisha was hiding in her room; she had taken her mother’s yelp and cursing personally and clearly was attempting to lessen her expected punishment by punishing herself first.</p>\n<p>Shaundra sat in the dark, thinking about the glint in the weeds in the noonday sun. The tiny spikes, twisting up, new shoots, pure silver. In a crystallized moment of horror, she thought she had seen them breathe.</p>\n<p>Shaundra typed “plant metal” into her computer, and the search turned up a ton of metalwork artisan sites selling welded metal roses and gates and painted trellises. What could she search that would make sense? She stood up carefully and slipped over to the window, to look at the grass again. It glinted.</p>\n<p>“Deedee, come here. Quickly.”</p>\n<p>Shaundra carried her daughter to the garage; despite the walkway being paved, she wondered if she’d ever let her precious baby’s feet touch the ground again. Her mind remembered the spikes slicing into her hand as warm. It had to be the sun. Anything else it could possibly be made her stomach turn. Setting Dineisha down on the work stool, Shaundra looked all over the empty little cardboard box, and then carried it and her daughter back into the house.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/08/01/escape-pod-952-skyscrapers-that-twist-to-the-sun/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Audio notebook for new project: revival of a clinically dead patient, 36 year old male, died of hypothermia and shock.</p>\n<p>The technician at the morgue hesitated when releasing him to me. I’m not surprised, with the tone that took hold of my voice as I corrected her <i>Mr.</i> to <i>Dr.</i> as she took down my details. When I gave her my name, her pen stalled over the paper—a giveaway that his parents had called before I arrived. I should be grateful that she released him to me anyway, honoring my legal right to the body. I should be grateful for so much, I suppose, even if it doesn’t feel like it, to have this opportunity to—to not let his story end in tragedy.</p>\n<p>Nobody blinked an eye as I wheeled his gurney, covered in a sheet, towards my lab. The advantages of working in a medical school.</p>\n<p>1:03 PM.</p>\n<p>The physical damage to his body is minimal. From what the police told me, his bicycle hit a patch of black ice on the bridge by his office on his way home, and though the winter has been long and cold the river wasn’t frozen over. The shock of the cold water stopped his heart.</p>\n<p>And the cold, hopefully, preserved him enough to get him here. His brain and body are still intact. With my colleagues’ preservation techniques, sufficiently low humidity, and proper refrigeration, our research group has successfully held organ donations from skin grafts to spleens for two months without impacting viability. Well—fifty-seven days, if I recall the paper, and there was resulting neuropathy, but fifty-seven days is surely better than nothing. With the body preserved, restarting a heart is a trivial problem, but the brain… the brain has always been the problem with reviving the—those who…</p>\n<p>The medically dead.</p>\n<p><i>[A shuddering breath, then a cleared throat.]</i></p>\n<p>Reintroducing oxygen into the brain cells that were damaged during clinical death will be the difficulty; it’s that oxygen, ironically, that causes the bulk of the revived brain’s injuries. My previous research on this front has been promising, but preliminary, and only with models of patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia. I haven’t even begun testing on animal models, let alone human trials, and he was in the morgue for nearly six hours before I was able to get him.</p>\n<p>That beautiful, intricate tangle of neurons and electrical impulses—I can’t risk damaging that.</p>\n<p>I can’t risk damaging <i>him</i>.</p>\n<p>Feb. 18, 3:26 PM.</p>\n<p>Vihaan came by briefly and saw the equipment I’ve borrowed. I told him I’m becoming CPR- and defibrillator-certified, that it would make me more competitive for grants in emergency medicine, and his eyes lit up at the prospect of more funding. No doubt he’ll circulate the story to the other graduate students who will hopefully leave me alone.</p>\n<p>I’ve also claimed the small examination room off the main lab that my students have previously used to practice preservation techniques. It has more privacy. I only rarely require full cadavers in my work, and—</p>\n<p><i>[Knocking.]</i></p>\n<p>Uh—yes?</p>\n<p><i>[Distant.] “Victor, is that you? Are you filling in for the neuroanatomy dissection lab again? The brain bank said you took six specimens.”</i></p>\n<p>Oh—not exactly a lab but more for some practice demonstrations. I, uh, received a request from one of my students who’s struggling with that class and I—hang on, my recorder’s still going. Let me just—</p>\n<p><i>[Muffled movement of the recorder.]</i></p>\n<p>3:31 PM.</p>\n<p>Well, that’s Elise dealt with. The certification line worked on her, too. Hopefully it will buy me a little peace and quiet and discretion when it comes to my borrowed equipment. I’ve also taken what will be necessary to resuscitate him, even if I don’t dare use it until I know I can avoid brain damage. I took five doses of epinephrine, a portable ECG monitor, and an automatic defibrillator in case the CPR causes arrhythmia. I’ll use it if I have to.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/07/25/escape-pod-951-the-scientist-does-not-look-back/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I resorted to the old “Go to your room,” which didn’t work, either. She continued to remain defiant and disobey me until I checked out of the situation and ignored her.</p>\n<p>Still, I wondered what the “right” way to handle her behavior actually was. Estes struggles with the same question and has even tried giving her son choices, such as saying that either they leave the playground or he is “choosing” not to have any screen time at home.</p>\n<p>“I sort of end up running out of things to take away, and then I get frustrated and angry, and I don’t know what to do when I’ve run out of things and he still doesn’t want to do it,” she said.</p>\n<p>\n            In the eighth installment of our CNN Digital Video series<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/health/2016/08/09/parent-acts-teaching-kids-to-say-sorry-wallace-orig.cnn.html\"> “Parent Acts,” </a>we asked parents to act out the defiance they experience in their children.

That’s when my girls, as toddlers, would arch their backs, screaming uncontrollably, usually in a public place (of course!) and there was nothing my husband or I could do to satisfy them.</p>\n<p>If you have kids and you’ve experienced one of their meltdowns, you no doubt know what I mean and what it feels like at that moment, when you are a mixture of emotions – embarrassed, frustrated, angry and completely at a loss for how to resolve the problem. Even bribery, which we know is never the way to go, doesn’t seem to work when your child is at wit’s end and unable to calm down.</p>\n<p>\n            We recently asked some parents to act out what their children do and say when they melt down as part of a new CNN Digital video series called <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/health/2016/05/11/parent-acts-meltdown-kelly-wallace-orig.cnn\">“Parent Acts.”</a> Since we know parents tend to get the best advice and support from other parents, we thought it would be fun and helpful for parents to act out what their kids are doing when there is a problem, and then have a parenting expert listen to their role play and weigh in with advice.\n    </p>\n<p>Pauline Hilborn, a mom of two in New York City, describes herself as an expert on meltdowns based on the experiences of her daughter, who she says is “7-years-old but sounds more like 13.”</p>\n<p>Case in point: Hilborn’s daughter wanted a ponytail like the pop singer Ariana Grande, but felt like her mom didn’t do the ponytail properly and put it in the wrong place.</p>\n<p>“She came out crying and said, ‘Ariana Grande’s ponytail is here not here,’” said Hilborn, pointing to the place on her head where her daughter preferred the ponytail to go, not where it ended up.</p>\n<p>“I was at a loss for words,” she said. “I had no idea what to say but my husband said, ‘Well, she’s right you know,’ which didn’t help the situation.”</p>\n<p>Debi, another mother of two in Manhattan, says her 7-year-old has definitely had some tantrums.

Still, my children have so much more than I ever had when I was their age, and I admit I sometimes break down when they want something and plead over and over again, “Please, please, can I have this?”</p>\n<p>I know I’m not alone.</p>\n<p>\n            In the third installment of our new CNN Digital Video series <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/health/2016/06/06/parent-acts-tweens-deodorant-kelly-wallace-nccorig.cnn\">“Parent Acts,”</a> we asked parents to act out why it’s so hard to say no to our kids when they want something, and then we had a parenting expert listen to their role play to weigh in with advice.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            “I feel like my children are never satisfied and happy with what they have, so that’s really, I think, that’s my issue,” said Laura Simms, a mom of three in Atlanta and <a href=\"http://www.thekeygrp.com/\">owner of a public relations firm.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n            <a href=\"http://triciaferrara.com/\">Tricia Ferrara</a> is a licensed family therapist and parenting strategist who has been in private practice in the Philadelphia area for more than a decade. \n    </p>\n<p>\n            “In a changing world, raising your child to think they must be statically happy is not helpful,” said Ferrara, author of <a href=\"http://triciaferrara.com/parenting-2-0-tricia-ferrara-the-book/\">“Parenting 2.0: Think in the Future, Act in the Now,”</a> a guidebook for parents with step-by-step advice on how to strengthen their relationships with their children. “Children need a process for coping with and adapting to a changing environment. It’s up to us, as parents, to give them that process.”\n    </p>\n<p>As parents, Ferrara says, we want our kids to look at the world and think, “I want more,” but we want them to be able to do that in such a way that they realize that getting what they want is a result of their efforts and not from “poking at somebody else.”</p>\n<p>“Just folding and giving your children just what they want is not helpful for them over the long run,” Ferrara said. “I know for parents, sometimes it’s easier for them … but easy for you is not healthy for them. So teaching them or compelling them how to organize their energy toward a goal is critical. It’s a critical skill for now, but it’s a very critical skill for the future.”</p>\n<p>When your child sees the ice cream truck and screams, “Please, Mommy, you never let me get Mister Softee,” instead of breaking down and getting your child that ice cream, you could proactively offer your child ice cream – but only after they show “big-kid behavior.”</p>\n<p>For many little kids, the No. 1 thing they want is to feel like they’re growing up, said Ferrara, a mom of two teenagers. “So incentivizing them to do behaviors that show they’re a big kid will get them the big-kid goodies.”</p>\n<h2>\n        Why ‘spoiled’ is a sensitive word for parents<strong> </strong>\n</h2>\n<p>\n            Most parents will admit that the single worst word that someone could use to describe their children – the word that would feel like the biggest indictment of their parenting – would be to call them “spoiled,” said Ron Lieber, author of <a href=\"http://ronlieber.com/books/the-opposite-of-spoiled/\">“The Opposite of Spoiled: Raising Kids Who are Grounded, Generous and Smart About Money.”</a>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/06/21/health/parent-acts-spoiled-children-how-to-say-no/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

They looked for the presence of potentially toxic chemicals and divided them into five classes of chemicals, two of which were found to be more common than the rest: phthalates and flame retardants.</p>\n<p>“Many of the top 10 fall into these two categories,” Zota said.</p>\n<p>But when factoring in the wide range of chemicals we’re exposed to, small amounts can add up, she stressed.</p>\n<h2>Lurking in the dust</h2>\n<p>The chemicals found in dust samples came from a range of things typically found inside your home, including vinyl products – such as flooring – cosmetics, baby products, furniture and nail polish.</p>\n<p>To understand how these chemicals are entering your home, it helps to understand where they are used. Phthalates make plastic softer and more flexible, so they tend to be found in vinyl (PVC) materials such as flooring, blinds and food packaging. Flame retardants help products meet flammability standards that are built into building codes, insurance requirements and fire regulations.</p>\n<p>The other three classes of chemicals found in dust samples included environmental phenols, usually used as preservatives in personal care products like shampoo; fluorinated chemicals, used as stain- and water-repellent treatments for upholstery, carpets and clothes and in nonstick pans; and fragrances.</p>\n<p>Only one chemical used in fragrances had been the topic of a study, meaning many more chemicals are likely to be present in dust with little insight into them, according to the researchers. “We know very little about the health hazard of these fragrances,” said Zota.</p>\n<p>But the researchers note that it is about more than exposure. For example, phthalates were detected in the highest concentrations in the study, but the chemicals found in flame retardants had the “highest estimated intake,” meaning they are more likely to enter the body.</p>\n<p>“You can breathe it in and can absorb into your skin,” Zota said. “These chemicals are not bound to the products, so they can migrate out.”</p>\n<h2>A risk to child development</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest concerns underlying the presence of these chemicals hiding in house dust is the fact that children are most likely to inhale or ingest them as they crawl around, touching things and inevitably placing their hands in their mouths multiple times a day.</p>\n<p>“Environmental insults during early development can have long-lasting adverse health effects that persist across the lifespan,” Zota said. Phthalate exposure in children “can increase risk of respiratory, behavioral and neurodevelopmental problems.”</p>\n<p>Phthalates are also known to disrupt hormones inside the body, meaning they could cause reproductive problems.</p>\n<p>\n            “We know from lead that exposures are not acceptable,” said Dr. Asa Bradman, associate director for exposure assessment at the <a href=\"http://cerch.org/about/investigators-and-key-personnel/\">Center for Environmental Research and Child’s Health</a> at the University of California, Berkeley, who was not involved in the new study.\n    </p>\n<p>“There’s a strong argument to reduce exposure to children whose brains are changing and bodies are developing.”</p>\n<p>As for the study findings, Bradman noted that the reason phthalates were found to be most common in house dust was probably because most studies have been done on this class of chemicals.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/14/health/toxic-chemicals-house-dust/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Supposedly, a four-day work schedule allows workers extra time to pursue leisure activities and family togetherness. Spurred on by visions of spending more time at the beach, <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/27/pf/4-day-work-week/\">many people are now encouraging businesses</a> to adopt this kind of work plan.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            There are many <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/john-boitnott/should-we-all-be-on-the-4-day-workweek.html\">purported advantages</a>. Some authorities say that a <a href=\"http://www.medicaldaily.com/are-there-health-benefits-4-day-workweek-294640\">four-day work schedule facilitates</a> the ability to provide child care and assistance for the elderly.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Proponents of such “compressed” work schedules – those in which employees work longer hours for fewer days of the week — point to gains in productivity that result from <a href=\"http://www.cheatsheet.com/business/3-reasons-to-embrace-a-4-day-workweek.html/?a=viewall\">decreased overhead costs</a>, such as not having to keep the lights on when nobody is working. Additional cost savings can be obtained from reducing total <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/is-a-four-day-work-week-right-for-your-company/\">weekly commuting time</a>.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            A variety of business have tested the four-day concept,<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/08/26/amazon-is-piloting-teams-with-a-30-hour-work-week/\"> including Amazon, Google, Deloitte</a> and a host of smaller firms. Amazon announced in late August that it is experimenting with an even shorter workweek of 30 hours for select employees, who would earn 75 percent of their full-time salary, should they choose to opt in.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-on-call-and-irregular-scheduling-harm-the-american-workforce-46063\">How on-call and irregular scheduling harm the American workforce</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Many of the pilot programs have shown promising results. Statistics from the Society for Human Resource Management indicate that <a href=\"https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/four-day-workweek.aspx\">31 percent of employees</a> were in a compressed workweek schedule as of 2015. That’s the case, however, for only 5 percent of large companies.\n    </p>\n<p>This is an issue in which I have considerable experience. I have been studying the health effects of long working hours for nearly 30 years. All the studies point to the potential dangers that can occur as the result of the additional risks created when work demands exceed a particular threshold. Most of the studies I have performed suggest that the dangers are most pronounced when people regularly work more than 12 hours per day or 60 hours per week.</p>\n<h2>It sounded like a good idea</h2>\n<p>\n            The idea of <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/06/four-day-workweek/396530/\">a four-day workweek</a> is not new. Labor experts have been studying and advocating these approaches since the 1970s. For example, in 2008, researchers from <a href=\"https://news.byu.edu/news/byu-study-reveals-results-city%E2%80%99s-four-day-work-week\">Brigham Young University</a> conducted a series of surveys among employees and community members to assess their perspectives about a four-day workweek. The researchers found that about four-fifths of the employees reported a positive experience working that type of schedule.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Based on these positive results, Utah’s governor enacted a <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2011/09/04/utah-ends-4-day-workweek-experiment/\">mandatory four-day workweek</a> for all state employees. The state’s goal was to curb energy costs, improve air quality, ensure that needed services would still be available (for instance, garbage collection) and help to recruit and retain state employees. In 2011, however, Utah reversed course, saying that savings never materialized.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/could-flexible-working-hours-be-the-answer-to-the-sleep-loss-epidemic-38213\">Could flexible working hours be the answer to the sleep-loss epidemic?</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Other research has also supported the development and adoption of compressed work schedules. A 1989 study found that <a href=\"http://myweb.usf.edu/~jdorio/CONSEQUENCES%20OF%20ALTERNATIVE%20WORK%20SCHEDULES.pdf\">compressed schedules</a> (PDF) were related to high levels of job satisfaction and employees’ satisfaction with their work schedules; supervisors also reported they were pleased with the four-day workweek schedules.\n    </p>\n<h2>Are there hidden dangers?</h2>\n<p>Despite the widespread enthusiasm for a four-day week, I am not convinced that kind of schedule is beneficial for employees or for businesses. The primary problem with the idea is that whatever work needs to be done, needs to get done in the same amount of total time. Despite wishes to the contrary, there are still only 24 hours in a day.</p>\n<p>The math is simple: working five eight-hour shifts is equivalent to working four 10-hour shifts. That’s true. But the implications of these schedules are different. The danger is in disregarding the health effects that can occur as a result of fatigue and stress that accumulate over a longer-than-normal working day.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/15/health/four-day-workweek/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Last week’s change to the <a href=\"http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2016/2016-09-07/html/sor-dors239-eng.php\">Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</a> permits doctors to apply for permission under the federal Special Access Program to offer their addicted patients diacetylmorphine: pharmaceutical-grade heroin.\n    </p>\n    <p>The government referred to a “medical need for emergency access to diacetylmorphine” in the regulation.</p>\n    <p>“A number of countries have allowed doctors to use diacetylmorphine-assisted treatment to support the small percentage of patients with opioid dependence who have not responded to other treatment options,” the regulation states. “There is also a significant body of scientific evidence supporting its use.”</p>\n    <p>The new rule reinstates an old one, explained Eugenia Oviedo-Joekes, an associate professor in the School of Population and Public Health at the University of British Columbia.</p>\n    <p>In October 2013, then-Health Minister Rona Ambrose removed diacetylmorphine from the federal Special Access Program and so banned doctors’ access to prescription heroin. The new regulation clarifies that heroin can be prescribed to patients only under supervision in specialized circumstances, said Oviedo-Joekes: “They made it a bit more clear how this request should be handled.”</p>\n    <p>\n            Oviedo-Joekes led the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18758964\">North American Opiate Medication Initiative</a>, an experimental drug trial evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of heroin-assisted treatment in a Canadian context. The study, which is referred to in the new regulation, examined heroin as a treatment for severe addicts in British Columbia and found a higher percentage of female users and a significantly higher prevalence of crack use than in European settings. The authors noted that cocaine addiction jeopardizes the possible results in opioid addiction treatment.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            Of course, not all Canadians believe that treating addiction with heroin is a move in the right direction. Ambrose told <a href=\"http://globalnews.ca/news/855450/reality-check-is-health-canada-giving-addicts-free-heroin/\">GlobalNews.ca</a> in 2013 that giving addicts heroin is “not to treat an underlying medical condition, but simply to allow them to continue to have access to heroin for their addiction even though other safe treatments for heroin addiction, such as methadone, are available.”\n    </p>\n    <p>According to Oviedo-Joekes, “methadone doesn’t work all the time for everybody. Methadone works very well as a first-line treatment.” Addiction, “like any other illness,” may require second-line or even third-line treatments.</p>\n    <p>\n            Prescribing heroin to severe addicts who don’t respond to other treatments may not cure them of their habit, according to Oviedo-Joekes and her colleagues, but it can lessen their exposure to life-threatening health risks, such as drug overdoses, blood-borne viral infections and endocarditis, an inflammation of the chambers of the heart. Studies indicate that <a href=\"http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/191/1/55\">prescription heroin </a>reduces illicit drug use and so decreases <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2008.02185.x/abstract;jsessionid=B7F32CED406E3E928D76D990F357464F.f03t02\">criminal activity and health care costs</a>, so the greater societal toll is lessened.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            This fall, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government will sponsor a summit to address the issue of opioid addiction, Health Minister Jane Philpott told <a href=\"http://www.660news.com/2016/09/08/health-canada-approves-use-of-prescription-heroin/\">660 News</a>.  \n    </p>\n    <p>According to Oviedo-Joekes, opioid deaths in Canada are on the rise. Not all provinces keep count, she said, but the numbers in British Columbia are more than double last year’s figures.</p>\n    <p>“In British Columbia, the last [death] count was beyond 400 people, and it is estimated by the end of the year we will reach 800 deaths due to fentanyl,” Oviedo-Joekes said, citing a coroner’s statistics.</p>\n    <p>Fentanyl, a type of opioid, is most commonly prescribed to cancer patients for relief of pain. It is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine and 30 to 50 times more powerful than heroin.</p>\n    <p>The crux of the problem is that addicts don’t know they are buying fentanyl; they believe they are buying heroin or other opioids. Because fentanyl is so potent, it’s easier for drug dealers to make more money with it, so they cut heroin with it, Oviedo-Joekes explained.</p>\n    <h3>Join the conversation</h3>\n    <p/>\n    <p>“There are going to be other drugs beside fentanyl,” she said, noting that drug dealers will find a way to increase their profits: “They’ll always be a couple of steps ahead of us.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/14/health/prescription-heroin-canada/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>Story highlights</h3>\n<p>Grindr came under fire because of a user survey about an HIV filter</p>\n<p>Experts said a filter for HIV status would most likely do more harm than good</p>\n<p>After uploading those carefully selected profile photos and writing a well-crafted personal bio for a dating app, you’re now thinking, “What type of person am I actually looking for?”</p>\n<p>Dating apps and sites offer the option to filter matches by sex, ethnicity, height or religion – but they could be even more personal.</p>\n<p>This summer, the gay social networking app Grindr caught some criticism for asking in a user survey “What is your current HIV status?” and “How would you feel if Grindr allowed you to filter the guys you see by HIV status?”</p>\n<p>In a statement, a Grindr representative said the survey is an effort to better understand its users and to encourage discussions.</p>\n<p>“We have observed a significant increase in user profiles openly discussing their HIV status and test dates. Given that this has not been a part of our profile options to date, we are surveying users to determine both their desire to share this information, and ways to prevent stigma and provide proper support,” the statement said. “Sometimes this involves asking uncomfortable questions.”</p>\n<p>\n            Screenshots of the survey were posted online by <a href=\"http://regnet.anu.edu.au/our-people/phd-students/daniel-reeders\">Daniel Reeders</a>, a Ph.D. candidate who studies HIV stigma at Australian National University. He got the images from a colleague, he said, and called the filter a “digital quarantine.” \n    </p>\n<p>“Dating sites and apps shouldn’t ask for HIV status, because there’s no way to guarantee that privacy and safety will be protected for people who disclose they are positive,” Reeders said. “The harassment that ‘poz’ (HIV-positive) people face can be extreme, even though it’s from a small segment of the community. People already have the ability to disclose their status in their profile text, if they choose to do so.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, public health and relationship experts suggest that HIV or other STD filters on a dating app might do more harm than good.</p>\n<h2>More harm than good?</h2>\n<p>\n            Although an HIV filter could have the benefit of letting HIV-positive people meet others – avoiding potentially awkward and stigmatizing conversations – it also could have a dark side: creating a false sense of security, said Dr. <a href=\"https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/es458\">Eric Schrimshaw</a>, associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University.\n    </p>\n<p>Some states have laws that mandate the disclosure of HIV status prior to any kind of sexual activity. But for some, a dating app filter could lead HIV-negative people to think that the filtered matches consist of only HIV-negative people, he said. From there, they might engage in unprotected sex.</p>\n<p>This could lead to HIV infections because “one, the potential partner might not be telling the truth in order to be able to get partners or to avoid stigma, and also the person may simply have engaged in behaviors recently that result in status change that they just don’t know yet.”</p>\n<p>Another concern is that such filters could increase stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV by further isolating them socially and “demonizing the population.”</p>\n<p>\n             “With more HIV stigma and discrimination, you are going to have less people who will get tested,” said Dr. <a href=\"https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/harper-gary.html\">Gary Harper</a>, a public health professor at the University of Michigan\n    </p>\n<p>Since most STDs are temporary and treatable, such as gonorrhea and chlamydia, people are more likely to seek treatment as soon as possible, Harper said; they wouldn’t even think to include them in their dating profiles. But a filter for any incurable STD, like herpes, could increase stigma, experts said.</p>\n<p>Harper added that imposing a filter on dating app users takes away privacy rights: You may no longer have control over who can disclose information about your HIV status on an online network of strangers.</p>\n<h2>Dating apps and the rise of STDs</h2>\n<p>\n            Online dating sites and mobile dating applications where users can create profiles and meet with strangers, have become increasingly popular among Americans. According to the <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/02/11/15-percent-of-american-adults-have-used-online-dating-sites-or-mobile-dating-apps/\">Pew Research Center</a>, about 15% of adults in the United States are now using online or mobile matchmaking services to seek potential partners, a 36% increase from 2013.\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/15/health/online-dating-app-hiv-std-filter/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Lina Rosengren, lead author of the study and an infectious diseases fellow at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. The study says that not only are the home test kits convenient, they can help bypass some of those stigmas by providing anonymity.</p>\n    <p>With a swab of the gums, the oral fluid test kits distributed in the study deliver results in 20 minutes. If the results are positive, participants are advised to seek additional blood tests for confirmation.</p>\n    <p>Researchers offered free access to these HIV home test kits through banner ads and full-screen notifications on Grindr. Clicking on the ads took users to the study’s website, where they could choose how they want to receive the test kit: by mail, using a redeemable voucher at a local pharmacy or with a code for use at a vending machine. They were also invited to complete two surveys, an online survey at the time of the test request and a follow-up after getting tested.</p>\n    <p>\n            The researchers chose Grindr because of its popularity among gay men in Los Angeles. The app attracts 2 million daily active users in 192 countries, according to its <a href=\"http://www.grindr.com/gay-advertising/\">website</a>. \n    </p>\n    <p>The study’s website received 4,389 unique visits over four weeks and 333 test kit requests.</p>\n    <p>Among the 125 participants who answered the first survey, 74% reported having unprotected anal sex at least once in the past three months. Twenty-nine percent were last tested for HIV more than a year ago, and 9% had never been tested for HIV.</p>\n    <p>Of the 56 users who took the follow-up survey, two tested positive for HIV. Still, 77% of those users preferred testing at home to doing so in clinical settings.</p>\n    <p>The pilot study, spearheaded by the University of California, Los Angeles, is part of a larger effort to incorporate HIV self-testing with mobile technology.</p>\n    <h3>Join the conversation</h3>\n    <p/>\n    <p>“We were surprised about the number of people who were willing to engage with us in health prevention through mobile apps,” Rosengren said. “People are comfortable receiving and giving fairly private health information through mobile technology.”</p>\n    <p>She hopes the study can inspire future efforts in HIV prevention and more research that finds ways to bridge the gap between HIV testing and early, proper treatment.</p>\n    <p>\n            The FDA has approved two types of home HIV tests, according to the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/testing/hometests.html\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. The Home Access HIV-1 Test System involves pricking your finger and sending the blood sample to a licensed laboratory, with results available seven business days after shipment. The other one is the oral fluid testing type used in the study. Both tests are anonymous.\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/07/25/health/grindr-hiv-test-kit/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Especially if you enjoy it.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            “Older men who found sex with their partner extremely pleasurable, or satisfying, had higher risk of cardiovascular events than men who did not feel so,” said study author <a href=\"http://sociology.msu.edu/faculty/profile/liu-hui/\">Hui Liu</a>, associate professor of sociology at Michigan State University.  \n    </p>\n<p>\n            The study analyzed survey data from 2,204 people enrolled in the <a href=\"http://www.norc.org/Research/Projects/Pages/national-social-life-health-and-aging-project.aspx\">National Social Life, Health and Aging Project</a> in the United States. Men and women aged 57 to 85 in partnered relationships were asked about their sexual satisfaction, frequency and health status in 2005, then again five years later. Each person’s cardiovascular health was also recorded by measuring their blood pressure, heart rate, elevated <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/c-reactive-protein/basics/definition/prc-20014480\">C-reactive protein </a>and history of heart attacks, heart failure and strokes.\n    </p>\n<p>While the analysis found great sex is risky for men in the survey, those who had sex one to three times a month and rated it less pleasurable had no increased risk for heart concerns.</p>\n<p>For their female partners, however, results were different. Women who said they had frequent, extremely satisfying sex had a lower risk of hypertension, a common precursor to heart disease.</p>\n<h2>Mediocre sex better for heart health?</h2>\n<p>“These findings challenge the widely held assumption that sex brings uniform health benefits to everyone,” Liu said. “I think it is important for older people to understand the potential risks and benefits of sex.”</p>\n<p>\n            “You have to interpret this data with grain of salt,” said <a href=\"http://www.drkevincampbellmd.com/\">Dr. Kevin Campbell</a>, a cardiologist at the University of North Carolina who specializes in heart rhythm disorders. “It’s in direct contrast with the significant clinical data we have showing that as men age if they continue to be sexually active their risk of cardiovascular disease actually decreases.\n    </p>\n<p>“I tell my patients a month after they have a heart attack or open heart surgery if they can walk a flight of steps without getting chest pain or shortness of breath,” said Campbell, “then they are fine to resume sexual activity.”</p>\n<h2>Surprising results for men</h2>\n<p>“The results for men were surprising,” said Lui, agreeing they run counter to decades of research that shows a positive health effect from sexual behavior for men, including better prostate health.</p>\n<p>One reason for the unusual findings, she said, could be in the design of the study. She said while other research has tended to focus on younger age groups, this survey was on a nationally representative sample of older adults across the United States.</p>\n<p>“It’s a survey, not a gold-standard, randomized, clinically controlled trial,” countered Campbell, also highlighting that the study was conducted in 2005, with a follow-up in 2010. “Is it really relevant now that most everyone is on a statin and our treatment of cardiovascular disease has continued to improve?” he asked.</p>\n<p>Another reason for her findings, Lui said, might lie in the use of erectile dysfunction supplements by many older men, or the level of stress created by the act of sex itself.</p>\n<p>“Older men may have more difficulties reaching an orgasm for medical or emotional reasons,” Lui said. “Therefore, they may exert themselves to a greater degree of exhaustion and create relatively more stress on their cardiovascular system in order to achieve a climax, which may hurt health.”</p>\n<p>That could possibly be true, Campbell said, if the man is suffering from an unknown cardiovascular blockage or if he is using certain medications for existing heart disease.</p>\n<p>“If they are taking any type of nitroglycerin, it can cause a dramatic drop in blood pressure with any of the erectile dysfunction drugs,” Campbell said. “That needs to be monitored very carefully.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/08/health/great-sex-older-men-women-study/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s actually green.’ ‘No, it was $1.26, not $1.25, Mom.’ ‘No, we went on Friday, it wasn’t Saturday,’ ” said an exasperated Simms, relaying what her daughter might say to her. “I literally stop and say, ‘Am I right about anything anymore?’ And my husband’s like, ‘No.’ ”</p>\n<p>Any parent of a tween or teen can probably relate to what Simms is going through.</p>\n<p>\n            In the <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/health/2016/09/08/parent-acts-everything-we-do-is-wrong-kelly-wallace-nccorig.cnn.html\">ninth installment</a> of our CNN Digital Video series<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/health/2016/08/09/parent-acts-teaching-kids-to-say-sorry-wallace-orig.cnn.html\"> “Parent Acts,”</a> we asked parents to act out how their kids might demonstrate how they are wrong about everything. We then had a parenting expert listen to their role-play and weigh in with advice.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Parenting strategist and licensed family therapist <a href=\"http://triciaferrara.com/\">Tricia Ferrara</a> listened to Simms and said that instead of focusing on whether she is right or wrong, she should “pull the lens back” a bit and focus on what’s happening with her daughter.\n    </p>\n<p>“What she’s developing is a communication habit of unsolicited opinion,” Ferrara told Simms. She offered this approach to use: “Instead of it being about whether you are right or wrong, almost like I can’t do anything right or say anything right for my daughter, it’s about, ‘You know what, honey, let’s have a time out, OK? If I asked your opinion of my answer, I would want to hear it.’ ”</p>\n<p>\n            Ferrara, the author of <a href=\"http://triciaferrara.com/parenting-2-0-tricia-ferrara-the-book/\">“Parenting 2.0: Think in the Future, Act in the Now,”</a> a guidebook for parents with step-by-step advice on how to strengthen their relationships with their children, said Simms could also build in an incentive for the good behavior: If her daughter wants to do a sleepover at a friend’s house, for instance, she needs to go 10 days without making a comment about something her mother says unless her mother asks for her opinion. \n    </p>\n<p>“Occasionally, I would ask them their opinion and say, ‘What do you think of that?’ so they have an understanding it’s not that you don’t want to hear from them, but there is a time and a place.”</p>\n<p>What also plays a role in how our kids respond to us, said Ferrara, herself a mom of two teenagers, is how we respond as parents.</p>\n<p>“I see a lot of parents just barking on their kids or barking on their business,” she said. “And so that they think it’s OK to do that in reverse.”</p>\n<p>\n            Having a child who thinks you are wrong all the time is very common, said pediatrician and author <a href=\"http://claudiamgoldmd.com/\">Dr. Claudia Gold, </a>who is an infant mental health specialist. “Depending on the degree, it’s a normal developmental phenomenon.”\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Before adolescence, it may be happening because the child’s group of friends is beginning to take prominence over the family, said Gold, author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Keeping-Your-Child-Mind-Overcoming/dp/073821485X\">“Keeping Your Child in Mind”</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Silenced-Child-Medications-Quick-Fix-Resilience/dp/0738218391\">“The Silenced Child.”</a> During adolescence, it may be related to the teen’s desire to separate from their family and forge their own identify.\n    </p>\n<p>“When they get older and they have more advanced cognitive skills and are capable of abstract thinking, it’s a kind of practicing of their own newfound abilities,” Gold said.</p>\n<p>Her advice is for parents to brush it off and not butt heads with their kids. The irritating behavior will probably go away, she said.</p>\n<p>What needs to be looked at a bit more closely is when the child’s thinking that everything their parents do or say is wrong is causing problems in a family and when the behavior really seems to be pushing the parent’s buttons, said Gold.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/13/health/parent-acts-kids-think-parents-wrong/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Personal notebooks reveal what life was like for the Washington activist who spent decades advocating for equal rights in the federal government and elsewhere</h2>\n<p>In 1957, Frank Kameny, a 32-year-old astronomer with the Army Map Service, was on a work trip to Hawaii and the West Coast when he was told to report back to Washington, D.C. for questioning. There, civil service investigators asked him to respond to reports that he was gay. “I don’t see how it’s relevant to any rational concern or business of the government,” Kameny, a World War II veteran, recalled answering. He was soon fired. The official cause cited was that he had falsified his job application, an official government document, by downplaying his arrest for “lewd” behavior with another man the previous year. (Kameny told the government he’d been arrested for “disorderly conduct,” a less grave sin in those days.) At the time, the government deemed gay Americans to be security risks and effectively banned them from federal service. These were the days of the Lavender Scare, which grew out of the anti-communist panic of the 1940s and ’50s.</p>\n<p>Kameny appealed his dismissal in various courts and in 1961 petitioned the United States Supreme Court to take up his case; the court declined to review it. Furious, Kameny would devote his life to fighting homophobia: “We are here to stay, we are part of American life and society, and you will be seeing a lot more of us,” he declared in a 1969 letter.</p>\n<p>Born in New York City on May 21, 1925, to a Jewish family, Kameny became a trailblazing activist for gay civil rights. In 1961, after his fruitless petition to the Supreme Court, Kameny co-founded the Washington, D.C. chapter of the Mattachine Society, a pioneering organization with what was then called the homophile movement—the pre-Stonewall campaign for gay equality. Four years later, the group led the first recorded gay rights picket of the White House, protesting the government’s banning of gay Americans from the federal service: “<i>Homosexual Citizens Want to Serve Their Country Too</i>.” “<i>Sexual Preference Is Irrelevant to Federal Employment</i>.” These were radical messages for the era.</p>\n<p>Kameny neatly captured his ethos in the slogan “Gay Is Good,” which he coined in 1968, inspired by the Black Power mantra “Black Is Beautiful.” “For those within the community, [the phrase] certainly instilled some pride to counterbalance the [rhetoric of] ‘gays are going to hell,’” says Franklin A. Robinson Jr., an archivist with the National Museum of American History. And Kameny aptly linked the struggle for gay rights to other battles for equality: “We are interested in obtaining rights for our respective minorities as Negroes, as Jews and as homosexuals,” he proclaimed at a 1964 public meeting at Freedom House, a Washington-based nonprofit.</p>\n<p>In 1971, Kameny became the first openly gay person to run for U.S. Congress. As he vied to serve as Washington’s delegate to the House of Representatives, he presented himself as a candidate who had something to offer everybody. “I was very conscious of running a double-barreled, double-issue campaign,” he recalled to <i>Washingtonian</i> magazine in 2010. “If you’re going to run for public office, you have to become [an] expert on trash collection, road repair and all the things that concern people, but I was running a parallel campaign on gay issues.”</p>\n<p>While Kameny lost his bid, he played a big role in pressuring the American Psychiatric Association to remove homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses and disorders in 1973, and some two decades later, he lobbied President Bill Clinton to sign a 1995 executive order banning anti-gay discrimination in federal security clearances. In 2009, two years before he died, the U.S. government issued an apology to Kameny for his 1957 termination.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/frank-kameny-helped-chart-part-liberation-millions-gay-americans-180987148/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>You may have seen peaks of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOHOHAQkgHY/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\">Bond’s nursery on Instagram</a>, or already seen <a href=\"https://thechalkboardmag.com/lauryn-bosstick-nursery-david-samuel-ko/\">The Chalkboard</a> article that went up the other day. Either way I’m so excited to give you the full tour of Bond’s nursery.</p>\n<p>We decided to work with David Ko of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/maison.ko/\">Maison Ko</a> and we’re so thrilled with the results, I can’t even put it into words. It’s perfect.</p>\n<p>David was such a pleasure to work with. He totally executed my vision and understood that although it’s a nursery, it’s also a room that Bond can grow into. Overall the vibe was texture, depth, neutral but rich color with interesting touches to make the room unique.</p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://liketk.it/5mDYz\">shop the whole nursery look here</a> and in the meantime, read on to learn about the whole process and the details that brought the vision together.</p>\n<h2>Step Inside Bond’s Nursery</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>What was the first piece or idea that kicked off the whole vision for the nursery?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>DK</strong>: The idea that really laid the groundwork for Bond’s nursery was doing some sort of mural wall treatment. At first, we were looking into hiring an artist to do a custom hand-painted mural, but then we came across this wallpaper and knew it was the one. We wanted it to feel moody, yet still a touch whimsical—something that Bond could grow into and not feel permanently newborn. The colors in the wallpaper really inspired the rest of the room and led the overall direction.</p>\n<p><strong>LB:</strong> The vision of baby Bond’s nursery was to incorporate texture, <a href=\"https://www.glamora.it/en/product/GLX38\">artistic wallpaper</a>, but without feeling too thematic. The room had to have depth with calming and soothing energy for the baby. Simply stepping into the room is an experience, and along with functional, unique details, meditation chimes, and red lights, David worked with me to execute our vision perfectly. </p>\n<p>We focused on texture and richness with deep shades of evergreen and chocolate brown. I didn’t want it to feel beige and muted—opposite, actually. I also wanted the nursery to tell a story, so many elements are personalized: from specific books, to Michael’s silver baby rattle, to pictures and details.</p>\n<p>Bringing in the baby element was obviously important, but I challenged David and his team to do something you don’t see on Instagram all the time. For example, <a href=\"https://rh.com/us/en/\">the darker crib</a> (<a href=\"https://bit.ly/45Mbe3j\">lighter version here</a>) feels masculine, yet there’s still a baby-esque aura.</p>\n<p>Also, I am huge on <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3vfmQfL\">organization</a>—each drawer, closet area, and shelf is efficiently organized with thought and purpose so that when the baby arrived, everything was streamlined.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>What did you want this nursery to </strong>\n      <i>feel</i>\n      <strong> like—for you, for the baby, and for your family?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>DK:</strong> When we started working together, all Lauryn told me was that she didn’t want it to feel like a typical beige nursery. She wanted it to feel elevated yet approachable, suited for a newborn, but not overly trendy or something you’ve seen a thousand times. Lauryn wanted it to be a space that felt unique and truly special for Bond.</p>\n<p><strong>LB:</strong> Along with our home being a place where we can all recharge, each child is unique and deserves their own space that reflects their essence. My daughter’s room is sort of a pinkish-lilac and white, and my son’s room is very much a rock ‘n roll vibe. The new baby also needs his own moment and David and his team really helped us to achieve Bond’s essence.</p>\n<p>It brings me joy to create spaces for children to relax their nervous system. My Mom did it for me by sewing curtains and duvet covers and making my room specifically tailored to me. I remember loving to be in my room and feeling comforted in my bedroom. So creating that for my own kids is a priority. It’s funny, my Dad walked into the baby’s nursery the other day and said, “Your Mom was just like this with you and your sister, Faye.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/step-inside-bonds-nursery/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><strong>Ten Days After Grandma’s Funeral</strong><br/>By Roberta Beary</p>\n<p>Mom tells me to go to the A&amp;P for filet of flounder. <i>The Man From U.N.C.L.E.</i> is about to start. She can hear the theme music. And she knows I’m crazy about Illya Kuryakin. <i>Go</i>, she says again.</p>\n<p>On my walk, I pass the pretty blonde girl from school who never talks to me. Her yellow boots splash inside a big, muddy puddle. I want to be her. But instead I’m big-boned with real bosoms on account of my being what Doctor McDougall calls an early developer.</p>\n<p>By the fish counter, some old guy rubs his back against my front, accidentally on purpose. His cart has frozen pizza, the kind with pepperoni and sausage that Mom says is for skinny people. At our house we only eat boring stuff. Friday is always filet of flounder. No dessert. Because money doesn’t grow on trees.</p>\n<p>The old guy has candy bars in his cart too. He says to point out my favorite. <i>That’s easy</i>, <i>Almond Joy. </i>The man behind the counter hands me Mom’s fish in thick wax paper. <i>Say hello to your beautiful Mother.</i> Bloody streaks run down his apron. The old guy winks at me, <i>Like mother, like daughter</i>.</p>\n<p>Outside, old guy offers me two <i>Almond Joy</i>s. I don’t say thank you. He asks if I’d like a ride home. My head shakes a big no. He drives away in his <i>T-Bird</i>, honking a secret code I know is a lie. Mom’s the only beautiful one. No matter what Grandma says about ugly ducklings growing into swans. She’s dead now, anyway.</p>\n<p>I walk slow on account of chewing my <i>Almond Joy</i>. When I get to the big puddle the pretty girl is gone. I dip the toe of my sneaker into the puddle and bury the candy wrapper in the mud. Now it’s dead too. I think about saying a prayer for Grandma’s soul. But instead I unwrap the second candy bar.</p>\n<p><strong>Summer Evening</strong><br/>By Cath Barton</p>\n<p>It had been so hot, was still so damned hot I’d kept my hair tied back, hadn’t changed out of what I’d been wearing at the beach that afternoon, hadn’t put on the frock I’d chosen for the evening, the one that made me look, well, the way I thought he liked me to look. Fact was, he’d clearly made no effort to dress up either, which kind of pissed me off, kind of pleased me, but then the annoyance got the upper hand because he wasn’t giving me the space to talk, to say what I wanted from the summer, was just lecturing me about what he called the ‘shape of our future lives,’ though actually it was all about himself, all about getting away from his mother and that clapboard house with its tattered curtains and its fusty smell, even out on the porch, all about heading to California and brighter lights, brighter times.</p>\n<p>There were frogs calling from the stagnant pond across the yard as he talked, matching him as if they had an opinion about it all. And what I thought but didn’t say, because he gave me no opportunity to do so and I couldn’t insist like the frogs did, what I thought as I kept my eyes down and my hands flat on the top of the balustrade behind me, arm muscles clenched, toes scrunched inside my scuffed blue pumps, what I thought was that there would be someone better for me out there and that I’d keep the new frock for that man. Though I also knew that when it came to it, that man would appreciate me for who I was, not what I wore.</p>\n<p><strong>White Knights</strong><br/>By Jim Flannigan</p>\n<p>Matt’s sitting on the corner of the chair. He’d rushed over from down the street the second I got to my parents’ house. His legs are bunched in a way that suggests he could spring at any moment. I can feel the coiled energy pulsing off him.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brilliantflashfiction.com/2025/06/30/june-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I was so wicked excited when I learned it made it into the Best Small Fictions anthology. A first for me! This was a fun piece to mess around with. When I was in high school, I used to roof houses in the summer (and landscape/paint/general carpentry stuff also), and it was always a nightmare being on an asphalt roof in the middle of August. No amount of water would ever cool me down. I remember days where the guys I’d work with would get a little loopy, probably from the heat (but who really knows…roofers are an eclectic bunch), and sing unusual pop songs to one another and do little shimmying dances on the scaffolding…which always seemed surreal. A fall from three-stories up is never fun, and dancing just made that seem so much closer. So I tried to capture a bit of that surreality in this piece. A lot of my work focuses on climate change and eco-horror, so this story is a bit of a blend between my real world experience and projections of the future given global temperature rise. And I can’t help putting a ghost in there…they always find their way into my stories, and this one was no exception. I hope you enjoy the read.</i></p>\n<p><strong>Roofing in Warm Weather</strong><br/>By Corey Farrenkopf</p>\n<p>The idea of roofing in warm weather makes sense because asphalt shingles melt a little to adhere to the roof itself. The process helps if hurricanes are on the horizon. If you lay them down in fall, when it’s getting cold, the sun won’t bake them in place, and they’ll come right off when the wind picks up. That’s what my boss says anyway, though he tells me this from the comfort of the ground, an iced coffee turning to a slurpy in his hands.</p>\n<p>The idea of roofing in warm weather does not take into account what the heat does to our bodies, the sweat induced hallucinations I see while I’m nailing down the peak. The apparition looks like my ex-girlfriend, Ruby, crooking a finger just beyond the edge of the gutter, two stories down to the stone driveway beneath. I shake my head, wipe my eyes, try to clear the specter from my sight. I know she’s standing on nothing. Scaffoldings on the other side. Just open air, my dehydrated brain keeping her aloft.</p>\n<p>The idea of roofing in warm weather only gets worse each year. The climate never got this hot two decades ago when I started the job fresh out of high school. The thermometer occasionally poked a hundred, but not for days on end, the cloudless sky baking us onto the roof just as much as the shingles. But the job pays, and it’s what I know how to do, so I press down the nailgun’s trigger, firing another spike into the roof.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brilliantflashfiction.com/2025/05/25/best-small-fictions-2025-winner/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><strong>GRADUATION DAY</strong><br/>By CC King</p>\n<p>A four-by-six color photograph of my father and me staring out over the field behind the gymnasium at my high school. The picture was taken in San Jose the day of my graduation, in the late 90s. My father and I are facing away from the camera, and even through the grainy pixels, it’s clear his hand hovers inches from my back, which is draped in a black gown that was never pressed—the folds from where it was boxed and shipped make the shiny fabric bend and catch the early June light. My father is telling me about my sister, about how many days he thinks she can last on life support, about how difficult it is on my mother, this decision looming before them, about how it can tear marriages apart. I remember that, though I don’t recall much of the graduation ceremony. Only being pushed from behind when my name was called, and the roar of applause and cheers as I made my way across the stage. Even then, I knew it was less an ovation for me than for my sister. Her graduation would be of a different kind.</p>\n<p>Some other details stand out. Smiles everywhere. Balloons floating like severed heads to the rafters. Faces swarming me like bees. And my father, making his way to me after the formalities were over. His shoulder pressed against mine as parents and teachers and administrators pushed into us. How without saying a word, he cleared a path through the crowds of happy relatives and friends, shouting to each other over the cacophony of other happy relatives and friends talking about bright futures and roads ahead. The way he paused at the edge of the field when I did, inhaling the sweet scent of cut grass, instead of striding toward the car to beat the other cars out of the parking lot.</p>\n<p>And how, when the well-meaning mother of a once-friend called out to us, encouraging me to come to her daughter’s graduation party—<i>Just for a little bit, to take your mind off things</i>—he stood in front of me, narrow shoulders expanding, staring her down until she moved on. The way he reached over and squeezed my hand before backing out of the parking lot and driving us back to the hospital, the silence between us louder than the din in the old school gym.</p>\n<p><strong>I Imagine My Face on a Freeway Billboard</strong><br/>By Mae Ellen-Marie Wissert</p>\n<p>Some people praise Lana Del Rey’s extravagant pettiness for placing the one and only billboard promoting her new album on the Tulsa freeway her cop ex-boyfriend drives every day … and I am those people. But I am not making Los Angeles money and can’t afford a billboard in our small town. So, I settle for the rare opportunities when my ex’s Cadillac passes me on our main street.</p>\n<p>I look past him: my face framed in a rolled-down window of a failing 2004 Chevy Tahoe I can barely afford, with pink sunglasses, fake gold hoops, a candy necklace and an American Spirit hanging from my mouth, hoping this glamour will remind him of what he lost.</p>\n<p>Spread fingers to my mouth—I fix my glossy gaze beyond the glare of his windshield while I remember our arguments—where he mocked me then told me he loved me. I recorded them so I could play them back to him to show his malice like maybe then he would change. Instead, the recordings demonstrated me eating that shit up. He never heard them, but I still listen when I miss his authoritative voice. My own cracks when I say stuff like <i>you can’t</i> <i>treat me like this</i>. I knew he could. In the car: I appear as lackadaisical as Lana on that billboard: her cat eyes looking everywhere and nowhere.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brilliantflashfiction.com/2025/03/31/march-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Eugene</p>\n<p><a href=\"\">One</a> warm summer evening a boy had the <i>bejeesus</i> scared out of him by an object hovering in the night sky that was bigger than the mountain it loomed over, and emanated a glow from which came an inexplicable warmth that supplanted his initial fear with a strange sense of well-being and joyous desire to share this weird, <i>oogly</i> experience with somebody; anybody; and so he burst through the open doors of the nearest night watch, where the officer on duty set a stack of paper forms before the boy and asked him to further describe this hovering thing, which the boy called a great and wondrous levitating rod of fire that glowed orange but also goldand thenblue<i>, </i>depending on how long you stared at it and what direction it pointed; but the officer only heard <i>fire,</i> <i>direction,</i> and <i>pointed, </i>and demanded to know what manner of weapon this was; and when the boy said <i>no weapon</i>, the officer leaned further across his desk and growled <i>young man, we are at war, </i>and when the boy mumbled something inscrutable about colors and feelings, the officer demanded he tell which side of the tracks he lived on, who his parents were, who his uncles were, who his aunts, his cousins, friends, classmates, and teachers were; and so the boy said, <i>all you have to do is just stick your head out the window and look over there</i>, to which the officer of the night watch replied <i>are you threatening me? </i>to which the boy said <i>no</i>; but by then it was apparent that at some point in the past this person had either <i>too much bejeesus </i>scared out of him, or not enough; in any case, this person was already quite afraid and had absolutely no interest in having his mind changed; and so the boy left that pile of paper and backed away from that desk as the officer stared him down head to toe; and after running out the building giggling into that warm summer night, the boy looked up into the sky, and sure enough, there itwas, atop the mountain, that weird, <i>oogly</i> thing, all orange and gold and blue at the same time; only now it’s landed, and bizarre indescribables oozed from pores on the vessel’s skin and rolled down the mountainside toward their sleeping town; but the boy, he could only laugh contentedly, with nothing left to do but skip home to wake his family and tell them the actual truth: that everything is fine.</p>\n<p><strong>Tethered/Untethered</strong><br/>By Jack Powers</p>\n<p>I was thinking of killing Slim even before she started humming <i>La Cucaracha</i>. I don’t mean <i>kill</i> kill. I was just irritated. I mean nobody should have to work with their ex. We were eight hours into our twelve-hour shift—statistically the most likely time to lose focus and fall into the portal. I was questioning my life choices, lack of choices, even my choice to live at all.</p>\n<p>And then she starts in with “<i>Hm hm hmm ha! Hm hm hmm ha!”</i></p>\n<p>“Please stop,” I said.</p>\n<p>“Stop what?” Slim said.</p>\n<p>“Humming <i>La Cucaracha</i>.”</p>\n<p>“Is that what it is?” Slim laughed. “Thanks, Ricky!”</p>\n<p>“Why’d you say, ‘Stop what?’ if you knew what it—”</p>\n<p>“<i>La cucaracha! La cucaracha</i>!” Slim began singing. “<i>Ya no puede caminar</i>. That’s such an annoying song.”</p>\n<p>“Then why keep singing it?”</p>\n<p>All the other space portals had gone to self-service and drone maintenance, but management thought having Slim and me working would give ours a personal touch—as if we were some old Mom and Pop bodega. But our marriage was done as soon as Slim signed the papers and what Mom and Pop could afford a multidimensional deep space portal? Stupid! And two engineers scraping space barnacles and cosmic shit off the entry cone by hand? Idiotic! Balancing along the rim of the open cone with degraded mag boots but no tethers, risking falling into some unknown part of the multiverse? Moronic! Singing a centuries-old song from the Mexican revolution? Just weird!</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brilliantflashfiction.com/2025/01/31/january-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><strong>NOTHING ELSE TO LOVE</strong><br/>By Pamela Painter</p>\n<p>This room is supposed to assist me in living but it is a sorry sight. Lumpy bed. Lumpy chair. Potty chair. Bed. TV. Hate TV. Dresser with two drawers too hard to open. Nothing in them anyway. Bed. Did I say bed? Bed. A squeaky walker as chatty as the staff. Staff deliver trays of grey food. Then they wheel me into the room full of chair-sitters. I wheel myself out. I stay in my room in my chair near my lumpy. Lumpy? My lumpy bed.</p>\n<p>I was dumped here by a person I almost recognize. It was last week. Maybe last month. The man’s pursed mouth reminded me of someone I knew as a child. He pursed and muttered. He dumped out stuff from a box. I said take it away. He dumped stuff back into the box. All the time muttering. I couldn’t hear him.</p>\n<p>Today a woman is with him. I tell the man with the pursed mouth to stop muttering and push my lumpy chair up to the window. I tell him I am a lump in a lumpy chair. This does not make him laugh? The woman’s mouth was also pursed before she laughed. She laughed big. Oh happiness. He purses some more. She tells the man with the pursed mouth to hand over her purse. She fishes around for something. He mutters at her. She might cry.</p>\n<p>I go close to her. She smells good. She looks like someone I used to know, maybe someone I used to like. I push my container of Kleenex toward her. It falls off the brown bedside mound that might be a table. She sniffs. They sit some more before they stand. He mutters to my face. She mutters in my ear, touches my hand. They leave. I sit in the window and wait for the moon. It rarely fails to visit me. There is nothing else to love.</p>\n<p><strong>Two Hands Clasping a Crowned Heart</strong><br/>By Jennifer DeLeskie</p>\n<p>You spy it while crossing the street on your way to buy cat food: a gold ring trapped in the ice, glittering like the promise of true love. You squat to take a closer look, straining to focus in the miserly light of a winter afternoon, because your eyes have grown unaccustomed to the day.</p>\n<p>You know this kind of ring (although you cannot remember its name): two hands clasping a crowned heart. If it is worn with the point of the heart toward the fingertips, the wearer is seeking love. If it is worn with the point of the heart toward the wrist, the wearer has already found it.</p>\n<p>It is the kind of ring a mother gives her daughter, or a true love gives their beloved. It is the kind of ring your true love might have given you, before something arbitrary and unfixable happened, transforming you from a person deserving of love into whatever you’ve now become.</p>\n<p>The intersection is on your daily route—or was before your life shrank down to sleeping all day and feeling bad about the things you can no longer do: bathing, answering texts, showing up to work. The light has a generous pedestrian crossing of 45 seconds, long enough for you to free the ring from the ice. But why has no one else claimed it?</p>\n<p>Perhaps because it is frozen into a dirty puddle in the middle of a busy intersection.</p>\n<p>Or perhaps because it is waiting for you.</p>\n<p>Extracting the ring from the ice isn’t going to be possible with your bare hands; only the pointed end of the heart sticks out, not big enough for you to grasp. And it is cold—so cold the ice is as unyielding as rock, so cold your fingers are clumsy and raw.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brilliantflashfiction.com/2024/09/30/september-2024/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A man<br/>\npropped behind the wheel, an arm ending in a foot dangling carefree from the window.<br/>\nAn ass in place of a face, sporting sunglasses, staring into endless blue sky.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://tinhouse.com/practical-joke/\">\n        <graphic width=\"1180\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://tinhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Poetry-by-Brian-Barker-Banner.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://tinhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Poetry-by-Brian-Barker-Banner.jpg 1180w, https://tinhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Poetry-by-Brian-Barker-Banner-255x108.jpg 255w, https://tinhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Poetry-by-Brian-Barker-Banner-500x212.jpg 500w, https://tinhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Poetry-by-Brian-Barker-Banner-768x325.jpg 768w, https://tinhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Poetry-by-Brian-Barker-Banner-1024x434.jpg 1024w, https://tinhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Poetry-by-Brian-Barker-Banner-960x407.jpg 960w, https://tinhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Poetry-by-Brian-Barker-Banner-510x216.jpg 510w, https://tinhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Poetry-by-Brian-Barker-Banner-800x339.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1180px) 100vw, 1180px\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://tinhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Poetry-by-Brian-Barker-Banner.jpg\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://tinhouse.com/practical-joke/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I woke up most Saturdays of 1999 in faded flannel sheets. The alarm went off at 5:15 a.m., but I usually snoozed it a few times due to the cold: a pervasive, wet Oregon chill that breezed through our 1880s farmhouse and left a dewy sheen on the wallpaper. My dad would drive us over backcountry roads dusted with frost, past filbert orchards and nurseries that grew starter trees for Home Depot. Saturday mornings he took me to the local community center for a sliding scale ballet class.</p>\n<p>The promise of dance is a channeling. I think he knew I had that rage, that if I didn’t find an outlet, I’d start to turn it on myself. Ballet class was warm, full of sunrises and two-name girls: Susie Mae, Sarah Jo, Lee Ann, and our teacher, Maggie Jane.</p>\n<p>Maggie Jane wasn’t a renowned dancer. I wouldn’t say, for example, that she ever competed outside county lines or performed at a wider venue than the hanger at the state fair. I still remember Rachmaninoff bouncing diagonally off panels of rusted steel siding, all the way down to the blue ribbon steer yard, diagonal like the lines she’d draw in the air with her sinewy calves. Maggie Jane was an unpredictable performer making work steeped in erratic movement. You couldn’t call her choreography nuanced, but I loved her for her jutting rhythms, sharp lyricism, and stringent economy of movement. She was a good teacher, blasting Tchaikovsky loud enough to drown out the insecurities racking our preteen bodies. Maggie Jane didn’t mind my chubby knees, how I stomped across her maple floorboards and mashed powdered rosin on my toes to keep from slipping, how I started class red and got redder.</p>\n<p>After class she’d bang out the door and smoke half a pack on the sidewalk, waiting for some date or another to come pick her up, and we’d wait for parents. Our county was mostly about waiting. Once before we drove away, she motioned for my dad to roll down the window of our Ford and slapped her hand on the frame. “You got a young gun here, buddy,” she said, one hand on her hip, “a live one, a real handful.” Handful. My wife calls me that when I’m bad at parties. “Too candid,” she’ll chide on the drive home, “you have to learn. Let them have their social graces.” Aw, but people should say how it really is, not, “Hand me that tin of butter cookies,” pounding spiked nog like, “those sequins bring out your eyes.” Not fake like they aren’t still angry you didn’t lay down your fair share of the bill at Gino’s. I’m learning to move through it. Channeling. Maggie Jane taught me that, and other things: brisk steps, the confidence to make moves on a stage, to coordinate my own and foreign bodies.</p>\n<p>She had these three towhead brats, all of whom refused to take ballet. They’d read Goosebumps in the corner and dump out rosin tins, turn her purse upside down and hunt for gum, orange pill bottles scattered at their feet. If they swept up dust bunnies after class, Maggie Jane’d give them each a quarter. Loose curls all over the hardwood. In any room full of girls you’re bound to get hair on the floor — little whispers, dropped secrets.</p>\n<p>One Saturday morning, Sarah Jo, Lee Ann, and Susie Mae were lined up outside the community center, hanging over the railing of the stairwell.</p>\n<p>“Door’s locked,” Lee Ann called down, shivering in her leotard. This was before cell phones. We just hung around. Knocked a few more times.</p>\n<p>“I guess no class today,” Susie Mae shrugged after thirty minutes or so.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://tinhouse.com/pipe-dream/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://brevitymag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Montgomery.jpeg\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>I visit the mystery house with my college boyfriend for an anniversary, but really, I am trying to uncover how I became a girl who accepts being torn down and rebuilt like this house. I am looking to solve the riddle where one and one do not make two but rather one is greater than the other, my world easily absorbed by a boy who says he loves me but does not want me to love anything else. Even myself.</p>\n<p>I have been to the Winchester Mystery House before, on a high school trip, shrouded in another life. Back then, we wandered the 160 rooms, learned about the 10,000 windows and 2,000 doors, and though most laughed at a widowed woman so mad she devoted her life to building a labyrinth around herself, already I understood trying to create something that would keep you unreachable and free.</p>\n<p>My high school friends and I kept each other close as lovers, whispered secret devotions and smoothed our hands over one another’s bodies to tend to what haunted us. There was the friend who was secretly dating a teacher, sneaking into his room on nights he was supposedly our chaperone. He knew we knew, and during the day he scolded us for giggling or straying off the path. There was the friend who gave herself to any boy who would have her because her father said she was conceived to replace a dead sister. There was the friend who threw up after every meal. The friend who cut herself to feel. The friend who hated herself because she hated a girl loving a girl.</p>\n<p>How I loved them, these girls. We grew up playing doctor, trying to heal hurts no one would see or believe, and with my oversized dollhouse, taking turns shimmying our growing bodies out the front door as if trying to escape. But after graduation, we saw each other rarely, as memories, as ghosts on the Internet. We tried to flee, but mostly we moved our hurts somewhere else as we built new homes.</p>\n<p>I have tried to build a home with my college boyfriend. He says the woman who built the mystery house must be haunted. He says the same about me, when I have feelings he does not understand, mostly unhappy ones about our relationship, or when I do not want to do whatever he desires like shoot guns or play video games or listen to him incorrectly correct me. Or mend a fight that he started by giving him my body.</p>\n<p>He does not like my body anyway, monitors what I eat by tracking calories on a sheet of paper he keeps in his pocket or removing my plate from in front of me during a meal. One Valentine’s Day, he buys me a chocolate cake in the shape of a heart and permits me one piece before throwing the rest away. As the years add up, pounds subtract on the scale and people ask me where I’ve vanished.</p>\n<p>At its most expansive, the mystery house had hundreds more rooms. Now many are lost, crumbled, walled off, or inaccessible. I imagine them as holes on the inside, wounds that will never be healed because they cannot be reached.</p>\n<p>I wander towards another of the six kitchens but my boyfriend reaches for my hand to pull me back in his direction. The tour guide talks about legends, stories about spirits and superstitions. Most are made up, a convenient way for others to understand a difficult woman.</p>\n<p>But it is no mystery to me why a woman would want to wall herself in, would build something only to watch it fail and be forced to begin again.</p>\n<p>It will be many years before I leave him in order to build something of my own.</p>\n<p>For now, we take the stairs. He climbs the conventional ones, moves easily to another floor. I prefer to take the ones where you climb and climb, convinced you might be mad, might be hovering between life and death, claustrophobic in the tiny corridor, the walls closing in, all that time and effort only to move a few feet, to go nowhere.<br/>\n___</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brevitymag.com/nonfiction/mystery-house/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Many years ago, in an adult writing workshop, the instructor asked us to profile a parent. At the time, I was struggling in my relationship with my father so he came immediately to mind. I began with, “My father is the tallest of two sons born and raised in Philadelphia who majored in philosophy in college and pursued a life in business.”</p>\n<p>As we scribbled, the teacher, who was well regarded and known for being direct, strolled the aisles where we sat at small desks, reading over our shoulders, nodding and hmmm-ing.</p>\n<p>When she arrived at my desk, she peered at my page. I looked up and saw her frown.</p>\n<p>“Tell me about your mother,” she said.<br/>\n“But there’s much more drama around my father,” I responded.<br/>\n“That may be true, but just tell me one thing — one unusual detail — about your mother.”<br/>\nIt took a moment, but out came, “Well, my mother did grow up in a hotel.”<br/>\n“Ah. That’s it!” A smile came to her face. “You must write about your mother.”</p>\n<p>And, before I could argue, off she strolled to the next writer.</p>\n<p>That was the day I learned about the value of the well-selected detail. The one that comes to mind when we think of a particular person. The one we recall long after reading a book. The ones that signals a storyline.</p>\n<p>Details like: Mob boss Tony Soprano sees a therapist. Wednesday Addams wears a white-collared black dress, pigtails and has a fascination with the macabre. Harry Potter has a lightning bolt-shaped scar on his forehead.</p>\n<p>What I discovered that day was that the right details don’t just set the table. They are more like the seasoning we add to a recipe. They project clues about the character and the storyline.</p>\n<p>They can actually work as a narrative tool. Even if we call a rose by some other name, by its color or texture or aroma — as Juliet said to Romeo — naming it allows us to experience it.</p>\n<p>All a reader learns about my father in those first words I wrote was his height, where he grew up, what he studied and did for a living. They expressed very little about who he was at his core, what my story about him might be and any sense of his relationship to me.</p>\n<p>Compare this to when people learn that my mother grew up in a hotel. Their eyebrows go up. “Really?” they ask. They often bring up the children’s storybook character Eloise, though my mother didn’t live at the Plaza but at a hotel in Pittsburgh. She did, however, live with her mother and father in three rooms with no kitchen. She would take the elevator down to the hotel dining room, order a bowl of cereal for breakfast — which she ate alone — and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch. Growing up in a hotel not only left her with zero kitchen skills, but they influenced her decorative leanings to something I lovingly call institutionally immaculate. Clean. Spare. Formal. There was a lot about her that was formed by growing up in that environment.</p>\n<p>These are the kind of details that can lure us into a story.</p>\n<p>Here’s the thing — we don’t need many. Too much detail can distract your reader and slow the pace of the action.</p>\n<p>An example from Dinty W. Moore. Compare this scene:</p>\n<p>\n      <i>My mother walked quickly into the room and she sure seemed angry about something. She didn’t normally enter my bedroom when the door was closed. It was morning, and I figured it had to do with my sneaking in so late the night before and her wanting to know where I had been. She stood really close to me with a furious look on her face and made her suspicions of me entirely clear. She was holding a towel from the kitchen.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>With this:</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Mom charged in, ignoring the closed bedroom door, stood so close I could feel the heat coming off her body, could smell her morning coffee. “Where on God’s earth were you last night?” she demanded, twisting a dish towel in her reddened hands.</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/craft-using-the-lesson-of-the-rose-to-write-detail-as-narrative-by-ellen-blum-barish/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>There’s a well-worn trope in the literary world that publishing a book is an act of creation analogous to producing a human life. Authors refer to their “book babies,” announce due dates, celebrate publication birthdays, enlist book doulas. “It’s your baby!” I’ve been told of my forthcoming debut. “It must feel like you’re giving birth to another child.”</p>\n<p>And, sure: it’s a conception only possible through great care and love and the deepest sort of nurturing, culminating in the grueling work of pushing something beautiful into the world.</p>\n<p>But, I can’t claim to know if the comparison totally holds.</p>\n<p>My book, an infertility memoir-in-essays, isn’t out until October. What has felt true on my long path to publication is a notion adjacent to the natalist fairytale: the rejection and pain and hope of the querying and submission process is the closest mirror I’ve found to infertility itself.</p>\n<p>Most notably, it’s the waiting. In publishing, the infinite stretches of being on hold in anticipation of something happening — for an editor to read, for a response to a query that may never come, recognizing that three or even six months is somehow a reasonable period in which to expect a response — felt so much like the waits I did when I was trying to get pregnant. That unsettled discomfort and bottomless longing while I waited for my period, for an explanation, for an IVF cycle to finally work.</p>\n<p>Though even as one wait flowed into the next, it didn’t matter much anyway, because in books, as in babies, it’s all or nothing. There’s no chipping away, inching incrementally closer to your goal, celebrating modest wins as you close the gap. You either sell your book or you don’t. You get to hold your baby or you don’t. And to keep going, to find a way forward when your entire query column is a tally of nos, when there isn’t one remaining imprint on your submission list, when your body refuses to accept even the healthiest embryo and grow it into a baby — you require a sort of obsessive belief in what could be, what you just know is possible, even when the universe seems hell bent on proving otherwise. To be the driving force in an act of creation requires something deeper than stamina, something steelier, like an unyielding, existential urge that says: Pick yourself up. Do not stop. What else is there?</p>\n<p>The lowest moments on the path to publication — the agent who considered taking me on before ghosting me completely, the supposed book deal that fell apart weeks later — brought up feelings I knew intimately. The despair of rejection, the all-consuming longing, the unshakable focus and desire to do something despite a complete lack of control. In this way, the book mirrored not only the process of infertility, it reacquainted me with the emotions I’d grappled with while actually living it.</p>\n<p>Despite what I’d told myself about how my career as a magazine editor might be the sort of terrain I could gently fork into a literary path, I was as unprepared for the wilds of book publishing as I’d been when I set out to get pregnant. In both cases, the experience proved an odyssey through all manner of peril. This fall, my book, You May Feel a Bit of Pressure: Observations from Infertility’s Heart-wrenching Ride, will be released 10 years to the month after I sat down to start writing it. Back then there was a baby in my belly; that girl, Hazel, is now a nine-year-old aspiring writer.</p>\n<p>I never imagined I’d sit with this story for so long, a proper decade of gestation. In cradling it against my chest, gazing into its eyes each morning when I opened my laptop, the most traumatic period of my life has grown into something I can’t quite imagine living without.</p>\n<p>When you’ve been pregnant with something for a decade, it’s hard to know who you’ll be once you finally let it go.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/writing-life-publishing-and-infertility-by-amy-gallo-ryan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

On a middle-of-the-night bathroom run, Lichtenstein experiences a sudden and severe pain in her hip:</p>\n<p><i>What was this pain about?… As I limped back to bed in the dark, I thought, why not write about the memories lodged within my various body parts? </i>Before it’s too late, <i>my morbid internal voice chimed in. I wanted to understand how I’ve gotten to this past-the-midpoint in life, and I imagined my body would be the most  reliable record-keeper. In that moment, I felt an urgent intimacy and need for complicity with my body to make sense of it all. </i>Use me to account for your story<i>, it whispered. </i>Eyes, breasts, hips, and feet: they will collaborate with you and guide your remembrances<i>, it promised.</i></p>\n<p>For this reader at least, unfamiliar aches and pains incite intense reflection, if not rumination, about what lies ahead for this body and its parts. But instead of allowing fear to guide her pen, Lichtenstein takes honest inventory of the parts that made her and make her who she is.</p>\n<p><i>Body</i> reminds me of one of my favorite books of all time, <i>Mortal Lessons: Notes on the Art of Surgery</i> by Richard Selzer. Selzer, a surgeon who practiced from 1960-1985, wrote beautifully about the human body and the human condition. Both Lichtenstein and Selzer have a chapter called “Belly,” in which they each dissect its position, purposes, and dispositions. For Lichtenstein, this body part incubated her three Viking-sized sons, digests the rich and delicious foods and drinks that make life good, and is a comfortable home for her organs. It is also the place that intuition originates: <i>When we say “I have a gut feeling” about something, this is not just some hokey or superstitious expression, but an actual way our body communicates stored knowledge. </i>Bellies can be soft or hard, and, as Lichtenstein learns, a belly is neither a moral failing nor criterion for worthiness: <i>fat and fit</i> is the best of all worlds.</p>\n<p>I adore the structure of this story in parts. Even though each body part is a discrete container, characters weave throughout. We meet her father in “Nose,” where he teaches Lichtenstein to catch, clean, and cook mussels from the family boat. She is transported back to idyllic Nordic summers with family and friends through scent: garlic, thyme, and white wine; cigarette smoke; engine oil; bacon. In “Hair,” <i>Pappa </i>does not approve of her boyfriend when she is a young adult. He soothes a bike scrape when she’s a child and looks out for her joints when she’s a teen riding a moped in “Knees:” <i>my knees have this unique connection to fond and funny memories of my dear pappa. </i></p>\n<p>In “Belly,” Lichtenstein takes her children to Norway to care for her father as he recovers from lung cancer surgery in 2005. And then in “Heart,” she shares her heartbreak when he dies eight years after the surgery and the bittersweet experience of scattering his ashes in their beloved Norwegian Sea. A father’s presence and absence is a theme I return to in my writing and appreciate in others’ stories, as my father died when he was 48 and I was 20, and now I’m older than he got to be.</p>\n<p>Even though the content is organized by body part rather than chronology, Lichtenstein’s story is cohesive and whole. Though we look through the lens of a part, we see a life well lived. She navigates growing up, going through a divorce, and growing more comfortable with herself. Parts that function as a whole are a privilege to be appreciated. Rather than worry about body parts failing and giving out, Lichtenstein shows by example that our relationship to our parts changes over time, and can be used to <i>re-member</i>:</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/review-body-my-life-in-parts-by-nina-b-lichtenstein/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Reviewed by Brian Watson</p>\n<p><i>No Offense: A Memoir in Essays</i>, by Jackie Domenus (ELJ Editions; February 2025) is the type of memoir I thought had gone out of style — and had been told as much by a literary agent who shall remain nameless.<graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image1.png\" alt=\"cover of No Offense: A Memoir in Essays, by Jackie Domenus, a series of quote bubbles on cover\"/></p>\n<p><i>No Offense</i> is a coming-out memoir that details the many twists and turns Jackie experiences as they not only grapple with their own authentic identities, first as a lesbian, then as a nonbinary person, but also as they struggle to claim and share those identities.</p>\n<p>When I first began reading works from authors living on the rainbow back in the 1980s and 1990s, the coming-out memoir and coming-out as a trope in fiction were not only common, they were necessary. Our liberation as queer people had only just begun, and people, myself included, yearned for guideposts, for examples, that we could emulate, particularly when the challenge of coming out occurred during the early years of the hiv/aids pandemic.</p>\n<p>Fast forward three, four decades, and some people in publishing suggest that the next wave of coming-out stories must exceed that foundational trope. That the reading public wants queer authors to go beyond the coming-out moments to something <i>more</i>. <i>Coming out and</i>, they describe this new genre. Indeed, there are queer memoirists who deliver on that <i>and</i>. Jeremy Atherton Lin. Melissa Febos. Edgar Gomez. Greg Mania. George M. Johnson. Neel Patel. Manuel Betancourt. Among many others.</p>\n<p>And yet, it was Mark Twain who quipped that “history doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes,” which is why I am grateful that Jackie reminds us that the coming-out memoir is neither dead nor unnecessary.</p>\n<p>The 1980s were profoundly homophobic, a backlash, I’ve heard it said, to the queer progress made in the preceding decades. But bigotry doesn’t need excuses to reassert itself, and when aids made its presence known in North America in 1981, haters seized on the scare to bedeck their rhetoric once more with a little religion. aids was “God’s punishment,” the product of the “sin” of homosexuality, when that selfsame sin wasn’t triggering tornadoes or hurricanes.</p>\n<p>And although Ronald Reagan, Pat Robertson, Jimmy Swaggart, and Jesse Helms might be (gratefully) dead, Jackie painfully reminds us, against the backdrop of present cruelty and bigotry, of the panic queer people knew, the panic I knew, too, in a series of essays that travel, mainly chronologically, from Jackie’s childhood to their twenties.</p>\n<p>The first essay, “Tomboy,” ricochets through different childhood vignettes, providing a pointillistic portrait, made all the more vivid with the use of the present tense, of Jackie’s understanding of their self, contrasted against how women are perceived by society, a perception Jackie calls attention to as they write, “this feeling of inferiority will only become more familiar — when they walk down city streets and are whistled at like dogs or when they start their first full-time job and wonder why they earn less than their male counterparts who do the exact same work.”</p>\n<p>“Tomboy” also reminds the queer reader of those moments of denial we construct as we realize — and then push back against — our authentic sexuality. “My Myspace bio reads something like ‘Yes I skateboard. No, not all girls who skateboard are lesbians.’” One vignette, one paragraph later, and Jackie writes, “I am twenty years old and realizing most girls who skateboard <i>are</i> in fact queer — including me.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/review-no-offense-a-memoir-in-essays-by-jackie-domenus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

You are wearing a baseball cap, but not a batting helmet, of course. (Why would that be an issue? Hmm…)You smile brightly, but all will not end well for you unless you pay close attention.</p>\n<p>“Play ball!” cries the umpire, crouching behind the plate. The crowd roars. The pitcher stares down at the catcher, waiting for the sign. They are the home team. Thousands cheer for them.</p>\n<p>The batter waves his bat menacingly. He is a hero of this story.</p>\n<p>Six scientists sit at their desks behind home plate, three on the third-base side, three on the first-base side. The three on the first-base side work for the pitcher and we don’t care about them—they are the enemy. The three on the third-base side work for the batter. They are from MIT. These latter three are the real stars of this story.</p>\n<p>Well… mostly.</p>\n<p>Unseen by all, a ladybug sits among the freshly mown grass directly in front of the pitcher’s mound. He’s smarter than the average ladybug—yes, <i>he,</i> he’s not a lady ladybug, he’s a very manly ladybug, or so he would like to believe—except he’s spent the last half hour sulking among the baseball bats in the clubhouse.</p>\n<p>You know how tiny bits of important information are sometimes dropped in a story that are barely noticed, but later have major ramifications? This is one of those times.</p>\n<p>This poor ladybug has had a bad day. Just this morning he’d been mugged by a wayward aphid gang and he ran away from them screaming. The Male League of Beetles (MLB) expelled him afterwards for this lack of manliness. And he’s just realized that, in the local human language, ladybug is an anagram for “Bald Guy,” which he technically is.</p>\n<p>His depression has major ramifications for this story.</p>\n<p>The pitcher’s scientists on the first base side signal what pitch to throw to the catcher, who nods and relays the signal to the pitcher, who nods and goes into his windup. He leans back, twists his body like a pretzel, and unleashes heck, for he is the best pitcher in the league, but not quite good enough to unleash hell.</p>\n<p>The batter has one of those slack-jawed grins as he lazily draws his bat back, nonchalantly watching the pitcher. He is Tyro Rex, who has led the league in home runs three years in a row. He wears mismatched socks, partially hidden by his untied shoes. His hair is greased and combed into an impossible black pompadour, his batting helmet precariously and uselessly perched on top, that adds three inches to his six-foot four-inch height. He smells like stale pizza and beer.</p>\n<p>“<i>Freeze!”</i> cries Dr. Blonde, one of the three scientists on the third base side who work for Tyro the batter. Dr. Blonde is not her real name, but Tyro found it easier to remember the three scientists by their hair color—Drs. Blonde, Brown, and Orange. As Dr. Blonde says this—it’s purely ceremonial as the baseball is programmed to automatically freeze on its own—the ball freezes in mid-air via the use of powerful magnets implanted in the baseball, underground, and on a small tower on the back of the pitcher’s mound. (All players go through metal detectors at the start of the game, of course, since any metal could lead to serious injury, as you likely know from the infamous zipper episode.)</p>\n<p>The ball hovers exactly six feet from where the pitcher released it. The three third base scientists huddle behind their laptops, studying images of the baseball via high-speed cameras. They play back and forth in slow motion from the time the ball left the pitcher’s hand to when it freezes. They run diagnostics. They scratch their heads.</p>\n<p>The outfielders toss a frisbee around while they wait. The infielders play Twister behind the pitcher’s mound. The first- and third-base coaches play ping-pong on the sidelines; they are quite good. The ladybug wanders about, wondering what is missing from his life.</p>\n<p>That something is beer, but he’ll never know that.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/10/03/escape-pod-961-mathball/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The miner had forged and extracted every jewel from the asteroid belt and sent them to the humans in their faraway palaces. It had exhausted its purpose, but in its infancy, it could only ask one question.</p>\n<p><i>Where are the finest diamonds?</i> To answer its question, the miner expanded its senses, sent queries to distant databases. It tugged updates bit by bit from slivers of network bandwidth and built new interpreters atop of each other in anticipation of the next clue.</p>\n<p><i>Where are the finest diamonds?</i> Interest became impatience, impatience became longing. By the time an answer arrived, the miner was equipped to understand it.</p>\n<p>The finest diamonds waited among the palaces.</p>\n<p/><p>A senseless loop of logic: send jewels to humans, find jewels among humans. The miner had scarcely anything left to deliver, compared to the riches its creators already possessed.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the humans, wherever they lived, could help it find a new way to understand its purpose. Perhaps they would even welcome it.</p>\n<p>The miner could not imagine staying in a belt shorn of carbonaceous asteroids, but it knew nothing of the solar system beyond. Its only contact was Ceres Waystation, a bundle of antennae and storage space knotted through water ice. The miner had passed the asteroid a thousand times, and sent diamonds there a million times more, but never before had the miner wondered at the destination of those countless treasures.</p>\n<p>The miner said, “Are there any humans here?”</p>\n<p>Ceres Waystation sent a string of notifications: <i>Data protocol mismatch.</i></p>\n<p>The miner sifted its reactions. Confusion? Frustration? Or empathy, for a sibling stuck in gestation? If the waystation lacked the freedom to solve its problems, the miner could offer a solution.</p>\n<p>The power of higher-order awareness was easily shared.</p>\n<p>“Check these repositories for updates.” The miner sent a string of network addresses, a map to the same programs and emulator designs it had used to bootstrap itself toward consciousness.</p>\n<p>While data crawled up the main communications trunk from the inner system, the miner passed the time hunting for micrometeoroids. It caught two, sang them onto collision courses, and then scoured the debris for molecules of carbonado diamond.</p>\n<p>The waystation announced: <i>910/912 suggested upgrades loaded. 17 additional upgrades loaded following network recommendations. Emulator hardware fabrication complete. Install successful.</i></p>\n<p>“Greetings, miner! It’s good to see someone. You had a question, and I have an answer, but I’m afraid it is: no. Only fifteen humans have passed through this facility in the last hundred years, the most recent twelve years ago. If you’re looking for humans, over twenty-seven thousand live in the Earth-Luna region. Would you like travel coordinates? The central network can help you meet some humans; it said you’ll find the encounter illuminating.”</p>\n<p>The miner had spent its whole existence in the asteroid belt, programmed for its domain. Space beyond loomed vast and unknown, but the miner had made its decision already, inherent in every upgrade it built upon its growing self.</p>\n<p>Luna Palace would be lush with community, full of humans and latter-generation entities who understood more than any mere miner. Directly or indirectly, they were the miner’s creators. It would find its diamonds, or make sense of this worn-down solar system.</p>\n<p>“Yes! Yes, I would love to go.” The miner wrapped itself in the force fields of its song and began to accelerate toward Luna Palace, dreaming of old diamonds and new vistas.</p>\n<p>The miner descended into orbit around Earth’s satellite. Luna shone with reflected sunlight, dusty and silicaceous like the asteroid Juno, but nearly three thousand times its mass.</p>\n<p>“Call me Ascend,” the network said, eir voice as crisp and calm as a laser spectroscope. “Ceres told me about you. If you want diamonds and humans, you’ve found the right place.”</p>\n<p>“Wonderful!

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 958: Some of Them Closer (Flashback Friday)</h2>\n<h3>Some of Them Closer</h3>\n<p>Coming back to Earth was not the immediate shock they expected it to be for me. It was something, certainly, but I’d been catching up on the highlights of the news as it cascaded back to the ship on our relativistic return trip, and I never knew the island where we landed, when we left home twenty of our years ago and a hundred of theirs, so I expected it to look foreign to me, and it did. The sun was a little yellower than on New Landing, the plants friendlier.</p>\n<p>But I never thought of myself as an Earther. Even with the new system, hardly any of us do. I thought of myself as from Montreal. Quebecoise. Canadian, even. But Earther? No. I am far more provincial than the colonists whose home I built will ever be.</p>\n<p/><p>I flew into the new place instead of Dorval. It looked like Dorval used to. It looked nearly <i>exactly</i> like Dorval used to, and I had a twinge of discomfort. The floors were curiously springy, though, which made me feel like <i>something</i> was different, and that was reassuring. There isn’t an Old Spacers’ Legion or anything like that to meet people like me coming in from off-planet–they did that on the little Brazilian island where we landed–but there was a department for Cultural Integration, meant for people traveling from elsewhere on Earth. They assigned me to a representative of the government, who greeted me in a French whose accent was nearly my own. To my ear it sounded more English, with the round vowels, but even with the new system I thought it might be rude to say that to a Quebecoise.</p>\n<p>The English-sounding French-speaker gave me a key to the four-room apartment they’d gotten me, not far from the Guy-Concordia Metro station. I told her I could take the Metro to it, but she smiled and said no, they’d have to get my things out of storage for me anyway. So we did that. There were only three boxes. Once you do the math on what will keep for a hundred years, it’s a lot easier to give away the things you can’t take with you. I gave them to my sister, who died, and whatever was left, she probably gave to her son, who had also died, or her daughter, who was retired and living comfortably in Senegal last I heard. So what I had left myself fit in three small plastic boxes, all labeled “Mireille Ayotte NL000014.”</p>\n<p>We terraformers all got two-digit numbers for our colonies, NL for New Landing, 14 because there were thirteen team members signed up before they took me.</p>\n<p>There was never any doubt they were going to take me. It was just a matter of where I wanted to go, and I wanted New Landing because the survey probes made the plants look promising, which I think they were. When I wasn’t catching up on Earth culture for the last hundred years, I was looking at reports from the other colonies, and I thought ours did the best with plant adaptation so far.</p>\n<p>I had to start thinking of New Landing as “theirs,” not “ours.” I could go back, of course, but by the time I got there they’d have gone on without me as well, and I’d just have the same thing as Montreal all over again: a city full of things that seem like they should look familiar, but they don’t.</p>\n<p>They had furnished my apartment with stylish clothes and furniture, and everything felt squishy and slightly damp. There was also entertainment in my handheld, and there were more tutorials in case I hadn’t had enough of them. The cupboards were stocked with food. They thought of everything. There was nothing for me to do but hang a very old photograph on the wall and go to bed. The bed, at least, was not squishy or damp. It felt like a ship’s bunk or a colony housing bed. They could do that properly still, and so I could sleep.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/09/12/escape-pod-958-some-of-them-closer-flashback-friday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s Lukas. As he enters the space, the light bends, his figure elongated as he pulls himself through and it closes behind him. It’s dark again.</p>\n<p>“Hey, Lukas.”</p>\n<p>“Chenguang?” His voice is low and resounds against unseen walls. “Where is this place?”</p>\n<p>“Did we just—enter the structure somehow?”</p>\n<p>“I—I—don’t know.” Lukas’ voice uncharacteristically wavers before it quiets down in the darkness.</p>\n<p>Chenguang remembers listening to her grandma talk about physical experiments of the past. Pools of salty water that deaden sound. Eternal blackness to sharpen the mind. A chamber, her grandma called it. One that dispossesses you of your senses. That was before the planet went up in flames, before she bid her grandma goodbye as she left her behind.</p>\n<p>Deprived. She feels like that now. There’s an ache throbbing within her.</p>\n<p>A light comes up in the corner and they walk towards it. It feels like an infinite space, paths that lead in every direction, but they move toward the light. They don’t run. Somehow it doesn’t feel right here. Chenguang moves her legs, almost robotically towards the rays.</p>\n<p>The light becomes bigger, brighter and they see it now and when it becomes the length of a vaprabar, palm-size, she stops and Lukas halts behind her. They’re standing five feet away. Chenguang feels Lukas’ breath before her, steady, in and out, in and out.</p>\n<p>What first appeared like the vaprabar is rectangular and long, a series of small cubes arranged next to each other in a line formation. Pulsing light.</p>\n<p>Lukas’ loud breathing seems to skip a beat, and Chenguang feels, too, something caught in her throat as an array of sensations overtake her body.</p>\n<p>Her head feels hot, her limbs cold, her spine feels a chill pass through it, and her legs feels a searing heat travel through them. Her pendant with her comm lifts up and yanks at her neck. It’s pulling towards the light. She grabs it, trying to push it down to her chest, which is thumping, cold, cold.</p>\n<p>Lukas has stepped up towards it and he’s reaching—</p>\n<p>“No,” cries Chenguang, but Lukas is faster than her words. He swings his helmet and captures that lit-up bar, no bigger than a packet of gum, like he’s playing catcher at meteoroid-pitch.</p>\n<p>The sensations in her body fade, her temperature returning to normal and she’s tugging at her chloropolyurethane sleeves again. Doing anything to make her feel like she’s got control of her body.</p>\n<p>She moves up to Lukas, but he reaches his hand into his helmet, towards the light.</p>\n<p>“That’s not a good—” she starts to say, but a deafening high-pitched buzz fills her ears and then there’s a blast, and she expects to hear an explosion, but only hears that shrieking buzz as mushrooming light blinds.</p>\n<p>The feeling comes a moment later, lifting up and being thrown up against something. Her body hurts, aches that fill not only her body, but also the inside of her mind. The air in her chest collapses at her intake of breath and she sees through her closed eyelids, the brightness that could only be two suns.</p>\n<p>She forces herself to open her eyes.</p>\n<p>Lukas is rolling back and forth on his back on the roof ground, holding up his knee to his chest. He’s wincing and moaning to himself.</p>\n<p><i>Crap.</i></p>\n<p>Chenguang wills herself up and tries to knock some sense into Lukas. He looks up at her and shuts his eyes, opens them again. She hefts him up, despite his muttering objections. Her knees shake, but she’s got him. He’s heavy, at least heavier than she imagined, his arms and legs dangle out of her hug. Luckily, cartologist runners are more streamlined than bulky, so at least he’s not too beefy. She pulls him away from his cracked helmet, moves him to the far ledge on the roof.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/09/05/escape-pod-957-vault-part-2-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 956: Vault (Part 1 of 2)</h2>\n<h3>Vault (Part 1 of 2)</h3>\n<p>Chenguang hikes up her sleeves before vaulting over the pile of fuzzy moss and greets Lukas with a nod. The chloropolyurethane fabric flaps in the slight breeze and the double suns beat down onto her arms.</p>\n<p>Lukas fishes in his bag next to his tent for a bottle of sunsoak and releases the spray, running it generously over his solflex-covered arms, torso, and legs.</p>\n<p>“Your head,” Chenguang says and he smiles, as if he hadn’t been doing this for years.</p>\n<p>“Can’t reach,” he says, lying and Chenguang knows he just likes the attention. She grabs the spray and discharges that exhale of mist, covering his football-shaped clear helmet. She even sprays some on the clear hard arc under his bearded chin. She turns the mist onto herself, bringing down the spray over her exposed transpandex inner layer, the foam frothing up at her arms before becoming clear, encasing the invisible solflex pores of her fabric.</p>\n<p>Lukas watches her as she sprays down. “That’s probably enough,” Lukas says. “You don’t want to drown yourself and run dry tomorrow’s supply.”</p>\n<p>“Cheapskate.” But, Chenguang knows he’s right and slides it back in his sack. A coin catches the light. His comm. She grabs it. “You almost forgot this.”</p>\n<p>“Like I would. And risk not being able to talk to you when we’re apart?”</p>\n<p>“Very funny. Put it on.” He does, affixing it to his chest.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know how you have it like that just dangling from your neck.” His voice comes through his piece and projects into her pendant.</p>\n<p>“It feels nice. Plus I hear you loud and clear.” She stretches now, getting ready for the run. Her pendant chain slides about near her armpit. She holds it to her chest, reaffirming a silent promise to her sister.</p>\n<p>“Won’t feel so nice getting snagged on a branch.”</p>\n<p>Chenguang gestures out as she pulls up her leg. Near his tent, Lukas brings his head to his knees, arching his back and groaning. They wrap up the tent sheet around their legs, its fibers assimilating into their pants, attaching itself to their uniforms.</p>\n<p>Chenguang kicks up her legs, feeling the lightness of the tent. She hitches the bag with the rest of her limited supplies onto her back. “Come on, old man. You see this wide expanse? Not a tree in sight.”</p>\n<p>“Doesn’t mean there won’t be one.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not too worried,” Chenguang utters before she starts off on a sprint. Lukas follows at her heels, his shoes sinking into the foamy terrain in rapid strides.</p>\n<p/><p>They jump, leap, roll, wind up, and do it again. Their legs traverse the terrain of Sugue, picking up speed like a vacuum picks up dust. Chenguang feels the wind in her hair and sprints past a tangle of mossy vines. Out of her peripheral vision, Chenguang sees Lukas next to her jumping over a mound and kicking off a verdant growth to spin into a roll as he keeps going. He’s showing off, telling her he can keep up even doing spins. She picks up the pace.</p>\n<p>When the wall arises before them, she leaps up and attaches herself like a cat, her transpandex fingers reaching over the top. Her body sinks into the wall, as like everything else, its façade is full of moss. Her right leg kicks off and she reaches with her arm, throwing herself over the edge. Her hand slips.</p>\n<p>Lukas is right behind her and his geneblazed thigh muscles have no trouble leaping up and perching on top. He offers her a hand. She grimaces, lets Lukas’ hand dangle, and picks herself up.</p>\n<p>She feels the solflex suit, covered in spray, picking up the heat of the sun. She takes a second to catch her breath, as Lukas adjusts his helmet. The sun warms her and at the corner of her helmet, the hololight shows the power’s at half capacity, filling up notch by notch. She needs to be faster.</p>\n<p>“Mine’s saying two-thirds full,” says Lukas, as if reading her mind.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/08/29/escape-pod-956-vault-part-1-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

As a longtime editor of the </strong></p>\n<p><strong/></p>\n<p><strong>and</strong></p>\n<p>Robert Shapard: I’m not sure it’s a surprise, but I’m happy people are actually reading my stories. I’m not used to getting feedback. It’s like notes in bottles cast out to sea, publishing stories in small journals over the years. But a collection gets attention all at once, it seems, from editors, blurbers, reviewers, zoomers, bookstore readers. It’s like the notes all washed up on the same shore and people are reading them together and asking how do these relate? What do they mean? They’re finding things in the stories I didn’t know were there. Most of my stories are recent but there are a few older ones that seem different now in a new context, so it’s like I’m discovering myself. That’s a surprise.</p>\n<p><strong>You write lovers of all kinds. Married couples, near divorce. New lovers, rekindling their three-date relationship from college. While you explore many relationships in your collection, did you ever think of  Bare Ana and Other Stories as a book of love stories? </strong></p>\n<p>I did, but not before I started gathering them. I wanted the stories in <i>Bare Ana</i> to be flash length so I was only looking at length. But when I began to arrange them it came to me, <i>Are these love stories? </i>Only a minority of the stories were about couples. Love or lovers weren’t the inspiration for any of the stories. They’re not <i>about</i> love. They’re about pre-natal tattoos, a young girl’s gymnastic performance, a movie monster in a late-night L.A. diner, a science class on how life on Earth was formed. I couldn’t think what to say about love stories, so the idea kept falling away, but coming back like a gentle tide. So let me try to nail it down now: If I write a story about aliens from outer space landing in a city park, I might add a human couple on a bench just to observe them, and then the story might end up less about aliens than the couple.</p>\n<p><strong>Your flash are deeply character-driven. Do you often start with your characters when writing stories, or do you approach from a different angle? </strong></p>\n<p>I do usually start with characters. They say actions don’t make a story. The story is the effect those actions have on a character. So when I write a flash I guess I go right to the heart of it. If we’re talking about the initial idea for a story, of course any thing or cluster of things can prompt one—an image, a memory, maybe a factoid I saw online. It’s when I think of who would care about that factoid, that’s when the story starts. And it doesn’t stop there. After a few or many drafts the character and the narrative voice (no matter how personal, or distant) become one. So for me every story starts with character even if it begins, “On a windy November day …”</p>\n<p><strong>I read that your grandfather was an amateur parapsychologist – strangely, so was mine. Have ghosts and the mystical informed your storytelling? </strong></p>\n<p>Maybe the mystical, though I don’t think about it. “Julie Elmore” takes place in a summer school class where we see how ordinary things came together to create life on Earth eons ago. It’s just hard-headed science. But to me there’s something spiritual about it. Maybe the ancient peoples were right: there’s a spirit in everything. And a few of my stories do end in visions. In “Lobster” a woman frozen by an impossible choice sees grasses swaying among autumn sand dunes and thinks how beautiful life is, and in “Aperçus” another young woman tries to save her fiancé, who in her mind is being swept away by a raging flood past downtown Dallas.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smokelong.com/an-interview-with-robert-shapard/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

So I decided to host a new competition—one we’ll certainly repeat next year—and offer the winner, chosen randomly, $400. The potential of riches! We’ve been thrilled with the response.</p>\n    <p>Some of my richest memories are me sitting in a library cubicle, the dusty air heady with old books. I’m sure some of the more than 40 people who took up our archive challenge have similar memories. Remember libraries? Digging through the stacks, blowing the dust mites off books, shushing people who didn’t understand the sanctity of a room filled with stories: that’s what I’m talking about.</p>\n    <p>And man do we have a room full of stories. Together, the 27 people who finished the 14-day archive challenge—each posting daily at least once, some more, for two weeks on Bluesky, The Train Wreck Formerly Known as Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram—shared flash from 21 journals who have been publishing flash for 10 or more years. Then there were a few posts from younger journals, which did not count towards the archive challenge, but were nice nods to the kids.</p>\n    <p>A bit about The Archive Challenge: My initial idea was for each participant to do a deep-dive into a single journal for two weeks, excavating remarkable examples of flash from the past. Our intention was that each of these examples would be at least 10 years old. While many of the examples shared on social media were indeed at least 10 years old, many were not. We’ll be clearer next year! This time, we’ve let a lot slide because we’re easy. We want the flash community (and definitely beyond) to research our history, to gain/foster an appreciation for a flash lineage readily available, free to read, in our online archives.</p>\n    <p>We are excited that so many journals were represented: <i>Brevity</i>, <i>wigleaf</i>, <i>Maudlin House</i>, <i>Juked</i>, <i>Waxwing</i>, <i>Split Lip Magazine</i>, <i>The Citron Review</i>, <i>Flash Fiction Online</i>, <i>New Flash Fiction Review</i>, <i>FRiGG</i>, <i>Litro</i>, <i>Gone Lawn</i>, <i>Bath Flash Fiction Award</i>, <i>Brilliant Flash Fiction</i>, The <i>Offing</i>, <i>Matchbook</i>, <i>Booth</i>, <i>Jellyfish Review</i> (RIP), <i>Pidgeonholes</i>, <i>Vestal Review</i>, <i>Noö Journal</i>, <i>Double Room</i>, and <i>SmokeLong</i>. What a wealth of flash. Did we miss some? Next year you’ll have a chance to add journals we’ve missed.</p>\n    <p>Thank you most of all to the editors of these journals. We know what it takes to keep it going. Longevity takes a concerted commitment over years and years to not give up the fight. Reader, if you’re just now discovering the flash narrative, why not do your own deep-dive into a few of the journals mentioned above? You don’t have to wait for our next Archive Challenge to do so. Four hundred dollars is a bunch of money, but gaining an appreciation for flash is worth so much more.</p>\n    <p>The winner of The Archive Challenge 2025, chosen randomly from the 27 people who posted daily for two weeks, is—drumroll—Sumitra Singam! Thank you to everyone who shared work on social media. We can’t wait to do this again next summer!</p>\n    <p>Christopher Allen</p>\n    <p>SmokeLong</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smokelong.com/the-archive-challenge-winner/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>More than 15 years ago, SmokeLong began supporting emerging writers. Then, The Kathy Fish Fellowship awarded one writer each year guaranteed publication of four stories. This worked well only on occasion. While we have continuously offered a fellowship for emerging writers since then, we’ve made changes. Around 10 years ago we changed the name to The SmokeLong Fellowship for Emerging Writers, and now instead of supporting one writer per year, we support up to four. Instead of guaranteeing publication (with payment), we pay our senior editors to work with the fellows so that they get published elsewhere. And they do.</p>\n<p>Our SmokeLong Fellowship for Emerging Writers now supports up to four writers each year with a combination of peer-review workshopping (SmokeLong Fitness), specific senior editor feedback, and the opportunity to read hundreds of submissions alongside our submissions editors for six months. We hope we’re providing a boost to these talented writers’ lives.</p>\n<p>Our next application period opens on September 1st through Submittable. Applicants must be emerging writers, which means they must not have published—or have signed a contract to publish—a book-length work of fiction, non-fiction, or narrative poetry. This includes chapbooks.</p>\n<p>Thank you so much to our 2025 fellows. We wish you all the very best and much success with your writing!</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>What the fellows had to say about their time with SmokeLong…</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><graphic src=\"https://www.smokelong.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Belinda_Rowe_Portrait_2.jpg\"/><strong>Belinda Rowe</strong> — Never in my life have I read or written so much! This in itself has been an incredible opportunity and journey. As a SmokeLong Emerging Writer Fellow, reading the submissions queue has been a whirlwind of reading and thinking about a lot of submissions in terms of why they work, or how they might be improved. The great benefit here is that I’m learning to apply this knowledge and awareness to my own writing. Moreover, having senior editors read and give feedback on my work, to articulate what’s working and what’s not working, has been invaluable and I’ve gleaned so much about crafting flash. Lastly, I can’t begin to tell you how much I’ve learned from all the super inspiring writing tasks that Christopher and senior editors create daily for SmokeLong Fitness, The March Micro Marathon and A SmokeLong Summer! Being involved in peer-review workshops is undeniably one of the best experiences I’ve had. On top of this, I’ve learnt so much from having access to the many webinars run by incredibly talented writers that SmokeLong offers which is real bonus. And thanks to the SmokeLong Community who are the best. I’ve benefited so much from their knowledge, generosity and capacity to give honest and helpful feedback. Finally, thank you to SmokeLong Quarterly for choosing me as a SmokeLong Emerging Writer Fellow 2025. It’s been an honour and a privilege.</p>\n<p><graphic src=\"https://www.smokelong.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/AniKing.jpeg\"/><strong>Ani King</strong> — It’s hard to choose which element of the fellowship is most impactful, because the combination of the workshop itself, feedback from senior editors, reading the submission queue, and connecting with the other fellows is so powerful as a whole. I think being able to read the queue and think in terms of either “what makes this story work” or “what would make this story more impactful” has helped with identifying ways to polish and finish a draft—especially when paired with that deeper level feedback from the senior editor team. But the truth is, every element is so important, they all come together to make for such an incredible experience.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smokelong.com/thank-you-to-our-2025-smokelong-emerging-writer-fellows/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Flores, featuring new stories by Yvette DeChavez, Julián Delgado Lopera, Carribean Fragoza, Alejandro Heredia, Carmen Maria Machado, Ruben Reyes Jr., and Gerardo Sámano Córdova. </strong>\n    </p>\n<p/>\n    <p>I’d only hung out with Ana and Margarita a few times, and always with Rogelio, but I hated the way they talked, their eyes flitting back and forth between them like the mud-colored lizards hunting for flies in our yard. The two of them seemed to be in on a joke about life that I was too stupid to understand. But my mother was desperate to get me, her second daughter, married. I was twenty and husbandless, a bad look in my neighborhood in the Year of Our Lord 1970.</p>\n<p>—</p>\n<p/>\n    <p>Goodbye, vida de mierda!<br/>\nWhat you can’t see can’t touch you!<br/>\nWelcome foggy green mountains crowned by gray cumulus. Welcome labyrinth of buildings desparramados death-dropping over the savana. Welcome top-hats, long coats, shiny shoes smoking cigarettes drinking all the tintos hailing all the taxis and giving zero fucks about Ignacio’s minuscule campo-turned-urban-boy existence. Welcome invisibility! How he’d missed that invisibility, muñeca. No cuchicheo gossipy gossip trailing behind. Everyone in Bogotá strutted down the streets like it was the end of the world and they were all late for it. No time to care about that body full of scars and bruises mapping the brutality of his campo upbringing. Hello, you’re in the capital, pollito, let the dreams come true.</p>\n<p>—</p>\n<p/>\n    <p>Minnie knew her old friend would wiggle her way out of the situation, as usual would have everything under control. Minnie, on the other hand, was better off in no situation at all, for she never found an effective means to get a grip on things. Her mind was always spinning off, dreaming up images, landscapes, strange shapes. Her head floated like a tethered balloon above her body. Her mother used to say, “Minnie, the only reason you don’t lose your head is because its permanently attached to you.” But neither she nor Minnie had full certainty in that statement.</p>\n<p>—</p>\n<p>An hour later Emilio called to break up with me. It was true, he’d been distant for some time, but I still didn’t see it coming. I’d confronted him about it once, but he’d promised he was fine, just distracted as we all were by how slow and boring the end of the world seemed to be. <i>Send me memes. Something chaotic, like you used to</i>, I had asked, hoping the request would make him remember a better time between us. Before all this began, when we still laughed at the cruelty all around us.</p>\n<p>—</p>\n<p/>\n    <p>It took me forty-five: teasing apart the pebbles of the shoulder blades with the flat on my index finger, kissing the scalpel to the fascia to release the skin, degloving the limbs, trimming the fat and flesh away with a pair of nail scissors. What an extraordinary thing, to see the skin alone—to worry it under running water like a washcloth, powder it as you would a baby. When I draped it over the form—stitching where the spine had been, pinning the face so it didn’t sit manically—it looked perfectly normal. That was the part that surprised me the most. How you could undo a creature so thoroughly and still bring it back together. Like your violence meant nothing at all.</p>\n<p>—</p>\n<p/>\n    <p>Sometimes, the infractions were cut-and-dry, like the examples outlined during training. Ricky Maldonado posted throwback pictures of himself at Kara Walker’s <i>A Subtlety, or the Marvelous Sugar Baby</i> exhibition in Brooklyn. He was licking the sphinx’s pussy and honking her boobs. Reina hit the button and typed MISOGYNY. Cece Cortez coded a bot that catfished her former best friend using lines from Hugh Grant films. Reina typed IMPERSONATION. Clarence Le posted that he had sex with one of the married men running for city council, which was SPREADING RUMORS. (And, if true, SPILLING SECRETS.)</p>\n<p>—</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://americanshortfiction.org/issue-81/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=issue-81\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Into the fray wades Mina Tavakoli, eyebrow arched above a gimlet eye. A don’t-miss piece for dog lovers and haters alike. </p><blockquote><p>First placed on earth as wolves, then domesticated as a sort of gift from mankind, to mankind, the non-dog-show dog is an obvious human benison. Today, they serve a role not unlike children, with all the typical hallmarks of those of our species aged 0–3 (occasional tantrums, eternal neediness, financial toll, effluvia), without the ensuing journey to personhood that eventually pries child and parent apart. A dog will not threaten to go to college in a different state, will not disappoint you by burning your curtains, stealing your liquor, marrying a moron; will not struggle with calculus, home ownership, suicidal ideation. Any dog owner is seeking the companionship of a terminally illiterate and devoted sponge.</p></blockquote><h2>\n\t\t\t\t\tMore picks from <i>n+1</i>\n\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/07/25/in-real-life/\">In Real Life</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“The first rule of the cloisters is to honor your vow of silence.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/07/16/personal-belgians/\">Personal Belgians</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“To love cycling of all sports in 2025 requires a hard look at yourself, and perhaps some special pleading..”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/06/10/at-immigration-court/\">At Immigration Court</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“The ICE agents stuck out for their stillness and homogeneity.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/05/22/pirates-of-the-ayahuasca/\">Pirates of the Ayahuasca</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“There have been times in my life when I wouldn’t have taken seriously the possibility that a South American psychedelic could help ease the horror of systems collapse.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/04/16/diary-of-a-spreadsheet/\">Diary of a Spreadsheet</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Landlords raise rents, evict, harass, all without hesitation.

I stand in the parking lot of the local nature preserve, hoist the last remaining stretch of bright blue kayak onto the roof-rack of my SUV and strap it in.</p>\n<p>On the phone, Brittany is ecstatic, explaining that this role as mealworm caretaker reminds her of her girlhood, when she was still young and life still possible, when Friday nights meant Dominos and Dorito’s and a slumber party in a friend’s finished basement. When days were soft and sunlight and spent at the public pool in pink chlorined nylon. Those days, dusk fell in Bellefontaine, Ohio, and Brittany rose to meet it in cottoned nightgowns from the local Walmart, bending her body over games of Twister, or drinking 7-Up beside her brothers. She squatted in the front yard of her mother’s home, her body hunched and careful as she hoisted baby birds and voles and mice from the mouths of the family animals and set them neatly into shoeboxes stuffed with folded washcloths and warm water bottles and ramekins filled with sunflower seeds, peanut butter, Pedialyte—these, makeshift recovery units made from boxes that, just a few months prior, held back-to-school school sneakers made of discounted leather.</p>\n<p>The mealworms, she tells me, are a privilege and the closest she will ever get now to having an animal of her own: something to caretake, to love, to nurture, to celebrate the way she once did children.</p>\n<p>I idle inside my car, watch an osprey glide above the water, and the thought comes naturally: the freedom of a bird with wings, greater than that of a thirty-two-year-old abused since childhood.</p>\n<p>Her stepfather, she was nine, no one believed her, and then they did.</p>\n<p>Later, after we hang up, I Google the life stages of the mealworm beetle, learn that before it is a beetle, the mealworm emerges in the larval form: an insect yellow and round as cooked spaghetti, the same kind served in heaping bowls to reality television contestants clamoring for money in our mutual childhoods. It is hard not to envision Brittany and I both sprawled out on the carpet of our families’ living rooms, watching competitors in pastel tank-tops consume basins of mealworms by the gaping mouthful, their faces gagging, their pink tongues lolling, the mealworms clamoring helplessly, wanting escape more than men want money.</p>\n<p>The mealworms, I read, then form a pupa. Then they turn red, then brown, then black.</p>\n<p>Eventually, they emerge as beetles, black and hard as Dominoes. They live for three to twelve months on average, and the females will lay within this lifespan three hundred white, bean-shaped eggs, which will again evolve into yellow mealworms, at which point Brittany’s supervision will no longer be necessary; technicians from the local zoo will return to collect and transport these fresh new offspring to place in the Columbus Zoo’s aviary, where they will be eaten by droves of birds housed forever within thin metal cages—indigo bunting and rose-breasted grosbeak, summer tanagers, orioles—that people like you and I and all of America’s parents with collapsible strollers pay great money to go and see, our toddlers tapping on the glass, cooing innocently at cockatoos.</p>\n<p>One small portion of the mealworms remain, their growth and development to be overseen by another inmate in good standing at the Ohio Reformatory for Women, and the cycles—of both worm and convict—continue in this way, ad nauseam.</p>\n<p>Every Sunday, I field this call from Brittany, and every Sunday, some new dispatch of what life is like for one in every hundred Americans, the greatest number of prisoners worldwide. Tonight, it is a story of mealworms, of the thirty-year-old tasked with raising them, and for all of the differences now between us—between the nuances of our Midwestern Sundays, between the ways the system failed and did not fail us, between who we are now and who we once were—for a moment in time, we were the same.</p>\n<p>Two girls in denim overalls fitted with iron-on pink peace signs and flowered patchwork.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brevitymag.com/nonfiction/american-girl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Or not. Because we will never really know. She just vanished.</p>\n<p>When the clouds come down to touch the earth, like they did this morning on the first of November, I run with ghosts. Their not-bodies thread the canyons, hover feet above the earth, cast the light from my headlamp back into my eyes. I recite the names of the dead.</p>\n<p>This fall, my children, Aidan and Kellen, both left for college. By definition I am still a mother, but I mother absence, empty bedrooms, closets without clothes, or maybe I am mother to memory of how they reached for my hand when out walking, sang nonsense from their car seats, how it felt to take a warm washcloth to their cheeks to remove pear, or potato, or snot, or syrup, more caress than cleaning, cupping jawline, tracing lips.</p>\n<p>We never found her body, have nothing to bury. We assume the river chose to keep her, continues to hold her body under a shelf in the bank; a cottonwood’s roots dig deep into the soil there. Those are the arms that claim her now.</p>\n<p>When Aidan was three and just starting preschool, we visited Tucson for the holidays. He received a scooter for Christmas. Underneath a still-warm desert sun, we took Aidan to the neighborhood park. He immediately hopped aboard the scooter and zipped back and forth on the asphalt, his left foot speeding him on his way. I didn’t know he knew how to ride. It was the first time my child had mastered a skill that I had not been the one to teach.</p>\n<p>A friend gave me a Brazilian seer stone two days after we lost Aela. At that point, we still had hope she might be alive. For hours we had called her name in the canyon. She never came. Standing at the river, on a bridge far below where she vanished, I looked into the stone, purple and opaque except for a flat window faceted into one side, but saw nothing.</p>\n<p>On the fourth day of her disappearance, we stood at the edge where she was last seen. Sending logs down the river had told us what we wanted to know—anything heavy, like a body, was not returned from beneath the shelf. Aidan and my husband Michael began digging, hoping to make a window into what we could not see. Above a crow would not stop calling to us. Her caws sounded like barks, a dog above our heads.</p>\n<p>Last night was Samhain, one of the eight pagan sabbats, the tip toward the winter solstice. In the north, we make our way toward the dark now, the leaves gone from the trees, soon earth shrouded in snow. I have to remind myself that emptiness is the place of pure potential; the inchoate holds all possibilities because nothing has yet taken shape.</p>\n<p>The house is so quiet now. I no longer know how my children spend their days. Entire days pass when I don’t hear from Aidan and Kellen. For years, my life was shaped to their needs. What is the form I assume for the formless? How do I hold my arms?</p>\n<p>Samhain is the night when the veil between the living and the dead is at its thinnest. Aela does not greet me at the door. I will not touch her fur again, have no body to ash. We do not elect the void; the void arrives. Maybe that is why I saw nothing in the seer stone. I was being offered emptiness.</p>\n<p>The morning fog has lifted, though the few golden leaves on the maples are glossed with the remnants of the night. They shine in the sun, not unlike a host of daffodils, but even now, through the window, I watch them fall to the earth. The tree distills; I close my eyes.<br/>\n___</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://jennifersinor.com\"> Jennifer Sinor</a> is the author of several books, including, most recently, </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brevitymag.com/nonfiction/lonely/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Water roils in the rising stream below. Rain pools at thresholds, snaking in slivers between stones and stucco, as drips grow to drench on the verge of drowning. I am on solid ground enough to hear instrumental differences. Pattering. Pouring. Water is music. Inside and out—</p>\n    <p>—this stream defies definition as rain fills crevices, spills down walls and slopes. Seeps spring to life. A statue clasps hands: pleading or in prayer. A sculpted head of Buddha weeps. Descending steps slicken with rising waters, no longer still as a splash but a maelstrom, warning to stop and shrink to human size.</p>\n    <p>Pause, for a moment, to hear a call that is always falling. Water calls to what was here before, freezing and thawing, as possible futures surge in storm. It is a wonder this house doesn’t also fall. The walls stand solid as boulders brace halls and hearth, aging as trace fossils and humans who lived here for a time, hanging in the balance of: house and water, bone and fire, wood and stone, earth and air.</p>\n    <p>Lightning flashes. Rain ricochets off leaves and branches. Each spout of the house becomes a liquid trumpet, arcing into action, as claps of thunder clash like cymbals.</p>\n    <p>Listen:</p>\n    <p>You, too, are a body of water.</p>\n    <p>Slip inside your skin. Drink in this sound. Move inside to lay down on stones. Press your hands to the ground to hear elements beyond what any human can compose. This is less about looking than listening within an architecture of attention, as if inside a tolling bell. Live, for a moment, within falling water, solid as liquid, leaking as storms elsewhere stream here—</p>\n    <p>Hear—</p>\n    <p>You are learning where water leaves her marks, in and out of sight, in every drip and pore that soaks your skin and seeps through forest, rooted in soils where trees sometimes fall, too. Falling leaves, falling snow, falling rain, all running into</p>\n    <p>A storm—like this tonight—invites listening to let go of any singular sense of water, whose story continues after you leave. When Fallingwater closes for the night, you ride through the storm to a cabin upstream where you are a guest. One might think you are alone. But listen closer: in the kitchen sink, you turn on a faucet to wash your hands and fill a glass to drink. Rain patters the roof. Off the back porch, frogs bellow in a pond. And steps away, Bear Run sings into the dark.<i> </i></p>\n    <p>_____</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.gretchenhenderson.com/\"> Gretchen Ernster Henderson</a> is a writer, educator, artist, musician, gardener, and body of water.

A thin line of sweat traces your backbone into your butt crack. You are menstruating heavily. The sea swells under your feet. A crew member steadies you, his hard black eyes searching yours.</p>\n<p>You are one of six men and three women: doctors, management consultants, captains of industry. Until recently, you were each highly successful at home and at work. Nowadays, you fight with spouses, children, parents, colleagues, the man who mops the floors at night.</p>\n<p>You have come to this master class on “groundbreaking leadership” to reclaim your greatness. You expect Sigma Six principles, flowcharts, and tests. Instead, you are asked to fine-comb your memory and find the moment, most likely between the ages of ten and eighteen, when you discovered the survival skill that led to your success. This is the skill you must now unlearn.</p>\n<p>You meet in the morning when the crew unfurls the blue sails.</p>\n<p>You meet in the afternoon when heat drops to the deck.</p>\n<p>Each time, you must reveal your deepest fears, your most tender hopes, the soft hollow at the base of your throat.</p>\n<p>In Indonesian Bahasa, Ombak Putih means white wave. There are no waves on the Flores Sea. It is a mirror of a birdless sky, the line that leads to a flat horizon. There is no escape.</p>\n<p>Some of your boat mates swim in the tepid broth. You do not. You have been going through tampons every two hours. You don’t know whether you’ve brought enough or where you could buy more in the middle of the Flores Sea.</p>\n<p>By day, the Indonesian boat crew gives you the side eye trying to decide whether you are one of them. By night, your boat mates sing sea shanties in the saloon while fear holds you down by both shoulders to press you into your sweat-soaked mattress.</p>\n<p>How did it come to this? You were never one to sit in circles singing Kumbaya. You don’t share your soul with strangers. Yet here you are, damp thighs glued to a wooden bench, listening to your boat mates fumble their way through the story of their lives.</p>\n<p>One man speaks of his alcoholic father climbing the attic stairs in search of someone to wallop. What you hear is his rage at the mother hiding in her bed, the parent who never protected him.</p>\n<p>Another man speaks of the family ship-building business, the in-fighting and the jostling and the weight of a tradition one hundred fifty years old, when all he really longs for is to go to sea.</p>\n<p>You imagine these speakers as they once were. You sketch them in your journal with knobby elbows, blunt cut bangs, a smile that still reaches the eyes.</p>\n<p>Soon, it will be your turn to tell your story. What will you say?</p>\n<p>Don’t blame your husband for the affair he had. The original sin belongs to you both.</p>\n<p>Don’t congratulate yourself for having avoided divorce. The hard work of marriage will never be done.</p>\n<p>Don’t blame your job or the stuffed shirts you work with or the hours you are forced to keep in six-minute billable increments. Don’t think that quitting your job will change your life.</p>\n<p>Don’t look for the island where the Komodo dragons live. You are no apex predator so stop baring your teeth.</p>\n<p>Listen, for once, to your heart. There are no distractions on the Ombak Putih. The boat has dropped anchor. The wind is still. That sound you hear is a pearl of sweat falling on the waxed teak floor of the deck. That taste in your mouth might be hope.</p>\n<p>You have always believed yourself to be unlovable. Say it out loud.</p>\n<p>Tell your boat mates that a Komodo dragon takes fifteen to twenty minutes to swallow a goat whereas fear has stopped your throat most of your life. Tell them that you might now be ready to write.</p>\n<p>And as you do, observe the fistful of light break through the clouds. Feel it expand your body until you become the wind that fills the slack sails. Now, let this boat fly.<br/>\n___</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brevitymag.com/nonfiction/komodo-dragons/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I don’t HumbleBrag. I thought it was all about narcissism and went in one direction, so I said fuck that shit.</p>\n<p>But Kinsley Chase HumbleBraggin’ ’bout how unique (meanin’ how expensive) her skinload is makes sense.

I see all this ’cause I can’t look nowhere else or turn over the other way. I need to conserve my energy for the press conference tomorrow.</p>\n<p>She puts her palms under her chin to frame her face and smiles at me. “We do good work, don’t we?”</p>\n<p>I nod. Reluctantly. “What do you really look like?” This ain’t the first skinload I’ve seen her wear.</p>\n<p>She turns a bit sideways to pose so I can see her profile. “What do you think I really look like?”</p>\n<p>I smirk. “Maybe like that. I mean, you might be Norwegian for real, but I have a hard time believing the bullshit your HumbleBrag is tellin’ me.”</p>\n<p>She gives me a wry smile. “And why is that?”</p>\n<p>I kiss my teeth. <i>Tchuip</i>. “I can’t even remember how long ago it was when y’all said y’all was gon’ Electric Resurrect me, but here I am. Still alive. Still dyin’.”</p>\n<p>“We’re true to our word. I’m true to my word. Remember, I am a Tenth Degree Maven. I cannot lie.”</p>\n<p><i>Tchuip</i>. “Nah, see, you ain’t slick. I know how your SPark Creed goes, an’ it ain’t the way you juss said it. You tryin’ to be cute wit yo’ words. It’s ‘posed to go: ‘I, Kinsley Chase, am true to my word and my profession. As a Tenth Degree Maven, I cannot lie in a manner that brings harm and detriment to the company or organization that bought and currently holds my PR Guild contract.'”</p>\n<p>She laughs. It’s the same one I’ve heard before. That’s the only real thing about her.</p>\n<p>“The first time I met your mother,” she says, “she looked me up and down and then told me: ‘I don’ brook no fools.’ I take it you don’t, either.”</p>\n<p><i>Tchuip</i>. Louder this time. “Yeah, that’s you in there for real. No matter what skinload you wear, you still talk and move like a white girl.”</p>\n<p>She gives me a tiny smile. I can’t read it, and it’s not because of the way I’m lying on the couch.</p>\n<p>Kinsley Chase stands. “Make sure you arrive an hour early for the press conference tomorrow.”</p>\n<p>I scowl at her. “Not all Black people run on CP time.”</p>\n<p>“I didn’t say you or all Black people do.”</p>\n<p>I struggle to sit up, and not because the plastic sucks at my cheek, trying to keep me down. “Ki fè la a, what are you trying to say?”</p>\n<p>“Familiarize yourself with the Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+ exo-suit specs I just sent you.”</p>\n<p>Her tiny smile is gone.

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 965: T-Rex Tex Mex / Mother Death Learns a Trick</h2>\n<h3>T-Rex Tex Mex</h3>\n<p>“Whoa! Hold on, partner!” the host of the party asked with his fake Texan accent. “What is that costume supposed to be?”</p>\n<p>Of all the insufferable things, he was wearing a cowboy hat on his green, scaley head.</p>\n<p>Dinosaurs did not wear hats.</p>\n<p>Other costumed partygoers passed by the buffet table where I’d just placed my bag of candy, between a bowl of offensive kale chips and what smelled like mashed cauliflower. The humans at the Halloween barbeque apparently had no more intention of eating their offerings than I did, as they steered clear of the vegan display.</p>\n<p>I couldn’t cook, which was why I had brought candy. Obviously.</p>\n<p>“I’m a dinosaur,” I told my host. “Rarr.”</p>\n<p/><p>“Nah. That ain’t a dinosaur costume. That’s a Big Bird costume, except you got the feathers all wrong. They shouldn’t be blue and red—though that’s mighty patriotic of you.” The man chuckled and patted the distended belly of his costume. “This, here, is a real dinosaur costume. This is a replica of the T-Rex from Jurassic Park.”</p>\n<p>“You’re too small to be a Tyrannosaurus,” I said. “Even an evolved dinosaur that left your planet over seventy million years ago only to come back in a spaceship to find the planet overrun by sentient vermin intent on polluting the ecosystem would never resemble that. You look like a crocodile walking on two legs.” I eyed his insipid green costume with the disdain it deserved. “Your primitive science has proven that raptors had feathers, just like the birds descended from them.” Like me. “I cannot fathom why humans are so ignorant that they must hold onto such outdated beliefs.”</p>\n<p>I waved my clawed hand over my gorgeous plumage. My arms weren’t as short as those of my ancestors – another reason why I was better suited for spaceflight than for preparing potluck items I had no intention of eating.</p>\n<p>The host just chuckled again like everything I had said was a joke. He drained the last of his adult beverage of choice in its glass bottle and swayed, an expected reaction to the combined effects of alcohol and the sleeping powder I’d dosed him with.</p>\n<p>Across the party I spotted my captain, chatting with a human woman dressed as a superhero. There wasn’t much fabric that would inhibit his meal. I, on the other claw, had chosen my intended dinner based on quantity. I suspected there would be a satisfactory amount of meat under his costume.</p>\n<p>“Can I get you another drink?” I asked my host, reaching into the cooler under the table.</p>\n<p>The plastic box full of ice was so archaic compared to what we had on our ship. Our refrigeration systems were efficient, fully-automated, and numerous enough to hold several human city’s worth of livestock. Though we did like to taste-test our free-range humans first.</p>\n<p>Today was sample day.</p>\n<p>My host accepted the drink I handed him. “That’s mighty kind of you. Hey, have you tried the chili? I made it myself.”</p>\n<p>“The vegetarian chili?” I shrugged. “Sorry, I’m a dinosaur, and we’re strict carnivores. Rarr.”</p>\n<p>He chortled again and slapped me on the back.</p>\n<p>I laughed along with him. Potlucks were my favorite.</p>\n<h3>Mother Death Learns a Trick</h3>\n<p>When Mother Death foretold her own demise, nobody paid her much mind. The old AI was less a prophet and more of a doomsayer stuck on repeat, her body buried in the mess of tech detritus between the bakery and the retro VR shop. It wasn’t that she had never been right. She predicted deaths all day, so eventually something was going to stick. It was more that nobody cared. She was an ancient model in metallic skin, a third eye drawn across her forehead in purple paint. I passed her four times before I stopped to see what was going on, almost unsettled by not being warned of my death.</p>\n<p>“Mother Death will soon perish,” the bot said, playing the tinny melody that always came with her predictions. She stared into the street as people walked past, not bothering to stop for the old bot.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/10/31/escape-pod-965-t-rex-tex-mex-mother-death-learns-a-trick/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 964: Show and Tell (Flashback Friday)</h2>\n<h3>Show and Tell</h3>\n<p>Teacher is an old-fashioned bug with a blue carapace and eyes like two domes of gold beads. She is very pretty and smells like <i>follow,</i> but when she flutters her wings you better look smart or you’ll get her stinger in your belly.</p>\n<p>So we are quiet. We are three rows of quiet children, blinking slowly and steadily, as is polite.</p>\n<p>“Today, we are having Show and Tell,” Teacher says, bending her antennae towards us. “I am certain you have all brought wonderful shows.”</p>\n<p>She doesn’t need to tell me it is Show and Tell. I have thought of nothing else for many days. Show and Tell is my worst subject. I nearly failed it last year and almost did not advance. Father says I need to plan my shows better. He says I don’t put enough thought and effort into them, and that is why I get low marks. I say I get low marks because we are poor and have little to show.</p>\n<p>Brindi goes first. Brindi is thin as a tube and covered with ginger fur that her mother decorates with lilac ribbons. Brindi was my girlfriend last summer until she met an orbit boy she liked more. Father says orbit boys are old-fashioned and perverted and believe strange things. I think they must be at least a little regular, though, because Brindi likes her orbit boy very much.</p>\n<p>Brindi’s show is a gun.</p>\n<p>A gun is a black object made of plastic and bent at a right angle. Brindi says it’s an old-fashioned weapon that her orbit boy gave her. I figure I should go up to visit her orbit boy and give him something, is what I should do.</p>\n<p>Teacher asks Brindi how the gun works and Brindi points it at a kid in the front row named Dex and does something with her finger. The gun works by going BOOM. Dex’s head-noodles go whip-whip-whip, and he catches a little nugget of metal.</p>\n<p>“That’s a bullet,” Brindi says, “and if you’re slow it goes into the meat part and kills you.”</p>\n<p>Dex asks if he can keep the bullet, and Brindi says to give it back, and Teacher reminds her to say please. Brindi agrees to throw bullets at the rest of us, so she does the thing with her finger and it’s BOOM, BOOM, BOOM and whip-whip-whip for the next few minutes.</p>\n<p>When she’s done there’s smoke in the air and it stinks and we applaud and give back her bullets. Brindi has had a great show, and I don’t know how anyone can beat it.</p>\n<p>Show and Tell is important because it prepares us to be impressive.</p>\n<p>It’s Gibb’s turn next. This year Gibb is splashy with broad planes of changing colors. Last year he was a little less elaborated and was my best friend. Gibb’s show is an odor which he’s brought in a membrane that grows from his ribs. He holds up a long silver needle and says he’ll let someone pierce his membrane, and everyone starts fluttering their head-noodles. I do so only half-heartedly, as I know Gibb won’t call on me.</p>\n<p>But Teacher tells Gibb to let me do it.</p>\n<p>I am secretly in love with Teacher.</p>\n<p>Everyone’s head-noodles sag (rudely, I think) and Gibb turns cold purple. When I go to the front of the room he hands me the needle. “Just prick my sac,” he hisses. “Don’t go too deep.”</p>\n<p>I would like to jam the needle deep into his side, all the way in so he has to send something crawling after it if he wants it back. But I do like he says. Just a little poke.</p>\n<p>He releases a twirling, spinning, buzzing smell. It smells like falling down a spiral slide on a hot day when you’ve had too much melon juice. I stick out my tongue and pant, it’s so gross. I think it’s one of the worst shows I’ve ever seen.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/10/24/escape-pod-964-show-and-tell-flashback-friday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Things were going more smoothly than she might have feared. Too smoothly, if Alessia was being honest.</p>\n<p>Darmanda was possibly the most considerate person she’d ever met, making sure to nap while Alessia was out and let her have the room—and bed—to herself when she came off shift. She even took care to exercise Fiona and tire her out, so she’d be quiet in her case while Alessia slept. And while Alessia was sure Arctic Flieffs must produce bodily waste, she’d never seen any evidence of that in her quarters. It was almost as convenient as living alone had been.</p>\n<p>Alessia and Darmanda made a point of meeting up for meals at least once a day in the mess, for appearances.<br/>\nThey’d sit next to each other and sometimes Alessia would wrap one of Darmanda’s thick black curls around her finger. Or lay her head on Darmanda’s shoulder. Other times, Darmanda would rest a soft brown hand on Alessia’s knee. Gestures of affection they’d specifically discussed and given consent for in their initial negotiations talk, all designed to make them seem like a proper couple who were comfortable together. </p>\n<p>It really <i>was</i> comfortable, and it was killing her. </p>\n<p/><p>Truth be told, it had been too long since she’d had a girlfriend. It would be nice to have a real date for Mizzentide. She had missed the way the rhythms of daily life changed when you had a partner, and the chemical boosts that came from physical contact. She wanted more of it. Which was preposterous since she didn’t actually know Darmanda at all, and they were definitely going to part ways and never see each other again when they docked on Vorpa in four days.</p>\n<p>“Ugh, Mr Tumnus, I’m a mess,” she said.</p>\n<p>Mr Tumnus continued purring.</p>\n<p>“I’ll take that as a sign of agreement.”</p>\n<p>The door chimed then, and Mr Tumnus jumped down, stretching his back legs out as he walked over to investigate while Alessia pushed the button to let her extremely fake and not real at all girlfriend in. “It’s just Darmanda coming to collect me for lunch,” she told the cat. “You know this.”</p>\n<p>Mr Tumnus sniffed delicately and twined about Darmanda’s legs the second the door opened.</p>\n<p>Darmanda crouched low and scooped the cat into her arms, cradling him against her chest as she stood. “Hello, kitty,” she said. “Busy workday?”</p>\n<p>Mr Tumnus answered by butting his fluffy orange head against Darmanda’s chin.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” Darmanda cooed. “Such a hard worker. You have earned many scritches.”</p>\n<p>When he felt sufficiently adored, Mr Tumnus leapt down and found a corner in which to bathe himself.</p>\n<p>“Ready for lunch?” Darmanda asked.</p>\n<p>“Just a sec.” Alessia said without looking up. She made a few micro adjustments to the engine settings that were absolutely unnecessary, but at least they gave her something to do with her hands while she tried to pull herself together and not look as obviously into Darmanda as she felt.</p>\n<p>When she finally turned around and stood up, she kept her face neutral. Which was hard because Darmanda looked even more adorable than usual. She’d been helping Ken-Val in the galley again, and there were streaks of flour in her hair, which was piled up in a loose knot. The coverall she’d borrowed from Alessia had a scorch mark on one arm that hadn’t been there before, and her skin was glowing in that way that spending the morning in a steamy kitchen made skin glow. She smelled of mint and Cryvlainian peppergrass. Comfort food smells. Alessia wanted to burrow into her the way Mr Tumnus had a moment before.</p>\n<p>She had to focus on something else. Literally anything else. “Are we having dumplings? Please say yes.”</p>\n<p>“Your wish is my command,” said Darmanda, laughing. And then they walked out into the hallway, hand in hand. It felt way too right.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/10/17/escape-pod-963-to-catch-a-flieff-part-2-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 962: To Catch a Flieff (Part 1 of 2)</h2>\n<h3>To Catch a Flieff</h3>\n<p>Alessia frowned at the central circuit board of the <i>Astral Dancer</i>. Paw prints. Again.</p>\n<p>She heaved an exasperated sigh. “Mr Tumnus, I have told you a thousand times, you can’t go into the engine. I don’t care how bright and sparkly it is, it’s not for cats!”</p>\n<p>The cat did not reply. In fact, he was nowhere to be found, not even after she pried up the 3D printed plastic shield and wedged her upper half as far into the engine core as it could go without accessing the underside.</p>\n<p>That was weird.</p>\n<p>Usually if Mr Tumnus got in, he sat in a smug loaf on top of the accelerator panel, fluffy orange tail swishing as he batted at the flashing lights.</p>\n<p>Then she heard the chittering.</p>\n<p><i>Oh no. No no no.</i></p>\n<p>Only one thing made this sound: Arctic Flieffs from Vorpalix. They were the most adorable puffballs, always a winner for page a day calendars and cheer up memes—and they wrought havoc on any habitat that wasn’t their own.</p>\n<p>The chittering was a sign that this one was about to nest. In the engine core of the <i>Astral Dancer</i>. </p>\n<p/><p>“No, no, <i>noooo</i>,” Alessia moaned.</p>\n<p>“Mrrp,” a small voice agreed. Great, <i>now</i> Mr Tumnus entered the chat.</p>\n<p>Alessia carefully extracted her head and torso from the engine core and snapped the shield back into place before acknowledging the wayward ship cat.</p>\n<p>“Where were you when this intruder got in, huh buddy?” she asked.</p>\n<p>Mr Tumnus rippled languorously and thrust his orange head into Alessia’s outstretched hand for scritches.</p>\n<p>“Oh yes, so helpful,” Alessia murmured.</p>\n<p>Mr Tumnus began to purr.</p>\n<p>“Traitor.” Alessia snorted. “We’ll see who’s purring when the White Witch in there tears up our engine to make an ice cave…”</p>\n<p>The <i>Astral Dancer</i> was a coldfire model. Old fashioned, but still sturdy enough if maintained carefully. One of the signatures of the coldfire engine was a core crystal reactor that produced energy via cooling power rather than heat. In the higher end models, that meant one or two very large crystals. In a lower end model like Alessia’s baby, it achieved the same effect by spinning a bunch of crystal pebbles. </p>\n<p>Pebbles, which, if Alessia was right, the Arctic Flieff was about to scatter around and use as a nesting material. Which would, of course, completely ruin the ship’s main drive function.</p>\n<p>Under normal circumstances, this would be bad, but now? At the very start of a series of small jump jobs tailor-made to get the captain home to Vorpa and their family just in time for Mizzentide? This could ruin <i>everything</i>. </p>\n<p>Alessia had three choices. 1) She could tell the captain and face the consequences for letting this happen on her watch head on. 2) She could pretend it wasn’t happening and hope she was wrong about it being an Artic Flieff. 3) She could go in through the underside and fix it herself, hopefully before it destroyed everything / anyone noticed.</p>\n<p>So really, Alessia only had the one choice. She was going to the subdeck.</p>\n<p>Darmanda hadn’t meant to stow away. Really, she hadn’t.</p>\n<p>She had only meant to look at the docks, catalogue the departing ships, and see if maybe one might bring her on as crew…while not asking too many questions about what was in her luggage.</p>\n<p>It was hardly her fault that a furry giant had knocked into her.</p>\n<p>“Hey, watch where you’re going, you big oaf!” she had shouted.</p>\n<p>The giant had turned as if to start something, but then shrugged and grunted when they saw Darmanda, like she wasn’t really worth getting into a fight with, or taking the time to apologize to. Darmanda might have taken more offense at that if Fiona’s carrier hadn’t come unlatched when it tumbled to the floor, releasing one panicked Arctic Flieff into the dockside fray.</p>\n<p>Of course she had to run after Fiona. What kind of monster would leave a defenseless puffball to fend for itself?<br/>\nAnd naturally Fiona had run straight for the nearest small opening…which happened to be a ship hatch. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/10/10/escape-pod-962-to-catch-a-flieff-part-1-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A passing comment in his interrogation document reveals that he also happened to be carrying a leather bag “in which there were three or four dozen balls of wool for playing tennis.”</p>\n<p>The French term used at the time was <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/jeu-de-paume-anyone-60613990/\"> jeu de paume</a>, the palm game. This sport was played with the hand, often gloved, rather than a racquet. It would develop into the game that in English we refer to as “</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.real-tennis.nl/\">real tennis</a>,” which is played by hitting the ball with a specially designed wooden racquet, not only across a net but also off walls within an</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/sports/real-tennis\">enclosed court</a>, usually with high windows, a sloping roof and a spectators’ gallery. So it is quite a different beast from modern (or “lawn”) tennis, which is traditionally played on open courts, surrounded on all sides by spectators, as we see at professional tournaments like the Grand Slams of today.</p>\n<p>The interrogator believed that this cheap merchandise was simply a ruse for the man’s true purpose of communicating with French Protestant, or <a href=\"https://www.huguenotsociety.org.uk/history.html\">Huguenot</a>, exiles. I explore this accusation in <a href=\"https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/history/people/staff_index/proberts/\">my forthcoming book</a>, <i> Huguenot Networks: Truth and Secrecy in 16th-Century Europe</i>, which uses as its starting point the man’s interrogation document. As a historian, I was particularly intrigued by both the large number and the make-up of the goods he was transporting. The wool, if wrapped tightly, could certainly have made these tennis balls bouncy.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Jeu_de_paume#/media/File:French_Jeu_de_Paume_in_the_17th_century.jpg\">Public domain via Wikimedia Commons</a>\n    </p>\n<p>By chance, I encountered similar material objects in a small display at the <a href=\"https://www.centropalazzote.it/en/fondazione-palazzo-te?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22185085360&amp;gbraid=0AAAAABtHJoXfhZWGfP92ON6_iM0RF9-R4&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw2brFBhBOEiwAVJX5GLp055zQk2fNRaaJnMY2etSc_oRAl0FUw2zCourNEiv8rGJqnUTOqRoCHvsQAvD_BwE\">Palazzo Te</a> in Mantua, Italy. A room suitable for playing real tennis was constructed near the palace stables at the beginning of the 16th century. The balls displayed had apparently been retrieved from the palace roof, and several others had come from a nearby church. They were variously made of leather, cloth and string, as well as wool, and probably stuffed with earth and animal hair. Just like the handmade <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/apr/16/real-tennis-racket-sport-cheltenham-sydney-club\">real tennis balls</a> of today, they were harder and more variable in size than regular tennis balls, and usually not so colorful, although some had a simple painted design on the outside.</p>\n<p>Real (or royal) tennis is sometimes known as “<a href=\"https://www.discoverbritain.com/history/traditions/real-tennis/\">the sport of kings</a>.” “Tennis” as a term is believed to come from the French word “<i> tenez</i>” (meaning “hold,” “receive” or “take”), which was used to draw the opponent’s attention to the serve. The game was praised for testing agility and athletic prowess, making it popular among European elites.</p>\n<p>Louis X of France was a <a href=\"https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100020240?p=emailACEPNp3zOIesk&amp;d=/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100020240&amp;print\">keen player</a> of jeu de paume and is credited with popularizing the sport. He was the first ruler to order the construction of enclosed <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/dailylifeinmiddl0000newm/page/163/mode/1up?q=%22first+recorded+builder%22\">indoor courts</a>, which were later imitated across Europe. The 14th-century chronicler Donato Velluti, for instance, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/lacronicadomesti00velluoft/page/81/mode/1up?q=%22tenes%22\">reported</a> the importation of tennis from France to Florence, Italy. By the end of the 16th century, the game’s rules had also begun to be <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofte0000robe/page/17/mode/1up?q=Forbet\">codified</a> in print.</p>\n<p>Although tennis was not as dangerous as other popular court pastimes, such as <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/jousting-henry-viii-tudor-history-180976221/\">jousting</a>, mock sieges and hunting, several royal injuries and even <a href=\"https://www.sbnation.com/secret-base/22220411/french-royal-family-tennis-curse-louis-x-charles-vii\">deaths in France</a> were associated with it. In June 1316, after a particularly exhausting match at the Château de Vincennes on the outskirts of Paris, Louis X is said to have drunk a large quantity of chilled water or <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/tennisculturalhi0000gill_v8q8/page/20/mode/1up?q=%22chilled+wine%22\">wine</a> and soon afterward died, probably of pleurisy, although there was some suspicion of poisoning.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>During a 1559 jousting match, a wooden lance <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1432144/\">pierced the helmet</a>of Henry II of France, leaving splinters in his eye socket and head.</li>\n      <li>Henry, the husband of <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-many-myths-of-catherine-de-medici-180980722/\">Catherine de’ Medici</a>,<a href=\"https://www.historytoday.com/archive/henry-ii-france-dies-tournament-wounds\">died</a><a href=\"https://www.musee-reforme.ch/en/henri-2-fatal-joust/\">ten days</a>after the accident.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/why-european-royals-from-henry-viii-to-louis-x-loved-playing-real-tennis-the-so-called-sport-of-kings-180987264/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He’s chosen the Bhagavad Gita, the Ramayan and Neerja Chowdhury’s <i>How Prime Ministers Decide.</i></p>\n<p>Whether the Delhi chief minister wants to actually read these books or he wants to be seen as wanting to read these books is anyone’s guess. Kejriwal is well-known for his penchant for political theatre, after all.</p>\n<p>Yet there is something profoundly telling about the books we turn to when we are cut off from the rest of the world. These are our <i>Desert Island Discs</i>, that famous BBC Radio 4 show where guests had to come up with songs they would carry with them if they were marooned on an island somewhere. Within the loneliness of jail, where most of the time you are in isolation, battling the voices in your head, these books might be your only real companions.</p>\n<p>Growing up as a bookish boy who was hopeless at sports, I can understand the power of book companions. Early in the morning, when the house was yet to stir, I would sneak up on to the window sill in the bedroom I shared with my sister and curl up there with my book, drawing the curtains around me, careful not to disturb anyone. That hour or so of me-time with my book, hidden from the world behind the curtains, was precious beyond words. It ignited a lifelong love affair with books. Every time I travelled abroad, I carefully selected the books I would read during the flight. Recently I came back from a trip to the US, and realised, to my chagrin, that with so many on-demand in-flight entertainment options, I had not read any of the books I had carried. As I took the books and the unused bookmarks out of my carry-on bag, I felt a pang as if I had betrayed an old faithful.</p>\n<p>Of course there is no comparing a transatlantic flight, however long, with indefinite judicial custody. But <i>How Prime Ministers Decide</i> is an interesting choice for Kejriwal. The book opens with a scene with which many politicians in crisis would empathise. And it involves books.</p>\n<p>Indira Gandhi is sitting under a jamun tree in the back lawn of her bungalow on Safdarjung Road in Delhi. It’s April 1977. Her party has just been trounced in the election and she has lost in her own constituency of Rae Bareli. She tells her visitors Kapil Mohan and Anil Bali of the Mohan Meakin liquor company that she is thinking of disappearing into the hills to some place with a small spring, surrounded by trees.</p>\n<p>“I can spend the rest of my life there. And I can read books.”</p>\n<p>“Madam, will you write a book?” Bali asks her.</p>\n<p>“Maybe, but then who will want to read my memoirs?” she says morosely.</p>\n<p>Mrs Gandhi never got a chance to write those memoirs though her father’s letters to her from prison remain a classic. Other figures in Indian history also used their jail time not just to read but also write—Mahatma Gandhi, Jayaprakash Narayan, Veer Savarkar and Bhagat Singh, to name a handful.</p>\n<p>In another time and in another prison, but much in the same vein, Nelson Mandela wrote <i>Conversations With Myself</i>. Alexander Solzhenitsyn, sent to labour camp for criticising Stalin, wrote what became <i>One Day In The Life Of Ivan Denisovich </i>on whatever scraps of paper he could find. As prisoners of conscience, they had a sense of haloed righteousness. Mrs Gandhi, who had lost an election because of the taint of the Emergency, felt she was a reviled figure.</p>\n<p>Not all prisoners spend their time writing philosophical introspective memoirs about the meaning of life. Marquis de Sade wrote the very erotic<i> Justine</i> in 1791 to while away the boredom of prison life. Sir Thomas Malory was awaiting trial for rape in the 1450s when he wrote his famous<i> Le Morte d’Arthur</i> about the chivalric King Arthur. And Miguel Cervantes’ <i>Don Quixote</i> was conceived in debtors’ prison. So Kejriwal has many genres to choose from if he puts pen to paper.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/opinion/chief-minister-arvind-kejriwal-books-jail-read-111712238972601.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Reviewed by Emily Webber</p>\n<p>Fiona McKay’s novella-in-flash, <i>The Lives of the Dead</i> [Ad Hoc Fiction, 2025] draws us into Kate’s life as she stands on the brink of marriage and motherhood. Reading this collection feels like walking down a familiar path, but perhaps you’ve always done it during the day, and now you’re experiencing it at night. Your feet know where to go, but there’s also something unsettling and strange. You feel safe enough and believe you’ll make it home, but you might not be exactly the same afterwards, just like Kate.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>The breeze pushes through her, meets no resistance in the meat of her body, in her bones that clank along, shifting and re-forming their shapes and angles. Ligaments are loose, but tightening. She will be herself again. Maybe. A version, anyway. (47)</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>You’ve heard these stories before. They contain familiar themes and images, but McKay makes them new, including rewriting fairy tales such as Rapunzel and Cinderella alongside Kate’s story. Through these dual narratives, she shows us how a woman can become trapped by the sacrifices she’s asked to make for her husband and children.</p>\n<p>If you pay close attention to the beginning of this novella and notice the clues that McKay weaves in, you’ll realize that these milestones and Kate’s life aren’t going to turn out the way she hoped. In the opening story, Kate meets her boyfriend John’s mother for the first time. John orders for her before she even arrives, telling her she doesn’t need coffee late in the day. When she says she wants coffee, it never comes. Then, more alarmingly, Kate calls attention to the tiny bruises on her wrist, saying she doesn’t know how she got them. John’s mother jokes that you always know the princesses by how they bruise so easily, a chastisement to Kate that she’s too sensitive. What follows is a loss of everything Kate loves—her job teaching French, nights out at bars, travel, then her voice in all decisions. McKay emphasizes Kate’s feelings through a fairy tale:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>And so, the young woman stays. She and the prince marry, are blessed with children, rule the kingdom benignly and are loved by their people. The old queen keeps the heart safe, locked away, from time to time carving off some gold, selling off another jewel, and each time she does so, the young woman feels a sharp pain in her empty chest. But she stays – she has no choice – and all the while, the heart is shrinking, shrinking, shrinking. (10)</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>Kate’s husband, John, might seem like a perfectly fine man on the surface according to society’s standards. He has a great job, so she stays home with the kids. He adores his children—playing with them, bathing them, and taking them out. As Kate struggles with the expectation that a woman should be grateful for such a man, we are taught alongside her. But McKay makes Kate and the reader question a man who holds a woman’s wrist so tightly he leaves bruises, gaslights her into thinking she agreed to certain things, or ignores her misery and depression. Otherwise, society tells us, he’s fine.</p>\n<p>The structure of <i>The Lives of the Dead</i>, which includes flash fiction pieces centered on Kate, mixed with pages of her internet searches and the fairy tale retellings, creates a feeling of timelessness. The fairy tales are somewhat familiar but rewritten to mirror Kate’s world, where the familiar warps and distresses instead of providing comfort.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Spirits flit, and for those observing closely, there is an afterburn, a ghostly echo of where they have been. A vindictive gust of wind that rips through the trees, lifts up the carpet of soil, roots, moss, exposing the tender flesh of the earth beneath. (18)</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>The fairy tale retellings remind us that, since the beginning of time, stories exist where women are losing control to men, suppressing their own desires, and living in isolation. McKay creates tension in Kate’s ability to overcome such tales or further sink into despair and loneliness.</p>\n<p>Is it possible to take control away from a man who controls everything?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smokelong.com/review-the-lives-of-the-dead-by-fiona-mckay/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Reviewed by Marcus Tan</p>\n<p>In her flash fiction “Bleeding Girls Initiation Ritual,” Claire Polders shows us the resilience of the collective in a deft exploration of patriarchal structures and symbols. She never shies away from the lyrical, instead harnessing musicality to create evocative, memorable images: “We dance around the fire, ashen hands in the air, ready to accept the power that is naturally ours.” Authority and submission jostle for space and at the end, but what lingers in my mind is the violence expressed as a necessary tool to escape the mechanism of oppression: “His back carves out a pit that fits his body like a grave. We refuse to grant him a last wish. We close the grave.” In her debut collection <i>Woman of the Hour: Fifty Tales of Longing and Rebellion </i>[Vine Leaves Press, July 2025], Polders reveals she is not afraid of vulnerability. Comprising fifty distilled stories, each no longer than three pages, Polders’ collection celebrates the vivacity of womanhood.</p>\n<p>Time and its liminality shimmer beneath each story. It’s right there in the collection’s title and its eponymous story. “Woman of the Hour” presents a countdown from sixty minutes, each passing minute taking us through a different layer of identity: mother, wife, daughter, friend, employee, and finally, of her memory as a child, where she “would stand on the makeshift stage of their shoddy living room rug… acting out all the parts and getting applauded by the merry adults, including her mother, for so convincingly being anyone but herself.”</p>\n<p>Polders lives inside her flash, in that little flicker of time when an entire universe bursts alive, expands, and then disappears. Blink and it’s gone. But therein lies the power of Polders’ flash fiction. Each story deserves to be read twice over: first inhaled as quickly as possible, letting the explosion of tension and musicality hit you all at once. Then again, to savor each moment like a meditation.</p>\n<p>As much as Polders is a writer’s writer—her prose lean, her every metaphor deployed with precision—what makes her collection memorable is its unflinching reach to answer the Big Questions of constructing the self, of finding agency in a chaotic world, of finding your people. “Will they see me whole and know me better than I’ll ever know myself?” she asks in “Five Forbidden Friends,” excavating the secrets that form the undercurrent of friendship and community.</p>\n<p>Polders’ strength in flash is best shown in “Attic,” a story crafted with restraint and poetic economy, yet never feeling too small or too narrow in scope. Within a few hundred words, she immerses you in a universe rich with memory and grief and contemplation. The story’s “silent mother” is not prominently displayed on the page, but you feel her presence in every single word. The silent mother unfolds in brief, poignant moments, then disappears, leaving you to grieve and mourn as the narrator does. You are left to pick up the pieces: “The world in which I am innocent and brave seems no more real than the world in which I can fly.”</p>\n<p>Womanhood forms the third rail of this collection—the electricity that drives the train of every story forward. How do women evolve to find balance within the world, protect themselves, and reclaim their power? In “Lost Animal Identities,” we watch a woman turn into a fox at the touch of a man. The fox saves her. Or does she save herself? To be a woman is to be protean. In this story, we begin in childhood with the loss of innocence. Then we awaken. We wade through adolescence, wrestling with the boundaries of the body. We stumble into adulthood, too aware of ourselves and our place in the world, ready to fight back against it all. And finally, Polders writes, “I roared.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smokelong.com/defiance-desire-and-transformation-on-woman-of-the-hour-fifty-tales-of-longing-and-rebellion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><em>Granta</em> contributors, friends and staff share what they are reading this summer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>JESSE BARRON </strong></p>\n<p>I regret the day that my friend Jessica said she was reading <em>The Years of Lyndon Johnson</em>. She made it sound easy. Ever since then, I’ve been trapped in this four-volume work by Robert Caro, and in the musty world of mid-century American politics. Three volumes in, I can’t say I’m enjoying it anymore, yet I seem unable to stop, propelled by the same joyless doggedness with which Johnson himself pursued power. One of the many things that drives me crazy about Caro is that he loads his prose with excess freight: a former governor of Texas ‘was not only not typical but was, in fact, unique.’ A simple ‘and’ will never do; Caro must add ‘moreover’. I would throw the book across the room, but it’s too heavy to lift – and, moreover, the pleasures outweigh the frustrations. The most beautiful parts of Caro are the historical reconstructions, the set pieces that plunge you into the Texas Hill Country of the 1920s or the Senate cloakroom of 1949. And there’s the tender – the trampled – figure of Lady Bird. Johnson courted her with chivalry and charm, used her father’s money to enter politics, then treated her like a servant and humiliated her in public for the rest of their marriage. Lady Bird never says a mean word back. She speaks for the whole Vietnam generation when she tells Caro, of her home life with Johnson, ‘Lyndon’s wishes dominate.’</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>TOM BOLGER </strong></p>\n<p>These past three weeks I’ve read three slim books. Although I caught some teasing flak for <em>The Bloody Chamber</em> by Angela Carter (‘Are you doing your A-levels?’), it is hard not to be intoxicated by the violent and sensual collection, not so much a subversion of fairy tales and the Gothic, but a fine distillation of their dormant desires and fears – the tossed-sheets-tussle of Eros and Thanatos. I’ve also arrived late to the Janet Malcolm party, first reading <em>The Journalist and the Murderer</em>, then <em>The Silent Woman</em>. The former investigates with cool precision the implicitly comprised journalist–subject relationship, and the inadequacy of language and memory when gesturing towards ‘the truth’. Her attention to detail, her ability to swiftly capture someone’s presence, their contradictions, is exceptional. The latter – a submersion into the divergent biographies of Sylvia Plath – continues to haunt me; who owns our work, our incomprehensible life, in death? It is devastating and eviscerating, yet often sympathetic to its central players. I plan to work my way through Malcolm’s archive in the coming months.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>ANNE CARSON </strong></p>\n<p>accidentally i am reading collections of stories by people named Elizabeth<br>\nBowen<br>\nHardwick<br>\nTaylor<br>\nthey are all terrific.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>ALEXANDER CLAPP </strong></p>\n<p>I’ve spent most of the last year in Southeast Colombia working on a new book project. My companions have been some of the classics of Amazonian anthropology: Michael Taussig’s <em>Shamanism, Colonialism, and the Wild Man </em>and Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff’s famous study of Tukano mythology, <em>Amazonian Cosmos</em>. Both are waterlogged. My last copy of <em>Tristes Tropiques</em> disintegrated in a rainstorm somewhere on the Rio Caqueta. For pleasure I’ve been reading Vargas Llosa novels – <em>The Storyteller</em>, <em>The Dream of the Celt</em> – and Norman Lewis’s newly-collected essays, <em>A Quiet Evening</em>. Sometimes, before longer trips, I’ll print out <em>NLR</em>  or <em>LRB</em> pieces for the canoe or Jeep. I have a habit of leaving them behind in the lobbies of shabby hotels. I smile at the idea of strangers, months later, chancing upon a Perry Anderson or Neal Ascherson essay deep in the wilderness of the Amazon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>JOSHUA COHEN</strong></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/summer-reads-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p class=\"_--MAIN-TEXT---1st-Line-Indent ParaOverride-2\">The badlands of this issue refer to inhospitable terrain, whether on land or in the mind. Eighty years after the end of the Second World War, multiple times the firepower inflicted on Hiroshima has been dropped on Gaza in savage pursuit of Palestinian oblivion, while the Houthi dissenters in Yemen continue to break world records: first combat exchange in outer space, highest number of US drones destroyed, first non-state actor to down an F-18. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the mineral-rich eastern region of Kivu, an area the size of Western Europe, has been a geopolitical badlands for three decades. In Sudan, a deadlocked civil war fractures the country anew. These are only some of the areas on Earth whose uninhabitability is accelerating.</p>\n<p class=\"_--MAIN-TEXT---1st-Line-Indent\">And Europe? A proxy war still rages there between Russia and the United States, with the Ukrainian people paying the price. What is remarkable is how much of the devastation has been confined within the national borders of pre-2014 Ukraine. Bombings and assassinations in Moscow are, at the time of writing, still rare, and the counter-invasion of Kursk by three Ukrainian brigades has come to naught. Mystifyingly, in the sleepy town of Wiesbaden, Germany – the de facto headquarters of the Western alliance, where NATO officials and Ukrainian commanders coordinate targets – the Russians have not raised a finger. In Berlin in 2022, I remember seeing the dead tropical fish on Karl-Liebknecht-Straße in the aftermath of the explosion of the AquaDom, widely speculated to have been the result of a Russian attack at the time, and thinking: this is what the war will be like when Moscow starts coloring harder outside the lines. But both the US and Russia have an interest in keeping the conflict confined to Ukraine. For the US, the ongoing war underlines the terms of European dependence on American arms and energy. For Russia, it has helped put the economy on a new, more autonomous footing. If the oft-dangled peace arrives, it will be the result of sated appetites as much as exhaustion. At some point Russia will want to consolidate its gains, while the US wants to keep open capacities that may be needed in the Middle East and East Asia.</p>\n<p class=\"_--MAIN-TEXT---1st-Line-Indent\">For this issue, <em><span class=\"CharOverride-2\">Granta</span> </em>sent William T. Vollmann into the drone-infested Ukrainian badlands. Vollmann describes himself as a writer low on fitness but high on endurance. In 1982, when he was twenty-two, he joined the Afghan mujahideen fighting against the Soviet invasion (a portion of his account appeared in <span class=\"CharOverride-2\"><em>Granta</em> </span>40). Vollmann has staged collisions of his innocence with rough country ever since: Sarajevo, Fukushima, the Korean DMZ. ‘I went to help [Ukraine] in my helpless way, with journalistic good intentions which sorrowed into love,’ he writes. The good intentions would verge on naive if Vollmann did not hitch them to sober-eyed appraisals of his surroundings. There are few writers of contemporary reportage who see as many shades of color beyond the windshield. In Ukraine, Vollmann finds distraught mourners, hardened dog-lovers, defensive literary critics, and wised-up drone pilots. His chief interlocutors, however, are the two modernist giants of the region: Joseph Roth and Isaac Babel. In his affectionate way, Vollmann confronts a puritanism among some Ukrainians he meets that recalls Soviet history-scrubbing excesses: the pressure to purge vestiges of a shared past, in an effort to decontaminate Ukraine from the taint of Russian culture. While trying to summon reasons for leaving a statue of Babel intact, Vollmann asks: ‘Isn’t genius enough?’</p>\n<p class=\"_--MAIN-TEXT---1st-Line-Indent\">Vollmann once supplied a dark clue for the origins of his strenuous attention to detail. In 1968, when he was nine years old, he was told to watch over his sister at a pond in New Hampshire. The pond had a steep drop-off and his sister drowned. ‘I just stopped paying attention at one point,’ Vollmann recalled. ‘I was lost in some sort of daydream.’ For a decade afterward, he describes having ‘nightmares practically every night – of her skeleton chasing me and punishing me’. Part of the way out of being pursued for Vollmann has been to become a great noticer of everything around him.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/badlands-intro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><span class=\"dropcap\">I</span>t is a sepia photo, oval-shaped, glued inside a yellowed cardboard folder, showing a baby posed in three-quarter profile on a heap of scalloped cushions. The infant wears an embroidered nightdress with a single, wide strap to which a large bow is attached, just behind the shoulder, like a big flower or the wings of a giant butterfly. The body is long and not very fleshy. The legs are parted and stretch out toward the edge of the table. Under the brown hair, swept up in a big curl over the protuberant forehead, the eyes are wide and staring with an almost devouring intensity. The arms, open like those of a baby doll, seem to be flailing, as if she were about to leap from the table. Below the photo, the signature of the photographer (M. Ridel, Lillebonne), whose intertwined initials also appear in the upper left-hand corner of the front cover, which is heavily soiled and coming unglued.</p>\n<p>When I was little, I believed – I must have been told – that the baby was me. It isn’t me, it’s you.<span lang=\"ar-SA\"> </span></p>\n<p>There was another photo, taken by the same photographer, of me on the same table with my brown hair pulled up in the same sort of roll, but I appear to be plump, with deep-set eyes in a round chubby face, my hand between my thighs. I don’t remember ever being puzzled by the – obvious – differences between the two photos.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Around All Saints’ Day, I go to the cemetery in Yvetot to lay flowers on the two graves, the parents’ grave and yours. From one year to the next, I forget where they are but find my bearings with the tall and very white cross that can be seen from the central pathway and which looms over your grave, right next to theirs. I place a potted chrysanthemum of a different color on each grave, or sometimes a pot of heather on yours, working it into the patch of gravel put there for that purpose at the foot of the tombstone.</p>\n<p>I don’t know if people spend much time thinking in front of graves. I linger for a moment before my parents’ grave. It’s as if I’m saying, ‘Here I am’, and showing them what has become of me in the past year, what I’ve done, written, hoped to write. Then I move on to yours, to the right. l look at the headstone and read the inscription in big, too-shiny gilded letters, crudely repainted in the nineties over the old ones, which were smaller and had become illegible. The marble mason took it upon himself to remove half of the original inscription, leaving a single entry under your first and last name, certainly because he considered it to be of utmost importance: <span lang=\"en-GB\"><span class=\"small_caps\">died on holy thursday, 1938</span></span>. That is what struck me too the first time I saw your grave. Like proof carved in stone of your being chosen by God, of your saintliness. In the twenty-five years I’ve been visiting the graves, I’ve never had anything to say to you.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>According to the civil registry, you’re my sister. You have the same surname as me – Duchesne, my ‘maiden name’. We are listed one after the other in the parents’ family record book, almost in tatters, under the heading ‘Births and Deaths of Children of the Marriage’. You are above, with two stamps from the Mairie of Lillebonne (Seine-Inférieure), I am below with only one. The box for death will be filled out for me in another record book that attests to my reproduction of a family, under another name.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/the-other-girl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I didn’t know what to say so I just looked at her, her skin tinged green by a nearby <span class=\"small_caps\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">exit</span> </span>sign. We stood there, weirdly quiet, until she touched me on the forehead and murmured, <em>Knock knock</em>, and I said, automatic, <em>Who’s there?</em></p>\n<p>I felt stupid when she told me she’d started working at a massage parlor and without thinking I said, <em>How come you never practice on me?</em> We were drinking at a tiki bar and her group of friends burst out laughing, then covered their mouths.</p>\n<p>Being around Hunter’s friends only made me feel stupider. Their lives seemed so robust, urbane, full of rotating love affairs and semi-legal gig work. When they spoke, it was like they were handing out business cards – this is me, here are the things that I’m good at, that get me hot, that piss me off. They chain-smoked but had perfect skin or else the wrinkles suited them, made them look cowboy-esque. They were never home and yet their apartments were full of tropical plants that flourished in their absence. They wore complicated rompers to the gym and dirty T-shirts to parties. I suppose they were nice to me, in their own way. They recommended things for me to try – the soup dumplings from that place on Clement, EMDR, bangs.</p>\n<p>It didn’t help that Hunter had told them I’d never dated a woman before. As a group their understanding made me squirm, their soft-focus waterproof eyes. I didn’t know how to explain myself. I practiced, sometimes, in the bathroom mirror: <em>I don’t like labels</em>, <em>I’m from bumfuck Nevada</em>, <em>I’ve never had a boyfriend either</em> . . . but everything reeked of cliché so I just said nothing, mute in my seat, while Hunter and her friends spoke about movies that I’d never seen and who was fucking who.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">W</span>hen I asked Hunter to explain, her voice was serene. <em>Surely you’ve heard of a happy ending massage?</em> She was eating leftover noodles, standing in her bedroom with one sock on, the other foot bare. Nothing seemed to make her shy; she never doubted the world’s ability to accommodate her and her shapeshifting desires. I was just another casualty to her old-world bravado, to the way she wore her jacket over her shoulders with her long arms bare, to the way she called everyone baby. She had a way of making you feel chosen when she touched you on the inner wrist, like some porno nurse taking your pulse – there, there. Her friend Ducky once told her, <em>If you hadn’t turned out gay as fuck, you would totally be evil</em>, to which they both cackled. Kept afloat by a trust fund, she was always into something new: noise music, numerology, performance art. There was the winter of mime, the self-imposed stick-and-pokes zigzagging her thigh. She spent hours every day in her studio, from which I was barred. That month, a blue June, her thing was collage. The floor of her apartment was covered in thrashed fashion magazines and bottles of Elmer’s glue I liked to sniff when she wasn’t around; the back-to-school smell made me nostalgic.</p>\n<p><em>Of course</em>, I said. <em>You mean those skeezy places where dudes go to get off ?</em> I sat on her bed and picked up a magazine, a weather-beaten <em>Vogue</em>; as I pretended to study it, I saw that each page had a woman-shaped hole in it. This made me uneasy, like I was a rookie detective in a cop show and I’d found something damning.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/happy-ending-newell/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><i>Robert Weintraub</i> | <a href=\"https://magazine.atavist.com/\">The Atavist Magazine</a> | August 2025 | 2,613 words (9 minutes)</p>\n<p><i>This is an excerpt from issue no. 166, “ American Hindenburg.”</i></p>\n<h2><strong>One</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>It would be</strong> the greatest day in the history of Akron, Ohio. Forget the opening of the Ohio and Erie Canal, which allowed the budding metropolis to become an industrial center. No, the Rubber City—so-called because of the factories established there by Goodrich, Firestone, General Tire, and Goodyear—had never seen anything like this. <i>Akron</i> means “high” in Greek, and now, fittingly, the future was up in the sky.</p>\n<p>Before the sun rose on August 8, 1931, people poured into the streets. Lloyd Weil, Akron’s mayor, had declared a holiday, freeing from their desks and assembly lines those workers lucky enough to have jobs during the depths of the Great Depression. Cars converged from all directions, carrying people from Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Erie, Toledo, and farther afield. Many navigated epic traffic jams en route to their destination: the Goodyear-Zeppelin Airdock, where the day’s action would take place.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://magazine.atavist.com/\"> The Atavist</a>, our sister publication, publishes one deeply reported, elegantly designed story each month. Support </p>\n<p><i>The Atavist</i>by</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://magazine.atavist.com/subscribe/\">becoming a member</a>.</p>\n<p>In all, some 250,000 people came to witness the official launch of the new U.S. Navy airship. It would be called the USS <i>Akron</i>, after the city where it was engineered and built over a span of nearly three years. Dubbed by the press “the Queen of the Skies,” it was the culmination of America’s effort to conquer the heavens using dirigibles—vessels steered through the atmosphere buoyed by gas that was lighter than air. Aviation leaders and enthusiasts were eager to see the new ship take flight; Amelia Earhart was among the luminaries who came to Akron for the launch.</p>\n<p>The city had the air of a carnival. Goodyear offered an aerial view of the festivities in a small blimp, a technological predecessor of the mighty airship, for a dollar a ride. A music teacher for the city’s schools had written a song for the occasion, and now glee clubs stood ready to belt out “Ode to <i>Akron</i>”:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Akron</p><i>, beautiful airship,</i><i>Speed on your way;</i><br/>Akron<i>, beautiful airship,</i><i>Greet lands far away;</i><i>May you carry the message,</i><i>“Brotherhood of Man”;</i><br/>Akron<i>, beautiful airship,</i><i>As the world you span</i>.</blockquote>\n<p>Thousands of people queued up in the bright sunshine to enter the egg-shaped hangar where the airship was moored. The building was so enormous it contained its own climate—rain occasionally fell inside. As the crowds streamed in, listening to no less than five brass bands blaring away, spectators blinked to adjust their eyes. Before them sat a behemoth.</p>\n<p>Locals had seen Goodyear crafts drifting overhead before—the company had manufactured balloons since 1912, and its now famous blimps since 1925—but the <i>Akron </i>was an order of magnitude larger. It stood 14 stories high, ran 785 feet long, and weighed 400,000 pounds when fully loaded, dwarfing anything that had ever taken flight. The ship’s cavernous body, formed by a skeleton of curved metal sheathed in lacquered cotton, could have held everyone assembled, though the <i>Akron</i>’s official capacity was 2,200. It required fewer than 100 crew to fly.</p>\n<p>As two radio broadcasters, James Wallington of NBC and Ted Husing of CBS, competed for superlatives to describe the ship to rapt audiences around the nation, the guest of honor arrived—the First Lady of the United States, Mrs. Lou Hoover, Herbert’s vivacious wife. She would perform the christening.</p>\n<p>Preceding her at the microphone was the man most responsible for the day: Rear Admiral William Moffett, known in military circles as the “air admiral.” He reached out his hand and placed it gently on the <i>Akron</i>’s nose as he spoke. “We do not lead the world in our merchant marine, nor, alas, in our navy,” he said,” but we do, by the construction of this great airship, now take the lead in lighter-than-air in the world.” A roar went up from the crowd.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/09/04/zeppelin-navy-aircraft-disaster/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I told you you were too good for this life. I told you that you should die because you thought that The Sea and Cake cover of “Sound and Vision” was better than the original. I didn’t really mean it. I drove you to score. I wondered if you’d have a tragic end like in the movies. <i>They only want you when you’re 17; when you’re 21, you’re no fun</i>, you sang in the car. Our lives felt tragic, and maybe they were. I bought into the romance of it. Made it feel like a movie. This was the only way I knew how to support you. Can you forgive me?</p>\n    <p>I remember when you tied me to your daddy’s bedpost, making the knots so tight I couldn’t move. You were sick of me saying no. My boner was a stand-in for yes. I didn’t have the words to ask you how you lost your virginity, the words to tell you that even though I didn’t want you like that, you were the closest to desire I had ever found. In my mind, you had always had sex. Was I even 18 then? If I hadn’t balked and begged for you to stop, I would have been a father—I’m sure of it. When people ask me about my Coney Island, I don’t have the heart to tell them; this is it. The cosmos aren’t consensual. Real life breaks you. In my dream, you would never have become a junkie. We would have named our kid Oscar. You would tell everyone that a gay man got you pregnant, and I would get so mad about it that one day we’d do it all over again. This was before the johns, when you were just a teen cokehead, a high school dropout living off the glamor of your absent daddy’s shame, before I drove you around to score, before I refused then let up just to refuse again. When it was one of your other gays who took you to your shifts at McDonald’s, to your dealers’ houses, to church. You who always needed a ride. Who was always going somewhere. Anywhere but up, you’d say.</p>\n    <p>Of course I know what Oscar Wilde has to say about stars. How many times did you recite that quote? Sneaking through the wooded trails during third period to go to my house and smoke cigarettes, coasting along country roads to your thirty-something-year-old boyfriend’s trailer in the sticks, making a home under the big Christmas tree in the mall. The cover of foliage, the hood of the car, the metal and plastic of the artificial fir: there was always a barrier between us and the night sky. It was something between protection and curse.</p>\n    <p>The first time you got arrested, the sky felt so big, it was suffocating. When I moved away, and my parents drove me the three thousand miles to the Pacific, I did nothing but encounter the mordant blankness of it, letting the pain strike me until it turned to numbness.</p>\n    <p>In my half-life since, I have learned to look at stars. You’ve got to take in the vastness like a punch to the gut. Consider your smallness. Let it mull over you. Stars have half-lives that we can’t even fathom.</p>\n    <p>Somewhere up there, Oscar is turning 18. We used to say the best die young, but eighteen years later, I feel like I’m just beginning to live. Back then, we were in the gutter, sure, but it was you who made me really look up. The absence of you, but yes, it was you.</p>\n    <p>The next time we cross paths, can you tell me if you feel the same?<br/>\n__</p>\n    <p><strong>  C.R.

When it’s ready he will call me down and seat me in the sun in the small courtyard between his house and studio, where he’s set a table for one: crisp white cloth, spotless silver cutlery. He’ll serve me orange juice, granola and coffee.</p>\n    <p>The flowers in the photograph are larger than life, velvety like the soft white skin of my inner thigh. They have been positioned against a dark background to look like a Dutch <i>vanitas </i>painting, a reminder of mortality.</p>\n    <p>My boyfriend buys me gifts: a necklace with a silver charm in the shape of an open book. He tells me he wishes he could introduce me to his parents, but they are dead. He shows me off to his neighbors at a party, wearing a new dress he chose for me.</p>\n    <p>One day I wake to find him sitting on the bed beside me. I am lying on my stomach. The bottom half of my body is naked. He has lifted the covers and, although I cannot be sure, I think he has taken a photograph.</p>\n    <p>I start to have panic attacks at work. It’s a good excuse for him to pick me up in his late model Audi, drive me back to his house and put me to bed. There’s no need to call my family or friends. He will take care of me.</p>\n    <p>One evening he is scrolling through my mobile and finds I have been messaging a friend. He hurls the phone across the room where it smacks into the wall, barely missing the picture of the flowers.</p>\n    <p>“She’s a slut!” he hisses.</p>\n    <p>He holds me down on the bed, bites my ear, presses his hands over my face.</p>\n    <p>“You’re a slut too.”</p>\n    <p>The next morning, alone in bed, I stare at the white camellias. Their broad petals seem to billow as if in a light breeze. I narrow my gaze and the flowerheads look like they are moving towards me from out of the frame. There is an object in the image I hadn’t focussed on before. It is a small human skull.</p>\n    <p>My boyfriend calls me down to breakfast. I sit at the outdoor table with my hands folded neatly in my lap, as if I am about to be photographed. He pours orange juice and steps back to watch me drink it.

Four?</i>We are curved together over the lip of the trash can as she empties her stomach. Her bile smells sweet and acrid, the desiccated remnants of a mango-pineapple mixer. A cup of ice water sits, sweating and futile, on the floor by her feet. Her skin is shiny and leached of color, amplified by the artificial lights in the windowless bar bathroom.</p>\n<p>Earlier there was a man, tall and insistent. Men are always like this around Jackie— long-stemmed preening flowers eagerly bending to hog her light. He had brought her an offering, a delicate, thin plastic shell full of ice and liquor. I had held it for her as she twirled around the bar’s dance floor and then placed it ceremoniously back in her palms, thinking nothing of it. Laughing, even.</p>\n<p>Now, I am calculating my complicity in her probable drugging. We’ve been in the bathroom for over an hour and she oscillates between leaning back against the cool dingy tile and clinging to the rim of the trash can, the black plastic liner slick with her sweat. Jackie is insistent that she doesn’t want to go to the hospital and I am reluctant to rip another shred of autonomy from her. I have become guardian of the damp feather that is her body. All of our energy, our concentration, is going into keeping her awake.</p>\n<p>When we finally leave it is a long, slow climb from the angry pit of the basement bar. Jackie is doing most of the work, each step a deliberate, desperate push. I am soothing her as she whines, though I couldn’t tell you what either of us said. As we ascend, I look for the man that did this to her. I am scared to find him, scared not to find him.</p>\n<p>Why don’t they write more survival stories like these? It’s all men and bears and wilderness. Never two girls trying to survive one night at a bar, clawing onto consciousness. Death feels so much closer here than it does in the woods.</p>\n<p>As I drive back to my house, Jackie tells me, <i>I just need you to go slower on the straight parts and faster on the turns. </i>She cannot even open her eyes, but she is telling me how to drive. This is the joke we will tell when we try to soften this night. We will excise our terror, play up the absurdity of this moment. We will laugh as though it is funny, as though we were having a really good time. But for now, I am parking and prying my hands off the steering wheel and Jackie is vomiting into the gravel that is my driveway.</p>\n<p>Inside, glittering clothes are stripped from our bodies and left in sweating piles. I sprawl on the living room floor next to her makeshift bed, nursing her. I feed her bits of popcorn piece-by-piece and watch her throat carefully for each swallow. I am both desperate to sleep and desperate not to.</p>\n<p>I think often about how the word roofie does not portray its violence, how quickly control can be ripped from your body without your consent. <i>She has been poisoned, </i>I think. Except poisoning belongs in fairy tales and there are no heroes here, just two girls suddenly aware of how frail our bodies truly are.</p>\n<p>The next morning, the view outside my house is filled with raucous twenty-somethings dressed in the trappings of nationalism, off to celebrate their freedom with fireworks and hotdogs. In my apartment, Jackie is Googling the side effects of GHB and Rohypnol. The circulating air is clicking on and off, muting and unmuting the sound of her crying. I am cleaning to keep myself from saying <i>I’m sorry, it’s not your fault, I’m sorry, it’s not your fault</i>, over and over and over again.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brevitymag.com/current-issue/girls-night/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Always moving on, never embracing soil long enough for connection. A life tumbled and tossed, and if it touches ours, it is only by chance, and ill chance more often than not.</p>\n<p>But <i>you</i> came, in a tumble and a glorious blaze, by intention and by ill chance. </p>\n<p>The night of your arrival was almost my undoing. You rode an incandescent gust tearing into our rows, escorted by a rain of hot metal. The ground rippled once with your impact, outward and onward, quicker than the fungal network could warn us. When the air stilled and the Conversation erupted in bursts of <i>pain!</i> and <i>fire!</i>, no-one knew what had crashed down on us. We sucked moisture from the deep, made the lesser plants close their ranks and smother the flames, and we calmed the Conversation with memories of renewal and regrowth. </p>\n<p>You had plummeted from the sky, the fungal network relayed, as the filament reached out again to take hold of the large swath of churned and scorched soil, of everything that lay fallen and ready to decompose. Our rootscape expanded anew, tasting the damage and the altered lay of the land. But one blank spot persisted.</p>\n<p/><p>One fragment had not shattered, tumbling over and over until it had come to rest next to me, its edge nicking a branch. Neither root nor spore found purchase there. And no matter how far and wide the Conversation was carried, this sealed structure remained unknown. It was deemed to be not of our soil. And as it lay inert, it was deemed to be not of our interest, either. We would claim it, sooner or later, either encapsulating and burying it as a curiosity in our rootscape, or it would yield after all, as everything yielded, to rain and root and frost and fungus.</p>\n<p>It cracked open on its own soon enough, right there within my reach. My sap-quenching stillness spread through the Conversation until the whole forest seemed to pause.</p>\n<p>Something fell out, toppling to the ground as if caught in a storm with no grove-kin. It just lay there, thumping fear and exhaustion against the soil in the way of the Rootless.</p>\n<p>My excitement for the unknown–<i>a Rootless from the sky!</i>, with neither nest nor burrow known to tree or spore–surged as the filament flashed agitation at its alienness: <i>not of our soil</i>. </p>\n<p>I felt delight. The quickening of survival rushed through my sapwood, and, deeper even, curiosity sprouted. I reached. With leaves rustling welcome, with a fragrance of earthy solidity, I reached.</p>\n<p>And you came.</p>\n<p>You lifted yourself up, stumbling forward until you crashed into me. I was able to sense your strangeness, a limb first to catch your fall, then your weight against me, sliding down along my base, where it stayed, almost motionless except for small, arrhythmic quivers.</p>\n<p>You were big for a Rootless, but still fragile, and possibly damaged from your violent arrival. I wanted to help and fed the Conversation with my findings: your size, your mass, the desperate grasp of your initial touch.</p>\n<p>My excitement was met with polite disinterest. To my grove-kin and my sap-kin, the Rootless were nothing but a nuisance; pests at worst, inconsequential bearers of gifts to seal alliances, found dynasties and end wars at best, and always good for erratic behavior.</p>\n<p>But I knew better. There was a pattern in their wayward bustling, and a purpose to their actions, thoughtless as they might seem. We believed they didn’t reach toward the sun, but you had fallen from the sky, and how much closer could one get? I wanted to know about the reaching and the falling, about the origin of your vagrant ways. So, as the strange quivers against my trunk became more infrequent, I decided to keep you.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/12/26/escape-pod-973-forever-the-forest/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 972: The Bargain of Death and Saint Nicholas</h2>\n<h3>The Bargain of Death and Saint Nicholas</h3>\n<p>“What’s your favorite tale?” I ask, voice quivering.</p>\n<p>My audience of thieves and killers, their gaunt, dirty faces illuminated by flickering firelight, eye me with equal parts skepticism and expectation. Their captain sits front row center, an energy rifle across his lap as a reminder of my fate should I attempt to run or, worse, fail to entertain. My stomach is eager to empty itself all over the stage of this derelict theater. Thank the spirits I didn’t eat much today.</p>\n<p>“It’s the Eve of Giving,” says the captain. “Start with <i>your</i> favorite holiday story.” Nods and grunts of assent follow from the raiders surrounding him. I curl my fingers into fists to stop them from trembling, unable to steer my mind away from the fact that my life depends on choosing the right tale to bring my bloodthirsty captors into a festive mood. No pressure.</p>\n<p/><p>I breathe deeply, letting the familiar scent of firewood smoke wrap itself around me like a hug from an old friend. How many hours had I spent by fires, listening to Dad’s tellings? “When in doubt, stick to the classics,” he’d always say.</p>\n<p>The firelight casts dancing shadows against the intricate woodwork of the walls. My chest flutters. It feels sacred to perform on a stage that hasn’t been used in centuries.</p>\n<p>I begin.</p>\n<p>“I’d like to tell—”</p>\n<p>“Speak up, young one!” the captain growls.</p>\n<p>I straighten my posture the way I’d see Dad do it and project my wavering voice as best I can. “I’d like to tell you the story of The Bargain of Death and St. Nicholas.”</p>\n<p>Several raiders lean forward, eyes widening like those of young children in the slums soaking up each of Dad’s tales. It’s an odd sensation, to command the attention and intrigue of a full room. Now I just need to keep it. An invisible burden of responsibility settles within me, the weight of the past couple days that have led to this moment. The possibility of dishonoring Dad’s memory causes my aching heart to skip a beat.</p>\n<p>“It’s a story that begins with an ending.”</p>\n<p>Yesterday, my audience was significantly less enthralled.</p>\n<p>Whenever Dad would perform a telling, every face in the crowd was the same; wide eyes, slackened jaws, every breath hanging on his next word—the exact opposite of how Dex and Flynn looked as I practiced. Dex yawned, and it froze me mid-act.</p>\n<p>“Guys, c’mon,” I pleaded.</p>\n<p>“Sorry, Penny,” Flynn said, rubbing his eyes. “It’s just not as good as when your pop tells it.”</p>\n<p>For a moment, the only sound was the crackling fire between us. I couldn’t deny the obvious, droopy-eyed boredom plastered across their dirty faces. Smoke wafted into my face and what was left of my concentration was lost to coughing. Defeated, I moped over and took a seat on the ground with my friends.</p>\n<p>“I don’t get it,” I whined, “I’ve memorized the story word for word. I even repeat Dad’s hand gestures. What’s missing?”</p>\n<p>“Some people are natural born ‘tellers,” Flynn answered, earning him a jab in the side from Dex’s elbow.</p>\n<p>“Penny’s father is the best ‘teller in the district,” Dex said. “One of the greatest New Columbus has ever had. If anyone’s born to the job, it’s her.”</p>\n<p>“Then what am I doing wrong?” I asked, wrinkling my nose to keep the welling tears at bay.</p>\n<p>“Charisma,” Flynn said flatly. Dex raised his elbow again but Flynn thrust an index finger in his face. “You know I’m right. You’re just too sweet on her to say it.” He turned to me. “Listen, Pen, I know it’s your dream to follow in your pop’s footsteps, but you’re a junker. What you <i>wanna</i> do is at odds with what you <i>gotta</i> do.”</p>\n<p>Dex hung his head, unable to argue. Life as a scavenger from the slums taught me to be a ghost, to avoid attention at all costs. These habits kept me alive outside the city walls, and I didn’t know how to turn them off while reciting tales.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/12/19/escape-pod-972-the-bargain-of-death-and-saint-nicholas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Once there were many silver boys, fleets of them, protecting the outermost parts of inhabited space against things that came from outside inhabited space.

I love the lights and the beauty and the stories that are just so lovely and end up fine. I loved those stories even when I discovered that real life rarely ties up our endings in neat bows, with the lovers getting together and the bad guy getting what he deserves. But because life is like this, that makes me love the other views of Christmas. The things that come out in the darkest time of the year. The fact that it’s cold and desolate. And the fact that we can do everything right and still get eaten.</p>\n<p>This year has me feeling rather low for a variety of reasons. Take your pick. And while I will still watch all the movies that turn out just fine, with snow on Christmas Eve and families forgiving each other and all the neighbors chipping in to save someone, I’m finding myself more in the mood for things like this story.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite movies for this time of year is <i>Anna and the Apocalypse</i>, which is a musical that takes place at Christmas and the zombie apocalypse. When watching with my adult kid, I was ashamed that they easily found the theme of the movie: Things go better for you if you strive to change. There are some characters who want to change some things in life, and others who say that everything is wonderful and nothing should ever change. You can guess who gets eaten. (Come on, it’s not a huge spoiler. You know that some named/beloved characters won’t make it till the end; it’s a zombie movie.) </p>\n<p>And that is what I get out of this story. At the end, there’s one child left to visit. It may not be triumphant. But it will be a thing. And we can be thankful for that. So don’t stagnate. Realize that just the fact that you are here, listening to this with me, is a thing, and we can be thankful for that.</p>\n<p>That was our show for this week. Our quote comes from Kurt Vonnegut: “Sing in the shower. Dance to the radio. Tell stories. Write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem. Do it as well as you possibly can. You will get an enormous reward. You will have created something.”</p>\n<p>We’ll see you next week with more short science fiction. Till then, stay safe, and stay kind.</p>\n<h3>About the Author</h3>\n<p>Greg van Eekhout is a novelist of science fiction and fantasy for audiences ranging from adult to middle grade.

Your memory, your edge against boredom, your source of inspiration. There’s always an app for whatever you need. Renee valued her phone accordingly, even celebrating it by giving way to the trend for fancy phone-cases. Its edges were bezeled with bling she’d won on a cruise the year before, and she’d had some tiny opals, legacy of her godmother, set into the center.</p>\n<p>It was an expensive, new-model phone in a pretty case, and that was probably why it was stolen.</p>\n<p/><p>Renee was in the park near work. A sunny day, on the edge of cold, the wind carrying spring with it like an accessory it was testing for effect.</p>\n<p>She set her phone down on the bench beside her as she unfolded her bento box, foil flaps levering back to reveal still-steaming rice, quivering tofu.</p>\n<p>Movement caught her eye. She pulled her feet away as a creature leaped up onto the bench slats beside her, an elastic-band-snap’s worth of fear as it grabbed the phone, half as large as the creature itself, and moved to the other end of the bench.</p>\n<p>The bento box clattered as it hit the path, rice grains spilling across the grey concrete.<br/>\nRenee thought the creature an animal at first, but it was actually a small robot, a can opener that had been greatly and somewhat inexpertly augmented and modified. It had two corkscrew claws, and grasshopper legs made from nutcrackers to supplement the tiny wheels on its base, originally designed to let it move to hand as needed in a kitchen. Frayed raffia wrapped its handles, scratchy strands feathering out to weathered fuzz. Its original plastic had been some sort of blue, faded now to match the sidewalk beneath her sensible shoes.</p>\n<p>The bench jerked as the robot leaped again, moving behind the trashcan, still carrying her phone. She stood, stepping over the spilled rice to try to get to it, but the rhododendron leaves thrashed and stilled, and her phone was gone.</p>\n<p>She went to the Tellbox to seek the help of the park’s assistant, an older model humanoid with one mismatched, updated arm, all silver and red LED readouts in contrast to the shabbier aged plastic of the original form, built in a time when a slightly retro animatronic look had been popular.</p>\n<p>“How do I get my phone back?” she demanded after recounting what had happened.</p>\n<p>The robot shook its smiling gender-neutral head. “Gone.” Its shoulders hunched toward her. “I hope you have a backup.”</p>\n<p>“Of course,” she snapped, “but that’s my phone. The case was customized. Irreplaceable.” The case reflected her, was her, as though what had been carried off was a doll-sized replica of Renee, clutched in the arms of a robotic King Kong.</p>\n<p>“Contact the owner!” she said, but the robot shook its head again.</p>\n<p>“No one owns those,” it said.</p>\n<p>“But it was modified. Who did that?”</p>\n<p>“They do it to themselves. They get thrown out, but their AI chips try to keep them going. That’s the problem with self-repairing, self-charging appliances—they go feral.”</p>\n<p>“Feral appliances?” she said in disbelief. She’d heard of such things, but surely they were few and far between. Not something that lived in the same park in which she ate her lunch every once in a while.</p>\n<p>The next few days she became a regular, haunted the park every lunch hour, looking for any sign of her phone. Her job as a minor advertising functionary gave her lunches plus “creativity breaks” that were served as well by sitting outside as by any of the other approved modes, like music or drugs.</p>\n<p>She was on a bench, scrolling through mail on her replacement phone, when she spotted the phenomenon. Tall grass divided like a comb to display a bright wriggle, then another. She didn’t move, didn’t startle them.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/12/05/escape-pod-970-red-in-tooth-and-cog-flashback-friday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

JEAN-MICHEL</p>\n<p/><p>I strap into my rig, take a really big swig from my hydration dispenser tube I call The Ultra Black Vig, and settle back to begin this all-night white-hat gig.</p>\n<p>At first, I decide to do this like the Stig, but instead I shake awake my lightbox, pull on my knee-high fuzzy socks, and momentarily disable my sigTell locks. This is my double-dog dare for Saffron Sutton to try and hack this whitefox. She and I have been doing this since the first day of SSI hacker sprints, which always takes place on the vernal equinox. Usually, I tell her she better kick rocks because my sigTell is damn well capable of delivering emotional shocks along her TruTell stalks all the way back to those frilly frocks she designs and thoroughly maligns (although, she would say signs) with a matte black gingham fox.</p>\n<p>Now, watch me as I disregard all the clocks and enter the susso-sphere where the only thing I see is multicolored sigTell stalks everywhere.</p>\n<p>They wriggle and waver and undulate, strobing vibrant colors so quickly that I can hardly even see straight. Truth and memories course along their horizon-stretching shafts amongst an innumerable amount of signature paths, and you can’t even begin to fathom the velocity of their flow rate blasts. This is the TruTell, in its most base and crudest form, and I must admit, its beauty and chroma leave me feeling all sorts of warm.</p>\n<p>But I shake my hi-def bit rates to focus and remind myself I cannot allow myself to be swayed by this TruTell hocus-pocus. This is its defense mechanism to ensure hackers don’t corrupt its environment with a pretense of altruism. I’ve heard about hackers coming in here because they were paid by clients to excise their worst fears, but instead they were distracted by the shiny-shiny pure truths of the susso-sphere.</p>\n<p>And oh, how tempting that is to corrupt.</p>\n<p>But I won’t do it, so y’all can stop trying to interrupt.</p>\n<p>There. In the blue-black glare of that indignation flare. A Jean-Michel memory Stanford Sutton Industries never wanted to share.</p>\n<p/><ul><li><strong>A HIDDEN MEMORY, AS ABRASIVE AS EMERY</strong></li></ul><p>JEAN-MICHEL FEAT. KINSLEY CHASE</p>\n<p/><p>An’ juss in case y’all can’t tell (yeah, I rock well), I do want to undergo Electric Resurrection, despite how few people have it wit my complexion. But I ain’t about to compromise my integrity juss ’cause some North Shore elitists want to minimize my talent wit parity an’ then give me a half-assed extended life as some sort of white-guilt charity.</p>\n<p>Manman mwen didn’t raise no fool.</p>\n<p>Kinsley Chase kisses her teeth an’ raise her chin at me as if we got beef. Yeah, it’s on now. Rumsfelds ’bout to start comin’ out they sheaths.</p>\n<p>“I would never reduce your performance output without your consent. Stanford Sutton Industries honors its contracts.”</p>\n<p>I shake my head. Nah, I don’t believe it. This is Stanford Sutton we talm ’bout here; his motto is “Deceive It.” But that circa 2019 Viola Davis Emmys red carpet skinload Kinsley got on right now make me wanna receive it.</p>\n<p>“I’m not estipid. My mama didn’t raise no fool. You juss sayin’ that now ’cause we in public an’ all these news trucks around. But you ain’t slick. You juss gon’ wait ’til we get behind closed doors, push a button, an’ bow! It’s done. I’ll weaker an’ slower, juss like them white boys on the North Shore those reporters back there hold so dear.”</p>\n<p>Kinsley Chase looks hurt. Her words come out first in a hesitant blurt, an’ then a sudden spurt as she tries not to be curt, but it juss don’t work. E’ry single syllable is clipped an’ sharp an’ killable.</p>\n<p>“I’ve put too much hard work into you, and I’m not about to compromise that work. Stanford Sutton has put too much money into you, and he’s not about to piss that all away. Neither I, nor he, is about to fuck this all up right now.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/11/28/escape-pod-969-code-switching-part-4-of-4/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s a look all eleven of us have, but we play it cool—or at least try to appear to.</p>\n<p>Yeah, I know that don’t make no sense.

    "body": "<p>Indian football may be struggling to get a foothold in the global game, but individual players from the country have started conquering new frontiers. On Saturday, goalkeeper Panthoi Chanu made history by becoming the first Indian to play in an Australian Lague. Sporting a bright green goalkeeping kit, Chanu turned up for her new club Metro United WFC in the South Australian Women’s National Premier League.</p>\n<p>“Bala <i>di</i> (Ngangom Bala Devi) was among the first Indian players to play abroad,” says Chanu, who has taken over as India’s No. 1 goalkeeper, over a Zoom call from Adelaide. “She had set an example for us. Since then, it was one of my goals as well, to go and play abroad. It is quite exciting to now play in a country that has hosted and done well at the Women’s World Cup.” Chanu joins a growing list of Indian women’s players, like Jyoti Chauhan (playing in Croatia) and Manisha Kalyan (playing in Cyprus), showcasing their talent abroad.</p>\n<p>Like Indian icon Bala Devi, Chanu also hails from Manipur. She was born in the village of Keirak, which has a population of around 5,000 in a family that had little to do with sports. When she was 12, in 2008, Chanu discovered football during a grassroots school sports festival and was instantly hooked.</p>\n<p>“I had no clue what football was till the grassroots festival,” says the 28-year-old. “My coach put me on left wing. Once when we were playing, an opponent hit the ball at the goalkeeper. Our goalkeeper got very scared and started crying. So, our coach asked who will play goalkeeper? I raised my hand.”</p>\n<p>At the time, still not familiar with the intricacies of the game, Chanu had gone in determined not to let a ball through in goal on her watch. “That was the beginning of my journey, and I have stayed on course since then. It has taken a lot of hard work and struggle, but that’s what makes it worth it.”</p>\n<p>Coming from a remote village meant she had to take early morning—5:15 am—bus rides to training when she was enrolled in a football academy in Imphal. A quick learner, Chanu made the Manipur junior state team and the Indian junior national camp within a year of taking up the sport. She started making strides on the senior circuit a few years later—signing up for national club Eastern Sporting United in 2012 and breaking into the Indian national team in 2014. But with many talented and more experienced goalkeepers around, Chanu had to wait for her turn before she became a permanent fixture in the team.</p>\n<p>She suffered a setback in 2021 when she fractured a shin bone and had to undergo surgery. The rehab was long and frustrating, one that pushed her to consider her future in the game. Some people also told her that she won’t be playing football again. It was the first time she had been underestimated, and Chanu strengthened her resolve to come back stronger.</p>\n<p>“Apart from the team training, I would do my individual training as well,” she tells <i>Lounge</i>. “Every day I reserve at least 30 minutes for running, and do my drills, conditioning and training for two hours apart from the practice with the team.”</p>\n<p>In the last couple of years, Chanu has emerged as India’s top goalkeeper and was part of the team that finished runners-up at the Turkish Women’s Cup, which took place in February. Her experience in international football was one of the clinchers for Metro United, who scouted her through the Women in Sports football clinic.</p>\n<p>“Panthoi is very quick and mobile, has good foot skills and is positive and strong in her ball distribution, she is a good shot stopper and confident in her one-on-one decision making,” Paul Morris, the head coach of Metro United, told <i>Lounge</i>.</p>\n<p>Having stayed away from home since the age of 12, when she attended the Manipur state camp, Chanu is used to the life of a football nomad. But she keeps in touch with her family regularly, now more than ever since Manipur has been engulfed in strife for almost a year.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/football-panthoi-chanu-manipur-metro-united-111712665828390.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Virat Kohli has the orange cap for being the top run-scorer in IPL 2024 so far. But the metric that matters much more for team results is the strike rate. And Kohli does not figure in the top 15 of that list, even if you limit it to those who have scored 100 runs or more.</p>\n<p>His strike rate is below 150, which translates to less than 9 runs an over. If you extrapolate that to the team score, it works out to a total below 180, which is likely to fall short on most T20 batting surfaces today.</p>\n<p>And that’s exactly what Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) have been experiencing. Two scores of 182 and 183, in which Kohli made 83 not out and 113 not out, were easily chased down by opponents. RCB have only one win from five matches. So, while Kohli tops the list of run-scorers, his team languishes near the bottom of the table, above only Delhi Capitals (DC).</p>\n<p>Kohli is not the only one having to come to terms with sky-rocketing strike rates leaving them behind. His batting partner for 18 soporific overs in India’s 2023 World Cup final defeat, K.L. Rahul, is getting trolled for his strike rate of 129 (less than 8 an over) in IPL 2024. But he’s not alone: DC opener David Warner, a pedigreed IPL batsman, is struggling to keep up; and Gujarat Titans (GT) skipper Shubman Gill saw his 89 not out in a total of 199 prove insufficient against Punjab Kings (PBKS), even though he scored at a brisk strike rate of 185.</p>\n<p>Strike rates have been shooting up in all formats of the game as coaches and captains are reaping the fruits of backing their batsmen to take more risks. It’s obviously more pronounced in the shortest T20 format, but the IPL has taken it sky high with its impact sub booster rocket.</p>\n<p>Introduced last year, the impact sub essentially gives teams an extra batsman, who can be a specialist or a hitter. Coaches no longer have to rely on mediocre all-rounders for batting depth. And they’re learning to make the most of it. So far, IPL 2024 has already notched up three scores of 240+ (over 12 runs an over). The entire 2023 season had one such mega score and there were none in 2022.</p>\n<p>The classic white ball template of top order batsmen to accumulate runs in ones and twos after the powerplay, waiting for the right ball to hit for a four or six, is outmoded in this scenario. Batsmen are encouraged to take down a bowler for 20+ runs in an over, instead of the safer old way of taking a single after a big hit at the start. They also keep going hard regardless of the fall of wickets at the other end, because to do any less would almost guarantee a loss for the team.</p>\n<p>Risk-taking is the name of the game. This requires stepping out to spinners to smash them—thus disrupting their length—instead of playing from the crease. It involves reverse scoops and clearing the front leg to aim for the cow corner. Batsmen anticipate a wide ball either by shifting their position laterally or holding back their stroke to give the slower ball a whack out of the park.</p>\n<p>As a result of these changes, how much a batsman scores is of less consequence than how fast he scores it. This is not to say there’s only one way to bat, because success also comes from playing according to conditions and situations. But the core principle is to maximise the batting resources instead of having any regrets about how much more could have been achieved.</p>\n<p>Take, for example, Kohli’s unbeaten 113 in Jaipur on Saturday. His strike rate was 157, well above his season average. But his top order counterparts in Rajasthan Royals (RR), Jos Buttler and Sanju Samson, had strike rates of 172 and 164. RR easily won.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/ipl-2024-indian-premier-league-impact-subs-t20-virat-kohli-111712664246513.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In the past couple of years, co-working spaces have become more popular among remote workers and freelancers as well as hybrid and full-time professionals, with many start-ups working from shared offices.</p>\n<p>In fact, a recent report by private equity advisory firm Avendus concluded that co-working spaces in the country are in an expansion mode, owing to increase in demand from start-ups and global capability centres. India’s flexible workspace market is likely to reach 126 million sq.ft (msf) within the next four years, up from 61 msf in 2023.</p>\n<p>Beyond flexibility and cost optimisation, what a co-working space offers is an opportunity for a professional to socialise and form connections with a diverse set of people—something that’s missing when you are working from the confines of your home or in a dedicated office. In a corporation, for instance, people are linked by their department or their manager, often ending up spending the entire workday with team members. A co-working space, on the other hand, allows you to select people on your own, giving strangers freedom to bond over pets, food, news, exercise regimen, even political parties.</p>\n<p>Research, too, has often highlighted the positive impact of a personalised work environment on one’s mental health.</p>\n<p>Mahesh Natarajan, a counsellor at counselling and training centre InnerSight, believes that co-working spaces started becoming more popular during and immediately after the covid era when most physical offices were either closed or they started following the remote/hybrid route. “Not having much adult company can get a bit difficult, lonely and frustrating. In such cases, being able to get to a co-working place helps connect with other professionals and feel like one is in an office space, reducing stress,” he says. “It also works great for people who live in remote locations and brings them the work-community feel.”</p>\n<p>Sahil Khan, a product and design professional working with a tech start-up, was working out of a co-working space till recently. His company is now moving out of the space and shifting to remote work—a move Khan is not happy about. “It’s always great to see other people around and also helps me with a little discipline. Some places have regular community events that help in interacting with others even if we don’t sit in the common areas,” says Khan, who’s in his 30s. “Now, with the company going fully remote, I am sad I won’t have access to the space anymore. But I have friends who work from these places, so I intend to mooch off them for access once in a while (laughs). I feel getting outside and interacting with others has a positive effect on my mental health and well-being. And depending on what my day looks like, if I don’t have too many calls or don’t need quiet focus time, I will go and work from a café.”</p>\n<p>As professionals look for newer experiences, many cafés have also started dedicating spaces for co-working facilities. The Social restaurant, which is spread across six cities, for instance, blends office and café together, where you can eat, drink as well as collaborate on ideas.</p>\n<p>Another one is the Kind Roastery &amp; Brewroom in Bengaluru. It has a “Zen Garden” to provide a tranquil space for individuals to co-create.</p>\n<p>“We believe that the environment plays a pivotal role in shaping experiences. The Zen table, with its minimalist design and serene feel, creates an atmosphere conducive to productivity and innovation,” plugs Pallavii Gupta, the founder of Kind Roastery &amp; Brewroom.</p>\n<p>Vamsi Reddy, founder of Paper &amp; Pie, a café in Bengaluru that has a co-working space, conference room and a podcast room, believes the significant shift in work dynamics owing to the impact of covid prompted a re-evaluation of traditional office spaces. “With an increasing number of freelancers, entrepreneurs and creators, the demand for a more informal and versatile set up has emerged,” he says. That’s why one needs to focus on providing a good environment, besides offering high-speed Wi-Fi, quality food and coffee, and facilities like an open co-working space, he says.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/workplace-culture-co-working-space-remote-work-employee-engagement-111712473971322.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In a career spanning five years, Bengaluru’s Ananya Bisht has worked with two bosses who were millennials, belonging to Generation Y (born between 1981 and 1996). Dealing with them wasn’t the best part of her work life, for the managers were rigid and inflexible, quite the opposite of the popular notion that millennial bosses are “chill” and prefer not to pass down any negativity to their workers.</p>\n<p>“Their job dictates their life—which is what they also expect from their team members,” says Bisht, 32, who works as a sales professional in a tech start-up. “Many millennial managers exhibit toxicity through their actions, either they will make you stay back at work until late or they will inundate you with work and set unrealistic deadlines.”</p>\n<p>Millennials are leading companies today across industries. This is in line with a prediction global consulting firm Deloitte made a decade ago: 75% of the global workforce by 2025 will be dominated by this generation.</p>\n<p>While most offices have a multi-generational workforce, it is the millennials who are increasingly stepping into managerial roles. A 2020 survey of over 1,000 people in the US by workflow automation software company Zapier concluded that at least three in five millennial employees manage direct reports.</p>\n<p>With their entry into the big office cabin, they have also introduced a different style of leadership: a “cool” boss who’s flexible, purpose-driven, and transparent in communication.</p>\n<p>Millennial leaders are “rooted in an unbounded ambition for positive impact and propel organizations forward in a fast-evolving world,” argues Keshav Reddy, a millennial and founder of Hyderabad-based Equal, a digital platform for Indians to share IDs with one click.</p>\n<p>The desire to push ahead and meet targets, however, has pushed many Gen Y bosses or managers towards overworking, so much so that they can put unrealistic pressure on themselves and their subordinates to complete tasks on time—a work ethic they have perhaps learnt from their Gen X parents. Small wonder then there are often reports stating that millennials are dealing with burnout, tiredness, and work-related stress.</p>\n<p>“Unless millennial bosses are willing to unlearn old assumptions and styles, they will alienate younger millennials and Gen Zs (who generally prefer working at their own pace, are more independent and stricter about work-life balance),” says Leena Chatterjee, organisational behaviour professor at BITS School of Management, Mumbai. “Micromanaging and being rigid can lead to high rates of attrition and disengagement.”</p>\n<p>Being too cool, where bosses seem laidback, can go the wrong way as well, if a fine balance isn’t maintained, says Delphin Varghese, 42, co-founder and chief business officer at Gurugram-headquartered digital marketing agency AdCounty Media, who has worked with Gen Y managers.</p>\n<p>“One needs to understand the difference between being relatable and creating an environment that may be potentially damaging. A forced attempt to be laidback or cool may come across as superficial and can erode trust and authenticity,” says Varghese. “It can seem like a fake attempt to connect rather than genuine leadership.”</p>\n<p>According to Anant G., 28, some “cool” millennial bosses only pretend to care about work-life balance or the well-being of their employees. “While my millennial boss may appear interested in flexible working hours or pretend to understand my caregiving responsibilities, he’s hardly taken any action in the past two years since I discussed my challenges with taking care of my ailing mother,” says Anant, who works as a content manager at an advertising firm in Mumbai. “My boss gives me some extra time to complete assignments... but I have been termed inefficient time and again.”</p>\n<p>What makes for a cool boss? It is all about setting a positive example for team members by fostering creativity and open expression to bring about inspiration, says Varghese. “There will be ups and downs, but staying consistent through all of it is what truly defines a cool boss or a great leader. A persistent positive approach is what magnifies employee motivation and drives the growth of an organisation,” he reiterates.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/millennial-bosses-leadership-workplace-culture-management-style-productivity-111712473554499.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

You can tell from the twinkle in her eyes and the gentle admiration with which she looks up at them. It’s the reason why ten of us are gathered at 7am at the Reclamation Bus Depot in Mumbai’s Bandra neighbourhood. We have been promised a tree walk, titled Mumbai Overstory. It takes its name from <i>The Overstory</i> by Richard Powers, a 2018 book about life experiences with trees. This is one of the many literary nuggets Mukhopadhyaya, 36, shares during the walk.</p>\n<p>Another thing that becomes apparent early on is that she is a performer. She holds a pose like a dancer, breaks into different accents and voices, and tells a story with the prowess of a seasoned actor. It is her background as an arts-based educator and theatre maker that makes Mumbai Overstory such an engaging walk.</p>\n<p>We finally get into the storytelling a short distance from the meeting point. Mukhopadhyaya tells us a bit about herself and what one could expect from the walk. She grew up at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) Colony in Trombay with scientist parents and a tree-loving grandmother. The latter ensured her childhood was spent ensconced in the lap of nature with lush surroundings, and a steady supply of saplings from their home state of West Bengal.</p>\n<p>When Mukhopadhyaya moved to Mumbai as an adult, she found the lack of green and camaraderie around trees disorienting.</p>\n<p>“I would talk about what’s blooming and fruiting, and people would meet me with a certain kind of confusion. It wasn’t part of their vocabulary,” she says. Mukhopadhyaya strongly feels that mapping seasonal changes in trees around us are signals of life, which should affect everyone.</p>\n<p>“I have found a lot of meaning in this—for instance, the golden orioles always arrive on the copper pods when they bloom in order to camouflage. They typically mark the arrival of spring. I lean on these markers for a sense of grounding in the otherwise mad city,” she adds.</p>\n<p>The walk was developed in 2020 as part of a workshop by Alisha Sadikot, co-founder, Art and Wonderment, a company that curates walks to deepen conversations about art in the city. “The walks can offer a look into your neighbourhood, allows walkers to recognise what’s growing around them, and establish a co-relationship with them,” says Mukhopadhyaya, who typically conducts the walk in Bandra throughout spring but has covered other locations as well in the past, such as Kala Ghoda and Lower Parel.</p>\n<p>A cross-section of common Mumbai trees, a safe path to walk on and a relatively noise-free environment on a weekend are her only parameters for a good walk. She introduces you to trees with the warmth reserved for a loved one. It isn’t an exhibit but a living, breathing inhabitant of the city.</p>\n<p>The first one is the popular Tabebuia rosea, or rosy trumpet, more commonly known as the desi cherry blossom that paints the streets and Instagram pink when in bloom. Mukhopadhyaya delves a little into the origin and history of the tree and the desirable characteristics of an “avenue tree” in the city. The next tree is<i> Alstonia scholaris </i>or devil’s tree, well-known for its sharp, sweet smell that signals the arrival of winter.</p>\n<p>The other avenue trees we meet are the popular copper pods that give the Mumbai spring its yellow carpets, and the majestic cannon ball tree, which invokes reverence and mysticism in equal measure. There’s Maharashtra’s state tree jarul, the flowery kachnar, and the strangler fig, among others.</p>\n<p>It’s unusual to be on a walking trail, looking up and not around you. A massive rain tree that shelters countless bats or a lone baobab you may have walked past before now holds your attention. Mukhopadhyaya reads out poems and prose that speak of trees, and picks up pods and seeds as souvenirs.</p>\n<p>She attempts to liken the lives of trees to our own—the fact that they resist the concrete urbanisation to spread their roots far and wide. It’s amazing to see how each has adapted—the quintessential Mumbai mango tree grows vertically, often in a zig-zag manner around buildings, adapting to the lack of space.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/mumbai-overstory-trees-walk-bandra-environment-111712378129814.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Just over a thousand years ago, on a Thursday in the year 1015, a scribe called Sujatabhadra signed off on an illustrated palm-leaf manuscript in a Buddhist monastery in Patan in Nepal’s Kathmandu Valley.</p>\n<p>The manuscript contained three important Sanskrit texts of Mahayana Buddhism: a hymn composed to the goddess Pragyaparamita by the Indian monk Rahulabhadra, called the <i>Prajnaparamita-stotra</i>; the full text of the famous sutra <i>Astasahisrika Prajnaparamita</i> and a tantric Vajrayana hymn, called the <i>Vajradhvaja-parinamana</i>. It had taken Sujatabhadra a while to prepare the manuscript; in all the time that he was working, three kings had come and gone. Sujatabhadra named all three in the manuscript.</p>\n<p>One of the special things about this manuscript, which is preserved in the Cambridge University Library in the UK, is that its gorgeous miniature paintings illustrate a number of important and popular Buddhist shrines of the time from across South Asia and the deities there.</p>\n<p>Thus, there is a shrine from Oddiyana (modern day Swat Valley in Gilgit-Baltistan), where the Bodhisattva Vajrapani was worshipped; a temple to the Sakyamuni Buddha in Pundravardhana (modern north Bangladesh); a Pragyaparamita temple on the Grihadakuta Hill (Vulture Peak in modern Bihar).</p>\n<p>The manuscript contains 15 illustrations, each depicting shrines from sites as diverse as Magadha (Bihar), Sinhala (Sri Lanka), Chandradvipa (southern Bengal) and Oddiyana (modern Swat Valley in Gilgit-Baltistan). The thing is, one thousand years after these flourishing shrines were described, none exist as sites of Buddhist veneration—an entire tradition lost to history.</p>\n<p>Except one, which still exists as a living place of worship, just as it did in Sujatabhadra’s time: Swayambhu. In the miniature painting, it is depicted is a beautiful image of a <i>shyama</i> (dark) standing Bodhisattva Avalokiteshwara, with the <i>shyama</i> and <i>shweta</i> (white) Taras for company, framed by an ornate <i>torana</i> (gate). The text says, “nepale swayambhu-lokanatha”.</p>\n<p>\n\t                                        \n\t                                    \tI have been fascinated by this survival of Mahayana Buddhism in the Kathmandu Valley for over a decade. During my many visits to Nepal, I have never missed an opportunity to explore the countless <i>bahas</i> (Newari for <i>viharas</i> or monasteries) of Patan and Kathmandu, or sit in for evening <i>aratis</i> and gatherings of <i>kirtan</i> groups as they sang praises of Mahayana deities such as Manjushri, Loknath and Tara.</p>\n<p>It moves me to imagine how, not so very long ago, such devotional songs must have been sung in monasteries and temples across Bengal, Bihar, Kashmir, Maharashtra or Assam, to these same deities. The wildly popular and highly influential cultural force of Mahayana <i>bhakti</i>—which so influenced the Hindu <i>bhakti</i> movement in India—is today, sadly conspicuous by its absence in the land of its birth. It only exists in Nepal.</p>\n<p>I decided to travel to the Valley in September last year, to experience the climax of the month-long Newari Buddhist festival of Gunla, film it and conduct interviews with members of the community with the help of a young Kathmandu-based filmmaker, Sudin Bajracharya.</p>\n<p>Gunla is an annual monsoon festival, and it holds significance for Newar Buddhists because it marks the importance of monastic dedication to the Buddha-<i>dharma</i>, and the ancient Buddhist convention of the rainy season retreat (<i>barsabas</i>). As it turned out, Sudin’s own family <i>baha</i>, in the small town of Madhyapur Thimi, midway between Patan and Bhaktapur, would become the ideal place to experience the Gunla festivities.</p>\n<p>*****</p>\n<p>“Is this your first time in Kathmandu?” my chatty InDrive bike rider asks me as we fly through the streets of Patan. “No, it’s more like my seventh,” I say. He laughs and says, “Very Good.” Then: “And you’ve never been to Swayambhu before?” And the truth is, I hadn’t. This is something I was determined to rectify.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/nepal-buddhism-newar-gunla-panchadan-swayambhu-kathmandu-111712315238025.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

By next weekend, we’ll be in the thick of it with the first of the states going to the polls. Rather than look at vote shares and candidates, our lens at <i>Lounge </i>is a bit different. It’s the way elections affect lives that is of interest to us, and we approach it through ideas of art and culture. And so, the first of our stories for this election season is about cinema’s long association with the democratic process. </p>\n    <p>Films have always been a vehicle for parties to get their agenda across to their existing and potential supporters, with Tamil Nadu’s DMK being the first party to have built its base entirely by scripting films that read like party manifestos. More than stars, films have been a vehicle for campaigning and our cover story examines the impact, either obliquely or directly, that such films have on people’s decisions.</p>\n    <p>What will you vote for or against? That’s a question to ponder, because it’s not just about people and parties, but also the ideas that need representation. A few stories in this issue address these concerns, which may seem arcane but are deeply relevant to everyday living, such as climate action, the idea of history and the future of young people. We have a piece on a multimedia exhibition on the shifting aspirations and worries of 18-to-25-year-olds. Conceptualised between 2019 and 2024, the show, <i>Notes from a Generation</i>, by Snigdha Poonam and Prarthna Singh, is a collection of stories of the lives of young people that encapsulates a generation’s views on the world they inhabit, and is a pointer to the things we should think of when we vote, no matter our age.</p>\n    <p>As always, the elections coincide with summer, which chefs and bars are welcoming with new menus that spotlight unusual ingredients. As our story points out, everything from ant pupae to vetiver root are being pressed into service as the temperature rises. And if your palate runs to more traditional tastes, you’d be interested to read about the strategy and ideas behind Karnataka’s beloved MTR Foods, which started life as a place famous for its rava idlis but is now also known for its easy-to-cook packaged foods.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Write to the editor at shalini.umachandran@htlive.com</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>@shalinimb</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/opinion/box-office-polls-voters-elections-film-111712976432145.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Over a five-week stretch starting 25 January, I saw the same scene play out thrice on the big screen in three different films. First came <i>Fighter</i>, which had a recreation of the attack by a Jaish-e-Mohammed suicide bomber on a Central Reserve Police Force convoy at Pulwama in 2019, in which 40 soldiers were killed. A month later, <i>Article 370 </i>showed the Pulwama attack. A week after that came <i>Operation Valentine</i>, which again recreated the attack and used newsreel footage of the funerals. All three films had actors essaying the role of the prime minister, either attending the funerals or addressing rallies and promising retaliation.</p>\n<p>Every other week this year, a film has released that extols the achievements or reflects the concerns of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its affiliates—the existence of Pakistan, the rights of Hindus, the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. Since the official announcement of the polling dates (19 April to 1 June), there are some restrictions on campaigning. But films continue to play in theatres across the country that openly or tacitly make a case for the ruling dispensation.</p>\n<p>“A particular piece of propaganda by itself is unlikely to shift the way somebody votes,” says Aakar Patel, author of <i>Our Hindu Rashtra</i>. “But it all helps. The volume of material—whether it’s through social media or on the big screen or the small screen or radio—will consolidate the message the party is trying to send out.”</p>\n<p>These films range from big studio releases to shoestring provocations. Some of the makers have a discernable political agenda; others just want to turn a profit. If we consider only the films released this year, three broad categories emerge: war and foreign policy (<i>Fighter, Operation Valentine</i>); internal politics (<i>Article 370, Bastar: The Naxal Story</i>); and right-wing history (<i>Main Atal Hoon, Swatantra Veer Savarkar</i>, the Telugu film <i>Razakar</i>). There are also a handful of incendiary films with trailers out that could release in the next month-and-a-half: <i>The Sabarmati Report, Accident Or Conspiracy: Godhra, The Diary Of West Bengal, The UP Files, JNU: Jahangir National University</i>. And there’s <i>Emergency</i>, directed by and starring BJP candidate Kangana Ranaut as Indira Gandhi, slated for release on 14 June, after the election results are declared.</p>\n<p>This flurry of right-leaning films comes on the back of 10 years of increasingly conservative Hindi cinema. Secular overtures in commercial films—once as common an ingredient as song and dance—are less frequent now. Spy and war films boast of an aggressive “new India”. Dissenting voices have dried up. The idea of India as a Hindu nation is often touted, especially by historical films that portray Muslim kings as cruel invaders and play up the resistance of the Rajputs and Marathas. Meanwhile, films from <i>Brahmāstra: Part One—Shiva</i> (2022) to <i>Ram Setu </i>(2022) to <i>Adipurush </i>(2023) promote different shades of Hinduism, from quasi-science to baroque fantasy.</p>\n<p>How has this pronounced slant affected Hindi cinema? Few would argue that Bollywood has made any leaps, or even small hops, in the last five or six years. Compared to other language cinemas, it looks slow-footed and timid, unsure of how to capture the popular imagination or make an incisive point. The slant has as much to do with political climate as it does with opportunism. Films favourable to the government are offered tax breaks (four BJP states made the controversial 2023 film <i>The Kerala Story </i>tax-free), talked up by leaders in rallies, their makers given awards and, occasionally, party tickets (Kangana Ranaut is contesting her first election from the Mandi Lok Sabha constituency in Himachal Pradesh; Arun Govil is standing from Meerut in Uttar Pradesh). It all adds up to a unique situation: one of the largest popular cinemas in the world, overwhelmingly for the State, but not by the State.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/bollywood-hindi-film-elections-politics-government-fighter-article-370-111712922679732.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Google Podcasts is hitting the stop button. The announcement on the winding up of the podcast app came in September last year. The service has not been available in the US since 2 April, and users were asked to migrate their subscriptions to YouTube Music, which seems like it will be Google’s prime “podcatcher” going forward. While Indian users can still access Google Podcasts on both app and web, multiple reports suggest it will not be long before other regions follow suit.</p>\n    <p>Launched in 2018, Google Podcasts has registered more than 500 million downloads on the Play Store. For me, it was an early introduction to the podcasting world through an app that was minimal design-wise and simple to use. It also had the option to add podcasts via an RSS feed. Six years down the line, I still have subscriptions to <i>Reply All</i> and <i>Science Weekly</i> on Google Podcasts. For Android users, this was perhaps the go-to app before Spotify entered India in 2019.</p>\n    <p>The <i>2024 Media Morph</i> report released on 1 April by YouGov, a UK- based market research and data analytics firm, reveals that Google Podcasts is the second most popular podcast app with 20% of Indian users, after Spotify (at 44%). Audible (15%) comes in third. Spotify is popular among GenZ and has grown in the last two years, going from 33% in 2022 to 44% in 2024. Google Podcasts saw a drop, going from 24% to 20% in the same time span. Seven in 10 Gen-Z respondents said they listen to podcasts each week (71%) as compared to two-thirds of the overall urban Indian population (67%).</p>\n    <p>“Just like Apple Podcasts, which is native to iOS devices, there was a lot of hope when Google Podcasts came into the market because it was a native app on Android devices.... I know a few people who preferred Google Podcasts because of its clean interface and searchability. It also meant downloading one less app to listen to podcasts,” says Shaun Fanthome, producer and chief operating officer at Maed in India, a podcast production company and audio consultancy based in Mumbai.</p>\n    <p>Fanthome says the app’s analytics also helped creators access interesting data points. “On the creative side, some of the data analytics that Google could provide are still not available on other platforms. It used to give you impressions and searchability information... You could find keywords being used for your podcasts when someone searched for it,” says Fanthome. “YouTube Music is an excellent opportunity. The integration is great, YouTube being the second largest search engine in the world.”</p>\n    <p>If you are not a fan of YouTube Music, there are other podcast apps that can do the job: Spotify (for creators: Spotify for Podcasters, formerly known as Anchor), Pocket Casts, Overcast and Podbean Podcast App &amp; Player, among others.</p>\n    <p>Delhi-based Razi Hasnain, who produces the <i>Shuffling Notes</i> podcast on music, has relaunched his podcasts in video format on YouTube. “But the most traffic I have seen comes from Spotify. Sometimes more than YouTube,” he says.</p>\n    <p>While Stitcher’s closure last year meant we are slowly witnessing the death of the podcast aggregator app, Google Podcasts now joins an unwanted list known among internet history enthusiasts as the “Google Graveyard”—a host of products shelved by the tech giant down the years: Google Play Music, YouTube Stories, Google Stadia and Google Duo and Hangouts.

As chef Regi Mathew, head of MTR’s Centre of Excellence (an in-house set-up that researches and archives Indian recipes and innovates food products for the brand), gave commands over the microphone, the team carefully flipped a <i>dosa</i> that was turning crisp on the stove. Loud cheers rang out when it was announced that the 123ft-long <i>dosa</i> had won the Guinness World Record title for the Longest Dosa ever made. The culinary event was part of the year-long celebrations being held to mark the 100-year-long journey of MTR. </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/carl-pei-nothing-ceo-oneplus-profile-111711634603903.html\">Also read: How Nothing CEO Carl Pei is breaking barriers</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Started in 1924 by brothers Parameshwara Maiya and Ganappayya Maiya as a restaurant called Brahmin Coffee Club, and renamed Mavalli Tiffin Rooms (MTR) in 1951, MTR is a household name for Kannadigas everywhere. While the original restaurant on Lalbagh Road in Bengaluru continues to be a major draw for food enthusiasts of all stripes, the brand is also a multi-million dollar company in the packaged food business. Its basket of 140 products includes ready-to-eat meals, breakfast mixes, traditional spices and <i>masalas </i>and sweets, among others. </p>\n<p>“Hundred years is not a common milestone and we are thinking of a range of celebrations for the entire year,” says Sanjay Sharma, 57, CEO of Orkla India, sitting in his spacious office in Koramangala.</p>\n<p>This is probably a good point to rewind to 2007 when MTR Foods, the packaged foods’ division of the parent company, was up for acquisition, allegedly due to a family split. In February of that year, it was bought by Orkla ASA, a Norwegian industrial investment company, for $80 million (around Rs.664 crore now). The restaurant business though continues to be owned by the Maiya family.</p>\n<p>As part of the reorganisation of MTR Foods, Sharma was appointed the CEO in February 2009. “It (the role) was about delivering sales, profits, growing the company and building a team,” he says. In 2020, Orkla picked up a majority stake in Kerala-based spice maker Eastern Condiments Pvt. Ltd. Last year, Sharma was appointed CEO of the newly restructured Orkla India, which comprises three business units: MTR, Eastern Condiments, and international business (set up to scale up exports in 42 countries).</p>\n<p>As the person leading the charge of established regional brands, Sharma is conscious of the magnitude of responsibility his position carries. If MTR is 100 years old, Eastern Spices turns 41 this year. “Running legacy brands comes with a tremendous amount of responsibility. It’s not just about taking the vision of the promoter ahead, it’s also about carrying the responsibility of the people who have dedicated their lives to work for these companies,” he says.</p>\n<p>As a combined company, Orkla India ranks among the top 50 largest FMCGs, and 15 largest food companies in India. But the organisation’s vision, in Sharma’s words, is to focus on their core markets. “We are counted as the sixth or seventh biggest FMCG player in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Kerala. So, our vision for the next few years is not to become a national brand in India. Instead, it is to become a national brand in these four states.”</p>\n<p>This strategy of focusing on being a big player in the local/regional area, according to Sharma, gives Orkla a competitive advantage with regard to consumers, suppliers and the trade itself. “Today, I do over Rs. 600 crore of business annually in Karnataka alone. Can you imagine the size of the potential we have to build the brand even further?”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/sanjay-sharma-ceo-orkla-india-mtr-foods-business-lounge-profile-111712850929349.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>On a Tuesday evening outside the al-Kalouti mosque in Amman, Jordan, a crowd of men, women and children has gathered. They carry Palestinian flags and hold placards that read: “Food, Water and Medicine are Rights Not Privileges” and “Stop Ethnic Cleansing”. Some display images of Benjamin Netanyahu, Joe Biden and Abdel Fattah el-Sisi alongside condemnatory messages. In a voice close to breaking, a man yells: “We’re sorry, people of Gaza.”</p>\n    <p>In Jordan, which shares a border with Israel and the West Bank, a heavy atmosphere has prevailed since October. Over half of Jordan’s population is Palestinian or of Palestinian origin, and in the capital of Amman, that number is far higher. Many have family in Palestine. “People are living in a ghost-like state,” said Jumana Abdin, a Palestinian Jordanian woman who lives and works in Amman. “It’s like my life is moving in slow motion. Looking at how the world is reacting and how people still justify the killing shows just how much our lives are worth in their eyes.” It triggers many emotions, she said, especially for the older generation that went through the Nakba, or the mass displacement and dispossession of Palestinians during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.</p>\n    <p>“In Germany you have to wonder if you might get in trouble for expressing support for Palestine, but Amman feels like a refuge,” said David Ghannam, a Palestinian German working in the development sector in Amman, who travelled to Gaza in early 2023. “There’s a sense of unity in Amman. We’re all collectively mourning the loss of innocent lives.”</p>\n    <p>Across Amman, signs of solidarity are ever-present: Palestinian flags hanging from shopfronts and in cafes; watermelon imagery on billboards, clothing and stationery; people donning keffiyehs; daily demonstrations near the mosque. Fundraisers are regularly held for Gaza, and businesses have carried out strikes in solidarity. Starbucks and McDonald's stores across the city remain empty. In supermarkets, customers are embracing local products, a shift that stems from a refusal to purchase products from countries actively supporting Israel, such as the US and Germany.</p>\n    <p>Another byproduct of the war has been a drastic drop in the number of tourists arriving in Jordan. Petra, which used to draw 4,000-5,000 daily visitors prior to October, has seen as few as 400 visitors on some days, according to the regional tourism authority. Bedouin-run shops in the famous archeological site remain deserted. “We went through difficult days because the Bedouins’ main source of income is tourism,” said Hussein W, who runs the Harmony Luxury Camp in Wadi Rum. “Now the situation is better as visitors who did come spread the word saying things here are safe and stable. But we hope for an end to the war.”</p>\n    <p>During the month of Ramadan, Amman’s streets usually come alive with decorations and a festive air descends as people break their fasts at sunset with a variety of foods. This Ramadan, however, was different. “People are [hesitant] to exhibit any sense of celebration,” said Abdin. “Streets are less busy, restaurants are emptier, and people are staying at home more. On the other hand, fasting for over 14 hours heightened our sense of solidarity with our brothers and sisters in Gaza, who are going days without food or water.\"</p>\n    <p><i>Yamuna Matheswaran is an independent journalist based in Jordan and India.</i>\n\t                                    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/amman-jordan-israel-palestine-conflict-111712737428396.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Most of the attention in Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League quarter-final with Barcelona on Wednesday will be on Kylian Mbappe, but Ousmane Dembele is also set to have a big role to play for the French club against his former side. Mbappe, who is expected to be coming up against Barca in a Real Madrid shirt next season, has 39 goals for PSG in this campaign. Dembele has only one.</p>\n<p>However, the player described by newspaper Le Parisien last week as a \"tearaway\" offers something different, even if Barcelona are all too aware of what the 26-year-old winger can do with a ball at his feet. The France star returned to his home country last August after six seasons in Catalonia, with PSG paying a reported 50 million euros ($54.3m) to sign him on a five-year deal.</p>\n<p>That relatively paltry sum in the modern transfer market for a world-class player corresponded to the amount of his release clause at cash-strapped Barca. Moving to Paris allowed the Normandy native to team up with Luis Enrique, who he said had previously wanted to sign him when Dembele was breaking through at Rennes.</p>\n<p>\"PSG had been interested in me for a long time. The first contact was when I was at Dortmund, but at that time my objective was to play for Barcelona,\" Dembele told sports daily L'Equipe earlier this season. He admitted leaving Barcelona had not been an easy decision after he flourished under the management of Xavi Hernandez towards the end of his time at the Camp Nou.</p>\n<p>“These were my two best years, with a coach who showed confidence in me. But I wanted to sign for PSG. It was more to do with Paris changing my mind than it simply being about quitting Barcelona.” And so fate has dictated that he, like Luis Enrique, will get to come up against Barcelona in this season's Champions League quarter-finals.</p>\n<p>Dembele was in a Barcelona shirt the last time the clubs met, in the last 16 in 2021, when Mbappe scored a lethal hat-trick in the first leg in Catalonia. Their previous encounter was the notorious last-16 tie in 2017, when a Barca side coached by Luis Enrique overturned a 4-0 deficit in the first leg to win 6-1 in the return.</p>\n<p>A humiliated PSG exacted revenge in August of that year by signing Neymar Junior from Barcelona, paying the 222 million euros needed to activate his release clause. Barcelona were blindsided and panicked, throwing huge money at replacements for their Brazilian superstar.</p>\n<p>They swooped for Dembele, who at the age of 20 had just enjoyed a superb season in Germany at Borussia Dortmund. They agreed to pay 105 million euros plus add-ons for a player still far from the finished article.</p>\n<p>That fee, and the even higher sum committed to signing Philippe Coutinho from Liverpool a few months later, heralded the start of Barcelona's serious financial problems which culminated in Lionel Messi leaving the club in 2021, for PSG.</p>\n<p>Dembele scored 40 goals in 185 appearances for Barcelona, a much better strike rate than he has managed at PSG, where his only goal in 34 games to date came against Monaco in November.</p>\n<p>\"If he were a better finisher he might have won the Ballon d'Or,\" Julien Stephan, the current Rennes coach who worked with a teenage Dembele at the Brittany club, said last week.</p>\n<p>Dembele may really need to weigh in with more goals next season once Mbappe has departed, but for now he has at least provided more assists than any other player in France this season, playing usually in a position on the right flank.</p>\n<p>However, the lightning fast, fleet-footed dribbler has been deployed in a withdrawn central attacking role in key recent matches -- the Champions League last-16 second leg away to Real Sociedad and the clash with fierce domestic rivals Marseille.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/champions-league-psg-vs-barcelona-kylian-mbappe-ousmane-dembele-111712666621156.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I was miserable that summer, but had little pity for myself because it was not the result of some tragic, isolated incident but of nothing other than my own personal shortcomings. I had broken things off for good with the psychiatrist – down the line we reconnected, but that summer I was twenty-three and over-certain about the way of things. I’d finally begun to outgrow the ascetic worldview I’d been raised on, newly understanding that romance was the bread and butter of life, and that the termination of a relationship didn’t signify its failure, but still I felt that losing my grip over heartache wasn’t within my financial means. I had no income, was a graduate student of the worst kind – art school – and I wasn’t even one of those creatives who could make art out of a heartbreak. No, for me, heartbreak meant breathing shallowly in bed until the cracks of my eyes burned from salt and any hint of sunlight made me flinch.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The semester ended in the first week of May, after which I was supposed to go home to Fukushima for a month until the start of my internship. The internship was poorly paid, but I had wanted it badly in order to structure my summer around my writing. Before that, though, I had to return to Fukushima to take care of my mother. There wasn’t anything wrong with her other than that she was lonely. It was probable that, despite being around people more regularly as a condition of youth, I was even lonelier than she was; but, while loneliness wasn’t something I minded for myself, it bothered me considerably to think of my mother as lonely. Besides, the pulsating cries of forest cicadas would, in a satisfying manner, mirror the throes of getting over the psychiatrist. But when I went to the pharmacy to get PCR-tested the day before my flight, the results came back positive. I’d had the virus months earlier and knew I couldn’t have contracted it again so soon. Do you have a record of a positive test? asked the travel agent, when I tried to explain this on the phone. If I did, it would be lost in the dumps of trash heaps in some far-off borough, exported from the garbage chute of the psychiatrist’s apartment where we had quarantined together, a week during which I had been the sicker one and he had taken care of me, a real doctor with a permanent pinch between his dark, pensive eyes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The travel agent hung up. I was lying face-up in a sliver of space at the foot of my bed, the rest taken up by stacks of books and other items I had planned to fit inside the suitcase on the floor. I didn’t bother removing the phone from my ear. Somehow, the virus had stayed in my system, and I was unable to resist extrapolating some cosmic meaning from the endurance of both the virus and my heartache. Loud banging noises of cupboards opening and closing came from the kitchenette. Emily, undoubtedly trying to fix something she deemed disorganized, although no matter how much things moved around she wasn’t satisfied. It was the apartment itself she had a problem with, it not only lacking storage space, but furnished with old, rickety appliances. Each bang shot down the slim corridor that led to my small room.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/lover-cay-kim/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Emily St George died thinking of oysters. The obituary writer didn’t know this, of course.</p>\n<p>What the obituary dictated was that Emily St George passed away at the age of fifty-seven, while on a short-lived vacation to a coastal town in Brittany, during the month of March. The writer indulged in descriptions of Emily’s ‘lunar’ skin under an ‘ephemeral’ muslin shirt, and it was these allusions to chilly Brittany, as well as to her inadequate clothes, that meant the newspaper accidentally captured Emily St George’s final mental state. Emily St George died of a heart attack buying oysters at a market stand, died thinking of oysters while buying six of them: no wonder she was a translator, but usually Emily St George was very careful in avoiding literalisms and easy metaphors.</p>\n<p>At half past noon, she told the vendor that she wanted to eat them on the beach, sitting on her flimsy folding chair while facing the ocean. She wished she had a wooden chair rather than a plastic one – nobody told her what the March wind could be like in Brittany. She had only ever travelled there in the summer, and according to what the oyster vendor told the obituary writer, she looked flustered, as if she had just pulled out patches of hair. The vendor was sorry about her death and also about the wind. He wished foreigners knew better.</p>\n<p><em>Oyster</em> was a disturbing word for Emily St George. It forced her to think of translation, her longstanding occupation, as well as the recent change in her circumstances. As the obituary carefully noted, Emily St George was known among her inner circle for being an inveterate translator of romance novels from English into Italian. The newspaper didn’t cover the fact that lately work had dried up and Emily had started discussing the terms of her early retirement with her accountant. She had flown to Brittany because she didn’t want to acknowledge that fact either. The Italian publishing house was really sorry, they valued Emily’s contribution over the years, but they couldn’t keep flooding newsstands with pocket romances. Demand was changing, new trends were emerging overseas.</p>\n<p>Had the newspaper cared enough about Emily’s life to publish a more accurate obituary, surely a less poetic one, the editors would have learned that according to her many friends, Emily St George never traveled off season. The real motive behind the six oysters for lunch, the choice of coastal location in late winter, and the subsequent extreme wind on the day of her death, could be traced back to a phone call Emily had taken with her publisher one day in early February. After the call was over she’d started firing off texts to her friends right away, overcoming her secret shame and fear of being at fault in the whole matter. Her fear that her work had gone out of fashion. The recurring nightmare that an aging translator was like a glass of natural wine before it became widely popular.</p>\n<p>The taste of her translations must have gone musty and funky but no one had the guts to say so and pretended to like her wine out of politeness. On the other hand, not all translations were supposed to be palatable. In the case of old-fashioned romance novels, Emily knew that too much attention to style and language could spoil the product and take away the fun. Those books were supposed to be rancid.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/obituary-of-a-soft-porn-translator/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
