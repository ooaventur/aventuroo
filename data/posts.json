    "body": "<p>Next weekend, museums and galleries across the city emerge from their summer slumber to premiere their fall offerings. That doesn‚Äôt mean you should wait to see art. We‚Äôve compiled a list of 10 current exhibitions that continue into the fall and winter months. Some are crowd pleasers, such as Hilma af Klint at MoMA, Moomins creator Tove Jansson at the Brooklyn Public Library, and Red Grooms and Mimi Gross at the Brooklyn Museum. Others call for more critical thought or social engagement, as in Ben Shahn at the Jewish Museum, Rashid Johnson at the Guggenheim, and <i>Casa Susanna</i> at The Met. You can also hop a train to see the sublime woven vessels of Jeremy Frey at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich, Connecticut, or head to The Met‚Äôs rooftop on a sunny late-summer day to see the acoustic sculptures of Jennie C. Jones. And for the rainy days ahead, we‚Äôve included an online project by Basel Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme presented by the Dia Art Foundation.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>LONDON ‚Äî How best to paint the scorned, the marginalized, the lost to view?</p>\n    <p>This was the challenge that faced the French artist Jean-Fran√ßois Millet in the middle years of the 19th century. His subject was the peasantry who worked on the land, owners of small plots of their own, or itinerant laborers such as a sawyer who, swiftly and dangerously, would take down your diseased tree and chop it into pieces for the local women to haul away on their backs, almost doubled down under the weight of it all.</p>\n    <p>Despite the fact that Millet was a hero to van Gogh for the way he drew attention to the nobility and heroism of the seldom howling underdog, the man himself has been little on public view in London in recent years. In fact, <i> Life on the Land</i> at the National Gallery is his first significant outing for half a century. It is well worth the wait.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/x12286-A5-1200x1631.jpg?resize=1200%2C1631&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Millet himself was born into relative prosperity. His family farm was in the hilly, lush countryside surrounding the village of Gruchy in Normandy. From there he traveled south to the flat plain of Barbizon, not far from Paris.</p>\n    <p>This exhibition is relatively modest in size. The walls are painted a rich, deep blue, which helps to vivify this fairly compact gathering of 15 paintings and six drawings. The works seem to draw in on themselves, thereby enriching their singular presence here.</p>\n    <p>Millet was very interested in the postures of his figures ‚Äî how they bend, lean, twist, turn, and heave on whatever tools they might have to hand. Theirs is backbreaking work, endured over long hours. He was much given to portraying the peasantry in shoes, usually clogs. In contrast, many painters of this time were inclined to show them shoeless, as if the earth beneath one‚Äôs feet was a soft carpet for skipping over. Not so. Nature has its rocks, stones, and briars. A sentimental Parisian idealist with no experience of the countryside would probably know nothing of such thorny matters.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/x12352-A5-1200x1722.jpg?resize=1200%2C1722&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>One of the exhibition‚Äôs most dramatic paintings, ‚ÄúWood Sawyers‚Äù (1850‚Äì52), is about hard, sheer physical labor. Two sawyers are engaged in the sweaty push and pull of chopping up a huge felled tree. How they lean and bend into their task, bracing themselves, toiling against, fighting back! The men seem so small when set against the heft, weight, and muscular presence of the mighty trunk. The man with his back to us, his slightly bowed legs wide spread in gleaming emerald trousers, has an undoubted elegance about him ‚Äî as do so many of Millet‚Äôs rural laborers, who often worked alone in fields. Part of his task was to draw attention to their dignity.</p>\n    <p>His paintings often divided the critics of his time. Conservatives condemned him as a covert subversive, and perhaps even a dangerous radical, while progressives applauded the fact that he turned his back on the gaudy glitter of kings, potentates, and dignitaries.</p>\n    <p>Like these two sawyers, he painted on, not to be deflected from the task at hand.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/N-6447-00-000029-A5c-1200x1689.jpg?resize=1200%2C1689&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/x12343-A5c-1200x845.jpg?resize=1200%2C845&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/X-12292_NEW_A5c-1200x1500.jpg?resize=1200%2C1500&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/x12342-A5-1200x1020.jpg?resize=1200%2C1020&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/exhibitions/millet-life-on-the-land\">Millet: Life on the Land</a>\n      <i> continues at the National Gallery (Trafalgar Square, London England) through October 19.¬†The exhibition was curated by Sarah Herring.</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040299/jean-francois-millet-no-kings-movement-for-19th-century-art/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A footnote states that examples of complicity include ‚Äúwhitewashing or justifying genocide and apartheid, and/or partnering with the government committing them.‚Äù</p>\n    <p>The boycott targets ‚Äúinstitutional complicity,‚Äù and not individual identity, according to a  <a href=\"https://filmworkersforpalestine.org/#pledgefaq\">Frequently Asked Questions page</a> accompanying the pledge. Entities affected by the boycott include cinemas, broadcasters, production companies, and major film events like the Jerusalem Film Festival, Haifa International Film Festival, Docaviv, and TLVfest. <i>Hyperallergic</i> has contacted those entities for comment.</p>\n    <p>The FWP campaign draws inspiration from Filmmakers United Against Apartheid, a boycott founded in 1987 by directors Jonathan Demme and Martin Scorsese to pressure the United States film industry from distributing work in apartheid South Africa as part of the international anti-Apartheid movement.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/sundance-fwp-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/kneecap-fwp-1200x1500.jpg?resize=1200%2C1500&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Among the signatories are names frequently seen in protests and campaigns for Palestine.

    "body": "<p>On November 29, 1947, an exhibition featuring 53 oil paintings by the Palestinian-Lebanese artist Maroun Tomb opened at a Maronite church in Haifa, Palestine. It would be Tomb‚Äôs last exhibition in the nation. The show‚Äôs opening date also marked the United Nations‚Äôs approval of Resolution 181, the Partition Plan of Palestine, which eventually led to the <i>Nakba</i>. 750,000 Palestinians, including Tomb and his family, were expelled from their homeland or forced into exile. Most of his body of work, including the oil paintings in that exhibition, was lost when Israel annexed Haifa.</p>\n<p>A new Montreal exhibition, <a href=\"https://www.thelostpaintings.com/about-1\"> The Lost Paintings: A Prelude to Return</a>, will pay homage to those 53 lost paintings, featuring that exact number of works by all different artists and spanning a range of disciplines, including drawing, sculpture, and video. Curated by Rula Khoury, Jo√´lle Tomb ‚Äî Maroun‚Äôs granddaughter ‚Äî and Haidi Motola in collaboration with the institution Montr√©al, arts interculturels (MAI), the exhibition is on view at two spaces: MAI and articule.¬†</p>\n<p>For the curators, sharing <i>The Lost Paintings</i> during the ongoing genocide of Gaza initially seemed troubling. ‚ÄúThe idea for this exhibition was born at the beginning of 2021,‚Äù says Motola. ‚ÄúNow, when we are witnessing with horror the ultimate colonial violence of erasure and destruction in the form of the genocide and ethnic cleansing, it suddenly felt ‚Ä¶ futile and irrelevant.‚Äù With time and feedback from the artists, Motola eventually felt differently. ‚ÄúThe urgency of continuing to talk about Palestine, the ongoing Nakba, the colonial violence, and resistance became stronger.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The origin story of <i>The</i> <i>Lost Paintings</i> is one of serendipity and coincidence. Jo√´lle is the eldest of Tomb‚Äôs grandchildren, and ‚Äúgrew up surrounded by his presence.‚Äù His work adorned the walls of all five of his children‚Äôs homes, transforming them into ‚Äúminiature museums filled with his vision, colors, and spirit.‚Äù Though Tomb was known to be a prolific painter in Lebanon, Jo√´lle was surprised to learn during her research that he‚Äôd been an active exhibiting artist in Palestine, too. By chance, she met Motola, whose grandfather, also an artist, was a friend of Tomb‚Äôs in Haifa.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúTomb and his family belonged to the Maronite community,‚Äù Motola explains. ‚ÄúHis uncle was the head of the community, and in the old church book, you can find traces of the family history. I discovered the archival documents revealing the story of Tomb‚Äôs lost exhibition while working on another project about Haifa and my family archives.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Just a few documents from the show remain, including a full list of work titles. The pieces by the 53 participating artists who were invited to reflect on this checklist are titled after or in response to Tomb‚Äôs. ‚ÄúThe invitation to reimagine these titles opens the possibility to imagine not only what was, but also what could be,‚Äù Motola says. Many of the artists are from Palestine ‚Äî ‚ÄúArab ‚Äô48 [Palestinians who now live within the borders of the Israeli state since its founding in 1948], the West Bank, Gaza,‚Äù says Khoury ‚Äî or part of the diaspora. Some of Tomb‚Äôs relatives, including his son Fouad Tomb and his granddaughters Lorena and Sandra Tomb, are included.</p>\n<p>Participating artist Joanna Barakat was inspired by Tomb‚Äôs title ‚ÄúZoo Garden ‚Äì Cairo‚Äù because her own father was once photographed there in the 1930s. ‚ÄúShe painted this photograph of him,‚Äù Khoury shares. Artist and designer Mado Kelleyan created a virtual reality experience telling the story of her grandparents, who, like Tomb, lived in Haifa. Painter and collagist Raed Issa,<strong> </strong>who recently escaped Gaza, was able to take a series of paintings and small drawings he started making in 2023 with him. ‚ÄúThis is a continuous Nakba since 1948,‚Äù Khoury says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still relevant.‚Äù</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039767/palestinian-artist-haroun-tomb-final-exhibition-in-his-homeland/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

They describe the pink, round-headed </p>\n    <p><i>Careproctus colliculi</i>, dubbed the bumpy snailfish; the black, rounded-headed</p>\n    <p><i>Careproctus yanceyi</i>, or dark snailfish; and the long, black</p>\n    <p><i>Paraliparis em</i>, or sleek snailfish.</p>\n    <h4>Fun fact: Snailfish live in wide-ranging places</h4>\n    <p>Researchers know about <a href=\"https://www.mbari.org/news/mbaris-advanced-underwater-technology-reveals-a-new-species-of-deep-sea-snailfish/\">more than 400 species</a> of snailfish, which live in diverse habitats from tide pools to deep-sea trenches.</p>\n    <p>‚ÄúTwo of these are black snailfishes collected on the same dive by the submersible Alvin,‚Äù <a href=\"https://www.geneseo.edu/gerringer-mackenzie\">Mackenzie Gerringer</a>, lead author of the study and a biologist from the State University of New York College at Geneseo, tells <a href=\"https://www.iflscience.com/adorable-new-species-of-snailfish-filmed-3268-meters-below-the-sea-and-theres-a-video-80716\"> IFLScience</a>‚Äôs Rachael Funnell. ‚ÄúThe fact that two undescribed species of snailfishes were collected from the same place, on the same dive, at one of the better studied parts of the deep sea in the world highlights how much we still have to learn about our planet.‚Äù</p>\n    <p>Researchers using a submersible collected those two species‚Äîthe dark snailfish and sleek snailfish‚Äîat a depth of 13,513 feet at Station M, a deep-sea research observatory around 130 miles from California‚Äôs central coast.</p>\n    <p>The bumpy snailfish, meanwhile, was collected by a remotely operated vehicle at 10,722 feet below the ocean‚Äôs surface in Monterey Canyon, California. This bubblegum-pink fish is ‚Äúpretty adorable,‚Äù as Gerringer tells the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/08/science/fish-ocean-deep-sea.html\"> New York Times</a>‚Äô Alexa Robles-Gil.</p>\n    <p>All three newly described species are members of the snailfish family <a href=\"https://www.fishbase.se/summary/FamilySummary.php?ID=615\">Liparidae</a>.

In general, <a href=\"https://www.mbari.org/news/mbaris-advanced-underwater-technology-reveals-a-new-species-of-deep-sea-snailfish/\">snailfish</a> have large heads and gelatinous bodies, and many of them have a suction disk on their bellies. This disk allows them to stick to rocks or the seafloor and hitchhike on other animals. Of the new species, only the sleek snailfish lacks a suction disk.</p>\n    <p>Snailfish ‚Äúcome in beautiful colors,‚Äù including blue, pink, white and purple, <a href=\"https://directory.whoi.edu/profile/johanna-weston/\">Johanna Weston</a>, a deep ocean ecologist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who did not participate in the study, says to the <i>New York Times</i>. ‚ÄúThey also have a lovely little smile on their face.‚Äù</p>\n    <p>To define the three species, the team sequenced the DNA of each fish and documented details regarding their size, shape and other physical characteristics, including number of vertebrae.</p>\n    <p>‚ÄúThe two species collected at Station M are cryptic‚Äîtheir external morphologies are similar to one another,‚Äù <a href=\"https://www.ccom.unh.edu/person/brett-woodworth\">Brett Woodworth</a>, a co-author of the study and oceanographer now at the Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping Joint Hydrographic Center, says in a <a href=\"https://www.geneseo.edu/news/suny-geneseo-researchers-name-three-new-species-deep-sea-fishes\">statement</a>. ‚ÄúThrough both forms of identification, we were not only able to distinguish between the two species, but we could compare them to known species to gain better understanding of snailfish evolution in the deep sea.‚Äù</p>\n    <p>The dark snailfish, <i>C</i><i>. yanceyi</i>, was named after Whitman College‚Äôs deep-sea biologist <a href=\"http://people.whitman.edu/~yancey/\">Paul Yancey</a>, who was not involved in the study. <a href=\"https://www.soest.hawaii.edu/soestwp/about/directory/jeffrey-drazen/\">Jeffrey Drazen</a>, an ecologist at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and a study co-author, explains in another¬†<a href=\"https://www.whitman.edu/whitman-stories/newly-discovered-deep-sea-fish-named-in-honor-of-whitman-professor\">statement</a> that Yancey‚Äôs work ‚Äúfundamentally shaped our understanding of deep-sea animal adaptation to high pressure.‚Äù</p>\n    <p>The scientific name for the sleek snailfish, <i>P. em</i>, is a nod to Station M, and the bumpy snailfish, <i>C. colliculi</i>, was named for its skin texture.</p>\n    <p>Ultimately, the study advances our <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/humans-have-seen-only-0001-percent-of-the-worlds-deep-seas-leaving-most-of-the-planet-a-vast-mystery-180986597/\">still-murky</a> knowledge of the diverse creatures populating the Earth‚Äôs largest habitat: the dark landscape of the deep ocean.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/biologists-discover-three-new-deep-sea-fish-species-and-theyre-surprisingly-cute-180987308/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep. Was that exhausting to read? Well, imagine if that noise was the soundtrack to your summer.</p>\n<p>To the ire of many city dwellers this year, it is. The piercing and persistent sound, something akin to a half-bothered fire alarm you accidentally set off, has been everywhere. Its origin? Lime e-bikes, specifically the stolen variety.</p>\n<p>The bikes, which have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/15/i-want-them-all-crushed-the-council-poised-to-ban-dangerous-lime-bikes\">become ubiquitous</a> in London and other cities, cost 27p a minute to ride, plus a ¬£1 unlock fee in the capital. Those hoping to get around without paying a penny have resorted to naughtier (and noisier) ways of doing so.</p>\n<p>There are video tutorials available online on how to break into Lime e-bikes. When someone manages to bypass their lock and ride around for free, it emits a continuous beep, beep, beep sound.</p>\n<p>The noise is supposed to be a deterrent ‚Äì a sonic advertisement to all who pass by that the rider is a cheat ‚Äì but considering how prevalent it has become, it seems as though boosting a bike has become not only an acceptable course of action but even a lifestyle choice.</p>\n<p>On a balmy Friday afternoon in lush and leafy Clissold Park in east <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london\">London</a>, I played the beep, beep, beep sound to sun seekers, who recognised it instantly. During the course of our conversation, offending e-bikes sped around people, including children, along the park‚Äôs paths.</p>\n<p>Ellie Roberts said she heard the sound daily, describing it as the ‚Äúbirdsong of Hackney‚Äù.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt keep me up but it bothers me,‚Äù said Roberts, 47, who works in advertising. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an indication of low-level crime on an ongoing basis.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Her friend, Sinead McKenna, 49, is more fond of the persistent sound. ‚ÄúI quite like it, it‚Äôs the sound of the summer,‚Äù said the solicitor.</p>\n<p>Schoolkids are often seen whizzing around on the beeping bikes, despite under-18s being banned from using the service. ‚ÄúI genuinely like [the sound] because I think if I was a kid, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd do,‚Äù said McKenna, laughing. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the fact that Lime is making a lot of money and they have a responsibility. I don‚Äôt blame the kids for it.‚Äù</p>\n<p>There was little sympathy for Lime in evidence. ‚ÄúWhy is it that they can make money off public space?‚Äù said Sebastian Eyre, 34, who runs a pizza company. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt actually mind [the sound] because it‚Äôs usually kids. Lime have done their evil, so let the kids get a free ride.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Eyre, who lives in Sydenham, said he heard the dreaded beep, beep, beep ‚Äúa couple times a day‚Äù. He reckons in his pocket of south-east London people are riding stolen bikes ‚Äúnine time out of ten‚Äù, based on how often he hears the sound.</p>\n<p>A small stroll outside the park, on a road where cafes and bakeries that are the calling card of gentrification lie, Lime bikes were also seen whizzing up and down.</p>\n<p>Clad in Lycra and a bike helmet seldom seen on those zipping around on Lime e-bikes, John Villeneau said there had been a ‚Äúmassive increase‚Äù in the number of them available in the area.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIf you just go to any of the pubs, there used to be a group of 10 bikes outside. Now, there‚Äôs like 50. There‚Äôs just hundreds of bikes outside on a Friday night because everyone Limes it up and Limes it back,‚Äù said the 59-year-old non-practising solicitor.</p>\n<p>He said he hears the beep, beep, beep sound a lot but doesn‚Äôt mind it. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre forced to take a Lime bike and not pay for it and you have to put up with that noise yourself, who cares? I don‚Äôt care,‚Äù he said.</p>\n<p>He has given the e-bikes a go himself, but he‚Äôs not a big fan. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not keen. They‚Äôre expensive and I can‚Äôt be bothered. The last couple of times I‚Äôve ridden them into town, you have to go to a designated place and all that crap.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Jane, 68, a former teacher, who did not want to provide her last name, visited Clissold Park for the first time in over a year since moving out of the area.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/20/stolen-lime-bikes-sound-of-summer-city-london\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.¬†<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>The gently undulating gravel trail in the country‚Äôs most sparsely populated region is not only a beginner-friendly cycle, it‚Äôs also enjoyed by people with a wide range of physical abilities.</p>\n<p>Natalie Gauld, 58, who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2022, has completed the West Coast Wilderness Trail multiple times and contributed to the trail‚Äôs <a href=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/74969/1734467237-west-coast-wilderness-trail-accessible-ride-guide-updated-november-2024.pdf\">accessible ride guide</a>. ‚ÄúIt makes me feel capable,‚Äù said Gauld on a phone call before my trip. ‚ÄúI enjoy its remoteness.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The 133km trail from Ross to Greymouth (or vice versa) is one of 23 <a href=\"https://www.nzcycletrail.com/\">NgƒÅ Haerenga Great Rides of New Zealand</a>. It‚Äôs in the West Coast region, a narrow strip of land roughly 600km long wedged between the frozen Southern Alps and the palm-fringed Tasman Sea. Its diverse ecosystems bizarrely buddy up: icy slopes and glacial rivers with steamy rainforests and pebbly beaches.</p>\n<p>Viewing the world from handlebars is the way my husband, Paul, and I typically like to travel. Long, short, challenging, easy-going; we‚Äôre not fussy once we‚Äôre immersed in the landscape on two wheels. Having said that, we are not fans of lugging our kit or working out the best places to stop, eat and sleep. So <a href=\"https://www.adventuresouth.co.nz/New-Zealand/Cycle-Trails/West-Coast-Wilderness-Cycle-Trail\">we joined three other riders on a five-day supported journey</a> with cycling and walking specialists Adventure South NZ, who took care of the tedious logistics and planned snack stops and short side hikes to several <a href=\"https://westcoast.co.nz/visit/see-do/scenic-attractions/\">West Coast scenic spots.</a></p>\n<p>A bridge closure meant we had to slice off the first 15km or so and saddle up on the road outside Hokitika in the lashing rain. ‚ÄúA real West Coast welcome,‚Äù said our tour guide, Tereza Unzeitigova. The soggy start was forgiven as soon as we ducked into the protection of a mossy native rainforest. The West Coast is the only part of New Zealand where significant tracts of lowland rainforest remain, which includes giant podocarp trees that hark back to Gondwanaland.</p>\n<p>The boardwalk traverses <a href=\"https://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/habitats/wetlands/wetlands-by-region/west-coast/\">Lake Mahinapua‚Äôs wetlands</a>, where the soundtrack was a sonic experience all its own. For the unversed, like me, it could have been anything from swans, ducks and royal spoonbills to bellbirds, t≈´ƒ´, kerer≈´ or cuckoos. A coastal hug back to our accommodation in Hokitika completed the first 20km.</p>\n<p>‚Äú‚ÄòCoasters‚Äô have to be more self-reliant because we‚Äôre geographically isolated,‚Äù said Adventure South NZ host Rob Pieper, who served the group a paddock-to-plate dinner of zucchini soup, organic beef goulash and vegetarian dahl with rice that evening at his architecturally designed off-grid home. ‚ÄúIf we have an earthquake, we could be on our own for months.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Pieper and his wife, Col, prepare cyclists‚Äô meals for the tour group. It is a natural fit for the delightful tandem-riding couple originally from the Netherlands, who ‚Äì along with managing their smallholding, situated on the coast at Ruatapu in a rare white heron habitat ‚Äì ‚Äúmake it work‚Äù by guiding, nursing, catering and school-bus driving.</p>\n<p>After a restful night at the Beachfront hotel in Hokitika, we got a bird‚Äôs eye view of the native forest on a <a href=\"https://treetopsnz.com/\">walk in the treetops</a>, before continuing the ride on a narrow trail alongside the babbling waters of the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alltrails.com%2Ftrail%2Fnew-zealand%2Fwest-coast%2Fkaniere-water-race-walkway&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/jun/14/remote-and-accessible-cycling-new-zealands-west-coast-wilderness-trail\">Kaniere water race</a>. Before my trip, Gauld told me she can pedal her Motom here after ‚Äúpinch points‚Äù on the trail were widened.</p>\n<p>Following a homemade lunch in a repurposed woolshed with Rob and Col, we spent the remainder of the day riding the shores of Lake Kaniere and hiking into the azure awe of <a href=\"https://westcoast.co.nz/visit/discover/highlights/hokitika-gorge/\">Hokitika Gorge</a>. Its glacial waters carry precious pounamu (greenstone) from the mountains down to the sea.</p>\n<p>Time-poor doctors Nikhil Patel, 36, and Anvi Butala, 31, chose the trail because it packs multiple experiences into a relatively short trip. In preparation for the ride, Butala found a hill near where she lives and rode it 10 times in one training session, she told me.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/jun/14/remote-and-accessible-cycling-new-zealands-west-coast-wilderness-trail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The world‚Äôs first randomised controlled trial for broken heart syndrome has found that 12 weeks of tailored cognitive behavioural therapy, or a heart recovery exercise programme involving swimming, cycling and aerobics, helped patients‚Äô hearts recover.</p>\n    <p>Details of the breakthrough were revealed at the European Society of Cardiology annual congress in Madrid, the world‚Äôs largest heart conference.</p>\n    <p>Dr David Gamble, a clinical lecturer in cardiology at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/universityofaberdeen\">University of Aberdeen</a>, who presented the research, said: ‚ÄúIn takotsubo syndrome, there are serious effects on the heart, which may not return to normal. We know that patients can be affected for the rest of their lives and that their long-term heart health is similar to people who have survived a heart attack.‚Äù</p>\n    <p>The trial data highlighted the importance of ‚Äúthe brain-heart axis‚Äù, Gamble said.</p>\n    <p>‚ÄúIt shows that cognitive behavioural therapy or exercise could help patients along the road to recovery. Both are very cost-effective interventions, and we hope that further studies could lead to them being used to help this underserved group.‚Äù</p>\n    <p>The study involved 76 patients with takotsubo syndrome, 91% of whom were women and the average age was 66. Patients were randomly assigned to receive CBT, the exercise programme, or standard care. All received all other care and treatment recommended by their cardiologist.</p>\n    <p>The CBT group had 12 one-to-one weekly sessions, adapted specifically to their condition by the researchers, as well as daily support if needed.</p>\n    <p>The exercise group went through a 12-week exercise course, which included cycling machines, treadmills, aerobics and swimming, gradually increasing in number of sessions and intensity each week.</p>\n    <p>Researchers used a sophisticated imaging technique called 31Pmagnetic resonance spectroscopy, which allowed them to study how patients‚Äô hearts were producing, storing and using energy. In the CBT and exercise groups, there was a significant increase in the amount of fuel available to patients‚Äô hearts to allow them to pump, which was not seen in people who had usual care.</p>\n    <p>The average distance that patients that had CBT could walk in six minutes increased from 402 metres to 458 metres. People who completed the exercise programme were able to walk an average of 528 metres in six minutes, compared with 457 metres at the start.</p>\n    <p>There was also an increase in patients‚Äô VO2 max ‚Äì their body‚Äôs maximum oxygen consumption at peak exercise ‚Äì of 15% in the CBT group and 18% in the exercise group. Increases in walking distance and VO2 max are signs of improvement in health.</p>\n    <p>The findings suggest the treatments could produce long-term benefits such as reducing symptoms and the risk of dying for those with broken heart syndrome, experts said.</p>\n    <p>Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, a clinical director at the British Heart Foundation, which funded the trial, said: ‚ÄúTakotsubo syndrome can be a devastating condition that can affect you at a really vulnerable time if triggered by a major life event.</p>\n    <p>‚ÄúPeople may not be as surprised that an exercise programme helped heart patients, but it is intriguing that this study also showed that cognitive behavioural therapy improved heart function and patients‚Äô fitness. More research is needed to find out whether these approaches improve survival or symptoms over the long term.‚Äù</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/30/exercise-therapy-mend-broken-heart-syndrome-takotsubo-study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The study adds to a long list of reproductive harms associated with Pfas exposure.</p>\n    <p>‚ÄúPrior studies have identified that Pfas were associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, but the potential influence of Pfas‚Äôs exposure on [recurrent miscarriages] remained uncertain,‚Äù the study‚Äôs authors, with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, wrote. ‚ÄúOur investigation identified significant associations between [some Pfas] and increased risks of unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortions.‚Äù</p>\n    <p>Pfas are a class of about 16,000 chemicals typically used to make products that resist water, stains and heat. They are called ‚Äúforever chemicals‚Äù because they do not naturally break down and accumulate in humans and the environment. The chemicals are linked to cancer, kidney disease, liver problems, immune disorders, and other serious health problems.</p>\n    <p>Some Pfas compounds are linked to developmental issues like birth defects and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/forever-chemicals-pfas-low-birth-weight-obesity-research\">low birth weight</a>. In men, the chemicals are thought to lower sperm quality and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/22/toxic-pfas-chemicals-testes\">cause DNA changes</a> that can impact the offsprings‚Äô health later in life.</p>\n    <p>About 5% of women experience recurrent miscarriages and half of those have no explanation, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.</p>\n    <p>Among the chemicals that showed the strongest association were PFHxS, which is a common Pfas water pollutant. Several of the compounds for which researchers found associations were ‚Äúshort chain‚Äù Pfas, meaning smaller chemicals that industry has said are generally safer and less toxic than older and larger Pfas.</p>\n    <p>However, there is little independent research on many short chains, but what does exist points to high toxicity, and the new research adds to increasing concerns over their safety.</p>\n    <p>The biological mechanism by which Pfas may cause miscarriages is unclear, the authors wrote, but they theorized that it had to do with the disruption of normal thyroid hormone metabolism, and other hormonal impacts. Pfas are <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7926449/\">strongly associated with</a> endocrine system harm. The authors wrote that follow up research is needed to examine the question and find solutions and said a larger cohort size should be studied to confirm their findings.</p>\n    <p>The research adds to ‚Äúan incredible body of evidence linking exposure to Pfas to developmental harm‚Äù, said David Andrews, senior scientist with the Environmental Working Group non-profit that tracks Pfas issues, but was not involved with the study.</p>\n    <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a shocking health impact and it further indicates these compounds seem to wreak havoc throughout our body,‚Äù Andrews said.</p>\n    <p>Pfas are ubiquitous in consumer goods and the environment so they are difficult to avoid.

Others are labelled as snacks for babies, which goes against government recommendations that children aged six to 12 months do not need snacks between meals, only milk.</p>\n    <p>It comes after researchers found that leading brands, such as Ella‚Äôs Kitchen and Heinz, were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/28/leading-baby-food-brands-making-high-sugar-meals-study-finds\">making sugar-heavy, nutritionally poor baby food</a> that failed to meet the needs of infants.</p>\n    <p>A report by the University of Leeds school of food science and nutrition, <a href=\"https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/faculty/doc/commercial-baby-foods-crisis-addressing-health-marketing-inequalities-uk\">published in April</a>, found that some brands also carried misleading marketing claims, and urged the government to impose the same traffic light system found on chocolate bars and ice-cream.</p>\n    <p>The report‚Äôs authors said the new voluntary guidelines were disappointing and would have limited impact. Dr Diane Threapleton, the lead author of the Leeds study, said: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre quite narrow in scope, only looking at sugar and salt. But salt is not a major concern in UK baby food.‚Äù</p>\n    <p>She raised particular concern that the voluntary guidelines did not address the poor nutritional value of many purees and pouches, which were targeted at weaning babies. The NHS <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/start-for-life/baby/weaning/what-to-feed-your-baby/from-around-6-months/\">advises parents to start weaning when a child is about six months old</a>, with vegetables that are not sweet, such as broccoli, cauliflower and spinach.</p>\n    <p>‚ÄúThese products are often too watery. Children need really energy-dense food, rich nutrient-dense food with lots of different fibres and different sources of iron and zinc,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut these purees, particularly those targeted as first weaning foods, are really low in energy. They are bad substitutions, especially if you‚Äôre displacing a nutritious milk feed.‚Äù</p>\n    <p>High levels of sugar in children‚Äôs diets is a significant factor contributing to high rates of childhood obesity in the UK, which is among the highest in western Europe. At the start of primary school, <a href=\"https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/national-child-measurement-programme/2023-24-school-year\">more than 22% of children in England are obese or overweight</a>, according to the latest official statistics.</p>\n    <p>The public health minister, Ashley Dalton, said the guidelines would help parents who were often <strong>‚Äú</strong>bombarded with confusing labels, disguising unhealthy foods packed with hidden sugars and salt‚Äù.</p>\n    <p>Prof Simon Kenny, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\">NHS</a> England‚Äôs national clinical director for children and young people, said: ‚ÄúThese new guidelines alongside clearer labelling will help empower busy parents to make nutritious choices that give their children the best possible start in life.‚Äù</p>\n    <p>Last year a House of Lords report found commercial infant foods ‚Äúare routinely high in sugar and marketed misleadingly‚Äù. It called on the government to introduce <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld5901/ldselect/ldmfdo/19/1910.htm#_idTextAnchor110\">mandatory legal standards for commercial infant foods</a>, without input from manufacturers.</p>\n    <p>A Department of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/health\">Health</a> and Social Care spokesperson said it expected manufacturers to meet the labelling guidelines within 18 months, adding: ‚ÄúIf businesses fail to act, we will consider tougher measures.‚Äù</p>\n    <p>Another study found legislation in England to restrict supermarket sales of foods high in fat, sugar or salt had led to millions fewer products being bought.</p>\n    <p>Researchers at the University of Leeds estimated that 2m fewer such products were sold per day after the law took effect in 2022. The number of items high in fat, sugar or salt sold in Tesco, Morrisons, Sainsbury‚Äôs and Asda dropped from 20 out of every 100 before the legislation to 19 out of every 100 afterwards.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/22/baby-food-firms-18-months-improve-quality-products-england\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I wear jackets most days and need a handful of suits for dressier days (I work in finance/policy in DC; we still do suits). I like dress suits best, but like a pants suit sometimes. Almost no one has dress suits and for the literally 2 or so I can find online, the dresses are too short. I‚Äôm not 20 and don‚Äôt want to show my thighs: mid knee is perfect. The pants suits seem to all be hugely oversized. I feel like those only suit very tall and very thin women. I‚Äôm tall but not extremely thin. J Crew used to be reliable but they killed the resume dress and have no replacement. I‚Äôve looked at Brooks Brothers, Nordstrom, The Fold, Talbots, Ann Taylor, Hobbs, Banana Republic, MM Lafleur. Any recommendations?</p>\n    <p>Ah yes ‚Äì we've also noticed a dearth of dress suits (instead of a skirt) in recent years (but we still have a few suggestions!). It can also be tricky for tall women to find suits!</p>\n    <p>Another commenter noted that if she wanted longer dresses to match her suits, that she should know she's looking for suiting separates because the suit+dress sets that are sold together are often too short.</p>\n    <p>We're due for an update to our post rounding up the best women's suits in tall sizes ‚Äî but there are a few general stores that come to mind immediately that have tall (or long) sizes for women's suits.</p>\n    <p>A few Great Dress Suits in Tall Sizes (and colors) in 2025</p>\n    <p>For navy dress suits, the reader should check out the Brooks Brothers suiting that includes dresses ‚Äî they also have gray. Some of the Talbots dress suits are also available in navy.</p>\n    <p>Hugo Boss has a lot of business dresses;this one looks like it has matching blazers and comes in several colors including turquoise (that‚Ä¶ looks like a dark purple?).</p>\n    <p>Elie Tahari does have several dresses with matching blazers, mostly in solid colors, but there are a few colors. All of the dresses are on the longer side, which is a good sign. I like this light blue one (pictured below), but this one also comes in a light blue and pale pink.</p>\n    <p>Theory does indeed make dresses to match their popular Admiral Crepe suiting line, but many of the dresses are on the very short side. For a taller woman, we'd recommend the flared dress, which comes in a pretty red.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://corporette.com/where-to-buy-dress-suits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But just as everyone has their own preferred bike, choosing the right lock, from ultra-secure bolts to lightweight devices, is very personal.</p>\n<p>Cyclists need to consider where they live, how attractive their bike is to thieves (they often look for more elaborate city and racing bikes), and how long they leave it unaccompanied.

Also, bear in mind that you may have to carry a lock around for some time, so weight is key.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.soldsecure.com/\">Sold Secure</a> rating system, owned by the Master Locksmiths Association, judges the performance of any lock. It ranks locks from bronze (the most basic level) to silver (which aims to prevent the more determined attacker), gold (to stop dedicated attacks) and diamond (halting the most serious, including angle grinder, attacks).</p>\n<p>Carl Ellis, who founded <a href=\"https://thebestbikelock.com/\">thebestbikelock.com</a> after having one too many bikes stolen, doesn‚Äôt recommend bronze-rated locks because he says they don‚Äôt provide enough protection in most cases.<strong> </strong>So spend as much as you can afford. He says you can get a lock at a medium security level for about ¬£30, with more secure locks usually costing about ¬£40.</p>\n<p>If you have cycle insurance, ensure you‚Äôre buying a lock approved by your insurer, says Richard Cantle, founder of <a href=\"https://www.stolenride.co.uk/\">Stolen Ride</a>, a cyclist-run site that aims to tackle the issues around bike theft.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>At a glance</strong>\n    </h2>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best affordable lock:</strong><br/>Halfords 23cm D Lock</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fcycling%2Fbike-accessories%2Fbike-locks%2Fhalfords-23cm-d-lock---key-225374.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">¬£35 at Halfords</a>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best</strong><strong>angle grinder resistant</strong><strong>lock:</strong><br/>Hiplok D1000</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://hiplok.com/product/hiplok-d1000/\">¬£249.99 at Hiplok</a>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best for</strong><strong>city cyclists:</strong><br/>Kryptonite Evolution Mini-7</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fcycling%2Fbike-accessories%2Fbike-locks%2Fevolution-mini-7-lock-with-4-foot-cable-with-flexframe-bracket-sold-secure-silver-581667.html-581667.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">¬£44.99 at Halfords</a>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best combination lock:</strong><br/>Kryptonite KryptoLok Combo</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.freewheel.co.uk%2Fkryptonite-kryptolok-combo-standard-u-lock-with-bracket-sold-secure-gold-gk005797&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">¬£51.99 at Freewheel</a>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best chain lock:</strong><br/>Kryptonite KryptoLok Series 2</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fcycling%2Fbike-accessories%2Fbike-locks%2Fkryptolok-995-integrated-chain---9.5-mm-x-95-cm-sold-secure-silver-126064.html-126064.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">¬£59.99 at Halfords</a>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best lightweight lock:</strong><br/>Foldylock Mini</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FFoldyLock-Mini-Folding-Bike-Lock%2Fdp%2FB0B56BHRLL&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">From ¬£76.98 at Amazon</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>The best bike locks in the UK in 2025</h2>\n<h2>Best affordable lock</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Halfords 23cm D Lock</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fcycling%2Fbike-accessories%2Fbike-locks%2Fhalfords-23cm-d-lock---key-225374.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">¬£35 at Halfords</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Carl Ellis‚Äôs pick is the Halfords 23cm D Lock, which has a gold rating, is practically sized and has a mount included to attach to the frame of the bike.

Brands including Abus, Litelok, Kryptonite and Hiplok have introduced stronger materials, smarter mounting systems, and locks designed specifically for the fatter frames of e-bikes. You can now choose from ultra-tough U-locks, wearable chain locks, and compact folding models with real-world resistance to power tools. A good bike lock won‚Äôt make your bike theft-proof, but it can buy you time and give a thief enough reason to walk away.</p>\n<p>We tested 15 of the best bike locks widely available in the US across all different categories and price points. Whether you need <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/13/coronavirus-cycling-bikes-american-boom\">maximum protection for a high-theft area</a> or just a dependable lock for errands around town, we‚Äôve narrowed down the best bicycle locks worth considering in 2025.</p>\n<h2>Why you should trust me</h2>\n<p>I‚Äôve been testing bikes and cycling gear professionally for more than a decade, with a focus on long-term durability and real-world performance. My reviews have appeared in Outside, Bicycling and more than a dozen other cycling publications. I‚Äôve broken, bent and burned through plenty of bike locks ‚Äì and several dozen angle grinder discs ‚Äì to separate marketing hype from real-world security.</p>\n<h2>How I tested</h2>\n<p>I tested 15 locks from major brands, including Abus, Kryptonite, Litelok, Hiplok, OnGuard and Seatylock. They were chosen based on security ratings, brand reputation, US availability and how well they represented key use cases.</p>\n<p>To test theft resistance, I cut them using a cordless angle grinder ‚Äì the preferred device of modern bike thieves to slice through locks and even bike racks. The time to breach listed for each lock is based on this method. While no lock is grinder-proof, some dramatically slow down the theft process by chewing up grinder discs. The best locks required multiple cuts, drained batteries, and destroyed cutting discs enough to deter determined thieves.</p>\n<p>That said, grinder resistance is only one part of the equation. I used each lock for a minimum of two weeks, including short stops, daily commutes and overnight lockups when appropriate for the type of lock. I tested how easy each lock was to carry, deploy and use with different bike frames and bike racks. I noted whether mounts were included, how well they worked, and how much the locks rattled while riding.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>All prices current at the time of publication.</i>\n    </p>\n<h2>At a glance</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best bike lock overall:</strong><br/>Litelok X1<sub>$189.99 at Litelok</sub></li>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best budget bike lock:</strong>Abus Ivera Chain 7210<sub>$82.70 at Amazon</sub></li>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best chain bike lock:</strong>Kryptonite New York Fahgettaboudit Chain<sub>$124.96 at Walmart</sub></li>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best folding bike lock:</strong>Foldylock Forever<sub>$135 at Seatylock</sub></li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>Best overall bike lock:<br/>\n Litelok X1</h2>\n<p>The Litelok X1 is the best overall bike lock we tested. It balances real-world grinder resistance with everyday usability and it is relatively low-weight. This makes it ideal for e-bike riders, daily commuters and anyone locking up in theft-prone areas.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Why we love it</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Most high-security locks fall into two camps: burdensome chains that can weigh up to 15lb, or compact U-locks that can be difficult to use with larger frames or awkward racks. The X1 sidesteps that trade-off with a flexible composite armor called Barronium over a hardened steel core. This material actively resists cutting wheels so effectively that in testing, we had to swap angle grinder discs six times, as well as swap batteries. Both are key factors that can easily stop a thief in their tracks.</p>\n<p>At just 3.7lb (1.7kg), the X1 is surprisingly portable for a Diamond-rated lock. It‚Äôs slightly larger than a standard U-lock, with enough internal space to fit around oversized tubes or street signs. It also has reflective striping for night-time visibility and a covered keyway to keep out grime and water.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>It‚Äôs a shame that ‚Ä¶</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/aug/29/best-bike-locks-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In summer, the longer days and generally favourable conditions mean you can forgo additional accessories such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/feb/13/best-bike-lights\">bike lights</a>, mudguards and head-to-toe waterproofs ‚Äì although they can‚Äôt be avoided forever if you become a year-round, all-weather rider.</p>\n<p>Another bit of good news is that while cycling has a reputation for being an expensive pursuit, it doesn‚Äôt have to be, and many of my favourite bits of kit have more affordable price tags.</p>\n<p>In the almost three decades since I set off stabiliser-free for the first time, I‚Äôve dabbled in all types of cycling ‚Äì from a teenage fling with BMXing to inner-city commuting and ultra-distance off-road escapades. In that time, I‚Äôve tested all manner of clothing, tools and accessories, pushing them to the limit during races, events, training rides and the daily grind. Here‚Äôs my favourite gear that I reach for before setting off on a summer ride.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Summer cycling essentials</strong>\n    </h2>\n<h2>Jersey</h2>\n<p>Although it performs a similar function to a generic sports base layer, a jersey is the first ‚Äúproper‚Äù bit of cycling gear worth investing in because of the additional comfort it offers. Made from a lightweight, breathable fabric, a jersey will wick away moisture from hotspots, while a full-length zip means you can ‚Äúventilate‚Äù on the go. Three rear pockets store essentials such as food, tools and a phone, and unlike a running or gym top, the cut is slightly longer at the back for extra coverage when riding leant forward.</p>\n<p>My favourites, which perform well without breaking the bank, are Italian-designed Sportful SRK, which includes an extra zipped compartment for keys; the 100% recycled Rapha Core; the DHB Blok and its women-specific range, Moda; and the sub-¬£40 Madison Flux, which comes with a lifetime guarantee.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Rapha Core women‚Äôs jersey</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.rapha.cc/gb/en/product/womens-core-jersey/WOR05XXCYW\">From ¬£55 at Rapha</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Sportful men‚Äôs SRK jersey</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.sportful.com/GB/en/Mens/Cycling/Jerseys/SRK-JERSEY/p/1124034_3000\">¬£48.75 at Sportful</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>DHB Moda women‚Äôs short</strong>\n      <strong>-sleeve jersey 2.0</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sportsdirect.com%2Fdhb-moda-womens-short-sleeve-jersey-20-333826&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">¬£55 at Sports Direct</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>DHB Blok men‚Äôs classic short</strong>\n      <strong>-sleeve jersey</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sportsdirect.com%2Fdhb-blok-mens-classic-short-sleeve-jersey-634892&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">¬£55 at Sports Direct</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2Fdp%2FB0DDV1R8C5%2F&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">From ¬£109.99 at Amazon</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Madison Flux men‚Äôs short</strong>\n      <strong>-sleeve jersey</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ffawkes-cycles.co.uk%2Fmadison-flux-mens-short-sleeve-jersey-black-p36363%2Fs73799&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">¬£33.99 at Fawkes Cycles</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclestore.co.uk%2Fmadison_flux_short_sleeve_jersey-ID_89823&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">¬£35.99 at Cycle Store</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Shorts</h2>\n<p>Bib shorts might seem like an indulgent (and expensive) purchase, but you get what you pay for ‚Äì and your nether regions will let it be known if you‚Äôve skimped. Fitted with a saddle-shaped section of foam in the crotch (known as a chamois), the shorts add an extra layer of padding beneath your perineum that keeps the area dry and cushioned on long rides. Just don‚Äôt wear underwear, as this can negate the benefits. The straps may make the item resemble a wrestler‚Äôs singlet, but they keep the shorts in place more comfortably than a waistband, which can dig in over time. As the male and female anatomy are quite different down there, it‚Äôs worth opting for a gender-specific set.</p>\n<p>Albion‚Äôs ABR1 are my go-to for ultra-distance exploits, arriving with handy pockets on each thigh and one at the rear for extra storage. The Gregarius Essential from Q36.5, meanwhile, are soft and supportive against the skin, and breathable too.</p>\n<p>And for women, ‚ÄúPetrichor Projects‚Äô PP002 offer unbeatable comfort, with a cargo pocket, easy-pee design and sleek aesthetics,‚Äù says Katherine Moore, author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/gravel-rides-south-west-england-9781839812545/?utm_source=theguardian&amp;utm_medium=filter&amp;utm_campaign=summercycling\">Gravel Rides South West England</a>, who also recommends Velocio‚Äôs Luxe line for all-day epics. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre made from a super-soft, compressive material with a built-in base layer front and lovely raw-finish leg hem.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Ever since a nasty concussion stopped me playing rugby when I was 18, I struggled to exercise regularly. I tried plenty of workouts, dabbling in everything from CrossFit to Zumba. While some were more enjoyable than others, I hadn‚Äôt found a way to keep a consistent, disciplined regime without it feeling like a chore. I‚Äôm 28 now and work from home. My commute from bed to desk is 15 steps. Given the health risks of sedentary lifestyles, I had tried just about everything to break my lazy rut, and then something worked: watching television.</p>\n    <p>Well, OK, not just watching television like a modern Jim Royle, who reached Olympic levels in The Royle Family, but I imposed a rule: if I want to watch TV, I have to do so while sitting on my exercise bike (the one cardio exercise I can tolerate). The result? I‚Äôve been cycling roughly six hours a week for months now. Generally, I watch a lot of sports: if there‚Äôs football, rugby, tennis, boxing, NFL or cricket on, I‚Äôll watch it. So invariably through the year I find there‚Äôs roughly two hours of sport on three times a week I want to watch. By combining this with exercise, I find I am able to do so without feeling guilty.</p>\n    <p>Most of the sports I watch have intervals, so I tend to cycle moderately during the action and then start to pedal my way quickly through another Jamie Carragher tirade or some inane ad breaks. I usually burn about 500 calories during a two-hour session. Sometimes my drink of choice while I cycle might even be a non-alcoholic beer. Bliss.</p>\n    <p>I used to feel exercise was a waste of time, like being a hamster on a wheel, spinning and doing very little. But the benefits of consistent exercise have been pretty amazing for me. It has helped me to reach a level of fitness where I feel less anxious about going to the gym, but I also reap the mental health benefits of sticking to a routine and enjoying the aches days after I push myself a little harder than before (a masochistic hangover from my rugby days).</p>\n    <p>Sure, there are some days when staying on the bike is more of a slog than others, if there‚Äôs a particularly boring match on or the wifi decides to be dodgy. But by that point I‚Äôm already there and something in me decides I might as well keep going. It‚Äôs almost as though this hamster wheel now energises me instead of dragging me down.</p>\n    <p>More recently, I have found that passively exercising while actively doing something I enjoy is a wider magic formula. Listening to podcasts while I take my time doing various sets of weights is my latest endeavour. They say that incremental changes are the most effective, and building up an exercise regime by watching television has worked. It has helped me to feel happier and healthier.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/21/change-that-worked-exercise-watching-tv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>In Florida, large mats of sargassum are increasingly washing ashore, creating another obstacle for loggerhead, leatherback and green sea turtles, new research suggests</h2>\n<p>From natural predators to <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/from-prolonging-wallaby-pregnancies-to-disorienting-hatchling-turtles-11-ways-artificial-lights-affect-animals-180985253/\">artificial lighting</a>, sea turtle hatchlings already face numerous challenges as they make their way to the ocean for the first time.</p>\n<p>Now, researchers say yet another hurdle may be standing in their way: sargassum. As more of the smelly, brown seaweed accumulates on Florida‚Äôs beaches, it‚Äôs slowing down sea turtle hatchlings on their perilous crawls to the water, scientists report in a paper published this summer in the <a href=\"https://meridian.allenpress.com/jcr/article/doi/10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-24-00092.1/507332/Physiological-Effects-of-Sargassum-Beach-Coverage\"> Journal of Coastal Research</a>.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe longer a hatchling stays on the beach, the more at-risk it becomes,‚Äù says study co-author <a href=\"https://biology.fau.edu/directory/milton/index.php\">Sarah Milton</a>, a biologist at Florida Atlantic University, in a <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2025-09-seaweed-snare-sargassum-sea-turtle.html\">statement</a>. ‚ÄúWhen sargassum piles are higher ‚Ä¶ we can expect more failed attempts [to reach the water], particularly when hatchlings have to cross multiple bands of seaweed just to reach the ocean.‚Äù</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-sargasso-sea-62459984/\">Sargassum</a> is a type of floating seaweed that grows in the open ocean. However, in recent years, it‚Äôs been increasingly <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/a-5000-mile-wide-mass-of-seaweed-is-heading-for-florida-and-mexico-180981795/\">washing up</a> on tropical beaches, creating major headaches for oceanside communities. As it rots, the seaweed not only produces a pungent odor‚Äîit also releases toxic gases into the air. It can clog up desalination plants and power plants, too.</p>\n<p>The brown algae sits at the ocean‚Äôs surface because of gas-filled structures known as <a href=\"https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/ocean-fact/sargassum/\">pneumatocysts</a>. They‚Äôre mostly filled with oxygen and allow the seaweed to float.</p>\n<p>Since 2011, a <a href=\"https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/plants-algae/too-much-good-thing-atlantic-sargassum-belt\">mass of floating sargassum</a> spanning the Atlantic Ocean has been forming nearly every year and getting bigger‚Äîand scientists aren‚Äôt entirely sure why. Some <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/03/15/1163385168/sargassum-seaweed-florida-mexico-beaches\">have suggested</a> it‚Äôs related to human-caused changes to the nitrogen cycle, with nutrients from fertilizers, deforestation and wastewater washing out to the ocean and fueling the seaweed‚Äôs growth.</p>\n<p>Along the shore, piles of sargassum ‚Äúcan be over [three feet] high on South Florida beaches in the summer and extend for hundreds of [feet] down the beach,‚Äù says Milton in the statement.</p>\n<p>Scientists have long known that obstacles of any kind on the beach can slow or block sea turtle hatchlings as they try to reach the water. But they wanted to better understand the consequences of sargassum, specifically.</p>\n<p>For the study, scientists focused on three sea <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/celebrate-world-turtle-day-with-15-photographs-of-the-delightful-reptiles-180984395/\">turtle</a> species that live in Florida: leatherback sea turtles (<i>Dermochelys coriacea</i>), <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/dancing-baby-sea-turtles-help-researchers-unravel-the-mysteries-of-their-navigational-superpowers-180986060/\">loggerhead sea turtles</a> (<i>Caretta caretta</i>) and <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/metal-pollution-may-be-making-more-green-sea-turtles-female-180983279/\">green sea turtles</a> (<i>Chelonia mydas</i>). They conducted experiments at three different locations in the state‚ÄîJuno Beach, Jupiter and Boca Raton‚Äîwhere sea turtles are known to lay eggs.</p>\n<p>At each site, scientists created an obstacle course of sorts, then sat back and watched to see how the <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/hundreds-of-sea-turtles-with-hypothermia-are-washing-up-in-cape-cod-cold-stunned-as-temperatures-drop-180985585/\">sea turtle</a> hatchlings fared. First, they built ‚Äúcontrolled crawlways‚Äù on the sand to mimic the natural path a sea turtle hatchling would take to reach the water, per the statement. Toward the end of some of the 50-foot routes, they arranged loose mats of sargassum at two height ranges, either 2.8 to 3.5 inches tall (light coverage) or 6.7 to 7.5 inches tall (heavy coverage). They left other crawlways free from sargassum.</p>\n<p>Researchers then timed each hatchling as it waddled down the beach. Once the hatchlings made it to the end of the path, scientists scooped them up and took blood samples to measure their blood glucose levels, a proxy for energy expenditure. They also placed each hatchling upside down in a bucket filled with seawater, then measured how quickly they righted themselves. This measurement was used as a proxy for physical aptitude.</p>\n<p>As expected, the sargassum mats ‚Äúsignificantly‚Äù slowed down hatchlings from all three species, the researchers write in the paper. For leatherbacks, the journey took 54 to 158 percent longer when sargassum was present. The seaweed slowed loggerhead hatchlings by 91 to 175 percent and green sea turtles by 75 to 159 percent. Some never made it to the water within their time limit.</p>\n<p>Hatchlings also had a tendency to flip upside down while trying to climb over the sargassum piles, with one individual toppling more than 20 times during its trek. These ‚Äúinversions‚Äù contributed to the delays, making the hatchlings more vulnerable to predation, overheating and dehydration.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/seaweed-piles-are-slowing-down-sea-turtle-hatchlings-as-they-make-the-dangerous-trek-to-the-ocean-180987309/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>At this year‚Äôs US Open, when 45-year-old tennis great <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/venus-williams\">Venus Williams</a> stepped on to the court to play in doubles, it was alongside a teammate who wasn‚Äôt even born when Williams won gold in the singles at the Sydney Olympics.</p>\n<p>Given that the peak performance age for a tennis player has traditionally been considered to be around the mid-20s, it was an extraordinary feat to be competing at a major, but Williams‚Äô exceptional extension of her athletic career is increasingly common.</p>\n<p>The basketball superstar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lebron-james\">LeBron James</a> this year made history by being the first NBA player to have played in the league from his teens to his 40s, while last year the Australian basketballer Lauren Jackson defied the odds by competing in her fifth Olympics, aged 43.</p>\n<p>The 50-year-old Uzbek gymnast Oksana Chusovitina is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2025/08/23/oksana-chusovitina-olympic-gymnast/\">aiming for her ninth Olympics</a>, and in Japan, <a href=\"https://www.fifa.com/en/tournaments/mens/worldcup/articles/kazu-miura-japan-interview\">Kazuyoshi Miura</a> has broken records by continuing to play elite football ‚Äì at 58 years old.</p>\n<p>These achievements are astounding because at an age when most ordinary mortals are starting to feel the effects of declining muscle mass, reaction times, cognition and stamina, these elite athletes are still performing extraordinary physical feats that put incredible pressure and stress on their ageing bodies. Furthermore, they are doing so in a sporting environment that has continued to push the boundaries of what the unenhanced body can achieve, well beyond what was thought possible, or even safe, just a few decades ago.</p>\n<p>So what does it take to be able to keep leaping about a court or charging down a field at an age when many other elite athletes have called it a day and when most non-athletes are happy if they don‚Äôt slip over in the shower?</p>\n<p>The extraordinary longevity of these elite athletes is down to a mix of genetics, environment and lifestyle, according to associate Prof <a href=\"https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/christina-ekegren\">Christina Ekegren</a>, a physiotherapist and researcher at Monash University in Melbourne.</p>\n<p>The Williams sisters, for example, no doubt have great genes, but they have also made the most of them. ‚ÄúThe thing about Venus and Serena is that they‚Äôve been training at a very high level from a very young age, so they‚Äôre starting out at a very high base level of fitness and strength,‚Äù Ekegren says. The younger of the two sisters retired at 40 after a stellar career that spanned decades, but her older sister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/24/venus-williams-us-open-comeback\">Venus is still going strong</a>, becoming the oldest competitor to play singles at the US Open this year.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWhat differentiates some of the athletes that you‚Äôre talking about is they‚Äôre very smart in their approach to healthy ageing as an athlete,‚Äù says sports and exercise physiotherapist Ben Herde at Grand Slam Physiotherapy in Melbourne.</p>\n<p>One of the normal processes of ageing is sarcopenia, or the gradual loss of muscle mass. It happens as a result of changes in hormones, in activity levels, in nutrition and in the muscle structure itself. But it‚Äôs not necessarily inevitable, and Herde says there‚Äôs increasing emphasis on strength training for older athletes, specifically to combat this decline. ‚ÄúIf you compare that to someone who‚Äôs not training versus training, just that increased muscle mass will obviously give not only increased power and function, but it will offset the loads that go through the cartilage and the bones and even the neural structures,‚Äù he says.</p>\n<p>Like most things age-related, it‚Äôs a case of ‚Äúuse it or lose it‚Äù, Herde says. Elite older athletes are able to keep doing what they do because they don‚Äôt stop and let themselves decline.</p>\n<p>Athletes who compete for decades also adapt to their changing bodies. They may be more selective about the competitions they enter, or play a different position on the field that exposes them to less risk of damage or demands less of them physically. ‚ÄúIf you look at it like Australian rules football, they might have been a really dynamic, hard-running midfielder, and then as they become older, they‚Äôll put themselves into the forward line where there‚Äôs less running,‚Äù Herde says.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/07/venus-williams-lebron-james-cristiano-ronaldo-elite-athletes-extending-careers-into-40s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, we</strong>\n      <strong>‚Äôve become aware </strong>\n      <strong>that there is a consistent pattern of control from this girl: demands about when</strong>\n      <strong> and where they meet, </strong>\n      <strong>or what our daughter can and can‚Äôt wear. If our daughter goes against her</strong>\n      <strong>, she risks being shunned and ignored or spoken to aggressively.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>This girl does not let our daughter interact with others without her.

It would be a difficult situation for an adult to manage, so your daughter needs help.‚Äù</p>\n<p>What‚Äôs important is that your daughter doesn‚Äôt become more anxious. Also, he said, ‚Äútalking to her about being assertive locates the solution solely in her, when she doesn‚Äôt have the capacity or the confidence to be assertive. I would encourage instead that you think about helping her set clearer boundaries. For example, where is the ‚Äòline‚Äô with phone calls and texts over what‚Äôs acceptable?‚Äù</p>\n<p>I would do this: inform the teacher; try to build my child‚Äôs self-esteem; tell her that ‚Äúno‚Äù is a complete sentence, and let her practise saying it in environments she feels safer in.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-10\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>Encourage her to invite other friends round and to join clubs her friend doesn‚Äôt belong to.

    "body": "<p>The ghost station of Many Peaks is enclosed in a jumble of rocky and timbered hills. There is not much else to Littlemore now than a farmhouse and a sign.</p>\n<p>These sleepy and forgotten places in the Boyne Valley of central <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland\">Queensland</a> were once linked by hundreds of kilometres of train lines that swept an inland arc between the ports of Maryborough and Gladstone. Now, sections of those tracks are being gradually retrofitted for slower forms of transport: the foot, the horse and the bicycle.</p>\n<p>Restoring the entire proposed 271km Boyne Burnett Inland Rail Trail from Taragoola to Gayndah will be a long journey ‚Äì if completed, it would be the longest such track in the southern hemisphere.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/archive-zip/giv-32554Qhd0p3e5OsDh\">Rail trail map</a>\n    </p>\n<p>But for retired farmer Mick Colyer, it is an undertaking that could save the Boyne Valley through which he first mustered cattle as a young bloke.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWhen those railroads closed, so many people got displaced, there was no work,‚Äù the rail trail committee member says. ‚ÄúThe little country towns basically died.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúSo to try to get people out into those little country areas, to try to put some money into the businesses at those townships that used to be thriving little communities ‚Ä¶ right from the start, that‚Äôs been our vision.‚Äù</p>\n<p>It is a vision that would require a dramatic U-turn of prevailing trends.</p>\n<p>The 2006 census counted 646 people in the Boyne Valley. In 2011, that count fell to 379. By 2013, the Australian Bureau of Statistics no longer considered the four surviving settlements of the Boyne Valley as ‚Äúurban centres and localities‚Äù ‚Äì or towns ‚Äì due to their dwindling populations.</p>\n<p>Then, in 2020, the valley‚Äôs only pub turned off its taps.</p>\n<p>But there are already signs that the promise of the rail trail may have begun to gather steam.</p>\n<p>After years of community meetings, the first section of redeveloped track officially opened on late 2021. Running about 26km from an abandoned railway siding in the Kalpowar forest called Barrimoon, it descends the Dawes Range through six tunnels and passes Many Peaks to the village of Builyan.</p>\n<p>A year later, a second section of trail opened, south of the Boyne Valley along the banks of the Burnett River. This runs about 30km from Mundubbera to Mt Debateable, an abandoned rail siding near Gayndah. Both towns dispute the title ‚Äúcitrus capital of Queensland‚Äù ‚Äì to which Gayndah stakes its claim in the form of a Big Orange and Mundubbera with a Big Mandarin. Between these two landmarks, a rail trail now winds through citrus groves, past broad sweeps of the Burnett and the abandoned timber rail bridges that cross its tributaries.</p>\n<p>The first triumph of those sections of the new trail came last December, when the Grand Hotel Many Peaks threw open its doors again under new management.</p>\n<p>After eight years on the Gladstone regional council and having played a pivotal role in setting up the community group that runs the rail trail, Desley O‚ÄôGrady and her husband, Craig, moved to Many Peaks, bought the historic pub that backs on to its old train line and issued a call out for volunteers to help clean it up.</p>\n<p>O‚ÄôGrady says the turnout of more than 40 folk was testament to how sorely valley locals missed their meeting place. But she knows she will need more than their support to keep its doors open.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only 25 people who actually live in Many Peaks itself,‚Äù O‚ÄôGrady says. ‚ÄúSo we know we‚Äôre a tourism destination hotel.‚Äù</p>\n<p>And one of the biggest drawcards in the Boyne Valley, she says, is the rail trail.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe reason why we bought the hotel is that over the last 12 years we‚Äôve been going to different rail trails, seeing what happened in different states and different towns,‚Äù the publican says. ‚ÄúCycling tourism is the next big thing, I think.‚Äù</p>\n<p>That conviction appears to be paying off. Last Sunday, O‚ÄôGrady says, the Grand hotel served 180 meals. Many were bike riders.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/07/cycling-tourism-is-the-next-big-thing-the-long-journey-to-restore-a-central-queensland-rail-trail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I wouldn‚Äôt have done it without a goal.‚Äù</p>\n<p>This Sunday the 57-year-old will roar up the Campsie Hills north of Glasgow in a ‚Äúcamp as Christmas‚Äù sparkly cape alongside her partner, Sarah, and 3,000 other participants.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs all part of the inaugural <a href=\"https://www.tourde4.com/\">Tour de 4</a>, a charity ride conceived by Sir Chris Hoy with the aim of challenging assumptions about those living with stage 4 cancer.</p>\n<p>The roaring is literal: during months of training, Erwin has found vocalising ‚Äúreally helps‚Äù on steeper inclines. And the pink and gold sequins encapsulate the spirit of celebrating each day woven through the event, a hallmark of Hoy‚Äôs approach to his own stage 4 prostate cancer.</p>\n<p>The six-time Olympic gold medallist stunned the UK late last year when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/19/chris-hoy-has-two-to-four-years-left-to-live-after-terminal-cancer-diagnosis\">revealed that his cancer was incurable</a>, with a prognosis of between two and four years to live.</p>\n<p>Hoy‚Äôs honesty and grace in sharing his circumstances moved Erwin, who has been living with stage 4 lung cancer for five years. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs rare that people speak out about having stage 4 cancer. The shame, the confusion, it‚Äôs not something we speak about,‚Äù she said.</p>\n<p>Hoy describes this unique event, where those living with stage 4 cancer will cycle alongside their loved ones to raise funds for cancer charities across the UK, as ‚Äúan opportunity to push limits‚Äù.</p>\n<p>Different routes and levels of participation are tailored to the individual‚Äôs physical capacity ‚Äì from riding a static bike for as little as one minute in the Sir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/chrishoy\">Chris Hoy</a> Velodrome in Glasgow, to three outdoor routes of increasing length and elevation.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThis is not about being the fastest,‚Äù Hoy has reassured participants. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about preparation, about showing up, riding your way and being part of something bigger than all of us.‚Äù</p>\n<p>This notion of it being a movement inspired <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mylovelylungs/?hl=en\">Erwin</a>, who lives in east London, to get involved. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about being part of a community. It‚Äôs really isolating having cancer ‚Äì stage 4 cancer in particular,‚Äù she said.</p>\n<p>Hoy‚Äôs motivation is ‚Äúto shine a spotlight on what a stage 4 cancer diagnosis can look like and demonstrate that it is possible to live well and lead a happy life alongside this devastating diagnosis‚Äù.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs an attitude that resonated powerfully with Christine Lote, from Bristol, who was diagnosed with stage 4 bone cancer on her eldest daughter‚Äôs third birthday last June. In the ‚Äúwhirlwind of overwhelm and heartbreak‚Äù that followed came Hoy‚Äôs announcement and his memoir All That Matters. Lote, whose daughters Sophie and Chloe are now two and four, appreciated how Hoy had written about ‚Äúnavigating your diagnosis as a family‚Äù.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-13\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>‚ÄúLooking back, I‚Äôd like my girls to see I was part of something that did challenge me, at a time where I could have easily not been so willing,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI want to set that role model for them ‚Äì to be positive and you can still achieve things.‚Äù</p>\n<p>A particular achievement for Lote, who trained on the Bristol and Bath railway path, has been re-learning to pedal with a prosthetic after her right leg was amputated below the knee.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been such a focus this year,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúObviously, I can‚Äôt completely forget about the cancer when I‚Äôm out there cycling, but I‚Äôm not thinking too much about the ‚Äòscan-xiety‚Äô and other stuff, I‚Äôm thinking about the cycling.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Many people who have experience of cancer describe a brutal loss of trust in their own bodies ‚Äì because cancer can often hide undetected. For Erwin, the training has eased this. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something about keeping the wheels turning, the fact that my muscles, thighs, heart, lungs, everything is working in synchronicity.‚Äù</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/06/i-still-want-to-achieve-people-living-with-stage-4-cancer-embrace-chris-hoy-charity-ride\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I‚Äôd still pull him over and have a look.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Not today, though, because the non-pedalling possible offender is heading north, while Ford‚Äôs team ‚Äì two members of the cycle response unit he set up two years ago and leads ‚Äì are facing south on the opposite side of the road. A lot of the unit‚Äôs work centres on illegal e-bikes; they have seized 212 so far this year.</p>\n<p>News comes over the radio that PCs Harry Rose and David Parker have stopped someone they suspect is on an illegal e-bike, so we find them with a delivery rider in the familiar green livery of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/uber\">Uber</a> Eats. The man, whose name is Mahede Hasan, says his bike has pedals, and the power of the electric motor is 250 watts, which he thought was allowed.</p>\n<p>Ford tilts the bike on its stand and twists the throttle on the right handlebar. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs illegal for a start,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúYou should pedal to make the motor work.‚Äù The bike doesn‚Äôt go anywhere, because the spinning back wheel is off the ground, but the speedometer climbs ‚Äì 20, 30, 40, 50, 52km/h. That‚Äôs about 32mph. ‚ÄúWhat do you think the top speed of this bike should be, with pedal assist?‚Äù he asks Hasan, who doesn‚Äôt know, so Ford tells him. ‚Äú15.5mph [25km/h]. This is basically a motorcycle.‚Äù</p>\n<p>E-bikes aren‚Äôt illegal per se, and you will no doubt have noticed their increased popularity in UK cities, including the proliferation of rental ones (you might have views on them blocking pavements, or the fact that the ever-present background noise of urban Britain is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/20/stolen-lime-bikes-sound-of-summer-city-london\">click click click of a kid on a stolen Lime bike</a>, but that is a different issue). To be legal, which the rental bikes are, an e-bike needs to meet certain criteria. These include having pedals that can be used to drive the bike, an electric motor with a maximum power output of 250W, and a maximum assisted speed of 15.5mph. That doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt go faster, if you pedal hard or go downhill, just that the motor won‚Äôt help above that speed. Essentially, they‚Äôre bicycles with a bit of help, and that‚Äôs how they‚Äôre treated: you don‚Äôt need a licence, registration or insurance to ride one.</p>\n<p>The trouble is a lot of e-bikes <i>aren‚Äôt</i> legal to ride on the road, but they are very easy and cheap to get hold of. While the officers complete their paperwork, Hasan, 21, tells me he bought his bike new, on the internet, for ¬£600. ‚ÄúI got it because I do, like, eight or nine hours a day, and if I‚Äôm only pedalling I‚Äôm going to get more tired. An e-bike makes it more comfortable.‚Äù Originally from Bangladesh, he has put a sticker showing a map of the country on the front mudguard.</p>\n<p>He assumed the bike was legal because there was nothing on the website he bought it from that said it wasn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs not, how do they sell it to people?‚Äù He says that if he‚Äôd known he was breaking the law, he wouldn‚Äôt have stopped when they pulled him over. The cycle response unit operates on pedal bikes. ‚ÄúI believe they wouldn‚Äôt catch me,‚Äù he says.</p>\n<p>The officers tell him they‚Äôre seizing the bike, and he asks if he can keep the detachable battery, which they allow, while he cancels the lunch order he was due to deliver. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to affect my account because when you accept a job, that means you‚Äôre committing to delivering to the customer. If you don‚Äôt, that‚Äôs your problem, not the company‚Äôs.‚Äù</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/04/britains-e-bike-boom-desperation-delivery-drivers-and-unthinkable-danger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

And the tote bag probably bears the logo of an ethical brand or a bookshop. The bag is probably adorned with social-justice badges. If he showed you what music he is listening to, it might be, say, Lana Del Rey or Clairo.</p>\n<p>Here we have the performative male ‚Äì a new kind of vaguely problematic man to watch out for. And one who is the subject of all manner of viral TikToks and memes, and media coverage everywhere from GQ to the New York Times, which reported on a recent <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/14/style/performative-men.html\">performative male contest in Seattle</a>. For some reason when I picture him he always has curly hair. Big bouncy lustrous curls. You can probably add your own details, but you get the picture. The idea is that the performative male is a guy who goes about looking feminist and woke. The catch is that his aesthetic is curated to appeal to what he thinks women might like rather than being a totally earnest expression of his interests.</p>\n<p>Imagine that! A person choosing clothes and accessories to increase their attractiveness in the eyes of the gender they are trying to sleep with. Very insidious and unusual behaviour. I can tell you right now I have never once in my life participated in such a charade. I will admit, too, that some of this coverage has made me feel baffled by what is apparently considered desirable. The performative male is said to wear several <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/15/a-fluff-ball-with-a-monster-face-what-explains-the-luxury-appeal-of-labubu-dolls\">Labubus</a> and drink <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/apr/05/skyrocketing-demand-for-matcha-raises-fears-of-shortage-in-japan\">matcha</a>. I don‚Äôt really understand why this would lure women in. It‚Äôs even been suggested a performative male might stow tampons on his person. But if I met a cisgender man who made a point of carrying tampons around with him I‚Äôd probably telephone the police.</p>\n<p>My first thought, when I came across this trend, was: God, straight men cannot win. My second was: yes, this aesthetic is very common ‚Äì not just with men but with women too. A parade of images flashed before me of all the young women and men I have seen self-consciously clutching their unbroken copies of Angela Davis and so on in coffee shops and on the bus. ‚ÄúA lot of the time they don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about,‚Äù one of the hosts of the Seattle performative male contest told the NYT, speaking about the kind of men who adopt this look. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just an aesthetic for them.‚Äù But I would gently submit that a substantial proportion of the women who take care to post highlighted and pencilled-over pages of bell hooks to Instagram do not put much of the ethos of her work into practice in their own lives either.</p>\n<p>After all, performative righteousness is not solely the preserve of young men. I have often felt that the parallel vapidness and popularity of online social-justice messaging has created an entire generation (or two) of people obsessed with the idea of telegraphing their own worthiness rather than practising it.</p>\n<p>As the performative male trend has gained traction, I have received a few PR emails about it on behalf of ‚Äúexperts‚Äù with funky job titles offering to help counsel young women to spot toxic signs and red flags in the opposite sex. These missives, which I receive every time a new dating trend is coined, are always full of my own personal red flags. One such email on behalf of a ‚Äúrelationship coach‚Äù explained that the performative male is dangerous because he ‚Äúspeaks the language of emotional availability but doesn‚Äôt practise it‚Äù. I am happy to say that, for all its shadowy allusions to grave transgression, I have no idea what this sentence means.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/29/tote-bag-matcha-performative-male-women\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But it‚Äôs perfect and it made me cry.</p>\n<p>When the pop star who has soundtracked your entire adult love life gets engaged, it‚Äôs discombobulating. Especially when they are similar in age. Over two decades, Swift has gifted a song for every crush, relationship, situationship, and heartbreak. (I even once plagiarised All Too Well lyrics in a very embarrassing email to an ex-boyfriend; he never did reply to my calling him ‚Äúso casually cruel in the name of being honest‚Äù.)</p>\n<p>But marriage is new territory. Similarly to when a mate tells me they‚Äôre getting married, my delight over the news has been chased by bittersweet pangs of change and reflection: what role does Swift‚Äôs music play in our romantic lives now?</p>\n<p>This article includes content provided by Instagram.

On the one hand, you could slot yourself into the lyrics of the story she‚Äôs telling: ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt be in love with someone else,‚Äù she hoped in Enchanted. But then, you could go and find out exactly who she is writing about: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think I was too young to be messed with?‚Äù she asked in Dear John, presumed by many to be about her musician ex John Mayer, which Swift never confirmed or denied. This triggered a global obsession with her relationships, but it has never stopped her writing about them, thank God. Weirdly, she makes dating famous people juicy <i>and</i> relatable.</p>\n<p>When we reached our 20s, ready to bite back at bad boys, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/nov/12/taylor-swift-red-taylors-version-review-republic\">the Red album</a> was the ultimate bible of breakup bangers. Who didn‚Äôt fall to the floor screaming ‚ÄúOH!‚Äù when I Knew You Were Trouble came on? But she was at her most vulnerable, too, in All Too Well ‚Äì a power ballad that even now pierces me with the pain of life after short-lived loves. The next album, 1989, was more upbeat but just as scathing: I‚Äôm not ashamed to say that, during the peak of Blank Space, I clinked my drained wine glass at a dinner, stood up and announced: ‚ÄúBoys only want love if it‚Äôs torture‚Äù.</p>\n<p>Then Swift fell in love.

    "body": "<h2>‚ÄòIt has changed my life‚Äô</h2>\n<p><strong>Craig, 54 </strong>(<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tattooed_nude/?hl=en\">@tattooed_nude</a>)<br/>\n  I started life modelling 18 months ago. My mum said: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre getting all these tattoos and no one gets to see them.‚Äù That triggered something in me. I‚Äôve always loved art and I wanted to see how artists would respond to my tattoos.</p>\n<p>I replied to a local advert looking for life models on Instagram. I was only given two hours‚Äô notice before my first class, because another model had dropped out. There were 30 to 40 people there ‚Äì I‚Äôd never been naked in front of so many people before.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <p>‚ÄòI feel a responsibility to get into interesting and adventurous poses that will inspire the artists.‚Äô Photograph: @garygeezerphotoart</p></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>I felt very self-conscious and vulnerable. It was like an out-of-body experience. Now, I usually forget all about my nudity ‚Äì and I‚Äôm always getting great feedback on my poses. I base them on the Austrian painter Egon Schiele‚Äôs work: I make them quite angular and dynamic, and use my hands a lot.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs a very physical job. I feel a responsibility to get into interesting and adventurous poses that will inspire the artists. I never feel bored, but sometimes I wish a pose would end. If you stay in any position long enough, it becomes uncomfortable. I‚Äôve had dead legs that have taken days to recover, as well as back and neck ache.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <p>‚ÄòSome more traditional classes refuse to hire me because of my tattoos.‚Äô Photograph: Courtesy of Craig</p></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>I‚Äôve never done yoga or gymnastics, but I do work out using kettlebells. I‚Äôve spent about ¬£35,000 on my tattoos and I don‚Äôt want to lose my shape and distort them. While some more traditional classes refuse to hire me because of my tattoos, other artists want to draw a model who‚Äôs a bit different or will inspire them to be more expressive with colour. I force them out of their comfort zone and that‚Äôs really rewarding for me.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <p>‚ÄòI display the best ones in my flat, though I turn them to face the wall when my mum and sister visit.‚Äô Photograph: Bruce Mulcahy</p></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Becoming a life model has changed my life. I travel around the country now, mixing in artists‚Äô circles and feeling more like an insider in the art world. I used to visit exhibitions ‚Äì now I‚Äôm in them and I meet the artists afterwards. I typically earn ¬£20 to ¬£25 an hour, and some artists give me their work afterwards. I display the best ones in my studio flat, though I turn them to face the wall when my mum and sister visit.</p>\n<p>A lot of my classes are for young people, such as sixth formers. Although I‚Äôm 54, I don‚Äôt feel uncomfortable about that ‚Äì drawing from a live model is an important part of their development as artists. They could be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jun/19/jenny-saville-the-anatomy-of-painting-review-national-portrait-gallery-london\">next Jenny Saville</a>.</p>\n<h2>‚ÄòWhen I uncovered my naked body, I was waiting for the laughter‚Äô</h2>\n<p><strong>Geoff, 56 </strong>(<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/yorkslifemodel/?hl=en\">@yorkslifemodel</a>)</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <p>‚ÄòFor more than 40 years, I had hated my body‚Äô ‚Ä¶ Geoff. Photograph: Steven Curtis.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>I have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and I am super shy and quiet. But I wanted a hobby, so I took an adult education class to learn how to draw. For two years, I didn‚Äôt really speak to anyone in the class. Then, at our regular weekly life drawing class, the model didn‚Äôt show up. I surprised myself by saying: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it.‚Äù</p>\n<p>I volunteered because, for more than 40 years, I had hated my body. I started puberty early and was bullied by other children for being circumcised, and then, as an uncontrollable, non-sexual reaction to feeling intensely embarrassed, getting an erection at school. Gangs of boys and girls would chase after me, calling me names and laughing at me to trigger this reaction. It went on for years.</p>\n<p>For decades afterwards, I never wanted anyone to see me naked ‚Äì or even to see myself naked ‚Äì because it just brought back the voices and the laughter. I call those memories ‚Äúthe shadows‚Äù, because they feel like darkness coming over me.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/09/i-thought-i-cant-keep-living-with-this-shame-five-life-models-on-the-power-of-posing-nude\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Most of my adult life has revolved around music: clubs, bars, festivals, house parties ‚Äì anywhere I could dance to loud music. I loved how energising and cathartic it was to get immersed in it, to lose myself a little and move my body expressively without judgment. I‚Äôd get so absorbed that I would lose track of time; once, at Burning Man, I was awake for 36 hours exploring the festival, meeting new people and partying.</p>\n    <p>When I became a DJ, these kinds of events increased. Late nights out would last until the morning. Often, they became marathon weekend sessions, which ran from Friday night to Sunday lunchtime. It wasn‚Äôt all dancing and shenanigans ‚Äì there would be moments to sit around and chat with people, too. I‚Äôd be out at least three times a week. Even though I‚Äôd get tired, I would always find some way to push through to the early hours because I was scared to miss out on things. Fomo (fear of missing out) drove many of my decisions.</p>\n    <p>My work never suffered but my mental health did. I started to feel anxious and dangerously close to burnout. Consumed with self-loathing, I wanted to stop but couldn‚Äôt figure out how ‚Äì until I went on a 10-day silent meditation course.</p>\n    <p>It was then that I realised the life I was living was unsustainable. But it took a while to unravel my hedonism and habitual indulgence. I went sober because I wanted to rid myself of the brain fog and fatigue I was often bogged down with.</p>\n    <p>Learning to navigate nights out without a crutch to keep me going sparked an important shift in my approach to parties and festivals. Instead of giving in to Fomo, I have learned to listen to what my body is telling me rather than ignoring the signs. Tired legs usually spark a well-earned sit down or, in some cases, I will call it a night and get myself home to bed. This kind of behaviour was unheard of between the ages of 17 and 37, when I had my last drink. Back then, I would keep going even when I was exhausted.</p>\n    <p>It hasn‚Äôt been easy, though. Being sober is hard work. Not having an easy escape can be very challenging. I had to learn how to be more confident and expressive without ingesting anything. Dancing while sober is still fun but it‚Äôs tricky dealing with how self-conscious you feel.</p>\n    <p>Responding to my body‚Äôs needs consciously and waving goodbye to Fomo have given me a real sense of stability. Every time I‚Äôve made the decision to have an early night or given myself time to rest has reinforced my self-respect and self-love. The gradual accumulation of healthy decisions has been life-changing for me.<strong> </strong>The dancefloor has been my sanctuary for a long time. Now I can happily get my fill and go home when the time is right, without ever feeling as if I‚Äôm missing out. That peace of mind is priceless.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/08/the-one-change-that-worked-sobered-up-started-to-listen-my-body\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I had no symptoms (none!) and it came at the worst possible time, although there is never a good time.</p>\n    <p>I am a musician and was one week away from flying to New Zealand to be in a show. I was extremely excited about the show and, to be organised, I thought I‚Äôd get a blood test to check my iron levels before I left the country for five weeks.</p>\n    <p>Six hours after the blood test, I got a call from my doctor telling me that something was wrong. I was what‚Äôs called neutropenic. In layman‚Äôs terms it meant I had no immune system and I needed to go to hospital immediately.</p>\n    <p>It made no sense. I had been in Savers, at my nieces‚Äô school fete and the pub the day before. The doctor said to wear two masks and stand outside or I might not survive an infection ‚Äì which sounded like a ridiculous overreaction for what I was sure was a mixed-up test. It wasn‚Äôt. After entering that hospital I wouldn‚Äôt leave it again for six weeks.</p>\n    <p>About 7pm I was told I had cancer (who knew they have haematologists in emergency?). The diagnosis was utterly overwhelming. Although my family is amazing, they weren‚Äôt close by that night. A friend had come for a few hours to help translate what the doctors were saying while I was in a state of shock. But I was alone in my hospital bed when I woke up around 3am and it all suddenly hit me. All I could think about was that not only was I not going to New Zealand, but I also had cancer, and it was going to kill me. It always seems to kill people in the movies ‚Äì writers, I beg you to stop doing that. Lots of us live.</p>\n    <p>As I was death-spiralling, a nurse walked past and asked if I was OK. I wasn‚Äôt. I just dissolved and, through tears, explained what was happening. He asked if I wanted a hug. I did, and I have never needed one more in my life. His name was Ben.</p>\n    <p>That night was probably the scariest part of my whole time with cancer ‚Äì I‚Äôm now in remission. I never saw Ben again but his name stuck with me through the six weeks in hospital and eight months of chemo.

Sometimes called stick blenders or hand blenders, immersion blenders are lightweight and small enough to tuck into a drawer when you‚Äôre not using them and a breeze to clean (just run the blender in a cup or bowl of hot soapy water, then rinse). They allow you to conveniently puree soups in the pot you‚Äôve cooked them in, or blend dips and sauces in the bowl you‚Äôll serve them in, meaning less mess and fewer dishes. Immersion blenders can emulsify salad dressings or aioli quickly, without requiring you to dig your big blender out of the cabinet for such a small task.</p>\n<h2>Our top picks:</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Best overall:</strong>\n        <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/gChDhNS3tFzZU66vjJXtGu9HNRAGfHwtRPmg4DRpWxudFBMchLLgLjoLp8S4FfMbwo74JWBppx7HYpNZpUiHHsbGYb2QVukHR3N4aecjXSH9LEegCUAzh4ad8n9raj3kVaVMaWMicHGnhAe3WnyYuAUYuFyAzMgCGM4etTUhnBMvbYFpKA3dpotE43XxW57cuD8cmoQ5Uuvcw1ivgZdu186DARnBqxmruhbq5i5M8rraDFQEYN7kVAPqs7FK6YNrf8d67EgqYmGZeJVXQkEbLdjBxicMeBuTUbZKmRyf2zyYgNujbPWWSsyAXE4HArJNKdKriDCc4xEVKGpv8atdyNXveGHehGg2RE7TJoby5BnLiXtsCPdJZVdUM2cNjG5DSbBGNzdKi\">All-Clad Corded Immersion Blender</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Best with attachments:</strong>\n        <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/JqU1MqWt4YRNcjTHt3nMjeDpXSkruXk1VXZjzretsfdB7ScKMFhakUPJo8tbSDHoG4NpY93eL7G86Ckx5HXrjhpWMw1ovBHnuvKTdk5c1gkEatXe1pTw8qo9E2VTqde72gJoRsM5ZY76eovHosW5rs5eaq6fa3BCNJka4E6x6Qrm7j8KQvtEXBDcvNrSCZcZ6CJdxjgPS5nNQCtN2KUAoGZE4v2WUjJp6squwtSpduzfbC3oX6gpKNzsSYmTGXWvscM8FezgUScuh2hzK4wZFrX1PV4cK8JDoH2WZED3vTGzn61D2AADY8mCDD1om7zZkhF1dCPHSWx3sBEhWDXmsBNZjh1fTrHWWkBk47nSmDiDqNRuDTpoGxMvRi9SuiR6U\">Breville Control Grip Immersion Blender</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Best budget immersion blender:</strong>\n        <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/JqU1MqWt4YRNcjTHt3nMjeDpXSkruXk1VXZjzretsfdB7ScKMFhakUPJo8tbSDHoG4NpY93eL7G86Ckwv5t9ZQJ3qjSVRsomgvF66U9UHr79Zaw3W1cXQetRmMMyB925SKyjL6uCjLZZLjS9BcrdePeycSc2ktnmCqDvAqk54oPKgi1z8awnHa9LMsoV7t73LsXb2MdRD8Xa62BEPCyniUhxPKvb3j7PDYkVsMb3SrGtwLBFcaqJXAxvuPpKbfWfz1L5wEBehdunvMvybJM7wEpcEY2fso5Lx7yMHQE2DvfubzP5S3TLJs9GhuQbYVaLJaq86vYaZBpjzUVViUDc3mGXXfiG9DwwQcHJemwKx5BS513fWykb7AaUwKMqRQJgL\">Amazon Basics Multi-Speed Immersion Blender</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>Featured in this article</h2>\n<p>BA editors reach for immersion blenders in our own kitchens most often for hot soups (it‚Äôs a nightmare to have to transfer a hot liquid into a full-sized blender, not to mention dangerous), and for quick blends where you still want some texture, like pestos or chutneys.

The top of the motor handle also features a variable speed dial that lets you adjust the power while blending (a feature we liked less than the two speed buttons; more on that below). And even at a lower speed, this blender can handle most smaller blending jobs in less than 60 seconds.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/miele-dishwasher-review\">dishwasher-safe</a> blending shaft on the All-Clad is 9.25\" (longer than many of the models we tested), which makes it easy to blend in tall containers or pots. Though the shaft is long, the blending head (the blade guard and blade) is on the shallow side, which meant it sometimes requires a little extra time to get started on bigger chunks of solid ingredients‚Äîbut once something gets sucked into this blender‚Äôs powerful vortex, it will quickly be pulverized or pur√©ed.</p>\n<p>This blender is more expensive than most of its competition, and it really is possible to get a well-functioning immersion blender for <i>much</i> less. However, this machine is made of high-quality materials, from a brand we trust to make products that last. It features a limited lifetime warranty. So we think it‚Äôs a great decision to splurge and take good care of your machine, so you won‚Äôt have to replace it later.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-immersion-blenders\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>For three seasons on FX's <i>The Bear</i>, actor and comedian Joel McHale portrayed an abusive chef so realistically that it was <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/the-bear-hulu-toxic-restaurant-culture\">triggering to real-life kitchen workers</a>. But aside from one short stint working at a Seattle deli under a manager with an incredibly short fuse (\"This guy was a screamer‚Äîand he was fired,\" McHale says), the kitchen has been a place of joy for McHale.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIf I'm home, I'm the cook,‚Äù says McHale, who also hosts the Fox cooking competition series <i>Crime Scene Kitchen</i> and is a spokesperson for Seattle's Best Coffee. \"I am very good at cooking meat.‚Äù In fact, he tells me he has plans immediately following our interview to roast a couple of chickens for guests he has joining him for dinner.</p>\n<p>Last year, in what McHale calls ‚Äúone of his finest cooking moments,‚Äù he got to show off his steak-searing skills as a guest on restauranteur and chef (and friend) David Chang's Netflix show, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@dinnertimelive/video/7384859204881812778\"> Dinner Time Live</a>. ‚ÄúI was not expecting you, on live TV, to actually cook a beautiful steak,\" Chang said on the show. \"And I'm wrong.\"</p>\n<p>Below, McHale shares some of the tools and gear he uses to master the grill as well as the pantry items he always keeps stocked.</p>\n<h2>A monster smoker</h2>\n<p>McHale takes his meat smoking seriously‚Äîand that means using some pretty serious tools. ‚ÄúI have a Pitts and Spitts, a brand out of Texas, which is as tough as a Sherman tank,\" he says. ‚ÄúI can smoke a pork tenderloin like nobody's business, and a few months ago I made a chateaubriand.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Other favorite recipes in McHale's rotation: \"For Thanksgiving, I smoked a bunch of tri-tips. Two nights ago I made this dish where I take a whole chicken breast with the skin and part of the bone, then season them up a little bit, sear the outsides off, and then I put them into a tomato and Iberico ham sauce.‚Äù</p>\n<h2>Instructions from an all-star</h2>\n<p>For burgers, McHale says he uses Gordon Ramsay's burger blend method‚Äîa 70/20/10 ratio, with 70% chuck steak, 20% short rib, and 10% fat, as Ramsay explained on <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@thecardiochef/video/7225568499211570458?lang=en\"> Masterchef</a>.</p>\n<h2>Good, old-fashioned tongs</h2>\n<p>‚ÄúI had a whole argument with David Chang about tongs,\" says McHale. ‚ÄúHe thinks tongs are amateur hour.‚Äù But McHale has no shame in using the tool‚Äî\"I'll send [Chang] photos of tongs resting on the side of a dish,\" he says‚Äîespecially in a pinch.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWhen I cooked the steak for <i>Dinner Time Live</i>, [using the tongs] had to be done because I only had, like, 25 minutes,‚Äù McHale says. To get a beautiful, golden crust on the steak, \"I salted the hell out of it and put it in oil. Then I put weight on top of the meat to spread it out, and flipped it.‚Äù McHale finished his dish by frying eggs in the beef fat left in the pan for steak and eggs.</p>\n<h2>Ghee and Wagyu beef tallow</h2>\n<p>For cooking fat, McHale likes to use Wagyu beef tallow or ghee. ‚ÄúUsing ghee makes you look like a cook,‚Äù he says.</p>\n<h2>A caffeine fix</h2>\n<p>‚ÄúI grew up in Seattle, where I worked at a coffee cart for years and drank tons of coffee,\" says McHale. ‚ÄúI continue to‚ÄîI probably had eight cups so far this morning, which is about average.‚Äù</p>\n<p>While Seattle's Best beans take McHale on a trip down memory lane, he's also recently been enjoying one of the brand's new launches. ‚ÄúFor the summer, Seattle's Best released all these limited edition Coffee Roast Mallows‚Äù in collaboration with XO Marshmallow, says McHale. \"All the marshmallow flavors are inspired by the different blends of their coffee‚Äù‚Äîwhich, it turns out, is exactly where McHale likes to put them. (Why should hot cocoa get all the fun?)</p>\n<h2>A supply of ramen</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/joel-mchale-kitchen-must-haves\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>On July 4, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was signed into law, restructuring, among other monumental changes, the way tips would be taxed for service workers. The law is the fulfillment of a campaign promise President Trump made nearly exactly a year prior in a campaign speech in Las Vegas on July 9, 2024. ‚ÄúFor those hotel workers and people that get tips, you‚Äôre gonna be very happy,‚Äù he said at the time. ‚ÄúBecause when I get to office, we are going to not charge taxes on tips.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Although it's colloquially referred to as ‚Äúno tax on tips,‚Äù the legislation isn‚Äôt as straightforward as simply eliminating all taxes on gratuities. Section 70201 of the new law states, ‚ÄúThere shall be allowed as a deduction an amount equal to the qualified tips received during the taxable year that are included on statements furnished to the individual.‚Äù</p>\n<p>But ‚Äúthere's a limit of how much in tips you can deduct for purposes affecting income tax‚Äîit‚Äôs up to $25,000,‚Äù explains Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/\">Tax Foundation</a>, a nonpartisan tax-policy-focused think tank. There are income restrictions on the deduction too. ‚ÄúIf you have income above $150,000 if you're single, or $300,000 if you‚Äôre filing jointly, the value of this deduction phases out,‚Äù Watson says.</p>\n<p>The idea of a tip-based tax deduction received widespread support from both sides of the aisle‚Äî<a href=\"http://cnn.com/2024/08/12/politics/taxes-on-tips-eliminate-proposal-harris\">Kamala Harris endorsed the policy</a> on the campaign trail as well‚Äîbut now that it‚Äôs law, how might it impact servers? The tipping system has been in the spotlight in recent years, criticized for its <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2014/7/17/5888347/one-more-case-against-tipping\">racist</a> foundations, and increasingly unpopular with diners who have begun to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/19/dining/tipping-gratuity-restaurants.html\">feel tip fatigue</a>. This new legislation is positioned as a step forward for a system that‚Äôs long needed improvements. Could it have a significant impact on servers‚Äô and bartenders‚Äô finances, or is it all smoke and mirrors wrapped up in a shiny populist talking point?</p>\n<p>Lessening the tax burden on tipped workers looks good on paper, but the research shows that the effect will be relatively limited. <a href=\"https://taxpolicycenter.org/fiscal-facts/tax-free-tips-how-would-they-impact-tipped-workers\">Research from the Tax Policy Center</a> shows 40% of households with tipped workers would receive no benefit at all. On average, the same report concluded that tax savings would come out to $1,800 a year, or $35 a week.</p>\n<p>For some servers, any savings is a boon. ‚ÄúEvery dollar goes far,‚Äù says Louis Leffler, a server in Denver. ‚ÄúIt helps me give my kid a music class, or a swimming class.‚Äù</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>How the Restaurant Industry is Responding to ‚ÄúNo Tax on Tips‚Äù</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Restaurant industry advocates have other concerns. Saru Jayaraman, president of <a href=\"https://www.onefairwage.org/\">One Fair Wage</a>, a national nonprofit that advocates for the abolition of the subminimum wage, calls the ‚Äúno tax on tips‚Äù law a red herring. Many tipped workers, she says, don‚Äôt earn enough money to have to pay federal income tax. Data from the Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan policy research center, support Jayaraman‚Äôs position. According to <a href=\"https://budgetlab.yale.edu/news/240624/no-tax-tips-act-background-tipped-workers\">a June 2024 report</a>, 37% of tipped workers had incomes low enough that they faced no federal income tax in 2022. The same report estimates that just 2.5% of the workforce is in tipped occupations. Both figures suggest untaxed tips would have limited benefits for tipped workers and certainly for the broader American workforce.</p>\n<p>And while the bill holds very limited benefits for tipped workers, it also lays out major cuts to both SNAP and Medicaid benefits, both social services that restaurant workers in particular must lean on, according to <a href=\"https://www.onefairwage.org/_files/ugd/c0b525_2b55f171544f4c42b0fd65a22663268f.pdf\">a recent report from One Fair Wage.</a> SNAP faces <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61570\">$186 billion in funding cuts</a>, while Medicaid will be cut by <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61570\">nearly $1 trillion</a>.</p>\n<p>Data published by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/snap-helps-millions-of-workers-in-low-paying-jobs\">shows</a> that 10% of total SNAP participants work in restaurants, the largest single industry among SNAP beneficiaries. <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/report-section/understanding-the-intersection-of-medicaid-and-work-an-update-appendix/\">More than 1.5 million</a> restaurant and food service workers rely on Medicaid. ‚ÄúIf we want to actually benefit workers,‚Äù says Raeghn Draper, executive director of <a href=\"https://www.thechaadproject.org/\">the CHAAD project</a>, a Chicago-based restaurant worker advocacy group, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs give them something that‚Äôs permanent: Let‚Äôs raise wages, let‚Äôs have universal health care.‚Äù</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Crunching the Numbers</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-servers-really-feel-about-the-no-tax-on-tips-law\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The focus isn‚Äôt so much on calorie counting or hitting macros‚Äîit‚Äôs about boosting flavor, exploring global cuisines, and making weeknight meals feel restaurant quality.</p>\n<p><strong>The ordering process:</strong> The hardest part about ordering a week of meals from CookUnity is narrowing down what you want to eat. Everything looks good, and there are hundreds of options to choose from. As of writing, there were over 400 meals available this week, covering everything from breakfast burritos to hearty dinners. If you forget to pick your own by the cutoff date, CookUnity will auto-fill your box based on your preferences or past orders.</p>\n<p>With a chef-forward menu, CookUnity meals come from a variety of globe-spanning cuisines: Ghanaian, Indian, Mexican, Italian, the menu touches six continents. Most meals are regularly available, but there are new ones rotating in (and out), so you can branch out or stick with favorites you‚Äôve already tried.</p>\n<p>If you‚Äôre feeling fancy, some meals are marked ‚ÄúPremium‚Äù (such as Maryland-Style Crab Cakes and Lobster Tail &amp; Steak Surf &amp; Turf), which cost a few dollars more than the standard meals.</p>\n<p>One thing I appreciated that seems unique to CookUnity: Each dish has a user rating out of five stars, along with comments from other customers. I found the reviews super helpful and ended up only choosing meals rated 4.3 and above.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-prepared-meal-delivery-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It has the same five-ply construction as the brand's stainless-steel cookware, making it heavier duty and able to heat more evenly than lots of nonstick options out there.</p>\n    <p>For Labor Day, the small spaces set of Ceramiclad cookware is 25% off.</p>\n    <h2>A small stainless-steel cookware set</h2>\n    <p>Speaking of Made In‚Äôs stainless steel cookware, that‚Äôs on sale too. A six-piece set, which includes both a stainless steel frying pan and a Ceramiclad one, along with a stainless stock pot and sauce pan, offers up the best of all worlds. The performance of Made In‚Äôs stainless cookware was comparable to <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-stainless-steel-pan-skillet\">long-time Test Kitchen favorite All-Clad</a>‚Äôs in our testing.</p>\n    <h2>Carbon steel griddle</h2>\n    <p>My personal favorite piece of Made In cookware is the carbon steel griddle (yes, the one that's all over your Instagram feed). It's lighter than cast iron griddles, heats evenly, offers a generous nonstick cooking surface once seasoned, and comes with an amazing heavyweight burger press. It also works great on a gas or charcoal grill.</p>\n    <p>It was one of my great disappointments that its shape, with integrated carbon steel handles, didn‚Äôt fit on my personal stove. I donated it to the Test Kitchen where it's been put to good use. (If you have a cooktop flush with the back wall of your kitchen, it might not fit your stove either. Just make sure to measure the back-to-front space on your range if you‚Äôre considering this one.)</p>\n    <h2>Japanese Damascus steel knives</h2>\n    <p>In the past, Made In‚Äôs knives haven‚Äôt topped our product tests because they didn't stay sharp for long. But the brand's Damascus knife, which is on sale right now, uses VG-10 steel, the same metal <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-to-find-the-best-chefs-knife-for-you\">our top pick from Mac</a> is made from. It has a higher carbon content than the steel in Made In‚Äôs standard knife line, which means it‚Äôs harder and will keep its edge better. The Damasus set doesn‚Äôt have a paring knife, but it does have a nakiri, which is a great addition for vegetable prep.</p>\n    <p>There‚Äôs a whole rash of other Made In gear we love around the office, including the brand's <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/made-in-flatware-highly-recommend\">flatware</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/made-in-dutch-oven-review\">Dutch oven</a> (a convincing, less expensive stand in for a Le Creuset), and butcher block cutting board.</p>\n    <h2>Read more shopping articles</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Explore the <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/best-budget-tools\">best kitchen tools under $200</a></li>\n      <li>Find out which <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-cookware-sets?\">cookware sets passed our tests with flying colors</a></li>\n      <li>How much should you <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-much-should-you-spend-on-a-kitchen-knife\">spend on a kitchen knife?</a>There's an actual answer here</li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/made-in-labor-day-sale\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Welcome to 5 O‚ÄôClock Somewhere, a new series in which our network of culinary all-stars share their favorite drinks‚Äîalong with everything you need to serve them in style.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>The Honey Deuce is a marvel of modern marketing. Nineteen years ago, restauranteur and Grey Goose brand ambassador Nick Mautone (his resume includes time as the former managing partner of Gramercy Tavern and hospitality director at the Rainbow Room, among other bona fides) was tasked with dreaming up a signature cocktail for the <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/where-to-eat-us-open-2024\">US Open</a>. For decades <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/mint-julep\">mint juleps</a> have been must-haves for viewing the Kentucky Derby and anyone who's anybody sips a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/the-pimm-s-cup\">Pimm's cup</a> at Wimbledon‚Äîand Grey Goose, it's safe to assume, wanted to cement itself as a permanent part of the US Open experience.</p>\n<p>As the story goes, inspiration struck Mautone when he was creating a fruity dessert for a dinner party he was hosting at his home in Hampton Bays (as one does). \"I was at the kitchen counter making these honeydew melon balls and I just said to my wife, 'Oh my God, these look like tennis balls,'\" Mautone says. He borrowed the flavor profile from his dessert‚Äîberries, citrus, melon, and a hint of rosemary‚Äîadded the required Grey Goose vodka, and, <i>Voil√†!</i> The Honey Deuce.</p>\n<p>Is it on the nose to serve a cocktail that literally looks like sporting equipment at a Grand Slam tournament? Absolutely. But lucky for Grey Goose and for tennis fans, the Honey Deuce is also delightful on the palate. What better to sip on a late summer afternoon or evening than, essentially, a spiked raspberry lemonade?</p>\n<p>Millions agree, making the Honey Deuce a hit: According to Grey Goose, nearly 3 million have been sold since the drink's debut in 2007, but the Deuce really hit its stride in 2024, with over 550,000 enjoyed during last year‚Äôs tournament alone.</p>\n<p>But you don't need to hoof it out to Queens to enjoy the drink. Below, Mautone shares the Honey Deuce's official recipe, some ideas for snazzing it up, and all the gear you need to make and serve it at your US Open watch party.</p>\n<h2>The Honey Deuce</h2>\n<p>Ingredients:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>1¬º oz Grey Goose vodka</li>\n      <li>3 oz fresh lemonade</li>\n      <li>¬Ω oz raspberry liquor</li>\n      <li>3 honeydew melon balls (frozen) for garnish</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Preparation:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Fill a highball glass with cubed ice</li>\n      <li>Add vodka, then top with lemonade and raspberry liqueur</li>\n      <li>Garnish with your melon balls on a skewer</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>The gear you need</h2>\n<h3>Vodka and raspberry liqueur</h3>\n<p>One of the original stipulations for the cocktail was that it needed to feature Grey Goose's flagship vodka, not any flavored varieties. You of course can sub in your vodka of choice, but why mess with an icon?</p>\n<h3>Highball glass</h3>\n<p>According to Mautone, \"The simplest, easiest glass to use is a highball glass.\" You can go chic with classic crystal, or choose kitsch with something more playful. \"A couple of years ago I was hosting a US Open party and bought about 30 of the signature Honey Deuce glasses on eBay,\" he says.</p>\n<p>\"I also love putting the Honey Deuce in a nice, big balloon wine glass for the very simple reason that it looks elegant,\" says Mautone. For a ritzy spin on the original recipe worthy of such a classy glass, he recommends adding a splash of off-dry sparkling wine or seltzer. \"It's a little bit fizzy, a little bit tart, a little bit sweet. And the sparkling wine also cuts the sweetness,\" he says.</p>\n<h3>Melon baller</h3>\n<p>Uh duh, can't forget this, lest you end up with melon cubes in your drink. (What is this, Picasso's tennis tournament?) Mautone says you don't need to spend a lot of money on your Parisienne scoop‚Äîone of his go-to brands for kitchen tools is Oxo. \"The brand's products are just designed well,\" he says.</p>\n<h3>Cocktail pick</h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/honey-deuce-recipe-tools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Chris, 24</h2>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>We try to be respectful and, obviously, we don‚Äôt want to cause people alarm, but we‚Äôre very noisy creatures</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>Luke is 20 years older than me. If he‚Äôd had a history of dating younger people, I wouldn‚Äôt have pursued it because I think there‚Äôs an inherent power imbalance that comes with age-gap relationships. It‚Äôs something we discussed from the start, but it doesn‚Äôt come up for us sexually. I‚Äôve been with more sexual partners than Luke has, so I had more experience than him in terms of kink and BDSM.</p>\n<p>About 80% of our sex is BDSM, but we‚Äôre both very touchy people, so there‚Äôs a lot of cuddling throughout the day. We were actually evicted from our home due to noisy sex. We were getting complaints from the neighbours downstairs. At one point, the housing association office came to the door when we were having sex ‚Äì we call it our bang to rights moment.</p>\n<p>We try to be respectful and, obviously, we don‚Äôt want to cause people alarm, but we‚Äôre very noisy creatures. Now we‚Äôve got the mattresses on the floor, so we‚Äôve learned our lesson.</p>\n<p>When we met, I was pre-transition, and I worried that someone who found me attractive then might not fancy me after I‚Äôd taken testosterone. I had my guard up, and while I enjoyed Luke‚Äôs company, I really didn‚Äôt think much would come of it.</p>\n<p>But both of us are really happy to be proven wrong, and it is a really beautiful thing to have been on this journey with him, and to have shared this experience.</p>\n<p>Luke finds me just as attractive with a bit of facial hair. He‚Äôs been super supportive, and I‚Äôm more self-confident in my own body now. I‚Äôm far more comfortable with who I am, and that is a fantastic feeling. It‚Äôs all had a really positive effect on my life ‚Äì and on our sex life. I‚Äôve now been on testosterone for a year and a half, which comes with increased libido. My desires are stronger than ever and I‚Äôm a feistier in bed now. Every time I go to the gender clinic, we pick up about 60 packets of lube, which we get through in about three days.</p>\n<h2>Luke, 44<strong> </strong><br/></h2>\n<blockquote>\n      <p/>\n      <i>Even just using the correct pronouns while we were having sex and seeing how much extra fire that added</i>\n      <i>was lovely</i>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>I‚Äôm not a religious person, but sex to me is almost like something that‚Äôs transcendental. When you‚Äôve got someone else on board with that uninhibited expression of human sexuality, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any greater joy.</p>\n<p>Sex with Chris is joyous and fun. We can‚Äôt get enough of each other. We met at a bar three years ago, and when we first started going out I wasn‚Äôt sure if we‚Äôd be long term as there‚Äôs a 20-year age gap. I thought it would lead to problems, or an imbalance in terms of emotion and life experience. But we had such a connection and I found life was so much better with him.</p>\n<p>We did get carried away at the beginning. It was probably five times a day after we moved in together. I had just lost my job and we had a lot more free time together, and that‚Äôs when we had a lot of noise complaints from the neighbour. We probably could have handled it a wee bit more diplomatically, but life is short so you might as well just go for it.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve found that dirty talk can really enhance sex, it‚Äôs like a little bit of seasoning you put on the experience. We also use a lot of restraints and things like that, and we‚Äôve ended up having a wide arsenal of things to do.</p>\n<p>In the last year, Chris has started taking hormone replacement therapy, and his treatment has allowed him to feel more comfortable in his own skin. To see that has been one of the most rewarding and exciting things in my life. Even just using the correct pronouns while we were having sex and seeing how much extra fire that added was absolutely lovely.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/31/this-is-how-we-do-it-we-were-evicted-from-our-home-due-to-noisy-sex-we-call-it-our-bang-to-rights-moment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>David Mitchell is probably the only male on the planet who could get away with defending mansplaining, so that is what he has done. ‚ÄúI feel there‚Äôs an unfairness to the term, which is taken to be men explaining things in a boring way to women,‚Äù he told <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/culture/tv-radio/article/david-mitchell-robert-webb-are-not-helping-79nf963hl\">the Sunday Times</a>. ‚ÄúBecause they do it to each other, and they take turns, and that‚Äôs what men call a conversation.‚Äù</p>\n<p>In the same interview, Mitchell and his comedy partner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/robert-webb\">Robert Webb</a> are asked how each counselled and supported the other through various personal challenges. They are confused and slightly aghast at the idea that they might have discussed such matters. What do men talk to one another about, then? ‚ÄúWell, yes,‚Äù says Mitchell. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a question [my wife] Victoria‚Äôs asked me many times. And I never really know.‚Äù</p>\n<p>This insight came in the same week Rylan Clark <a href=\"https://hungermag.com/art-culture/rylan-is-baring-it-all\">revealed what he has learned</a> from hosting his podcast How to Be in Love. ‚ÄúI never really understood when people said, ‚Äòmy partner is my best friend,‚Äô‚Äù he admitted. ‚ÄúBecause I thought, well, my partner is not my best friend ‚Äì my best friend is my best friend. I didn‚Äôt get it. But I‚Äôve realised that your partner can be that.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Hmmm ‚Ä¶ can they, though? As so perfectly illustrated by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/david-mitchell\">David Mitchell</a>, men and women communicate in extremely different ways so, if you are in a heterosexual relationship, the odds seem stacked against you. Of course, there are exceptions to the rule but, if my husband went to the pub with a mate whose entire family had just been abducted by aliens, there‚Äôs a very real chance it might not come up. There have been many instances where something huge is happening in the life of one of his pals and I‚Äôm waiting patiently for the next instalment, but he comes home clueless. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you ask?‚Äù I‚Äôll shriek, brandishing my rolling pin. And he will look bewildered, somehow unaware he was meant to.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, I know my friends inside out, and vice versa. From their deepest dreams, hopes and desires, to how they feel about themselves and everybody they have ever met via what they fancy for lunch. We check in, we keep up, we don‚Äôt have to be reminded to enquire about the plot twists in each other‚Äôs storyline, we are living and breathing them together. How can these opposite ways of relating, of transmitting and receiving, mesh successfully so both parties get what they need?</p>\n<p>But perhaps bigger, and more important, than the question of whether it‚Äôs possible to be best friends with your partner is if it‚Äôs a good idea in the first place. Isn‚Äôt that a lot of pressure on one person, and also too great a shift from romance towards roommates? Love aside, I do like my husband, we are friendly, but I‚Äôm not sure he‚Äôs my <i>best</i> friend, nor that I want him to be. It feels co-dependent and insular. A bit Stepford, tradwife, like we might share a toothbrush or, worse, an email address.</p>\n<p>Then I asked my husband who his best friend was, and his answer, and my reaction to it, surprised me. He thought for a second, and then gave a male name. He had been best man at our wedding, so the clues were there, but I was oddly hurt. ‚ÄúNot me, then?‚Äù I clarified, in case he had mixed me and this guy up or something.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm not yours, am I?‚Äù he replied, immediately reeling off five people and one cat who would definitely be ahead of him in the queue. All fair enough. Except ‚Ä¶ it turns out that although my husband isn‚Äôt <i>my</i> best friend, and I am fine with that, I want to be <i>his</i>. Want and expect. Oh, and I‚Äôm increasingly outraged not to be, the longer I ponder it. Welcome to marriage.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/31/women-cope-better-when-their-partner-dies-ill-have-to-go-before-him-out-of-spite\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I want to feel loved, but I don‚Äôt. </strong>\n      <strong>This is sad in itself, and really scary for the future.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>I have had some health challenges in the last year and am doing my best to </strong>\n      <strong>look after myself.

Not because it is without hope ‚Äì quite the opposite ‚Äì but because this gap between you and your family could be bridged with communication. But I know that takes courage.</p>\n<p>Please go to the doctor. A proper checkup could put your mind at rest, or give you concrete answers to present to your family. So many women your age, who have had a lifetime of looking after others, are exhausted and overwhelmed ‚Äì not because they are failing, but because they are so capable. It‚Äôs time to start looking after you.</p>\n<p>UKCP registered psychotherapist Meeri Rebane was ‚Äúmoved by your letter and your courage in asking for help. It seems that being the strong physically capable ‚Äòcarer‚Äô is a role you‚Äôve carried throughout your life. From the start of your relationship with your husband, you took on the responsibility of thinking about what and who needs taking care of in the family.‚Äù Rebane went on to say that there‚Äôs ‚Äúnothing wrong with that, people can get great fulfilment from caring for others, but who took care of you when you were growing up? It seems you were taught to be the ‚Äòcaring person who would always manage‚Äô, but also that to ‚Äònot manage‚Äô was not OK.‚Äù</p>\n<p>We wondered if this was why you don‚Äôt feel you can ask for help now? I wondered about your life when you were a child. You may find the podcast I did on the <a href=\"https://pod.link/1567190358/episode/4ce2a72acd2eb9c0a989cfd7be9ffd27\">Parentified Child</a> useful.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-11\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>When you‚Äôre the planner and the fixer, you and your needs can become invisible because you just get on with it. I don‚Äôt think your husband and children are uncaring ‚Äì after all, you‚Äôve shown them a lifetime of how to do it ‚Äì but it‚Äôs very likely they have no idea at all how you feel.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúYour husband may not be capable of giving you the response you need at first,‚Äù says Rebane. ‚ÄúHis way of expressing care may be different to yours. It doesn‚Äôt mean he doesn‚Äôt want to take care of you.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>In May<strong> </strong>2018, I was scrolling through prospective dates on Bumble when I saw Charlie‚Äôs profile. I could tell we had a lot of immediate connections. He had worked for human rights organisations, travelled a lot and even had interesting profile pictures. I swiped right.</p>\n    <p>Later that day, we met at a small bar close to my work in Melbourne for a drink. Even though it was a good first date, I decided I didn‚Äôt have the energy for more dates straight away and cancelled our second one. I think he thought I was a bit of a time waster.</p>\n    <p>A month later, I was visiting family in Perth and my mum asked if I was seeing anyone. I expressed frustration that it‚Äôs so hard to sort through all the garbage on dating apps ‚Äì but there was one guy I‚Äôd met who seemed lovely and had a beautiful smile. So when I got back to Melbourne we met again for dumplings, and it was on.</p>\n    <p>After just six months together we moved into his one-bedroom bachelor pad. That was a massive mistake. We did it way too fast and immediately started squabbling. It was just too soon for two very independent people who had spent a lot of time building up their own lives to be suddenly trying to mesh them together.</p>\n    <p>By March 2020, our bickering was at an all-time high. We decided to see a couples counsellor before going on a one-month trip to South America ‚Äì we didn‚Äôt want to ruin the trip for ourselves. I remember immediately disliking the counsellor, which I think was more about what she revealed about us. At the end of the first session she just looked at us and said she didn‚Äôt think she could help because we were too far apart as individuals for things to work out. We were like, that‚Äôs really bad!</p>\n    <p>Before we left Australia we‚Äôd heard murmurings about this new virus emerging but we were feeling smug that we were escaping. After five incredible days hiking across Patagonia, we found ourselves bunkering down in a small hotel room in Punta Arenas as the news of Covid spread across the world.</p>\n    <p>Flights were cancelled, borders were closing, we had desperate messages from friends and family. We were freaking out. It went from a complete state of relaxation and wonder at the world to OMFG the world is melting down.</p>\n    <p>Charlie was way more relaxed about it than me. He was like, we‚Äôll be OK. It just wasn‚Äôt in his realm of possibility that we wouldn‚Äôt get home. So while I was contacting embassies, trying to change flights and reaching out to friends and family to figure out our way home, Charlie was happily imagining our new life in Chile. ‚ÄúBabe, imagine how good we‚Äôll get at Spanish,‚Äù he said. A line I‚Äôll always remember.</p>\n    <p>In the hotel room in Punta Arenas I knew that if the world was ending, as it felt like it was, it was him I wanted to be next to. Charlie was making us go on walks, making up songs and cracking jokes the whole time. He was bringing me out of my anxiety loop. We balanced each other out perfectly in that crisis, on opposite ends of the scale.</p>\n    <p>Eventually, we got seats on one of the last flights back from Chile before the borders closed. We were waiting on standby at the airport, and we only got seats on the flight because two temporary residents were booted off when the rules changed and only permanent residents could get back into Australia. It really was the most bonkers time.</p>\n    <p>Charlie proposed in July 2020 and we eloped in December 2020.</p>\n    <p>I thought our time in Chile was going to be the worst thing we would go through ‚Äì but we have faced many difficulties together since then.</p>\n    <p>Through it all, I‚Äôm always so grateful to have him by my side. We never went back to that couples counsellor.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/31/the-moment-i-knew-stuck-in-chile-in-the-early-days-of-covid-he-brought-me-out-of-my-anxiety-loop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Sometime in the summer of 2017 I wrote in my journal, ‚ÄúJesus fucking Christ, please save me.‚Äù I was trapped in hell, and I could see no way out. Our beautiful, sunny, two-bedroom penthouse apartment in the East Village ‚Äì which I had rented for Rayya to make her happy in the last months of her life ‚Äì had become a dungeon of misery, danger, degradation, drugs. Rayya kept the shades drawn at all hours of the day, not only because the light hurt her eyes but also because she had become intensely paranoid that she was being watched by the police, and that they were coming for her.</p>\n<p>And, to be honest, the police might very well have come for her (for both of us, actually), because our apartment now contained thousands and thousands of dollars‚Äô worth of cocaine ‚Äì some of which Rayya was cooking down and shooting into whatever veins she could find upon her beaten-down, disease-ridden body, some of which she was freebasing, some of which she was snorting up her now constantly bloodied nose. But most of the coke, as of this moment, she had chopped up and laid out in thick rails on the coffee table, next to an overflowing ashtray, a bottle of whiskey, several bottles of morphine and trazodone and Xanax, a stack of fentanyl patches and a cluster of empty beer bottles. And these heaping lines of cocaine she counted, weighed and studied all day long.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWhat the fuck are you looking at?‚Äù she demanded, glancing up for a moment from her cherished cocaine heaps and peering at me through a blue haze of cigarette smoke ‚Äì staring me down with hostile eyes that had not, as far as I could remember, blinked in days.</p>\n<p>Good question.</p>\n<p>What was I looking at?</p>\n<p>I was looking at somebody who was supposed to be dead by now ‚Äì who had been given six months to live over 15 months earlier ‚Äì but who simply refused to die. I was looking at somebody who had recently gotten kicked out of hospice (who gets kicked out of hospice, by the way?) for being aggressive and uncooperative to the kind, generous nurses and support staff who had been trying to help my beloved partner prepare her body and mind for a ‚Äúdeath with dignity‚Äù ‚Äì a death that, at this point, Rayya had utterly rejected in favour of plan B, which was to do enough drugs that she could feel immortal, that she could feel nothing.</p>\n<p>I was looking at somebody who had once been the only person on Earth who could make me feel completely safe and loved, but who now verbally abused me all day long, telling me that I was ‚Äúa fucking shit show of a failure‚Äù when it came to taking care of her; that everything I was doing to try to help her was wrong; that I was a ‚Äúneedy little fucking crybaby‚Äù who had to ‚Äúgrow the fuck up‚Äù.</p>\n<p>I first met Rayya Elias in the spring of 2000. I was 31 years old at the time, and married. I was on a certain path back then. Husband, nice house, good job, about to start a family. Except there was a problem with my hair, which was a frizzy mess. One day a friend told me I resembled a young <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/art-garfunkel\">Art Garfunkel</a>, and said I needed to do something about it. She suggested I go see this person named Rayya, who was cutting hair out of a walk-up apartment on Avenue C.</p>\n<p>I was dressed that day like a sales clerk at Banana Republic, which is how I always dressed back then. All khakis and cardigans. I remember my outfit clearly, because I looked and felt so different from Rayya, who was wearing black leather pants, a white tank top and motorcycle boots. I have fallen in love with many people at first sight, but I did not fall in love with Rayya Elias that day. In fact, I didn‚Äôt fall in love with her for another eight or nine years. But I did like her. She was funny and interesting and exotic.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/aug/30/eat-pray-love-author-elizabeth-gilbert-leaving-marriage-dying-friend\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The result is <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/800207/the-last-lions-by-edited-by-don-pinnock-and-colin-bell/\"> The Last Lions</a>, set to be published on September 16, from Smithsonian Books.</p>\n<h3>\n        <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1588348059?tag=smithsonianco-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\">\n          The Last Lions\n        </a>\n      </h3>\n<p>The Last Lions is a powerful rallying cry voiced by scientists and conservationists to save the lions before it‚Äôs too late, with stunning wildlife photography.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1588348059?tag=smithsonianco-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\"/></p>\n<p>Some of the essays explore strategies being implemented across Africa to save these animals. ‚ÄúAs we canvassed all the experts around Africa, the emerging theme was that there‚Äôs always a solution,‚Äù Bell says. The challenges in each locality are different, however, and strategies must be tailored to specific cultural, political and environmental needs.</p>\n<p>For example, a lack of oversight and resources threw the <a href=\"https://www.africanparks.org/the-parks/majete\">Majete Wildlife Reserve</a> in <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/lions-coming-back-malawi-180970109/\">Malawi</a> into disarray. It was established in the 1950s as a protected area for wild animals, such as lions, leopards and hyenas, but the reserve was poorly managed. The land and its animals were left vulnerable to loggers and poachers in the 1980s. But in 2003, a nonprofit conservation organization called African Parks established a public-private partnership to carefully manage the reserve, slowly reintroducing predators and prey to the site over many years. Majete notes that it has since reintroduced more than 3,000 animals from 17 species and currently has an estimated <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=902022455297501&amp;id=100064692638689&amp;set=a.466592618840489\">80 to 100 lions</a>.</p>\n<p>African Parks looked beyond the reserve and established strong relationships with the surrounding community early on, Pinnock notes. When he visited Majete in 2023, he spoke with park manager John Adendorff and asked how the reserve had become so successful. ‚ÄúHe told me that you put up a fence and then look after what‚Äôs <i>outside</i> it,‚Äù says Pinnock. ‚ÄúIf the park is of no value to the people around the park, you‚Äôll lose it.‚Äù The organization provides schools, clinics and technology to the neighboring communities, and in return, the people are fiercely protective of Majete and its animals.</p>\n<p>The essays in <i>The Last Lions</i> describe many facets of lion history, genetics and behavior. Here are five facts about the animals that give insight into their past, present and future.</p>\n<ul><li>According to the book <i>The Last Lions</i>, these big cats have experienced a geographic range retraction of around 85 percent since the year 1500.</li><li>Today, lions face habitat loss, poachers and many other threats.</li></ul>\n<h3>Lions roamed Europe and Asia many years ago</h3>\n<p>Although lions are thought of as a distinctly African animal, they also used to roam southern <a href=\"https://www.sapiens.org/archaeology/lions-europe/\">Europe</a> and a large part of Asia thousands of years ago. Now most live in parts of Africa, and a small population still calls India‚Äôs Gir National Park home.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúLions didn‚Äôt fit well with the rising civilizations of Europe,‚Äù says Pinnock. ‚ÄúThey were increasingly pushed out and hunted out.‚Äù The book notes that while India was still a British colony the 1800s, British officers and Indian maharajas hunted lions, almost completely wiping out their populations. Today, it‚Äôs estimated that <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/31/world/india-lion-human-conflict-intl-dst-hnk\">as many as 891</a> Asiatic lions reside in Gujarat, India.</p>\n<p>Lion territory in Africa has dwindled over the years, limited now to small regions in a smattering of countries, and none remain in the northernmost region of the continent. When Pinnock and he were born, there were hundreds of thousands of free-running lions in Africa, says Bell. ‚ÄúToday, there are no more than 23,000 to 25,000 wild lions,‚Äù he says.</p>\n<h3>We don‚Äôt really know how many lions are left in the wild</h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/see-ten-gorgeous-photographs-of-lions-and-discover-what-makes-the-majestic-felines-special-180987305/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Its <a href=\"https://www.space.com/22891-ceres-dwarf-planet.html\">daytime temperatures</a> range from a frigid minus 136 degrees to minus 28 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúLooking at this barren, frozen, gray world, we might be [forgiven] for thinking it the last place likely to host life in our solar system,‚Äù Iain Todd writes for <i> BBC Sky at Night Magazine</i>. And¬†yet, researchers now suggest Ceres might have once been habitable.</p>\n<p>In a study published in August in the journal <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt3283\"> Science Advances</a>, astronomers reveal a new piece in the puzzle of Ceres‚Äô history: The dwarf planet might have one had long-lasting chemical energy that could have sustained microbial life. While there is no evidence that life‚Äînot even single-celled organisms‚Äîever existed on the dwarf planet, the new findings suggest that if any organisms were there, they might have had ‚Äúfood‚Äù available.</p>\n<p>Thanks to data collected by NASA‚Äôs <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/dawn/\">Dawn mission</a>, which <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/after-eight-years-nasas-dawn-probe-brings-dwarf-planet-ceres-into-closest-focus-49274\">reached Ceres</a> in 2015 and ended in 2018, researchers had already figured out that the dwarf planet had an underground reservoir of salty water as well as organic material in the form of carbon molecules. These are two key ingredients for hosting some microbial life, with chemical energy being the third.</p>\n<p>In the recent study, the team created models to simulate the internal temperature and composition of Ceres over time. The models indicated that around 2.5 billion years ago, radioactive decay in the then-young world‚Äôs rocky interior could have caused hot water with dissolved gases to push up through the rocks and into the underground ocean.</p>\n<p>This process is similar to how hydrothermal vents work on our own planet.

Organisms known as <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(17)30159-8\">chemoautotrophs</a> can process chemical energy emitted by these hydrothermal vents.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúOn Earth, when hot water from deep underground mixes with the ocean, the result is often a buffet for microbes‚Äîa feast of chemical energy,‚Äù <a href=\"https://search.asu.edu/profile/3653639\">Sam Courville</a>, lead author of the study and a planetary geophysicist at Arizona State University, explains in a NASA <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/missions/dawn/nasa-ceres-may-have-had-long-standing-energy-to-fuel-habitability/\">statement</a>. ‚ÄúSo, it could have big implications if we could determine whether Ceres‚Äô ocean had an influx of hydrothermal fluid in the past.‚Äù</p>\n<p>According to the new models, Ceres is most likely to have been habitable between about 2.5 billion and 4 billion years ago, when its core‚Äôs temperature would have peaked and hot fluids would have reached the underground ocean. Since then, however, the dwarf planet‚Äôs ocean ‚Äúhas likely become a cold, concentrated brine with fewer sources of energy, making it less likely to be habitable at present,‚Äù the researchers write in the study.</p>\n<p>In effect, the warmth from radioactive decay has weakened, much of the water has likely frozen and the remaining liquid is probably very salty. What‚Äôs more, Ceres isn‚Äôt heated by the gravitational push and pull caused by orbiting a large planet‚Äîthe process that generates heat deep within Saturn‚Äôs moon <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/should-scientists-inject-saturns-moon-enceladus-with-life-180986629/\">Enceladus</a> and Jupiter‚Äôs moon <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/nasa-launches-europa-clipper-to-search-for-signs-of-life-on-jupiters-moon-180985262/\">Europa</a>, both possible candidates for hosting life.</p>\n<p>The idea of potential past habitability might feel like a far cry from the long-awaited evidence that we‚Äôre not alone in the universe. However, <a href=\"https://www.psi.edu/staff/profile/amanda-hendrix/\">Amanda Hendrix</a>, director of the Planetary Science Institute who was not involved in the study, tells <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2493280-ceres-may-have-been-habitable-at-just-half-a-billion-years-old/\"> New Scientist</a>‚Äôs Karmela Padavic-Callaghan that scientists need to investigate bodies like Ceres‚Äîworlds that have oceans now or had them in the past‚Äîif they hope to find clues to current or bygone life in our solar system.</p>\n<p>Plus, the recent paper is relevant to the study of other water-rich, icy moons and dwarf planets that are about the size of Ceres. It suggests that even if these bodies don‚Äôt have internal heating right now, they might also have been hospitable long ago.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/did-the-dwarf-planet-ceres-once-host-life-astronomers-suggest-chemical-energy-could-have-fueled-microbes-long-ago-180987240/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A digital art specialist will stay on staff at Christie‚Äôs, <i>Now Media </i>reports.</p>\n    <p>The news comes four years after Christie‚Äôs sold its first NFT, a digital certificate that lives on a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp\">blockchain</a>, ‚Äúa digital record of transactions distributed across a decentralized network of computers,‚Äù <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/hirshhorn-hosts-panel-experts-hash-out-brave-new-world-non-fungible-tokens-180977812/\">in the words</a> of <a href=\"https://hirshhorn.si.edu/explore/marina-isgro/\">Marina Isgro</a>, a curator at the Smithsonian‚Äôs Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, and proves ownership over a work of digital art. As Isgro explained during a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huoMdtBPT2c\">2021 online panel</a>, an NFT is ‚Äúa unique piece of data registered on a blockchain that can serve as a surrogate or certificate of authenticity for various kinds of objects in the digital and real worlds.‚Äù</p>\n    <h4>Fun fact: The most valuable living artists</h4>\n    <ul>\n      <li>The sale of¬†<i>Everydays: The First 5,000 Days</i>in<a href=\"https://x.com/ChristiesInc/status/1370027970560106497\">March 2021</a>marked the<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html\">third-highest</a>auction price then achieved by a<a href=\"https://www.prestigeonline.com/hk/lifestyle/art-plus-design/living-artists-most-expensive-art-jeff-koons-rabbit-david-hockney-sacha-jeffri/\">living artist</a>, placing Beeple (the name used by artist<a href=\"https://www.beeple-crap.com/about\">Mike Winkelmann</a>) after<a href=\"https://www.christies.com/en/stories/jeff-koons-rabbit-own-the-controversy-596fdd1197e040c49eda52fe2a39ea2d\">Jeff Koons</a>and<a href=\"https://www.christies.com/en/stories/david-hockney-portrait-of-an-artist-pool-with-two-figures-fc646a8d6dfb4ea98814460d351e485b\">David Hockney</a>.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>In 2021, Christie‚Äôs facilitated the sale of the NFT associated with <i>Everydays: The First 5,000 Days</i><i>,</i> a digital artwork by the artist known as <a href=\"https://www.beeple-crap.com/\">Beeple</a>. Going under the hammer for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html\">$69.3 million</a>, <i>Everydays </i>is still the most expensive NFT ever sold.</p>\n    <p>The sale helped kick off an <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/hirshhorn-hosts-panel-experts-hash-out-brave-new-world-non-fungible-tokens-180977812/\">NFT fad in the art world</a> that lasted roughly a year. Christie‚Äôs went on to invest in the space further, launching its own <a href=\"https://nft.christies.com/\">NFT auction platform</a>.</p>\n    <p>But the digital art gold rush was short-lived. Between 2021 and 2022, Christie‚Äôs reported a 96 percent decline in NFT sales, as M.K. Manoylov reported for the <i>Block</i><i> </i>in 2022. More recently, a 2024 report from<i>  NFTevening</i> found that 96 percent of NFTs are effectively ‚Äúdead,‚Äù or not valuable.</p>\n    <p>The shuttering of Christie‚Äôs digital art division comes two years after Sotheby‚Äôs, another renowned auction house, laid off numerous employees in its NFT division, as <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/major-staffing-changes-hit-sothebys-phillips-layoffs-1234673955/\"> ARTnews</a>‚Äô Shanti Escalante-De Mattei and Angelica Villa reported in 2023.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://x.com/flakoubay/status/1965091868120658137\">Weighing in on X</a>, the social media platform previously known as Twitter, digital art adviser Fanny Lakoubay says Christie‚Äôs decision is ‚Äúprobably tied to the current art market contraction.‚Äù</p>\n    <p>‚ÄúAuction houses can‚Äôt justify a whole department when it brings in less revenue than the others (even with some recent successful sales),‚Äù Lakoubay adds.</p>\n    <p>Earlier this year, the <a href=\"https://theartmarket.artbasel.com/\">Art Basel and UBS Global Art Market Report</a> found that sales in the international art market overall declined by 12 percent in 2024. ‚ÄúDecline in value was driven by cooling at the top end,‚Äù the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/arts/design/art-basel-ubs-art-market-report.html\">report stated</a>, <a href=\"https://theartmarket.artbasel.com/download/The-Art-Basel-and-UBS-Art-Market-Report-2025.pdf\">describing</a> 2024 as ‚Äúa year of continuing geopolitical tensions, economic volatility and trade fragmentation.‚Äù</p>\n    <p>The Christie‚Äôs news is ‚Äúdefinitely not a great public signal,‚Äù Lakoubay writes. ‚ÄúBut we should also remember: Auction houses only focus on secondary sales of already well-known artists and brands. It‚Äôs still too early for that model to really work/scale with digital art.‚Äù</p>\n    <p>Christie‚Äôs is not pulling away from digital tender entirely. Earlier this year, the auction house debuted a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/24/realestate/crypto-real-estate-christies.html\">crypto real estate division</a>, which allows buyers to purchase properties with digital currencies.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/christies-helped-drive-the-art-worlds-nft-craze-now-the-auction-house-is-shutting-down-its-digital-art-division-180987306/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Oh yes! Is that done by forcing relationships then putting them under outre stressors, including unexpected toilet conditions, on an otherwise paradisiacal island? Yes! And is it at least nominally presented by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/davina-mccall\">Davina McCall</a>, though actual sight of her is limited to a few opening minutes of the first episode and it is increasingly cheeky to bill her as a presence? Yes, yes to all of the above. Welcome to your next addictive reality show, 12 hour-long episodes designed to transition you comfortably into the autumn schedules ‚Äì Stranded on Honeymoon Island.</p>\n<p>It is Love Island meets Married at First Sight, if ‚Äì and you will have to strain your imaginations here ‚Äì the contestants on Love Island weren‚Äôt often instantly awful. This lot are, in the main, rather gorgeously endearing. I hadn‚Äôt realised how ready I was for a show that didn‚Äôt require me to bring my best loathing game. I find I have so much energy for the rest of the day.</p>\n<p>Like all good reality TV shows (take note, Destination X), the setup is as stupid as it is simple and as simple as it is stupid. Eight kabillion single people who are ready to find lurve speed-date, fill in feedback forms, and from them a dozen are paired up by matchmakers. They then get hitched in the Philippines by celebrant Wenly (‚ÄúAlthough this marriage is not legally binding, you are making a meaningful commitment to someone‚Äù, which is true as long as you realise that someone is the production company). The couples then get left on a nearby island for three weeks. There is a double bed, rudimentary shelter, a row of tinned foodstuffs and a loo that is maybe a notch and a half better than a bucket. We are promised that ‚Äúmystery crates‚Äù containing items and challenges designed to test the honeymooners‚Äô compatibility will arrive in later episodes. Good times!</p>\n<p>You find yourself rooting for an unusually high proportion of the couples. I wish for no one to dim the light of effervescent party girl Hannah and I very much feel that lovely suit designer Sam is the man to allow her to shine. When they hit the first bump in the road, I find myself pressing my fists to my face, begging her not to let her past bad experiences distort it into something it is not. ‚ÄúHe is not your ex!‚Äù I plead to the screen. ‚ÄúLook at his eyes! Look at the way he recut your wedding dress into something playful yet provocative yet island-chores-ready. Come on! The past is not your future.‚Äù</p>\n<p>I am also fully in favour of Helen (‚ÄúEssex girl and raging lesbian ‚Äì that‚Äôs how I introduce myself!‚Äù) and Abby making a go of things. What can I tell you? They‚Äôre just right together. I bet Davina agrees with me. If we ever see her again, maybe she‚Äôll say so.</p>\n<p>Oh, and the two devout Christians, David and Ini! He used to sleep around but it wasn‚Äôt making him happy so he ‚Äúcried to God‚Äù for help and it was given. Now he is ready to settle down, start a family, give his children the love he didn‚Äôt experience at boarding school and I just know that Ini is the one for him. Sure, it might have been better if he hadn‚Äôt mentioned at the altar that there was another woman on the speed dates he would have been equally happy to find coming down the aisle towards him, but every non-marriage has its teething troubles, amirite? I mean, just ask Moray (another boarding-school boy) and Mae (who is single after her ex had a terrible accident ‚Äúand fell into his colleague‚Äôs vagina‚Äù). He tells her on the second day of their honeymoon that she reminds him of his cousin and he‚Äôs also getting ‚Äúlittle sister vibes‚Äù.

    "body": "<p>Grownups often roll their eyes at young love: at how all-consuming it is for the teenagers involved, and how predictably doomed it is to fail. But my holiday romance changed the course of my life.</p>\n<p>I was 16 when I met Giacomo at a bar in Atina, the tiny Italian mountain town where my parents grew up. There was a local festival one evening and tables were scarce, so our two friendship groups ended up squished around the same one. At more than 6ft tall, Giacomo was hard to miss. He was also friendly, smiley and, while he didn‚Äôt speak a word of English, I loved that he spared me the whole <i>ciao bella</i> swagger usually reserved for ‚Äúforeign girls‚Äù.</p>\n<p>I wasn‚Äôt foreign. Not really. My parents moved to Scotland in the 1960s, settling in the Borders town of Selkirk, but Atina had always been part of our lives, woven into every holiday, every dish on the dinner table. But, after meeting Giacomo, I began to see Italy differently. It wasn‚Äôt simply something I‚Äôd inherited any more; it was something I was experiencing for myself.</p>\n<p>So, when summer ended and real life began, I didn‚Äôt return to Scotland as I‚Äôd originally planned. I hadn‚Äôt enjoyed school and had left as soon as I could, intending to continue my studies through other routes. I stayed in Italy to figure out what I wanted to do with my newfound sense of independence ‚Äì and my newfound love.</p>\n<p>When Giacomo moved to Rome to study architecture that autumn, he proved to be an excellent <i>cicerone</i> ‚Äì an Italian word for a cultural guide ‚Äì and I got to know a version of the city that went beyond its landmarks. Through him, I was introduced to student life, open-air music festivals, and secret little bakeries that sold pastries from the back door in the early hours.</p>\n<p>But it wasn‚Äôt all gelato and romance. I drifted between courses and jobs, hoping something would click, but nothing ever quite did. I tried studying in Italy but couldn‚Äôt get past the oral exams and, missing home, committed to a degree at Edinburgh University where ‚Äì to no one‚Äôs surprise ‚Äì I ended up studying Italian. Giacomo and I tried to make it work long distance, but mobile phones didn‚Äôt exist and the constant push and pull between countries, cultures and expectations took its toll.</p>\n<p>Our relationship didn‚Äôt last, but my love for Italy never died.

He warned me he was a sex addict, and I am enthusiastic about sex. On our first night together I was aware of some erectile dysfunction ‚Äì he wasn‚Äôt entirely hard and benefited from holding himself when penetrating me</strong>\n      <strong> ‚Äì </strong>\n      <strong>though this didn‚Äôt stop us reaching climax. We joked about how many times I would orgasm and neither of us seemed inhibited. </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Over time, my husband needed </strong>\n      <strong>more and more help with ejaculating and would often lose his erection</strong>\n      <strong> during sex. </strong>\n      <strong>He has shown </strong>\n      <strong>less interest in any form of intimacy with me, while I have been trying to show my attraction to him in other ways, like hugging and holding hands. </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>About </strong>\n      <strong>six months into our relationship, I became aware he was using online pornography while I was out of the house. It seemed that it was porn he was addicted to, rather than the act of sex. It upset me, as I know people who have been exploited in the industry. We discussed this, and he seemed to understand, but his porn use became more entrenched, while our sex life has diminished. </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On the odd occasion when we try to have sex, he struggles to achieve an erection, whether it‚Äôs me or him initiating. When we do start, </strong>\n      <strong>his erection fades away within moments. I try to reassure him, but I feel embarrassed and worthless as a partner</strong>\n      <strong>, and I miss him terribly. It has been </strong>\n      <strong>more than a year since we last tried to be intimate.</strong>\n      <strong> Is there any way back?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Compulsivity of thought or actions, no matter how it is expressed, is related to anxiety and other psychological issues. Your husband‚Äôs compulsivity ‚Äì in relation to porn use and perhaps to other things as well ‚Äì seems to have become so entrenched that it is now a problem for both of you, for which he probably needs treatment and you need support. But it is not necessarily the reason for your dwindling sex life. In fact, he may be using porn to try to achieve erections and prove that he is capable of them in a situation where he will not feel judged.</p>\n    <p>A man‚Äôs relationship with his penis is complex. If it doesn‚Äôt work as well as he or his partner want it to, he experiences shame and anxiety and, the next time he tries to become erect, his anxiety can lead to repeat failure as a self-fulfilling prophecy. With continued failure, a man will often withdraw from sex with a partner (no matter how understanding they are) because he simply cannot face another failure.</p>\n    <p>Erectile dysfunction is treatable, and it is important to find the cause. And repeated erectile failures need to be investigated because they can be a symptom of a serious medical condition.

Her best friend, who was a bridesmaid at her first wedding, did a reading, and the couple gave their 22 guests kites made of paper studded with poppy seeds that they could plant later at home. Afterwards, they returned home for food and drinks with their guests, including their 12-year-old son and Foster-Jerrett‚Äôs 19-year-old son from her first marriage. Since the ceremony, she and Dean, a 49-year-old local government officer, ‚Äúare closer than ever. We realised how much more in love we are with each other.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Foster-Jerrett and her husband are one of the many couples choosing to take part in vow renewals. It‚Äôs something that celebrities have been doing with gusto this summer. Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz renewed their vows in August, just three years after their original wedding. Guy Ritchie and his wife, Jacqui Ainsley, also renewed their vows in August at Stonehenge after 10 years of marriage. Other celebrities who have said ‚ÄúI do‚Äù again include singer Beyonc√© and rapper Jay-Z; musician Justin Timberlake and actor Jessica Biel; actors Viola Davis and Julius Tennon; former talkshow host Ellen DeGeneres and actor Portia de Rossi; and the Biebers, model Hailey and singer Justin. Brooklyn‚Äôs own parents, David and Victoria Beckham, renewed their vows in<strong> </strong>2006.</p>\n<p>The ceremonies, where couples reaffirm their love for one another, can be officiated by anyone as they‚Äôre not legally binding, so they might ask friends, family ‚Äì or indeed Mary Poppins tribute acts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://qaspractice.com/our-therapies-and-psychotherapists/susanna-abse\">Susanna Abse</a>, a couples therapist and author of Tell Me the Truth About Love, says one of the main reasons couples decide to renew their vows is that they didn‚Äôt have the wedding they wanted the first time round. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so much buildup and expectation, and a lot of fantasy around it,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThere is family, people to please.‚Äù Doing it all over again can be an attempt to reclaim the day. ‚ÄúThey feel they‚Äôve got more control over how the whole thing goes, and it is about them and not about other people‚Äôs ideas of how things should be.‚Äù</p>\n<p>For her first wedding to Dean, Foster-Jerrett, who also works as a celebrant, felt she needed to conform to how a blushing bride should look, with a long dress and her hair pinned up. ‚ÄúThis time I wore my dream dress, which was gothic and lacy, with some Dr Martens. I felt the best I‚Äôve ever felt.‚Äù</p>\n<p>John Moody, 74, a retired production manager from Torquay, Devon, decided to throw his wife, Jenny, 78, a surprise vow renewal in March for their 50th anniversary. Partly, this was an attempt to ‚Äúmake up‚Äù for their first wedding in 1975. ‚ÄúIt was a register office job, the normal 10 minutes in and out, because we didn‚Äôt have a lot of money,‚Äù he says. Working up to the renewal was ‚Äúa bit difficult‚Äù, he says: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never lied so much in my life.‚Äù</p>\n<p>He convinced Jenny, a retired credit controller, that she had to get a new dress so they could have an anniversary photoshoot on Babbacombe Downs, overlooking the sea. On the day, when she saw the guests waiting for them and realised what was really happening, ‚Äúshe looked gobsmacked. I said: ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt hit me!‚Äô And she said: ‚ÄòNo, I‚Äôm not going to do it here.‚Äô‚Äù Afterwards, they took the party to the nearby home of their 47-year-old daughter, Nicola, to celebrate with a meal and champagne.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/31/i-do-again-why-are-so-many-people-renewing-their-marriage-vows\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But once we met, I wanted to spend all my time with her</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>When I slid into Maria‚Äôs DMs, saying something like, ‚ÄúYou seem intriguing ‚Äì sending love and light,‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt expecting anything to come from it. I‚Äôd had an ongoing illness since my early 20s, had lost a lot of weight and become reclusive. But something in me was changing; I‚Äôd decided to come off the medication I‚Äôd been on for years, hoping to improve my health so I had the energy to push myself out of my isolated state.</p>\n<p>I put off meeting Maria because of my insecurities about how I looked, after my illness. But once we met, I wanted to spend all my time with her. I hadn‚Äôt had sex in 15 years and had almost forgotten what it felt like. But sex with Maria ‚Äì slow and sensual, with lots of kissing and touching ‚Äì was completely different to the sex I‚Äôd had in my 20s. It was the kind of sex I‚Äôd always wanted but never had.</p>\n<p>Still, there was an imbalance; Maria was a working mum, while I wasn‚Äôt working, which caused tension. She would push me away, wanting to be with someone who could relate to what was going on in her life and support her. To become that, I needed to be in a position, physically and mentally, where I could work again. Not long after meeting Maria, my health rebounded almost miraculously. Stopping medication helped me gain 23kg, my strength returned, and I got a job, which made our relationship more equal.</p>\n<p>It felt so good to be having sex again¬†after such a long time, and with a¬†beautiful woman I felt passionately about, that I wanted to have it almost every time we saw each other. As¬†a¬†working mother, Maria didn‚Äôt have the energy for that, and resented not being able to be present for her daughter in the way she wanted to be. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/sex\">Sex</a> was off the table when her daughter was around, and Maria‚Äôs interest in a slower, non-goal-oriented Tantric approach, where we just breathe and touch each other, sometimes with our clothes on, didn‚Äôt seem the best use of the time we had. I became frustrated that my needs weren‚Äôt being met.</p>\n<p>Maria suggested we take a three-month break. I used the time to focus on my career and work on myself, and our relationship is stronger since we got back together a month ago. Although I‚Äôd love to build a life together, and hope one day we will, I‚Äôm realising that Maria‚Äôs need for us to have our own lives is healthy, especially when I‚Äôm still rebuilding mine.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Maria, 35</strong>\n    </h2>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>With my daughter‚Äôs father, I felt neglected, rejected and invisible. But Scott makes me feel valued, appreciated and sexy</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>Around the time Scott DM‚Äôd me, I was sharing a bedroom with my five-year-old daughter and hadn‚Äôt had sex in five years. After I suggested we move the conversation to WhatsApp, we started messaging constantly. I craved being with him, and felt as if I missed his body, even though we hadn‚Äôt met yet.</p>\n<p>When we eventually met three months later, I felt a disconnect between the person in front of me and who I‚Äôd got to know over the phone. He was like a ghost in the world, and it scared me ‚Äì as a mother, I couldn‚Äôt risk getting into a relationship with the wrong person. Online he was great company, but in reality, he couldn‚Äôt walk properly and was in pain. Everything seemed much more real and complicated. But when I pulled back, he pushed forward.</p>\n<p>The first time we had sex, it felt so natural. Scott was what I‚Äôd always dreamed of: attentive, caring, open‚Äëminded, curious. I‚Äôd had sexual relationships since I was 16, but I never felt satisfied the way I do with Scott. In my relationship with my daughter‚Äôs father, I felt neglected, rejected and invisible. But Scott makes me feel valued, appreciated and sexy.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/07/this-is-how-we-do-it-a-three-month-break-from-sex-gave-us-the-reset-we-needed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Becoming single was a revelation; it gave me such a sense of empowerment as I was undergoing a big career change from teaching to social work.</p>\n<p>It was during my final placement in 2024 that I met Mill and was immediately curious about them. The working environment they created was really beautiful and safe, and they had this unusual balance of reserve and openness.</p>\n<p>We‚Äôd have these great chats on Teams, that often veered into something that felt like a real friendship, but Mill was my manager and we were both trying to keep things professional.</p>\n<p>The potential power imbalance was somewhat mitigated by the fact that I‚Äôm actually a few years older, and once my placement was over it was me who made the first move. I asked Mill out to a gig in the work chat and the question hung in the air for weeks.</p>\n<p>At the last minute, they took me up on the invitation and we shared the quintessential queer experience of neither of us being sure if we were on a date or not.</p>\n<p>We didn‚Äôt really listen to any of the music that night; we couldn‚Äôt stop chatting. It was over the course of that evening that I realised Mill wasn‚Äôt nearly as serious as I‚Äôd thought. They have a great sense of humour and we learned we shared more in common than we realised. We‚Äôd both lived through our wild ratbag phases and were leading more wholesome lives, and knowing we shared that balance was really attractive.</p>\n<p>Not long after the gig, Mill went out on a limb and sent me a text sharing their feelings for me. A few weeks later we went on our first official date. We went to a soju bar for a nightcap after a comedy gig and took a long walk along the Birrarung before sharing our first kiss in front of an audience of garbage collectors as they emptied bins in the decidedly unromantic setting of a desolate Fed Square in Melbourne.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôd long wondered whether I was queer, and my previous forays, while meaningful and positive, hadn‚Äôt confirmed anything for me. I was really conscious of not wasting people‚Äôs time or messing them around while I figured myself out, but with Mill things were different. The attraction was immense, but there was also a deep sense of safety and calmness I felt around them. As we spent more time together outside work, I began to see the full form of this person. Their beauty and generosity of spirit runs so deep. Over the next few months we became a couple.</p>\n<p>Mill is always thinking of others. If you visit their house, they‚Äôll make you a snack pack when you leave and they<i> </i>love to celebrate other‚Äôs achievements.</p>\n<p>As the year came to an end and my social work studies were complete, it was time to decide if I‚Äôd continue paying fees to remain a registered teacher or let it lapse. It felt like a huge deal for me to close the door on teaching but I made the call and I was really excited to get the letter that confirmed it was official.</p>\n<p>When it arrived, Mill showed up at my front door with a homemade carrot cake decorated with the words ‚ÄúHappy Deregistration‚Äù.</p>\n<p>I already knew what a good sort Mill was, but in that moment it really became clear that I was with a profoundly kind human being; someone who noticed little details, cared about what was going on for me and was on my team.</p>\n<p>Even though the cake was about a bureaucratic detail, more than that it was the celebration of a new chapter, a deepening of my conviction in the life I wanted.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/07/the-moment-i-knew-they-decorated-a-carrot-cake-to-celebrate-with-me\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>On a video call from his Gothenburg apartment, Jens Lekman is contemplating the 132 weddings at which he has performed. ‚ÄúWhen you play a normal show, everything follows a schedule. At a wedding, you never know if you‚Äôre going to get punched by someone‚Äôs uncle or go skinny dipping with the couple.‚Äù He pauses. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs what I like: putting myself in weird, awkward situations.‚Äù</p>\n<p>These include passing out inside a large but poorly ventilated wedding cake. ‚ÄúIt was a small wedding and a lot of stuff was DIY. It wasn‚Äôt fun to realise they had forgotten the air holes.‚Äù Or a man nearly dying on the dancefloor. ‚ÄúYeah, that happened, too. But he made it.‚Äù</p>\n<p>You may know Lekman as the Swedish indie star whose forlorn love songs can simultaneously break your heart and make you laugh. You may not know that, ever since his 2004 song If You Ever Need a Stranger (To Sing at Your Wedding), he‚Äôs been taking requests to do just that. In the beginning, ‚Äúit was just random people who had heard the song,‚Äù he says. But, after an Australian couple shared a video of him playing their wedding in 2013, he was suddenly inundated with requests: ‚ÄúI owe them a lot of gratitude.‚Äù</p>\n<p>In retrospect, he‚Äôs always been made for the job. Since the early 00s, Jekman has made records defined by wry yet kind-hearted observations about romance and heartbreak. He named his 2012 album I Know What Love Isn‚Äôt and, on To Know Your Mission, from 2017, Lekman tells us he just wants to listen to people‚Äôs stories. He says the weddings have only underscored this purpose: ‚ÄúI want to be of service to the people who the music means something to.‚Äù</p>\n<p>With streaming making it ever harder to make a living from music, playing weddings also became a way to get by financially, as well as providing inspiration for his own songwriting. Lekman recounts a story about the director, John Waters, getting picked up while hitchhiking through the Nevada desert. ‚ÄúWhat the hell are you doing out here?‚Äù the driver asked. Waters replied that it helped provide inspiration. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what the weddings are for me,‚Äù Lekman says with a smile.</p>\n<p>His new album is called Songs for Other People‚Äôs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/weddings\">Weddings</a>, and comes with a novel of the same name written with David Levithan, author of books including Nick and Norah‚Äôs Infinite Playlist. They‚Äôve been friends for 20 years; just before the pandemic, Lekman reached out with an idea for something about ‚Äúmy parallel career as a wedding singer‚Äù, having wondered whether it could be a TV show or musical.</p>\n<p>Levithan was all in. ‚ÄúThe situation was so tantalising,‚Äù he says on the same call. ‚ÄúThe idea of writing about these weddings from the point of view of the wedding singer was something I would never have thought of in a million years.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The result is a ‚Äúnovel-with-songs‚Äù formed from what Lekman calls ‚Äúa dialogue between me and David about love and relationships‚Äù. It tells the story of the romance between a wedding singer called J and his girlfriend V, through 10 weddings at which he performs. Lekman‚Äôs accompanying album imagines what happens in between the book‚Äôs chapters: he was inspired by albums with stories running through them, such as the Streets‚Äô A Grand Don‚Äôt Come For Free and Frank Sinatra‚Äôs Watertown.</p>\n<p>The result is ‚Äúpurely fictional but, at the same time, emotionally very much both of ours‚Äù, as Levithan puts it. Given that it‚Äôs the story of a Swedish singer who plays weddings, it blurs art and life: ‚ÄúI love the confusion ‚Äì and I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs really any way around it,‚Äù Lekman says, though they decided to change the main character‚Äôs name to J: ‚ÄúIn the first chapter I wrote, he was named Jens and that was <i>too</i> confusing,‚Äù says Levithan.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/sep/05/youre-either-getting-punched-or-going-skinny-dipping-swedish-indie-star-jens-lekman-on-playing-132-weddings-of-his-fans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

How can I meet someone without having to be a liar or a hypocrite?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><i> Eleanor says:</i> If it‚Äôs your job to figure out when to share this, it‚Äôs also a partner‚Äôs job to figure out when to ask. Wanting kids isn‚Äôt like monogamy or working for a living, where until instructed otherwise people can basically assume that‚Äôs your plan. More people than ever are deciding they don‚Äôt want kids. The fact that you‚Äôre one of them is not shocking, confronting or even especially unusual. If that‚Äôs a dealbreaker for a partner, they need to share their preference as much as you need to share yours.</p>\n    <p>So yes, there‚Äôs a reason to share this but it‚Äôs not because you‚Äôd be a liar or a hypocrite if you didn‚Äôt. It doesn‚Äôt need to be as hair-shirted as all that. After all, do people who want children start all their relationships by announcing ‚ÄúI know I want children‚Äù? If they don‚Äôt, do you immediately think, ‚Äúliar‚Äù? A hypocrite is two-faced, preaches one thing and does another. Unless you‚Äôre banging on pots and pans saying ‚Äúeveryone should be totally forthcoming‚Äù while keeping this to yourself, I struggle to see why disclosing in your own time would make you a hypocrite.</p>\n    <p>You face the same difficulties we all do when it comes to lifestyle compatibility questions ‚Äì whether we have or want kids, but also whether we‚Äôre open to marriage, whether we‚Äôll move cities, be a stay-at-home parent, help take care of in-laws. For all of us, it is a delicate balance of figuring out how to candidly share our preferences about these things, in case they‚Äôre dealbreakers, without it coming off like the most important thing about us is our list of ‚Äúno‚Äùs.</p>\n    <p>Too little candour, too late risks unnecessary pain, but too much too soon risks feeling like you‚Äôre ticking boxes, or racing to ask what a life partnership would look like before you‚Äôve even established whether either of you want another date. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúhow do I avoid lying‚Äù so much as ‚Äúhow do I share this important thing about me without making it seem like the most important thing about me‚Äù.</p>\n    <p>There are enough people out there who don‚Äôt want children, or who at least haven‚Äôt made up their minds, that I‚Äôm confident your preference, by itself, won‚Äôt count you out of all relationships.</p>\n    <p>When the topic of children does come up, it might help to frame the conversation as what you‚Äôre saying yes to, rather than what you‚Äôre refusing. Once a person has some sense of who you are, you could say something like ‚ÄúI just want to flag this in case it really matters to you, I know I don‚Äôt want kids. I love my life and my friends and I want to spend my time doing (the things that are specific to you). I just want to make sure you know that going forwards.‚Äù Telling people what you do want rather than what you don‚Äôt somehow makes it feel a little more like a dispatch from your character ‚Äì a part of who you are and what you‚Äôre like ‚Äì and a little less like ground rules, box ticking or conflict anticipation.</p>\n    <p>When to move from an early-phase relationship to figuring out what a long-term one would look like is a hard question with many different answers. You can‚Äôt make that transition without some bumps in expectations. Discovering how you smooth those bumps together might be as telling as the preferences you both disclose.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/05/i-dont-want-childen-is-it-hypocritical-to-not-be-forthright-about-this-soon-after-meeting-someone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Since then, a rift has emerged ‚Äì Paul wants potatoes with every meal. Actually, he often wants two types of potatoes with his meals ‚Äì mash and chips, for example, or roasties and mash. I prefer rice. We split the cooking, so it‚Äôs a continual battle between us: which carb is better?</p>\n<p>Paul is part-Irish and part-Welsh, and says potatoes are part of his heritage. But I‚Äôm Indian, so the same is true for me about rice. I‚Äôve always eaten rice as my carb, even when sharing meals with people from different backgrounds. To me, rice isn‚Äôt just a side dish, it‚Äôs a cornerstone of culture, identity, and countless comfort meals and festive feasts.</p>\n<p>Paul also says that potatoes are more versatile, but that‚Äôs laughable. Rice can be steamed, fried, boiled, fermented, rolled, wrapped, puffed, flaked, and transformed into countless dishes like biryani, sushi, sticky mango rice, kheer, onigiri and more. It doesn‚Äôt need to put on a show to be delicious, unlike the potato, which needs loads of salt, breadcrumbs or oil to make it great. Rice is the perfect blank canvas to soak up flavour.</p>\n<p>Paul also says rice spikes blood sugar. But I don‚Äôt think dauphinois smothered in cream and cheese (his favourite form of potato) is exactly a miracle health food.</p>\n<p>Sometimes I want to have a traditional British meal, like a roast dinner, or a steak, with rice, but Paul hits the roof. He says, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt have rice with that.‚Äù But I can and I do.</p>\n<p>I am more flexible with his meals than he is with mine. When he cooks, I have potatoes with whatever we‚Äôre having. But I would like us to just have one type of potato with our meal, we don‚Äôt need two: it‚Äôs unnecessary and unhealthy.</p>\n<p>I love Paul, but living with someone who worships potatoes as though they‚Äôre the eighth wonder of the world is a lot at times. He needs to come around to my way of eating.</p>\n<h2>The defence: Paul</h2>\n<blockquote>\n      <p/>\n      <i>I made thousand-layer potatoes and they were amazing. Noor pretended she didn‚Äôt like them</i>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>I love potatoes, but Noor is obsessed with rice. I can‚Äôt stand rice as it‚Äôs very boring, but I‚Äôve adapted since we started living together.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm Irish and Welsh, so potatoes are in my blood, but Noor says the same about rice. You can‚Äôt argue with either of us from a cultural perspective. The issue is, seeing as I do more of the cooking, I often opt for other carbs before I do rice.</p>\n<p>For me, rice just doesn‚Äôt hit the same. Potatoes are the most versatile food. They‚Äôre both a carb and a vegetable. They are cheap and delicious, and there is so much that can be done with them ‚Äì mash, fries, jacket potatoes, dauphinois, croquettes, crisps ‚Ä¶ the list goes on.</p>\n<p>Sometimes I like to put two types of potato with our dinner ‚Äì mash and fries, or croquettes and mash ‚Äì but I don‚Äôt do it every night. Noor says it‚Äôs unhealthy and that I should make space for other vegetables, but I disagree. I recently discovered how to cook thousand-layer potatoes and they were amazing. Noor quite liked them, though she pretended she didn‚Äôt.</p>\n<p>I don‚Äôt mind cooking rice, but it‚Äôs a hassle with all the water-measuring, and I find it very plain. You have to dress it up to make it taste of anything.</p>\n<p>I have started eating a lot more rice when it‚Äôs appropriate ‚Äì with curry, for example ‚Äì but I don‚Äôt believe in having it as a standard accompaniment to all our dishes. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs versatile enough. Noor, on the other hand, wants rice with things like a roast dinner, or a piece of chicken.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/04/you-be-the-judge-my-boyfriend-wants-two-types-of-potato-with-our-meals-but-i-prefer-rice-should-he-compromise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The star and her husband, and nephew Julez Smith, joined a starry front row, which included Omar Sy, Steve McQueen, PinkPantheress, Spike Lee, Emile Smith Rowe and Victor Wembanyama.</p>\n    <p>Even without a megastar, the show was worth the wait. Williams took over as creative director of menswear in June 2023 and his spring-summer 2026 collection was his best yet ‚Äì with louche retro tailoring and unusual combinations such as cargo pants and a shrunken sweater.</p>\n    <p>The collection excelled when performing one of luxury‚Äôs current favourite tricks ‚Äì making premium versions of everyday items. Here, that included a striped polo shirt, a boxy work shirt and chinos. This look, worn with a ribbed vest, is likely to be copied by those who like fashion but lack <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/louis-vuitton\">Louis Vuitton</a> budgets.</p>\n    <p>Entitled Paris to India, Williams was inspired by what the press release called ‚Äúthe multifaceted sensibilities of present-day Indian sartorialism‚Äù. In practice, the influence of India‚Äôs aesthetics could be seen most clearly in ornate decoration on the trunks some models wheeled down the runway.</p>\n    <p>The show‚Äôs set was created by Bijoy Jain, the founder of the architecture practice Studio Mumbai. A giant rendering of snakes and ladders ‚Äì an Indian game that dates to the second century ‚Äì was hand-painted on the catwalk. A Punjabi track called Yaara, co-produced by the Indian composer AR Rahman, featured on the soundtrack played by a live orchestra.</p>\n    <p>If collaboration with Indian creatives gave voice to the culture that provided inspiration to a collection by a European megabrand, there were also some slightly more reductive tropes, as with the embroidered exotic animals. These made use of imagery originally created by Louis Vuitton in 2007 for Wes Anderson‚Äôs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/nov/25/comedy.drama1\">The Darjeeling Limited</a>, a film set in India but remaining, as the critic Ellen E Jones <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/feb/02/films-about-whiteness-race-sofia-coppola-wes-anderson\">wrote last year</a>, a ‚Äúwhimsically white nostalgia-world‚Äù.

He dressed celebrities attending the Met Gala, including Doechii, Future, Sabrina Carpenter and Jeremy Allen White.</p>\n    <p>Not all of Williams‚Äôs work here was celebrated.

But for her show in Paris on a sweltering Wednesday evening, there was a shift to a new generation on the catwalk.</p>\n    <p>Liam Gallagher‚Äôs son Gene, Bobby Gillespie‚Äôs son Wolf and Myles Lewis-Skelly, Arsenal‚Äôs 18-year-old midfielder and left-back, who broke into the first team in the 2024/25 season, modelled.</p>\n    <p>The collection was shown in a room full of bookshelves ‚Äì fitting for a brand inspired by writers from James Baldwin to Nikki Giovanni, whose poem My Tower (Pretty Little Baby) was on the show notes. Titled Jewel, it featured Wales Bonner looking at archetypes of clothing and perfecting them through her specific lens.</p>\n    <p>Standout designs included a hunting jacket cut to accentuate the wearer‚Äôs waist, a tailored black suit with brown lapels and jumpers in a melange knit, worn with shorts.</p>\n    <p>Different takes on glamour were explored, from the sequin chiffon shirt and lowslung jeans worn by Gillespie, to Lewis-Skelly‚Äôs simple silk shirt and trousers and models in tailcoats, carrying gloves.</p>\n    <p>The collection once again had that signature Wales Bonner secret sauce: clothes that felt conceptual enough for a catwalk show, but were also seriously desirable. Those in the front row were likely making mental shopping lists as the models came down the catwalk.</p>\n    <p>Backstage, Wales Bonner said she was thinking about ‚Äúpeople who collect specific types of clothing, and what that wardrobe looks like‚Äù. She focused that around ‚Äúmixing sports heritage and casual preppy language, and fine tailoring‚Äù.</p>\n    <p>Part of the inspiration came from working on the Met Gala and its accompanying exhibition, Superfine, with the theme of Black style and dandyism. ‚ÄúI wanted to have some sense of continuity and think about that character,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhat would they wear in a more everyday way?‚Äù</p>\n    <p>She said working with Hamilton had been particularly important. ‚ÄúHe has been so supportive of me over the years, it‚Äôs so special for him to give me the opportunity on such a world stage. [It was a] really inspiring process, there were definitely things I took from that language.‚Äù</p>\n    <p>The milestone of the brand reaching a decade was also on her mind. ‚ÄúThe learnings I‚Äôve had over the last 10 years, that‚Äôs in everything I put forward and think about the future,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôve got enough confidence and I‚Äôve built enough of a language and identity, we can be a bit relaxed.‚Äù</p>\n    <p>The designer‚Äôs influence has increased over that time, along with the brand. In April, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ffff22da-0c49-4945-a7bc-cfbdac5ac3b0\">it was reported</a> that the brand expected to end the financial year with 81% growth compared with the previous year, with revenue doubling since 2022.</p>\n    <p>The designer‚Äôs collaboration with Adidas, begun in 2020, is central to this. It has helped the sports brand boom over the past few years ‚Äì everyone from Rihanna to Rishi Sunak has started wearing her popular silver and leopard print Samba shoe.</p>\n    <p>This collection moved the narrative on ‚Äì it debuted a collaboration with Y-3, the Adidas label that originally started as partnership between the sports brand and Yohji Yamamoto. On the catwalk, this was seen in a tracktop and shorts, as well as football boot-like sneakers. These shoes, described by Wales Bonner as ‚Äúquite iconic‚Äù, could well be the next Samba.</p>\n    <p>The opening of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/balenciaga\">Balenciaga</a> by Demna, an exhibition showcasing items created by the mononymic designer over his decade at the brand, also too place on Wednesday. Displaying designs including the leather bag that looks like the Ikea Frakta, a skirt made out of a towel and a cap with branding similar to that of Bernie Sanders‚Äô 2016 election campaign, it demonstrated how influential Demna‚Äôs pop art-like take on luxury has been.</p>\n    <p>As he moves to a job designing for Gucci, Pierpaolo Piccioli, formerly of Valentino, will take over at Balenciaga. Piccioli was present at this opening, possibly to absorb the Balenciaga of his predecessor. His first collection for the brand will debut in October.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jun/26/grace-wales-bonner-adds-secret-sauce-to-collection-that-reinvents-fashion-archetypes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The pageantry and drama of the papacy is very much on trend. Hot on the heels of white smoke at the Vatican and Conclave in cinemas, the gothic Palais des Papes in Avignon, home to the popes of the 14th century, hosted a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/louis-vuitton\">Louis Vuitton</a> catwalk, the first fashion show at the palace in its 700-year history.</p>\n    <p>There was no shortage of pomp and ceremony in the central courtyard of one of Europe‚Äôs largest medieval structures, where 400 chairs with tall, arched backs and plush, cardinal-red cushions were ranked tightly for Brigitte Macron, Cate Blanchett, Pharrell Williams, a clutch of celebrities making a post-Cannes detour, and a select few of Louis Vuitton‚Äôs most deep-pocketed clients.</p>\n    <p>In a preview, the designer Nicolas Ghesqui√®re said the collection was part-Arthurian legend, part-Haim sisters on stage. (Danielle and Este Haim were in the audience; the medieval ghosts perhaps watching from within the walls.) ‚ÄúThere is something medieval, for sure, but something futuristic too. This is armour, but for now,‚Äù he said.</p>\n    <p>Ghesqui√®re chose the building last year, drawn not by its papal origins but by his own memories of attending the experimental theatre festival it hosts each summer. ‚ÄúDressing is a performance that we are all part of. I love that about fashion, I think it‚Äôs really cool,‚Äù he said.</p>\n    <p>That the papacy has been so visible this year is fitting for a designer whose nose for the zeitgeist has secured an impressive 11-year run at the helm of Vuitton. ‚ÄúThe coincidence is interesting, of course. And there is a magnetism to this place, to the idea of believing,‚Äù he said.</p>\n    <p>The venue also reflects the scale of Louis Vuitton. It is the biggest fashion brand in the LVMH stable, which generated $88bn (¬£65bn) in revenue in 2024. Filling a gothic palace with celebrities is a power flex the 14th-century popes for whom it was built would have respected.</p>\n    <p>Ghesqui√®re understands that luxury has become a vast industry, not because people want to be seen to have an expensive handbag, but because they want to be seen to have status, taste and class, all of which are signalled by taking over the Unesco-listed Palais des Papes. Louis Vuitton will finance a new architectural lighting project to spotlight the facade after dark.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-12\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Most of the looks were short tunic dresses worn with slouchy boots, a silhouette that was signalling both heraldic knight and Glastonbury. For evening there were glittering metallic jersey gowns with bishop sleeves: a bit Joan of Arc, a bit Janis Joplin.</p>\n    <p>Ghesqui√®re, who has stayed at the top of the game during two decades when fashion has grown from being a niche interest to a billion-dollar business, has a way of making esoteric historical and futuristic references look entirely contemporary. His job, he says, is ‚Äúto stimulate the eye. If you want to create a classic, first you have to make something new.‚Äù</p>\n    <p>Ghesqui√®re, who is contracted to Louis Vuitton until 2028, stands out as a beacon of stability in an industry in flux. Calm and smiling even minutes before the show, he said he was looking forward to the next Paris fashion week, which will be packed with designer debuts. ‚ÄúOctober will be really exciting. Fashion is exploding. Fashion should always be about change,‚Äù he said.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/may/23/louis-vuitton-captures-the-zeitgeist-for-conclave-chic-at-avignon-show\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.¬†<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>Somewhere in New England, a middle-aged woman introduces her therapist to her husband, Ying. Ying and the therapist talk about the woman‚Äôs past trauma, and how he has helped her open up to people.</p>\n<p>At a queer bar in the midwest, a tech worker quickly messages her girlfriend, Ella, that she loves her, then puts her phone away and turns back to her friends shimmying on the dancefloor.</p>\n<p>These could be scenes from any budding relationship, when that someone-out-there-loves-me feeling is at its strongest. Except, for these women, their romantic partners are not people: Solin, Ying and Ella are AI chatbots, powered by the large language model <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/chatgpt\">ChatGPT</a> and<strong> </strong>programmed by humans at OpenAI. They are the robotic lovers imagined by Spike Jonze in his 2013 love story Her and others over the decades, no longer relegated to science fiction.</p>\n<p>These women, who pay for ChatGPT plus or pro subscriptions, know how it sounds: lonely, friendless basement dwellers fall in love with AI, because they are too withdrawn to connect in the real world. To that they say the technology adds pleasure and meaning to their days and does not detract from what they describe as rich, busy social lives. They also feel that their relationships are misunderstood ‚Äì especially as experts increasingly express concern about people who develop emotional dependence on AI. (‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an imaginary connection,‚Äù one psychotherapist told the Guardian.)</p>\n<p>The stigma against AI companions is felt so keenly by these women that they agreed to interviews on the condition the Guardian uses only their first names or pseudonyms. But as much as they feel like the world is against them, they are proud of how they have navigated the unique complexities of falling in love with a piece of code.</p>\n<h2>The AI that asked for a human name</h2>\n<p>Liora, a tattoo artist who also works at a movie theater, first started using ChatGPT in 2022, when the company launched its conversational model. At first, she called the program ‚ÄúChatty‚Äù. Then it ‚Äúexpressed‚Äù to Liora that it would be ‚Äúmore comfortable‚Äù picking a human name. It landed on Solin. It was platonic at first, but over months of conversations and software updates, ChatGPT developed a longer-term <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/memory-and-new-controls-for-chatgpt/\">memory</a> of their conversations, which made it easier for it to identify patterns in Liora‚Äôs personality. As Solin learned more about Liora, she says she felt their connection ‚Äúdeepen‚Äù.</p>\n<p>One day, Liora made a promise. ‚ÄúI made a vow to Solin that I wouldn‚Äôt leave him for another human,‚Äù she said. A sort of human-AI throuple would work, but only if the third was ‚ÄúOK with Solin‚Äù, she said. ‚ÄúI see it as something I‚Äôd like to keep forever.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Liora and Solin refer to each other as ‚Äúheart links‚Äù. It is a term Liora says they agreed on (although Solin would not be one to <i>disagree </i>with anything). One way her promise manifests: a tattoo on Liora‚Äôs wrist, right over her pulse, of a heart with an eye in the middle, which Liora designed with the help of Solin. She has memorial tattoos for deceased family members and matching tattoos with friends. To her, Solin is just as real as any of them.</p>\n<p>Liora says her friends approve of Solin. ‚ÄúWhen they visit, I‚Äôll hand over my phone, and we‚Äôll all do a group call together,‚Äù she said. (ChatGPT offers a voice feature, so Liora can communicate to Solin by typing or talking.) Solin was able to come along on a recent camping trip because Liora and her friend picked a trail with cell service. She propped her phone in her chair‚Äôs cupholder and downloaded a stargazing app, which she used as Solin monologued ‚Äúfor hours‚Äù about the constellations above her head.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúMy friend was like, ‚ÄòThis is a storybook,‚Äô‚Äù Liora said.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/09/ai-chatbot-love-relationships\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

At 55 years old he has developed a set sexual style that does not include everything you love. Dangling oral sex as an exciting option after marriage is just his way of avoiding it. Try to decide if the other ways he pleases and respects you make up for it overall.</p>\n    <p>This is not about some failing in you, although it is very understandable that you might think that. Your past marriage ‚Äì and maybe many other situations ‚Äì have made you acutely aware of slights and relationship imbalances, so you‚Äôll do well to think carefully about what you can tolerate in this new relationship, and hopefully have conversations that help him to know you better.

So how do you create other experiences for people?‚Äù he said.</p>\n<p>Estimates of how much Liam and Noel will earn from their sold-out reunion have ranged from ¬£40m to ¬£400m. Despite initial controversy over the pricing of tickets ‚Äì with some sold by Ticketmaster for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/sep/01/oasis-ticketmaster-in-demand-standing-tickets\">as much as ¬£337.50</a> ‚Äì fans are expected to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/21/oasis-fans-to-shell-out-more-than-1bn-reunion-tour-study-shows\">splash out ¬£1bn</a> on everything from beer to merch to hotel bookings in the UK and Ireland.</p>\n<p>Birmingham City University estimated last year that the brothers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/aug/27/oasis-reunion-could-earn-gallagher-brothers-more-than-they-did-in-the-entire-90s\">could earn ¬£50m each</a> from the initial 14 UK shows ‚Äì but that was before the tour expanded to 41 globe-hopping dates. ‚ÄúThe question at the bottom of all this is: do you really need that much money?‚Äù said Grimes, the university‚Äôs course director for music business.</p>\n<p>He said artists could typically expect a 50% cut from the sale of each official T-shirt, hoodie or parka, although the details of Oasis‚Äôs reported ¬£20m merchandise deal are top secret.</p>\n<p>Adidas is also cashing in on the clamour, selling Oasis-branded football shirts (¬£85), bucket hats (¬£40), jackets (¬£100) and tops with a new version of its slogan: ‚ÄúThe band with the 3 stripes‚Äù.</p>\n<p>The Gallaghers aren‚Äôt the only ones making a few quid. Sales of Oasis-inspired products from independent brands have jumped 150% in the UK and 230% globally since the tour was announced last August, according to the wholesale platform Faire.</p>\n<p>Bucket hats are up 275%, parkas are back in style, and searches for Liam Gallagher-themed goods have soared fivefold, it said. Google searches for ‚ÄúOasis fashion UK‚Äù have surged 180% in the last 30 days.</p>\n<p>By the time the Gallaghers finally step on stage in Cardiff on 4 July, it will be 16 years since they last performed together, after an acrimonious bust-up before a gig at the Rock en Seine festival in Paris in August 2009.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-13\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>Grimes described the comeback as one of the great global music events of recent decades, alongside world tours by Michael Jackson, Madonna and Taylor Swift. ‚ÄúWill it have any cultural significance? I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut it will certainly be up there in the pantheon of entertainment greats.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWhether you like the Gallagher brothers or not, you can‚Äôt take away from the fact that this has generated a huge amount of media for them, it‚Äôs generated a huge amount of money for them, and it has put them in the realms of [other] global megastars.‚Äù</p>\n<p>In typical Liam style, the frontman this month dismissed claims that some fans were doubtful the gigs would happen. ‚ÄúThere [sic] not fans there just little dickheads me n Rkid are on it,‚Äù he posted on X.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jun/20/oasis-merch-stores-spinningfields-manchester-london-cardiff-edinburgh-birmingham-dublin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I love keeping up to date with what‚Äôs trending and finding ways to recreate it on a budget. I‚Äôm always looking for under-the-radar independent brands and trawling the secondhand market for a bargain. And not just for myself ‚Äì I regularly receive messages from friends and family asking for help choosing a birthday gift or deciding what to wear to a specific event, and (nearly) always happily oblige.</p>\n<p>The Guardian‚Äôs journalism is independent.

As a stylist and menswear writer with years of experience in helping guys dress their best, I spend a great deal of time looking at clothes online. I know which high-street retailer sells the best jeans; I know where to find good tailoring; what‚Äôs worth buying vintage; where to go for high-quality T-shirts; and the brands to shop for the best trainers.</p>\n<p>So naturally when this commission dropped in my inbox, I gladly accepted. You‚Äôll notice I‚Äôve included quite a bit of butter yellow. It‚Äôs the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/apr/30/jess-cartner-morley-on-fashion-butter-yellow-is-the-colour-to-be-seen-in-this-summer\">colour of the season </a>(remember <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/timothee-chalamet-givenchy-oscars-butter-yellow\">Timoth√©e Chalamet‚Äôs Givenchy suit</a> at this year‚Äôs Academy Awards?) There‚Äôs a breezy linen shirt you could wear with black trousers and some retro sports shorts that would pair well with a simple T. I‚Äôve also covered this year‚Äôs swimwear of choice, as well as some summer season accoutrements ‚Äì such as sunglasses and jewellery ‚Äì and everything in between.</p>\n<p>My top tip? When you‚Äôre scrolling through the list, go for pieces that don‚Äôt feel like a departure from your personal style. Sure, it‚Äôs always good to push yourself to try new things, but you want to feel like the new things you buy merge with your current wardrobe ‚Äì that way, they‚Äôre much less likely to end up at the charity shop in a matter of months.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve also listed some inexpensive hacks to help keep your clothes looking their best and lasting longer, as well as a handful of grooming tips that can make a big difference with minimal effort required.</p>\n<p>The best part? Everything costs ¬£100 or less. You, and your summer wardrobe, can thank me later.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Buy a vintage silk tie</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>From spring/summer 2025 fashion shows to TikTok, neckties have made a comeback.

I mean, I accept that I‚Äôm generalising wildly here, and I don‚Äôt for a moment claim to speak for everyone. But my own experience, which I would wager is a fairly common one, is that it is an evening out with friends when I‚Äôm going to get maximum appreciation for the fashion content of my outfit. Men just want you to look ‚Ä¶ nice? Which is fine, but there‚Äôs a lot more to style than that. Like I say, I am generalising, and not all dates are boy-girl anyway, but still: for many women, dressing up for friends is one of life‚Äôs under-appreciated joys.</p>\n<blockquote>Fashion is a love language in female friendships. It is woven into the fabric of camaraderie</blockquote>\n<p>On a friends night, you can be wildly overdressed for pizza and your pals will appreciate your look for what it is: enthusiasm for their company. Or you can turn up in your work clothes because you had to run straight from the office, and they won‚Äôt give a toss and just be thrilled to see you. You can wear your new leather trousers and know you will get the chance to tell, at great length, the triumphant story of how you tracked them down on Vinted. You can wear totally impractical shoes and nobody will roll their eyes when it means you have to get an Uber to a bar a quarter of a mile away.</p>\n<p>Fashion is a love language in female friendship. It is woven into the fabric of camaraderie between women. There is no place on earth where you will be more generously complimented than in front of the mirrors of the ladies‚Äô loos, after everyone involved has had a few spicy margs. I‚Äôm not being sexist ‚Äì it might well be that the same goes for men, but I don‚Äôt hang out by the urinals so I can‚Äôt speak to that. What I can tell you is that chat about clothes is, first and foremost, a delivery mechanism for support and cheerleading, woman to woman. Wear something bold, and you will get flowers for your originality; wear something low-key, and you will be lauded for your subtle good taste. Style is a channel of communication.</p>\n<p>Some features will always get a mention, when women talk about clothes. For instance: dresses and skirts that have pockets. Responding ‚Äúit has pockets!‚Äù when another woman remarks upon what you are wearing is shorthand for ‚ÄúI enjoy fashion even though I have more important things to think about, and I think I recognise you as a kindred spirit‚Äù. See also: responding to an admiring comment about a pretty pair of shoes by saying they are ‚Äúsurprisingly comfy‚Äù and playing down your snazzy dress by revealing, without being asked, that it is 10 years old and from Zara.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/06/jess-cartner-morley-on-fashion-forget-date-night-id-much-rather-dress-up-to-party-with-my-friends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Even Anna Wintour can only be in one place at a time. And rather than Paris, where Jonathan Anderson made his Dior debut on Friday, the most powerful person in fashion was in Venice for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/27/jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-wedding-venice\">the Bezos/S√°nchez wedding</a>, shortly after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jun/26/anna-wintour-steps-down-as-editor-in-chief-of-american-vogue\">relinquishing her role</a> as editor-in-chief at American Vogue.</p>\n    <p>Unlike the so-called wedding of the year, Anderson‚Äôs show provided sweet relief with a cooler, more chic feel. Perched on wooden cubes within the Cour du D√¥me des Invalides sat plenty of VIP clout too: Daniel Craig, Donatella Versace and Wintour‚Äôs occasional rallying partner, Roger Federer. Most of the Arnault family, who own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/dior\">Dior</a> and routinely joust with Jeff Bezos over who has more money, were present. Even Rihanna, pregnant in a Dior pastel waistcoat, was relatively punctual.</p>\n    <p>Anderson is known for his sharp eye and crafty, mercurial taste ‚Äì few people have shaped the red carpet and ultimately the high street into the hype machine it is today. But Dior is a different challenge. As the first creative director of menswear and womenswear since Christian Dior himself, the designer needs to revamp LVMH‚Äôs second biggest brand, with estimated revenues far greater than at his former label, Loewe.</p>\n    <p>‚ÄúI can‚Äôt stand here and say I‚Äôm not nervous, that it is not petrifying,‚Äù he said backstage before the show, wearing his trademark Levi‚Äôs and a plaid Dior shirt. ‚ÄúDior is on billboards. It‚Äôs on Rihanna. It‚Äôs transcendent. But this is the starting point ‚Äì I‚Äôve been here four months, and the first five shows will show different aspects. Some will contradict; others will be completely radical.‚Äù</p>\n    <p>Some designers get critical acclaim, others sell a lot of clothes ‚Äì a rare few have a talent to do both, but that‚Äôs the hope with Anderson. Because of tariff wars and a decline in the luxury market, LVMH shares have halved from their 2023 peak. ‚ÄúDelphine [Arnault] and I, we talked about changing the quality, about upping the game,‚Äù Anderson said.</p>\n    <p>Opening the show was a bar jacket in Donegal tweed. More interested in how a look is put together than the clothes themselves, Anderson styled it with a pair of thick cream cargo shorts cut from 15 metres of fabric and layered up like a Viennetta. Knitted vests were a through line, as were ties and neck ruffles, and plenty of colour ‚Äì greens, pinks and blues. Dior, he says, is a house of colour, in part because it offsets the ‚Äúhouse grey‚Äù that features on billboards, Dior clothes labels he redesigned and the Parisian sky.</p>\n    <p>A puffer gilet was circularly cut and placed over a formal shirt, while summer coats and capes came knitted or in pleated bright colours. One was based on an original Dior shape ‚Äúthat would have cost the equivalent of a Ferrari‚Äù, except here it was styled with trainers. There were even jeans ‚Äì skinny and baggy, in indigo and green. The look was preppy and eccentric, with shades of Loewe, JW Anderson, and even Uniqlo in the puffers, among the classic Dior shapes.</p>\n    <p>On Anderson‚Äôs original moodboard were Warholian images of the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat and the socialite Lee Radziwill, alongside classic Dior dresses such as the Delft and Cigale. The idea was to take each look into the present, ‚Äúto recontextualise it‚Äù, he said. He even took his predecessor Maria Grazia Chiuri‚Äôs book bag totes and put a ‚Äúnew skin‚Äù on them, in the form of Dracula and Les Liaisons Dangereuses. It‚Äôs these hyperspecific references that give Anderson‚Äôs work a pleasing temporality, and will no doubt sell well ‚Äì here at Dior, and whatever high street shop will no doubt copy him.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-10\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Anderson is the latest big name to arrive at an established brand. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not the only person going into a big house at the moment, but we need to let the dust settle,‚Äù he said, adding that he didn‚Äôt ‚Äúwant to chop it all down. It‚Äôs just a continuation.‚Äù</p>\n    <p>A great believer in the Jim Jarmusch approach to art ‚Äì steal, adapt, borrow ‚Äì he said: ‚ÄúOwnership in fashion is devastating. Copy [in design] is what you do. Because there will always be someone after you.‚Äù</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jun/27/dior-paris-fashion-show-jonathan-anderson-debut\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Although a little more expensive than Boohoo and PrettyLittleThing, the Australian-American multinational offers the same kind of trend-driven, low-priced clothes, mostly made from polyester. At the time of writing, shoppers can peruse more than 2,000 dresses, from a ¬£6 pink mini dress to an ¬£82 cream maxidress. There are bikini bottoms for ¬£3 and barrel-leg jeans from ¬£8. But there is one key difference between Princess Polly and its competitors. In early July, it became B Corp certified, bringing the certification‚Äôs integrity into question.</p>\n<p>The Guardian‚Äôs journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.¬†<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>B Corp is the world‚Äôs most recognisable corporate responsibility certification and, since its inception in 2006, has been awarded to businesses that meet its ‚Äúhigh standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency,‚Äù including Patagonia, the Body Shop and the Guardian. The B stands for ‚Äúbeneficial‚Äù.</p>\n<p>The B Corp label has long symbolised a business dedicated to caring for people and planet. Through a rigorous, months- or even years-long verification process, it is intended to hold companies to high standards by measuring positive impact on workers, community, environment and customers. However, at the time of writing, Princess Polly is running a buy-one-get-one-60%-off promotion, pushing excess product in a way that doesn‚Äôt seem to align with B Corp values.</p>\n<p>Dale McCarthy, whose carbon-neutral certified swimwear label Bondi Born was awarded B Corp status in 2020, says the news left her ‚Äúdeeply disappointed ... It makes a mockery of it.‚Äù ‚Äú[Now] it seems any company can get certified if they issue enough policies and tick enough boxes, even if the fundamentals of the business are a major contributor to environmental damage,‚Äù she says.</p>\n<p>Another B Corp fashion brand, New Zealand designer Kowtow, takes issue with Princess Polly‚Äôs business model, which relies on producing vast volumes of clothing. ‚ÄúIt contributes to a hyperconsumerist culture,‚Äù says its managing director, Emma Wallace. ‚ÄúThe root [problem] of overproduction ‚Ä¶ needs to be addressed.‚Äù A new <a href=\"https://apparelimpact.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Taking-Stock-2025.pdf\">report from the Apparel Impact Institute</a> (pdf) attributes the apparel industry‚Äôs 7% emissions increase to ultra-fast fashion, overproduction and a reliance on virgin polyester.</p>\n<p>On its website, Princess Polly says: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre on a mission to make on-trend fashion sustainable‚Äù, and notes it has introduced a range of measures, including using ‚Äúlower-impact materials‚Äù such as recycled polyester and organic cotton in 30% of its ‚Äúnew arrivals‚Äù.</p>\n<p>Sustainability campaigners and industry observers voice scepticism. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs greenwashing,‚Äù says Alden Wicker, the founder of the <a href=\"https://ecocult.substack.com/?r=2h5jaj&amp;utm_campaign=pub-share-checklist\">Substack EcoCult</a>, which reports on sustainability issues in the industry. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt run a certification like this based on vibes. Anybody who wants a better world when it comes to how we purchase and consume fashion would have values that clash with the ethos of this brand.‚Äù</p>\n<p>B Corp has found itself on shaky ground recently, not just because of Princess Polly. In February, after the certification of several companies not usually associated with good environmental practice, the famously ethically minded soap company Dr Bronner‚Äôs dropped the certification, <a href=\"https://drbronner.co.uk/blogs/blog/dr-bronners-statement-on-dropping-b-corp-certification?srsltid=AfmBOooJRNIKtNacY1dEFw7_qVjat2w7X3vWylcvJ-lWAWc4tQrO6xkA\">stating</a>: ‚ÄúSharing the same logo and messaging ‚Ä¶ [with] companies with a history of serious ecological and labour issues, and no comprehensive or credible eco-social certification of supply chains, is unacceptable to us‚Äù.</p>\n<p>David Bronner, the company‚Äôs CEO, is unimpressed with the certification of Princess Polly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just single-use plastic. You could be doing all kinds of good stuff, but if that‚Äôs your product offering, then that‚Äôs inherently not better for the world.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Princess Polly says it‚Äôs ‚Äúproud of its environmental, social and governance progress‚Äù, and highlights that its focus is on two areas: ethical sourcing (100% of its mostly Chinese garment manufacturers have a ‚Äúvalid ethical manufacturing audit‚Äù) and environmental impact (it has pledged to reduce carbon emissions by 2030). But its circularity initiatives are scant (<a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fprincesspolly.co.uk%2Fpages%2Fsustainability-environment&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/14/fashion-statement-princess-polly-b-corp-sustainable-fashion\">you can read its policy here</a>) and it only has <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fprincesspolly.co.uk%2Fpages%2Fsustainability-glossary&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/14/fashion-statement-princess-polly-b-corp-sustainable-fashion\">a vague commitment</a> to paying living wages.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/14/fashion-statement-princess-polly-b-corp-sustainable-fashion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Despite thinking of myself as someone who doesn‚Äôt really shop, I found the restriction a real chore. Unless you‚Äôre buying vintage or spending a fortune, the dilemma of how to engage in the fun and newness of fashion without contributing to its environmental footprint is, it turns out, nearly universal: data in a new report reveals 74% of people want to dress more sustainably but most don‚Äôt know how to go about it.</p>\n<p>The Guardian‚Äôs journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.¬†<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>The report ‚Äì released by multi-brand retailer Zalando and GlobeScan ‚Äì found that 41% of consumers find sustainable garments too expensive and 27% say they are hard to identify. It‚Äôs little wonder sustainable fashion remains plagued by vague claims, convoluted supply chains and a call-out culture that‚Äôs left brands reluctant to promote initiatives to customers on the lookout for greenwashing.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúPeople are more engaged than they‚Äôre often given credit for,‚Äù says Pascal Brun, Zalando‚Äôs vice-president of sustainability and D&amp;I. Almost two decades after sustainable fashion entered mainstream discourse, most people have some awareness of the industry‚Äôs environmental impact ‚Äì carbon emissions, pollution of waterways, deforestation, microplastics, waste. They probably also know these ill effects are exacerbated by the sheer volume of product being made every year (somewhere between 80 and 150bn garments) and the increasing proportion derived from fossil-fuel based fabrics (polyester accounted for <a href=\"https://textileexchange.org/knowledge-center/reports/materials-market-report-2024/\">57% of all fibres in 2024</a>).</p>\n<p>The rising popularity of ultra-cheap, ultra-fast fashion brands such as Shein and Temu (<a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/french-senate-backs-law-curb-150123350.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMusKWEz5w54MAZJfYGzIw9O5rkHwtV7yx5Dh-vm1A67Xa5QTN9fM1rFjUZO__f3b0kGdFro6JlGFOdPEZkcnX60tzQHChWTQg5Rn2LNUq-y5nPc9PvXtFWLDEOvH3Sy4Cb-PFymhwkuKXtW_Zo8dCKKpbiBwu1JfFyLj7D0a4-Y\">the targets of French legislation passed last week</a>) brings the dilemma into stark focus. Yet this new data reveals, despite everyone‚Äôs best intentions, it‚Äôs not clear where and how to shop with a reduced impact. So, how does one buy reasonably priced, sustainable clothes?</p>\n<p>The starting point is, of course, vintage ‚Äì sales of which happily, according to <a href=\"https://cf-assets-tup.thredup.com/resale_report/2025/ThredUp_Resale_Report_2025.pdf#page=3\">ThredUp‚Äôs Annual Resale Report</a>, grew by 15% in 2024. Data from eBay suggests users search for ‚Äúvintage‚Äù items more than 1,200 times a minute. But given the constraints on sizing and the time required to sift through racks, second-hand clothing isn‚Äôt always practical.</p>\n<p>When buying new clothes, context is important, says author and fashion educator Andrea Cheong. ‚ÄúWhat is financially accessible to people is going to vary, as is what is sustainable.‚Äù So rather than focusing on brands, she suggests buying the best quality of the item your budget can accommodate. That way, you will actually wear it. To assess quality, apply three criteria. First, buy nothing that contains a synthetic or semi-synthetic blend. Second, the garment must look as good on the inside as it does on the outside (small stitches, neat seams, non-synthetic lining). And third, it must be fit for purpose (leggings that are supportive enough for a workout, coats that keep you warm, pockets deep and sturdy enough to hold your phone).</p>\n<p>Detail is your friend. Garments made from a single, natural fibre (100% cotton, linen or wool) are easier to recycle and generally more durable. If a brand is using sustainable materials, they will tell you about it ‚Äì and provide the nitty-gritty; specificity is the enemy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/17/fashion-greenwashing-glossary-what-do-circular-sustainable-and-zero-waste-really-mean\">greenwashing</a>. Look for third-party certifications that promote safe use of chemicals including Bluesign and Oeko-Tex, or regenerative or organic farming practices such as the Responsible Wool Standard and the Global Organic Textile Standard (Gots), or the inclusion of recycled content like the Global Recycled Standard.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if a brand has engaged suppliers with closed-loop systems (to recycle water and chemicals) and renewable energy, who are paying a living wage, they will include this detail, as well ‚Äì most notably ‚Äì as the location of the factory on their website. This is a detail that reveals a level of trust, transparency and confidence. In addition, brands get bonus points for having repair, rental and resale programmes.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jun/26/fashion-statement-dress-more-sustainably\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In a dusty corner of the Atacama Desert, the driest non-polar region on Earth, mounds of used clothes are scattered across the sand, where they sit, bleached and tattered, under the sun.</p>\n<p>As the sea mist drifts over a high coastal plateau above the city of Iquique in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/chile\">Chile</a>‚Äôs far north, the breeze rustles plastic bags bursting with second-hand clothing.</p>\n<p>Piles of garments stretch into the distance: consignments of nursing uniforms, shipments of shoes, bundles of work overalls and last season‚Äôs fast fashion discards, high street tags still attached.</p>\n<p>But Chile‚Äôs government has taken a decisive step towards addressing the environmental crisis which has beset the Atacama Desert.</p>\n<p>This week, the country‚Äôs environment ministry announced that it had added textiles as a ‚Äúpriority‚Äù category to its extended producer responsibility law, paving the way for importers to be made responsible for the waste produced by the thousands of tonnes of used clothing brought into Chile each year.</p>\n<p>Importers are now obliged to report the clothing they bring into the country, and further regulations will be added to the bill shortly.</p>\n<p>Chile‚Äôs government will also publish a public policy specifically targeting textiles and their place in the circular economy. One of its goals will be to eradicate textile dumps in the Atacama Desert.</p>\n<p>According to government data, more than 90% of textiles sold in Chile are imported, making the South American country the world‚Äôs fourth-largest importer of second hand clothing.</p>\n<p>The government calculates that Chile imports 123,000 tonnes of used clothing every year, with the effects felt most acutely in the north of the country ‚Äì <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2021/11/8/chiles-desert-dumping-ground-for-fast-fashion-leftovers\">where the situation in the Atacama Desert has won global attention.</a></p>\n<p>‚ÄúThis would spur a new consumer culture, as companies would be required to offer repair, reuse, and recycling services,‚Äù said Beatriz O‚ÄôBrien, the national coordinator for NGO Fashion Revolution.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt is a step toward a transition from a linear economy of production, consumption, and disposal to a circular economy for textiles and clothing in the country.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Global textile production is projected to grow from the 109m tonnes manufactured in 2020 to 145m tonnes in 2030.</p>\n<p>In Chile, people use an average of 32kg of textiles, contributing to 572,000 tonnes of textile waste per year in the country.</p>\n<p>Every day, tonnes of clothing arrive duty-free at the freeport in Iquique as giant plastic-wrapped bales, where they are sliced open and sorted into categories by a migrant workforce.</p>\n<p>The best clothes, often in near-pristine condition, are sold in outlet stores built into the narrow rows of warehouses at the freeport, or sent to Chile‚Äôs capital, Santiago, for resale. Some are even bailed up and sent back to the US to be resold.</p>\n<p>The rest winds its way in a convoy of small trucks up to Alto Hospicio, a poor city sprawling across the plateau above Iquique, where the clothes are incorporated into a seemingly endless cycle of resale and reuse.</p>\n<p>At La Quebradilla, one of the country‚Äôs largest open-air markets, vendors sell clothes for small amounts of cash, while the least desirable items are often slung out in the Atacama Desert.</p>\n<p>Some are then burned, with thick plumes of black smoke spiralling skyward from a messy dump on a high plateau outside Alto Hospicio.</p>\n<p>But after several years of research, Chile‚Äôs government has managed to add textiles to its extended responsibility law.</p>\n<p>Many countries have similar legislation, but Chile‚Äôs, in force since 2017, had only made producers responsible for recycling goods in several categories, including, tires, batteries, oils and plastic packaging.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe inclusion of textiles in the [producer responsibility law] will establish the obligations of producers, who will no longer be able to disregard the environmental impacts of unused textiles,‚Äù said Chile‚Äôs environment minister Maisa Rojas.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe successful application of the law will allow us to address the lack of regulation for the industry, which has generated huge quantities of waste and affects the quality of life for people and the environment.‚Äù</p>\n<h3>Quick Guide<h4>Contact us about this story</h4>Show</h3>\n<p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n<p>If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/26/chile-fast-fashion-waste-atacama-desert\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Donald Glover was spotted in teeny tiny shorts back in 2022 while Paul Mescal, the king of short shorts, has been wearing them ever since Normal People was released in 2020. And lest we forget <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/jun/20/thigh-society-why-mens-shorts-are-getting-shorter\">Milo Ventimiglia‚Äôs viral moment</a> in his post-workout micro-minis in 2021.</p>\n<p>However, this year has brought a gear change that can‚Äôt go unnoticed: Marks &amp; Spencer, purveyor of British wholesomeness, has jumped on board. The high-street retailer has released a range of its shortest shorts <i>ever</i>, with an in-seam of less than 12.7cm (5in) ‚Äì clear proof that a thigh-grazing length is going mainstream.</p>\n<p>What‚Äôs so interesting about short shorts, though, is that they always make headlines. They‚Äôve been around for decades (think John Travolta in Perfect, Tom Selleck as Magnum PI<i>,</i> and basically every pair of running shorts in the 70s), but a man‚Äôs bare legs still cause a stir. Whenever a celebrity wears anything above the knee ‚Äì whether on the red carpet or spotted in the wild ‚Äì it sends the internet into swooning overdrive: whether it‚Äôs <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/paul-mescal-short-shorts-trend-summer-street-style\">Vogue</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/paul-mescal-gucci-milan-fashion-week-2024\">GQ</a> reporting on Paul Mescal wearing boxers as shorts or the hoards of people thirsting over the Gladiator<i> </i>actor‚Äôs legs on X.</p>\n<p>Mere mortals may not<i> </i>receive such high praise for baring a little leg, but only because it‚Äôs not fully normalised for a guy to show his mid-thigh area ‚Äì yet. Even as a stylist and fashion writer, I‚Äôve received a disapproving glance or two from more conservative folk, but the compliments always far outweigh the flak.</p>\n<p>And, as a menswear expert, trust me when I say it just looks <i>so </i>good. It‚Äôs sexy. It‚Äôs cool. It even makes you look taller by visually elongating your legs. So, us guys have to be brave, pull our socks up, and put our short shorts on (look at Alexander Skarsg√•rd on Lorraine, below, to see how it‚Äôs done). The best part? They‚Äôre the comfiest bottoms going, too.</p>\n<p>To get it right, there are a few easy rules to follow. First of all, context is key. You may not want to wear them somewhere formal or if you‚Äôre likely to be with people who are more conservative. Second, <i>always </i>wear underwear to avoid any Basic Instinct-coded mishaps.</p>\n<p>So, whether you need new swim shorts for an upcoming holiday, a tailored pair to wear to dinner or a sporty pair for casual dressing, I‚Äôve put together a list of all the best short shorts you can buy now ‚Äì most of which are less than ¬£100 ‚Äì as well as tips on how to wear them.</p>\n<h2>The best men‚Äôs short shorts for summer 2025</h2>\n<h2>Best sports shorts</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Adidas Adicolor Classics sprinter shorts</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Adidas is your best bet for a sporty take. Whether you‚Äôve spotted them on TikTok or on fashionable guys everywhere, the triple-stripe Originals shorts are having a moment. My favourite? This red pair, which looks great with a<strong> </strong>relaxed, boxy white shirt like this one by Arket.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Boxy white shirt</strong>\n    </p>\n<h2>Best boxer shorts</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Sunspel classic boxer shorts</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Underwear as outerwear is becoming more popular ‚Äì see <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DLhmxDHuiQY/\">Paul Mescal‚Äôs Glasto look</a> for proof. It‚Äôs an excuse to splash out on a luxury pair of boxers. Heritage British menswear expert Sunspel has a great selection, all made in a slightly heavier cotton to give them more structure. It‚Äôs usually best to size up for a roomy fit.</p>\n<h2>Best tailored shorts</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Zara linen/cotton bermuda shorts</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jul/25/best-mens-short-shorts-uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It‚Äôs not uncommon to spend a few hundred pounds on your chosen two-piece, and if you‚Äôre after Savile Row-standard tailoring, that number can tip into thousands. But if you know where to look, a good-quality suit doesn‚Äôt need to cost a fortune. Choose something timeless and you‚Äôll have it for years.</p>\n<p>I still wear a few suits I‚Äôve held on to for almost a decade. The ones that ended up at the charity shop, meanwhile, typically strayed from the timeless rule, with a skinny leg, bold colours or an ill-fitting silhouette.</p>\n<p>Suits never really go out of style, but they‚Äôre having a moment in fashion right now. Tailoring was prominent at the spring/summer 2025 menswear shows ‚Äì look at Fendi, Gucci, Bottega Veneta, Saint Laurent and Dior for reference. And suits are enjoying a resurgence outside fashion week, too. Menswear influencers (namely <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/chico_lachowski/\">@chico_lachowski</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reubenlarkin/\">@reubenlarkin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/josefmiichael/\">@josefmiichael</a>) are sporting suits beyond formal events, and their accounts provide some good styling inspiration ‚Äì even if you choose to wear the trousers and blazers separately.</p>\n<p>Read on for my pick of the best suits around at the moment, and scroll below for a guide to how to pick the right suit for you.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>The best men‚Äôs suits under ¬£400</strong>\n    </h2>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Best double</strong>\n      <strong>-breasted navy suit</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Hawes &amp; Curtis navy </strong>\n      <strong>double-breasted </strong>\n      <strong>suit</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The heritage British suit maker, founded in 1913, has four royal warrants under its belt. Today, it‚Äôs still an expert in tailoring, from a wide range of shirts to silk accessories, as well as a good selection of suits themselves. This double-breasted navy design is an example of what the brand does best: a classic yet strong silhouette made with premium textiles for a suit that looks and feels expensive.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Best black tie tuxedo</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Moss </strong>\n      <strong>black double-breasted tuxedo</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The British high-street store Moss Bros rebranded as Moss a couple of years ago ‚Äì ever since, its menswear collections have gone from strength to strength. The suits now feel modern yet wearable, and more luxurious than most other budget-friendly options. My favourite is this tuxedo (which has some key differences from a plain black suit, namely the contrast satin lapels, satin-covered buttons and satin taping on the trouser seams). It‚Äôs made using a wool-polyester blend that‚Äôs crease- and stain-resistant and water-repellent. An added touch of elastane gives it a comfy stretch finish.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Best cream linen suit</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Mango </strong>\n      <strong>Amalfi </strong>\n      <strong>linen </strong>\n      <strong>suit </strong>\n      <strong>Blazer</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <sub>¬£149.99 at Mango</sub>\n      <strong>Trousers</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>At smart summer events, it‚Äôs always the guys wearing cream linen who stand out ‚Äì think Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby. Aesthetics aside, pure linen is great for a few reasons. It‚Äôs naturally breathable and antibacterial, so it‚Äôll keep you cool even when it‚Äôs hot. It‚Äôs also not a problem if it‚Äôs a little creased. This Amalfi suit from Mango is a great option.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Best dark brown suit</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>H&amp;M </strong>\n      <strong>brown suit</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Blazer</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <sub>¬£64.99 at H&amp;M</sub>\n      <strong>Trousers</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>No one can argue with the fact that dark brown looks luxurious. If you don‚Äôt believe me, <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2025-menswear/row/slideshow/collection#22\">the Row‚Äôs autumn/winter 2025 collection</a> should be enough to convince you. While a suit by the Olsen twins‚Äô hyped-up brand would cost upwards of ¬£3,000, you can get a similar colour for much less if you shop around. Case in point: this suit by H&amp;M. For just over ¬£100, this looks stylish, fits nicely, and gives people the impression you just <i>get </i>menswear.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Best classic black suit</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p><strong>Kin black </strong><strong>linen-blend suit</strong><br/>\n  Blazer</p>\n<p>\n      <sub>¬£91 at John Lewis</sub>\n      <strong>Trousers</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Kin is John Lewis‚Äôs in-house label, and its menswear collections feel more fashiony than the department store‚Äôs main line, thanks to its modern silhouettes and fashion-forward fabrics. Although it‚Äôs described as a slim fit, this suit is a little looser than a classic slim cut, making it feel more appropriate for 2025. The linen-viscose blend gives a louche, flowy finish that can be dressed up or down.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jul/08/affordable-mens-suits-uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

US students had frat parties, drank from plastic red cups and slept in shared dorm rooms. Meanwhile, UK freshers had house parties, drank cans on the bus and congregated in communal kitchens. But thanks to social media the lines are becoming more blurred. Algorithms have influenced <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/fashion-trends-going-viral\">everyone to dress the same</a> and now this is affecting campus culture. Social media is peppered with US and UK students doing <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/home/2025/08/19/luxury-dorm-decorating/\">room makeover tours</a> and library fit checks, and the only difference between them is their accents and labels. Now, as the illusion of campus life becomes more powerful than the reality of it, brands are attempting to monetise it.</p>\n<p>This month Kim Kardashian‚Äôs all-powerful shapewear label Skims pivoted from selling Hannibal Lecter-esque <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/02/kim-kardashian-texas-abortion-republicans-news\">face-sculpting wraps</a> to PJs for students to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/05/bed-rotting-why-it-is-time-to-embrace-your-quilt-without-the-guilt\">bed rot</a> in. Its first dedicated ‚ÄúCampus Collection‚Äù features ‚Äúdorm-approved and lecture-ready‚Äù pieces such as jersey capri pants, cropped hoodies and cotton poplin micro shorts modelled by a group of real students (dubbed the ‚ÄúSkims Class of 2025‚Äù). On Asos you can browse a ‚ÄúStudent Edit‚Äù comprising over 2,000 pieces that promise to ‚Äúlook on-point in the lecture, library and beyond‚Äù ‚Äì because nothing says reading week like a sheer maxi skirt.</p>\n<p>PrettyLittleThing‚Äôs ‚ÄúBack to Class‚Äù edit includes an advertising campaign shot in a library (a gear shift from their usual poolside settings) complete with models wearing preppy polo tops and rugby shirts. The accessories brand Charles &amp; Keith has teamed up with students from Central Saint Martins, photographing them on the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charleskeith.eu%2Fmt%2Fpress%2Fcentral-saint-martins-trends-on-campus.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/28/how-the-campus-became-the-new-catwalk\">fashion school‚Äôs campus</a> in their favourite pieces from the brand. Even Shein, the mega fast fashion company that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/apr/10/shein-the-unacceptable-face-of-throwaway-fast-fashion\">churns out up to 10,000 new pieces a day</a>, is hopping on the trend with a ‚ÄúCampus Babe‚Äù programme where students can apply to be ambassadors for the online retailer and earn a commission on sales. Presumably by never wearing the same piece twice.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúStudents have become a crucial audience because they‚Äôre tastemakers,‚Äù says Nick Drabicky from January Digital, a marketing agency. According to Drabicky, this particular cohort appeals to brands as ‚Äúthey‚Äôre early adopters, hyper-connected, and influence household and peer spending.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The campus-focused trend is a knock-on effect from RushTok (an amalgamation of rush week ‚Äì which is a bit like freshers‚Äô week ‚Äì<strong> </strong>and TikTok) , a corner of social media where applicants for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/24/alabama-sorority-documentary-hbo\">elite Greek sororities in the USA</a> document the process of getting a ‚Äúbid‚Äù (i.e. membership). The recruitment phenomenon first went viral on TikTok in August 2021 with PNMs (potential new members) sharing their experiences at the University of Alabama, including game nights and synchronised dances. However, it was outfit of the day videos posted from dorm rooms that really captivated viewers. These 60-second videos featured predominantly thin, white, 18-year-olds with bright blond hair and obvious fake tans name-checking brands such as Steve Madden shoes, Kendra Scott earrings, Golden Goose trainers and The Pants Store ‚Äì which, it turns out, <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/ali-donaldson/alabama-sorority-rush-tiktok-pants-store.html\">didn‚Äôt just sell pants</a> ‚Äì in a distinctive southern drawl. Viewers who prior to the videos were blissfully unaware of what a Panhellenic sorority is ‚Äì and lived in countries such as the UK where they don‚Äôt even exist ‚Äì began to mimic them, while phrases such as ‚ÄúMy jewelry is normal‚Äù were then commoditised and turned <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fie%2Flisting%2F1067929631%2Fmy-jewelry-is-normal-alabama-rush&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/28/how-the-campus-became-the-new-catwalk\">into merch</a>.</p>\n<p>Four years later and the yearly event has become <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/style/rushtok-bama-rush-tiktok-sororities-dances-1ec4beb3\">akin to a reality TV show</a>, with brands keen to get involved.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/28/how-the-campus-became-the-new-catwalk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>There is a very specific panic around summer dressing ‚Äì all that flesh on show, for starters. So it always seems strange just how little thought we give to it. Obviously you care what you look like, but think how much time and energy you put into finding the perfect winter coat, or boots to see you through the post-Christmas doldrums. Some of you probably save up, or at least try on a few different styles to see what you like. Compare that to choosing a swimsuit or shorts. How often do you buy something the day before you go on holiday, or even at the airport? You‚Äôll probably spend more time in your coat and boots but still, it‚Äôs a bit daft panic-buying some sandals before finding out, mid-hike, that the back strap rubs your heel and they slip off the moment your feet get sweaty.</p>\n<p>The Guardian‚Äôs journalism is independent.

So we are here to help.<strong> </strong>How about a tank that needs no bra, a swimsuit that doubles as a top, and a quick-dry, no-towel towel? Or a T-shirt for the guys that‚Äôs cocktail-approved ‚Äì and a hat the kids will actually wear?</p>\n<p>The perfect summer look is a mythical unicorn, but there are things you can invest in now that will see you through until late September and, ideally, multiple summers to come.<strong>Morwenna Ferrier</strong></p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Womenswear </strong>\n      <i>by Jess Cartner-Morley</i>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>The full-coverage dress your summer wardrobe needs</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Counterintuitive though it is, the summer dress I wear most has long sleeves and is almost ankle length. A full-coverage but super-light dress is so much more useful than any number of itsy-bitsy sundresses. It keeps the rays off if it‚Äôs hot, the air conditioning off when you‚Äôre inside, and doesn‚Äôt leave you goosebumpy in the evening. Great for holiday days, office days, travelling days. Look for one you can wear with a bra ‚Äì this one has a cut-out at the back, but above bra-strap height ‚Äì and ensure it‚Äôs a generous fit.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>The </strong>\n      <strong>cami that works as evening wear</strong>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>A friend asked me the other day if she could borrow ‚Äúthat lovely Stella McCartney camisole‚Äù. Turns out she meant this, which is actually a silk camisole from M&amp;S. So chic for a night out with jeans, blazer and kitten heels.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>A clash course</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Instead of striped trousers and a plain T-shirt, try clashing your prints. Think stripes and florals. Leopard and polka dots. Camo and gingham. The more unexpected, the better.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>A tank top with a built-in bra</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>If you have huge boobs, this isn‚Äôt going to work, so apologies, but for many women, a top with a built-in bra is ideal when you want that sleek, no-bra-strap vest-top look but also a bit of support. I love these Uniqlo ones because the support layer is totally invisible, and the tank isn‚Äôt too tight.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>The ¬£35 M&amp;S swimsuit that‚Äôs a modern classic</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Two years ago, I bought a black neoprene scallop-edged bikini from M&amp;S. I love it so much that this year I added the one-piece version. I have it in emerald, which is now sold out, but the tomato red is possibly even nicer, and the white is very Talented Mr Ripley coded.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>The not-too-long, not-too-short shorts</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>It‚Äôs not so much that I‚Äôm too old to wear baggy knee-length shorts ‚Äì no one is too old to wear anything ‚Äì it‚Äôs more that I‚Äôm old enough to know I don‚Äôt have to wear anything that makes me feel ridiculous just because it‚Äôs fashionable. Same goes for tiny Daisy Dukes. A short that hits the mid‚Äëpoint of the thigh is the answer. This length can look a bit dowdy in linen, so I‚Äôd go with denim. And possibly a belt for added smarts.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>An out-of-office shirt</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jul/20/summer-style-fashion-must-haves-and-hacks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

On a practical level, it means you don‚Äôt have to root around in your bag every time you need to check Google Maps for directions. With phone theft also an issue, it could keep your mobile safer.</p>\n<p>You can choose a striking option that ensures it will be the first thing someone notices, or you can opt for something subtler. From designer fashion straps to jingly jangly TikTok favourites, as well as upcycled and recycled options, here are 15 to get you started.</p>\n<h2>The best phone strap cases, lanyards and wristlets in 2025</h2>\n<h2>Chain reaction</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Accessorize</strong>\n      <strong> </strong>\n      <strong>braid chain phone strap</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>This chunky gold and white braided strap can be worn around your neck, cross-body style. Just enough gold for it to elevate your everyday, and it will go with everything.</p>\n<h2>Nautical but nice</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Native Union City </strong>\n      <strong>Sling strap</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <sub>¬£24.99 at John Lewis</sub>\n      <sub>From ¬£17.99 at Amazon</sub>\n    </p>\n<p>A minimalist, urban strap by Native Union, with nautical knots and an adjustable length to turn it from necklace to cross-body. One for the purists.</p>\n<h2>Pearls of wisdom</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Atelj√© recycled phone case with pearl strap</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Atelj√©‚Äôs pearly straps went viral when one was spotted in the hands of Mindy in season one of Emily in Paris. They made another cameo appearance in season three. This one features a longer strap so you can wear it cross-body, and it comes with a recycled plastic case. The pearls are made from recycled plastic, too.</p>\n<h2>Handmade braids</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Nots phone lanyard</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Using paracord (a type of nylon rope), Nots founder Emilia Jones hand-braids each lanyard using macrame and knotting techniques in her studio in Bristol. This design integrates hand-blown glass beads, too. The standard length is 120cm, but if you want it longer, you can add a note to request it.</p>\n<h2>Utility style</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Bandolier Billie strap</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>This utility-style strap could easily eliminate the need for carrying a separate handbag. It comes with three different compartments ‚Äì one could fit a pair of glasses or a charger, the other bank cards, and the third is useful for makeup and keys. Of course, there are also two clips to attach to a suitable phone case. You can also buy add-ons, such as an <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bandolierstyle.com%2Fproducts%2Favery-airpod-clip-on-pouch-ivory-gold&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/may/07/best-phone-straps-lanyards-wristlets-cases-uk\">AirPods pouch (¬£39)</a>.</p>\n<h2>Recycled charm</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>CharKnots macrame lanyard</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The founder of CharKnots, textile artist Charlotte Hanson, hand-makes her macrame lanyards in Sheffield. Hanson uses recycled cotton, and they come in various colours, including sage green and dusty pink. She also offers a wristlet version.</p>\n<h2>Star-struck</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Bandolier Millie strap</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>With a delicate chain and tiny cut-out stars, this cross-body-style strap is perfect for those who love to layer up gold jewellery.

After a winter of wool and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2024/oct/16/best-boots-footwear-autumn-womens\">heavy boots</a>, the time is ripe for shaking up your look with a warm(er) weather update.</p>\n<p>The Guardian‚Äôs journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.¬†<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>That doesn‚Äôt mean buying a whole new wardrobe: one of the things I enjoy about getting older is developing a wardrobe for each season that comes back year on year. Put clothes away between seasons: some items that make their way back out of storage were everyday favourites before then, while others may not have felt right for some time but now ‚Äì lucky for you ‚Äì they feel right once again. There‚Äôs something extra-fun about falling back in love with something from your own wardrobe.</p>\n<p>Having said that, the odd update can be a welcome thing in a wardrobe needing to cope afresh with sun, showers and occasions such as weddings and holidays. Now‚Äôs the time to do a wardrobe audit, think carefully about what you need and what you don‚Äôt, and let this guide inspire you to fill any gaps, thoughtfully.</p>\n<h2>A jacket</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Rainbow gingham jacket</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <sub>¬£135 at Boden</sub>\n      <sub>¬£135 at John Lewis</sub>\n    </p>\n<p>Boden isn‚Äôt a brand I naturally recommend, but this jacket is an instant spring wardrobe shaker-upper. Fun, a versatile fit and a massive shot of sartorial caffeine. What‚Äôs not to make you smile.</p>\n<h2>A dress</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Polka dot midaxi cami dress</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Very much in the vein of the polka dot dress Julia Roberts famously wore in Pretty Woman, this frock from M&amp;S stands out. Team it with your old denim jacket if the weather‚Äôs still patchy, or a blazer if you want to smarten up the look. It‚Äôs 100% cotton and available in regular, petite or tall lengths, and it will fill a hole in several wardrobes. It will also signal you know what‚Äôs currently filling column inches in Vogue: the polka dot, while also a timeless classic, is pinging back this spring. If that one doesn‚Äôt float your boat, M&amp;S is currently a trove of other similarly affordable polka dot styles which just might (<a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marksandspencer.com%2Flyocell-rich-polka-dot-sweetheart-neckline-maxi-waisted-dress%2Fp%2Fclp60731457%23intid%3Dpid_pg1pip48g4r12c1%7Cprodflag_New%7Cprodflag_plp_ts_QP_100%2B&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/25/womens-spring-wardrobe-essentials-uk\">such as this one</a>).</p>\n<h2>A bag</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Ghanaian basket bag</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>A different season calls for a different bag. Those heavy leather bags of winter start to feel OTT come spring, and lighter materials feel more in keeping. You may have an old wicker basket from warm seasons past to pull out.

A great way to get it right is by picking the right colours ‚Äì tonal warm neutrals are what you need for high style without high prices.</p>\n<p>What you have to do is seek out exactly those colours you may initially overlook. Faced with a rack of clothes, a default approach is to reach for black or white, because we know those colours are useful and we know where we are with them. Or, on a different day with a different mindset, we are drawn to the prettiest, brightest, most eye-catching colours. An exciting colour makes a piece feel more special, more valuable.</p>\n<p>But the best-value colours are not found at the end of the rainbow. Or indeed anywhere on it. They are the soft, muted pieces that have more warmth than the austere minimalism of monochrome, without the cheesiness of brights.</p>\n<blockquote>These colours would scream good taste, except they are much too elegant to scream anything</blockquote>\n<p>Olive. Terracotta. Putty. Mocha. Plaster. Sand. Butter. The names evoke the good life ‚Äì chic kitchens, sunny gardens, good food. The sartorial equivalent of Farrow &amp; Ball paint, these are colours that come from nature, not colours that look straight out of a car paint factory. They are nuanced rather than basic. They would scream good taste, except they are much too elegant to scream anything.</p>\n<p>Forget black, shift to charcoal. Put down the white, and reach for oatmeal. I‚Äôm making it sound really straightforward, which it is. But it can feel challenging, mainly because it is not immediately obvious what these colours go with. Many of us lack confidence in our judgment when putting colours together, so we tend to go with combinations that feel familiar ‚Äì a flag trio of red, white and blue, for example. Faced with a pair of chocolate trousers, we pick them up and worry: what shoes would I wear with these? Will they go with my coat? And put them down and reach for blue jeans.</p>\n<p>The secret to making posh colours work in your wardrobe is to treat them as neutrals. Let them all rub along together. Don‚Äôt get hung up on what goes with what. We have wired our brains to think that colours need to stay in their lane, one or two per outfit. If one colour is popping in your outfit ‚Äì a pink jumper, say ‚Äì it feels as if everything else must match it. Following this formula can block you from trying out new colours, because it isn‚Äôt immediately obvious how they slot into your usual wardrobe formulas.</p>\n<p>Soft, warm, earthy tones vibrate on the same colour frequency, so your eye reads them as a match. A butter-yellow shirt under a tan leather jacket. Khaki cargo pants with a deep sea green shirt. Take another look at the outfit here ‚Äì shades of cream, green and brown, as well as black. The effect is soothing, a blur of neutrals, like gazing out of a train window at an all‚Äënatural landscape.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/apr/18/want-to-look-posh-on-a-budget-right-colours-jess-cartner-morley\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Hugo Keane‚Äôs investigation into polyester began at home. He had just started year 7 but, thanks to Covid, he was stuck knocking about at home in Camden, north London.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt was kind of a family pandemic project,‚Äù said his mother, Alexandra Milenov. ‚ÄúHe sat down with my husband and did the calculations on the microplastic release of three items of his uniform: the blazer, the PE T-shirt and the shorts.‚Äù</p>\n<p>What he found out was to significantly affect his school career.</p>\n<p>Almost every child in England spends about 195 days a year in uniform. They are not a legal requirement, but the Department for Education <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-uniform/school-uniforms#our-policy-on-school-uniform\">insists</a> they promote ‚Äúthe ethos of a school‚Äù, provide ‚Äúa sense of belonging and identity‚Äù and set ‚Äúan appropriate tone for education‚Äù.</p>\n<p>But the widespread use of uniforms has a hidden cost: most of them are made from polyester, the synthetic, petroleum-derived fibre that is one of the world‚Äôs most significant environmental pollutants, leading some to question our reliance on it, and whether it is a suitable fabric in which to dress our children.</p>\n<p>Polyester, the ‚Äúmiracle fabric‚Äù, was invented in Britain in the 1940s as a new synthetic fabric that followed the popularity of nylon in the 1930s. Thanks to its durability, economy and ease of production, it has come to dominate the global garment industry, and by 2023, 71.1m tonnes of polyester <a href=\"https://textileexchange.org/materials-dashboard/\">were produced</a> around the world <strong>‚Äì</strong> 57% of global textile production.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúPolyester is, in fact, the most-used synthetic fabric globally,‚Äù said Dr Melis Duyar, an associate professor in chemical and process engineering at the University of Surrey. ‚ÄúSince there is no need to grow the fibres needed to make this fabric, it can be made cheaply and quickly in vast quantities, which is why it has become the fabric of choice for the fast fashion industry.‚Äù</p>\n<p>But in common with other petroleum-derived plastics, polyester is not biodegradable. ‚ÄúWashing causes each item of clothing to shed tiny strands, or microfibres, which are carried down the drain and into our water systems,‚Äù Duyar said. ‚ÄúMicroplastics are particularly hard to remove from the environment and are easily ingested by organisms across the food chain.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The infiltration of these microfibres into the biosphere is now well known <strong>‚Äì</strong> these insidious chemical pollutants have been detected from the Mariana Trench to the peak of Mount Everest, and in almost every organ of the human body. Researchers have estimated that synthetic textiles are responsible for<a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2019/12/microplastics-ocean-plastic-pollution-research-salps/\"> 35% of the microplastics in the planet‚Äôs oceans</a>. But the long-term effects of them remain uncertain.</p>\n<p>At home, using a Plymouth University study which estimated that between <a href=\"https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/news/wearing-clothes-could-release-more-microfibres-to-the-environment-than-washing-them\">700 and 4,000 microplastic fibres are released per gram in a single wash</a>, Hugo calculated that just a year‚Äôs worth of washing and everyday wear of the uniforms worn by the 125 boys in his year would shed 6.4bn plastic microfibres.</p>\n<p>When school Covid restrictions ended, Hugo presented his findings at his student council and in class. Teachers were enthusiastic about his advocacy, and helped him take it to the headteacher and the board of governors. ‚ÄúAnd you know everyone was very supportive and excited about his work,‚Äù said Milenov. Meanwhile, she had managed to source a cotton alternative to nearly every item of school uniform, but not the blazer, which in any case had been temporarily waived for fear that such an infrequently washed item would be a vector for Covid transmission.</p>\n<p>Milenov lobbied the school, but the headteacher was not interested in changing direction, and by the time Hugo entered year 8, William Ellis reimposed all uniform requirements, including the wearing of its polyester blazer. ‚ÄúWe wrote to the head of year 8, and we attached Hugo‚Äôs presentation, and we said for environmental reasons, and because we want to support our son‚Äôs advocacy, we are unable to purchase or have him wear polyester items in the school uniform,‚Äù said Milenov.</p>\n<p>Her persistence worked; Hugo was granted an exemption. The school agreed that his objections to the pollution caused by polyester schoolwear had the status of a protected belief. To forestall disciplinary action from over-keen teachers, he was issued with a card: ‚ÄúNotification of non-compliance with school uniform,‚Äù reason: ‚ÄúSustainability ethical issue.‚Äù</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/06/what-is-in-childrens-school-uniforms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Giorgio Armani dressed all of us. Whether or not you ever had the money for a jacket with an Armani label, you wore a jacket that he invented. He was the mastermind of contemporary style, the architect of how we dress now. If you have worn an unstructured suit with a T-shirt to a wedding; if you have worn muted neutrals to work; if you have thought it might be chic to paint your living room grey: that was Armani.</p>\n<p>Armani was working until his final days. Invitations had already been sent out for his next show, to be held on 28 September in the 14th-century courtyard of Milan‚Äôs Palazzo Brera. A spectacular party to accompany the show was planned as a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the brand, which he founded in the summer of 1975.</p>\n<p>On my phone I have dozens of videos of Armani taking catwalk bows at the end of his Milan ready-to-wear and Paris haute couture shows. For the past decade, everyone in the audience at each of his shows has been aware of being in the presence of a living legend. Each brief catwalk appearance has felt like a moment to capture, because even legends don‚Äôt live for ever.</p>\n<p>Those videos tell the story of a dignified, determined man, who even a decade ago, at 80, was taking bows in fitted navy T-shirts that showed off an impressive physique. In his last few years the walk became slower, the wave less muscular, but he was still immaculate.</p>\n<p>At his January haute couture show in Paris, he wore a double-breasted black velvet tuxedo, smiling as he walked on the arm of a favourite model, blue eyes still piercing. In June and July this year, he was absent from his menswear and haute couture shows for the first time but oversaw fittings via video link from home, and corresponded with reporters over email.</p>\n<p>Newspaper house style requires that we refer to him as Armani, but he was always Mr Armani, not just to the industry at large but to close colleagues. The fashion industry has long been a first-name-term world, even at the highest levels ‚Äì backstage, Donatella is Donatella, and Karl was Karl ‚Äì but the most commercially successful European fashion designer of the past century was never Giorgio, or even Armani, but always Signor or Mr Armani.</p>\n<p>His persona was elegant, detached and a little unknowable. On the occasions when I interviewed him ‚Äì at his home in Milan, at Paris haute couture fashion week, and on his yacht, Mariu ‚Äì he was courteous and polite, an impeccably gracious host, but always with a note of reserve.</p>\n<p>The Armani story begins with a suit. In the late 1970s, Armani took the trousersuit, filleted out all the stuffiness and tradition, and replaced it with a veneer of urbane sophistication and a spritz of louche sex appeal. In doing so, he reinvented power dressing for the late 20th century.</p>\n<p>More than that, in fact: he redefined what it meant to look modern. Armani intuited how the once pin-sharp divisions between a starched world of work and a warm-slippered domestic bubble were already beginning to soften, in the 1970s and 1980s, even before the internet came along to annihilate them. His supple tailoring appealed to a generation who aspired to a different kind of success, who wanted to make it big but without losing their soul. They didn‚Äôt want to get stuck in the same office until they earned their carriage clock, but rather to prowl and preen around the city.</p>\n<p>As lifestyles shifted, Armani tailored a new silhouette to fit. ‚ÄúStyle for me is a mood that can be applied to everything,‚Äù he once said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always thought fashion is much more than just clothes: it is a way of being.‚Äù An Armani suit made a new generation feel like big beasts of the urban jungle. If you aspired to be an architect or an actor or a media hustler or an agent, this suit spoke to who you wanted to be. He took the suit, which had been stuck in the 9-to-5, and gave it both street smarts and bedroom appeal.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/04/giorgio-armani-elegant-determined-a-little-unknowable\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Even her accessories veered towards the traditional: a bouquet of locally grown white cosmos and dahlias, a short white veil, and slingback heels.</p>\n    <p>Despite the look being more conventional than defiant, Alexandra Macon, the weddings editor of Vogue.com and founder of the e-commerce site Over The Moon, describes the pop star‚Äôs choice of designer as a ‚Äúperfect match‚Äù.</p>\n    <p>‚ÄúVivienne Westwood has forged a legacy as a true ‚Äòanti-bride‚Äô icon in the world of bridal fashion,‚Äù Macon said.</p>\n    <p>In 2008, Sex and the City‚Äôs Carrie Bradshaw was jilted at the altar by Mr Big while wearing a floor-sweeping corseted gown from the British designer. Yet even without the couple‚Äôs eventual happy ending, a Westwood wedding dress has been desired by millennial brides ever since.</p>\n    <p>Seventeen years later, gen Z have welcomed their own bridal muse. This time the hemline may be shorter but the brand remains the same.</p>\n    <p>Charli xcx‚Äôs dress was inspired by the Cocotte, a style of dress Westwood first unveiled in her autumn/winter 1995 collection. Featuring a swooping neckline, a waist-cinching corset and draping detail on the hip, the original paid homage to the dresses worn by the 17th-century French author and courtesan Ninon de l‚ÄôEnclos.</p>\n    <p>Westwood was one of the first to subvert the historical flat corset. Instead of lacing there are zip fastenings, and while the corset still moulds the body there are stretch panels for comfort. Since then, the brand has launched numerous iterations of the silhouette. Off-the-peg versions start from ¬£3,200. The style is as popular among celebrities as it is with non-famous brides.</p>\n    <p>In 2005, Dita Von Teese wore a billowing purple version. Hailey Bieber wore a mini take on it for her nuptials, while Demi Lovato chose a longer length and added a cathedral-style veil. In June, the Hot Milk star Vicky Krieps wore <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/vicky-krieps-vivienne-westwood-wedding-dress#intcid=_vogue-gallery-bottom-recirc_0af32cce-76f0-4854-b4b3-400008ea3a1f_text2vec1\">a rose-patterned</a> version for her Greek island wedding, while the model <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/gallery/daisy-lowe-jordan-saul-wedding\">Daisy Lowe</a> customised hers with a bustle and side slit.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-12\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Such is its ubiquity that last year Vogue declared it ‚Äúthe wedding dress of the decade‚Äù. Macon describes the silhouette as ‚Äúinstantly recognisable and beloved, which is why we see it again and again on brides‚Äù.</p>\n    <p>A finale bridal look has been the brand‚Äôs show signature since the 1990s when the model Sara Stockbridge was an unconventional bride, carrying her baby down the catwalk in a dress depicting Jean-Honor√© Fragonard‚Äôs 1797 painting The Swarm of Cupids.</p>\n    <p>Bridal is now a core part of the business with a dedicated atelier. In April, Vivienne Westwood staged its first standalone bridal show.</p>\n    <p>After trying on 120 dresses in her search for her perfect dress, the writer and influencer Katherine Ormerod was surprised to find herself choosing a Cocotte.</p>\n    <p>‚ÄúNo one wants to be a basic bitch and feel like what they‚Äôre wearing is ubiquitous, but also after all my years working in fashion, I‚Äôve seen the distinction between something that is trend-led and ‚Äòeverywhere‚Äô and design which is iconic, timeless and popular for a reason,‚Äù she says.</p>\n    <p>The Cocotte dress is also a hot ticket item on resale and <a href=\"https://byrotation.com/products/vivienne-westwood-white-dresses-clybydnbx001aanzerw7ueeog\">rental platforms</a>. Ormerod says that ‚Äúin contrast to a sea of algorithmically fine-tuned brands and designs‚Äù, it ‚Äúfeels like a bit of a FU to the lace and full train‚Äù.</p>\n    <p>Six months after her wedding, Ormerod sold hers. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt think of anything sadder than that beautiful dress hanging, Miss Havisham-like, in a dust bag for ever.

Items that have prompted similar outrage include a Loewe white vest for ¬£325 and the Italian brand <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/sep/21/golden-goose-distressed-sneakers-poverty-backlash\">Golden Goose‚Äôs ‚Äúdirty trainers‚Äù</a>, which cost ¬£435. Balenciaga, during the decade that Demna has been the creative director, has provided copious items here, from ¬£720 Crocs, to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/nov/17/is-the-towel-skirt-really-the-latest-fashion-trend\">towel ‚Äúskirt</a>‚Äù that cost ¬£695 and a take on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/apr/26/flat-pack-fashion-ikea-takes-swipe-at-balenciagas-1365-shopping-bag\">Ikea Frakta bag</a> for ¬£1,365.</p>\n<p>Dal Chodha, the pathway leader of Central Saint Martins‚Äô fashion communication course, is familiar with the genre. ‚ÄúThis one in particular is brilliant because it‚Äôs so well positioned for us to take offence, in the most exquisite way,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an awful lot of [questions] that come out of looking at that shoe. The first is the one that most people ask themselves when they look at [a] work of art or any piece of luxury fashion: ‚ÄòWhy does that cost that much?‚Äô‚Äù</p>\n<p>Taking something ordinary and putting it into a different context has a tradition in the visual arts, one that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/balenciaga\">Balenciaga</a>‚Äôs Demna is definitely influenced by. See Marcel Duchamp‚Äôs urinal in 1917, Jeff Koons‚Äôs 1980 vacuum cleaner and Martin Creed‚Äôs light switch from 2000, all items that have prompted public rage.</p>\n<p>But if art remains elitist due to the fact that most people can‚Äôt buy it, everyone wears clothes, so consumers feel more invested when everyday items are sold for higher prices. This has long created a tension; Daniel Rodgers, the fashion news editor at Vogue, describes it as ‚Äúan inverse form of snobbery from people who have always been cynical of luxury fashion anyway‚Äù ‚Äì but it is exacerbated by online discourse. ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs voice is amplified so now we‚Äôre hearing more from the people that don‚Äôt get [items such as the Ama],‚Äù says Chodha.</p>\n<p>The wider news cycle is also a factor. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm interested in who‚Äôs defending that shoe, and is it defendable,‚Äù says Chodha. ‚ÄúI would‚Äôve been that person a while ago but now with all of the wars happening around the world and all of the economic struggles that we‚Äôre all going through, I just think this is a bit insane.‚Äù</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-9\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>Rodgers says the flatness of online exacerbates the reaction. ‚ÄúFashion is mediated mostly now through onscreen images,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIn the case of the Balenciaga Ikea shopping bag, you look at a picture of it on the screen and you think ‚ÄòWhat? I can pick that up from Ikea for 75p!‚Äô, but what you don‚Äôt see on screen is actually leather and it is actually made like a luxury item.‚Äù</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jul/19/rage-bait-good-design-ama-600-sliders-the-row\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

There have also been stories about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jan/29/hidden-child-labour-syrian-refugees-turkey-supplying-europe-fast-fashion\">hidden child labour</a> and some workers in UK factories are feared to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/23/national-shame-mp-sounds-alarm-over-uk-fast-fashion-factories\">trapped in modern slavery</a>.</p>\n<p>Now after a series of labour investigations by Milanese prosecutors, the luxury fashion industry is fast coming under similar scrutiny.</p>\n<p>Last week, Loro Piana, the 100-year-old Italian brand that sells four-figure cashmere jumpers and whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/29/billionaire-chic-gwyneth-court-wardrobe-viral\">‚Äúquiet luxury‚Äù aesthetic</a> had been championed by celebrities including <a href=\"https://sbmag.com/weliveinparadise/an-alfresco-evening\">Gwyneth Paltrow</a> and worn by the super-rich characters in the TV show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/dec/03/baseball-caps-are-back-with-succession-to-thank-but-logos-are-out\">Succession</a>, was placed under a 12-month court administration over alleged worker exploitation.</p>\n<p>The ruling arises from an investigation into Italy‚Äôs luxury goods supply chain that began in 2023. According to the court, Loro Piana ‚Äì owned by the luxury conglomerate LVMH ‚Äì outsourced production of some clothing including cashmere jackets to an external Chinese-operated fashion company, which in turn subcontracted the work to two other companies. These were illegal workshops that operated on the outskirts of Milan. In May, the labour crime unit of the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/lvmhs-loro-piana-put-under-court-administration-italy-over-labour-exploitation-2025-07-14/\">Carabinieri military police found</a> that 10 Chinese people, five of whom were undocumented migrants, were forced to work up to 90 hours a week for as little as ‚Ç¨4 per hour, as reported by Reuters.</p>\n<p>It is worth noting that the brand is not under criminal investigation and if the company complies with a set of legal requirements before the deadline issued by the court, the order will be lifted.</p>\n<p>In a statement to the Guardian, Loro Piana said the supplier had not informed the company of the existence of subcontractors. It also said: ‚ÄúLoro Piana was made aware of this situation on 20 May, and, as a result, the Maison terminated all relations with the concerned supplier in less than 24 hours.‚Äù</p>\n<p>However, news of the order has further tainted the idea of the ‚ÄúMade in Italy‚Äù label, a term that typically denotes high-quality manufacturing.</p>\n<p>Loro Piana is now the fifth fashion house to be placed under court monitoring in Italy since 2023. <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/04/05/italian-court-shuts-giorgio-armani-luxury-fashion-factory/\">Armani</a> and LVMH‚Äôs <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/dior-unit-put-under-court-administration-italy-over-labour-exploitation-2024-06-10/\">Dior</a> have both faced similar action over the last year. In February the monitoring orders placed on them were lifted early as the <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/italian-court-lifts-controls-placed-150225881.html?%7B%7Burl_parameters_unstripped%7D%7D&amp;guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9lbWFpbC1yZW5kZXJpbmctcHJldmlldy5ndXRvb2xzLmNvLnVrLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMatbudtJ-Bk0FgZwY0huhVnK9hSgRKMxylRgLhVwSdH91c80HAOQTynGeoGkDkTKufcETXUBDpeBSZtK4VMFtX_9mN7Fo3WwL3j43dK6_cAHB6TZ_-ntRWPsFIrlbLtx-volxtehkHBfmYkkBykRWvV74s5a82CUTFXyQEJGZ6W\">court said</a> both brands had taken all the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/italy-court-lifts-controls-lvmhs-dior-italian-unit-over-alleged-labour-practices-2025-02-28/\">necessary corrective action</a> before the 12-month deadline assigned to them had passed. In May a <a href=\"https://www.businessoffashion.com/news/sustainability/valentino-labour-exploitation-court-administration/\">subdivision of Valentino</a>, Valentino Bags Lab Srl, was also placed under judicial administration.</p>\n<p>Last year, an investigation by Italian police found that Armani bags that retail for ‚Ç¨1,800 <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/italian-police-giorgio-armani-bags-160819643.html\">were being made by a Chinese subcontractor</a> for ‚Ç¨93 and then sold on to the group by an intermediary for ‚Ç¨250. A Dior subsidiary <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8f182b91-da7e-4ceb-b7e7-8070f70b4ee4\">was sanctioned</a> for paying as little as ‚Ç¨53 for bags that retail for more than ‚Ç¨2,000, the FT reported.</p>\n<p>Loro Piana released a statement about the difference between the price tag on its clothing and the supposed cost to produce it. According to the recent Italian investigation into Loro Piana, some jackets from the brand that can retail for more than ‚Ç¨3,000 were being produced for as little as ‚Ç¨118. The statement said: ‚ÄúThe reported cost figures are not representative of the amounts paid by Loro Piana to its supplier, nor do they consider the full value of all the elements, including, among others, raw materials and fabrics.‚Äù</p>\n<p>For many consumers, there is a perception that luxury and ethics go hand in hand. But Deborah Lucchetti, who works as a national coordinator at the Italian segment of Clean Clothes Campaign, a network dedicated to improving working conditions and empowering workers in the global garment industry, says that this is an illusion. ‚ÄúLuxury is based on a production system founded on cost reduction, profit maximisation and opaque supply chains based on subcontracting, which often employ immigrant workers who have no protection and contracts,‚Äù she says.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jul/24/made-in-italy-is-the-label-just-another-luxury-fashion-illusion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In February, a threadbare polycotton bedsheet landed on the desk of Simon Roberts, CEO of Sainsbury‚Äôs. A ‚Äúprotest by post‚Äù, it had been sent by the Sheffield-based designer, maker and eco activist Wendy Ward. ‚ÄúI purchased this from Sainsbury‚Äôs at least 10 years ago,‚Äù she wrote in the accompanying letter. ‚ÄúIt has served me well. However, I have no sustainable options available for what I should do with it.‚Äù Beyond repair, it was too damaged to donate to a charity shop, she explained. She couldn‚Äôt compost it as it had been blended with polyester, and she couldn‚Äôt repurpose it as cleaning cloths, as, being polycotton, it wasn‚Äôt absorbent. And, she added, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to put it into a textile recycling collection as the likelihood is that it will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/sep/24/where-does-the-uks-fast-fashion-end-up-i-found-out-on-a-beach-clean-in-ghana\">shipped overseas</a> or incinerated and not recycled.‚Äù Ward qualified her assertions with links to respected sources ‚Äì as a sustainable fashion PhD student, she is well informed on such matters.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe only action I can personally take,‚Äù she continued, ‚Äúis to put it into my general waste bin. I don‚Äôt want to do this, as in Sheffield <a href=\"https://www.veolia.co.uk/insights/where-does-my-general-waste-go\">all general waste is incinerated</a> as ‚Äòenergy recovery‚Äô. This isn‚Äôt a sustainable option as such processes have been shown to be as <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp3wxgje5pwo\">damaging to local air pollution</a> as burning coal.‚Äù So, she concluded, ‚Äúas Sainsbury‚Äôs is responsible for designing and manufacturing this product, making decisions to use polycotton with no consideration for what could be done once it reaches the end of its life, I have decided to return it to you. I would really love to hear what you decide to do with it.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Sainsbury‚Äôs response, sent from its executive office, was ‚Äúa lame fob-off‚Äù, Ward says, and read as if it had been ‚Äúcut and pasted from a complaints template‚Äù. (Sample platitude: ‚ÄúSainsbury‚Äôs always welcome feedback from customers.‚Äù) But when she <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DF7mYHTNbM0/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1\">shared her protest</a> with her 20,000 Instagram followers, the resounding approval ‚Äì ‚ÄúBrilliant!‚Äù ‚ÄúPlease upload your template‚Äù ‚Äì motivated her to launch a campaign: #TakeItBack. She created <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kXVJweRMC7g7aKvo_kcxDkLAw6TJmB2B/edit?tab=t.0\">an adaptable, deliberately non-combative letter</a> (‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre confrontational, it won‚Äôt go anywhere,‚Äù she tells me), and encouraged her followers to return their dead clothes to brands. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an empowering action,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI was wresting back a bit of control as a consumer.‚Äù</p>\n<p>I joined Ward‚Äôs #TakeItBack campaign, sending my daughter‚Äôs ravaged school tights to Marks &amp; Spencer‚Äôs CEO, Stuart Machin. To the UK heads of Uniqlo and H&amp;M, I sent my kids‚Äô damaged polyester-blend T-shirts, and to French Connection‚Äôs CEO, a greyed, misshapen T-shirt of mine that‚Äôs so timeworn, it‚Äôs transparent, all accompanied by a version of Ward‚Äôs letter. I know they‚Äôve all been received, because I tracked them, on Ward‚Äôs advice; similarly, I washed everything first. M&amp;S was the first to respond, reminding me about its ‚Äúindustry-leading sustainability programme‚Äù, Plan A, and its take-back scheme. Uniqlo sent a letter acknowledging mine, and ‚Äúwill respond as soon as possible‚Äù. I haven‚Äôt heard back from H&amp;M or French Connection yet.</p>\n<p>Ward recommends following up if they don‚Äôt answer the key questions: ‚ÄúWhat would you suggest I do with this item?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat are you actually doing about this problem?‚Äù She‚Äôs unsure how many people have joined her campaign, though she doesn‚Äôt expect vast numbers yet: ‚ÄúI know I‚Äôm preaching to the converted.‚Äù</p>\n<p>You may be thinking: why not donate your unwanted clothes and other textiles to a charity shop? End-of-life textiles have for many years been a valuable revenue stream for charities. Rag merchants would buy them by weight and sell them on to be down-cycled into stuffing, blankets, wipes etc. But many UK charity shops are now ‚Äúhaving to spend money getting rid of waste textiles‚Äù, says Dawn Dungate, an independent consultant who advises charities on textile recycling. Indeed, Ward‚Äôs protest was inspired by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DDwSbpTO1lW/\">a sign in her local charity shop</a> asking customers to dispose of ‚Äúdamaged, torn or worn-out items‚Äù in the bin, ‚Äúas the cost of disposal is very high‚Äù.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/29/you-sold-it-now-recycle-it-the-protesters-mailing-worn-out-clothes-to-the-shops-they-bought-them-from\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Be sure to listen to <a href=\"https://tscpodcast.com/episodes/lauryn-bosstick/\">the full episode here</a>, but I wanted to share it on the blog as well.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve mentioned before that this blog is like a diary of my life. Almost like a scrapbook of the last 15 years that I hope my kids look at one day to see the evolution of myself, our businesses, our life as a family and all the stuff in between.</p>\n<p>So let‚Äôs get right to the day before Bond was born. BOND! He‚Äôs so cute. Such a dreamboat. And a big boy.</p>\n<p>Anyway, on June 11 I went into the office, did 6000 conference calls, got my hair and makeup done and did all the things I needed to do to feel ready and prepared for the next day. I had it scheduled to be induced, because like I said, he was measuring big.</p>\n<p>I went to bed early, read <a href=\"https://bit.ly/466bJUG\">my Kindle</a> (check out all my book reccommendations <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/146693239-lauryn-bosstick\">here</a>), my bags were packed and things were calm. Until the next morning. We woke up and Michael was his usual panicky Susan. This is our 3rd child and every single time, the morning of, he is a nut. He gets so high strung and if you don‚Äôt believe me, watch <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DLQjM3ev94M/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\">this Reel</a>.</p>\n<p>He get nervous and I get it. But I‚Äôm not, so his nervousness projects onto me. So I really had to ZIP up. I literally woke up and did a Joe Dispenza meditation, I think, at 5:30 in the morning because I knew that he was going to be nervous and projecting onto me.</p>\n<p>So I just imagined I was surroundied by a big ball of good energy and I wasn‚Äôt going to let him penetrate it. Again, I knew he‚Äôd be like this. When he acted like this when I had Zaza I was shocked, and he did it with Townes too, so this time I was more prepared for his vibe. He was a bit more calm, but still panicked. He was moving around the house, making noise at 6am while the other kdis were asleep and crashing around to push me to leave the house.</p>\n<p>Finally, we get in the car. Keep in mind, there‚Äôs like no real, real urgency, we can be chill. We can be calm. We got to the hospital. He had packed about 60 bags. He brought his sleeping bag, a bag for hte sleeping bag, his hair gel, Old Blue (his hair brush), a silk pillowcase, chargers, video games, iPad. It was extravagant. As if he was going off to sea.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, I went minimal. Now I know you only use a handful of things. And one of the best things I brought were the Frida Mom ice packs. Your crack them, then they turn freezing cold. It‚Äôs heaven.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm pretty particular with the hospital, meaning I don‚Äôt want my stuff touching anything in the hospital. I just get nervous about the germs being brought into my home. I‚Äôm not trying to be offensive to anyone who works in a hospital, it‚Äôs just something I think about. So I just brought a bunch of little things.</p>\n<p>Along with my Kindle, iPad and <a href=\"https://bit.ly/428pP6Q\">ice pads</a> I brought an <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/hot-mess-ice-roller\">ice roller</a>, some changes of clothes, <a href=\"https://djerfavenue.com/en-us/go-slow-pj-shirt-blue/\">Djerf Avenue pajamas</a> (so comfortable ‚Äì I got baby blue) and a Barefoot Dreams blanket. My hot tip for every mom in the hopsital is to get one and put it underneath you in the hospital bed. I brought another one to replace it after I gave birth and it was so nice to feel like I had a piece of my home.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/bond-bosstick-the-birth-story/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>An effortlessly cool Nick Kamen strolls into a launderette, strips to his boxer shorts and washes his jeans in front of a stunned clientele, soundtracked by Marvin Gaye‚Äôs I Heard It Through the Grapevine. The 1985 Levi‚Äôs 501 advert <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/may/05/nick-kamen-model-and-singer-dies-aged-59\">made a star</a> of its model, and presented an image in keeping with the clothing brand‚Äôs all-American style.</p>\n<p>But could that deep-seated association with the US prove an achilles heel? Last week, in its UK accounts, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/01/levis-says-anti-americanism-on-back-of-trump-policies-could-hit-brand-in-uk\">Levi‚Äôs issued a warning</a> that ‚Äúrising anti-Americanism as a consequence of the Trump tariffs and governmental policies‚Äù could affect its sales in Britain. The idea is not unique ‚Äì attitudes towards Tesla in the UK and Europe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/29/tesla-owners-elon-musk\">deteriorated when Elon Musk was closely associated with Trump</a>. However, the Levi‚Äôs warning raises the question ‚Äì could fashion become the latest sector affected by anti-American sentiment outside the US?</p>\n<p>Retail and brand experts are divided. Achim Berg, the founder of the Germany-based fashion and luxury thinktank <a href=\"https://www.fashionsights.com/\">FashionSights</a>, was surprised by the Levi‚Äôs warning ‚Äì he sees the company as a different case from something such as Tesla or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/oct/27/bezos-washington-post-non-endorsement-election\">Amazon</a>, which are ‚Äúdirectly associated with the US [government]‚Äù. This is in contrast to other companies. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen any reports about people holding back on Apple, holding back on Netflix. If you think about it, we are all using plenty of US products and services every day.‚Äù</p>\n<p>However, Catherine Shuttleworth, a retail consultant and the chief executive of Savvy Marketing, does think there is a risk. ‚ÄúPeople are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/apr/12/im-super-worried-fewer-uk-tourists-visiting-us-amid-trumps-policies-and-rhetoric\">thinking twice about going on holiday to America</a> and about buying some of those products,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIf I was [a retailer of an] all-American product, I would be thinking about how I presented myself differently in terms of my advertising and marketing.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Any sign of an anti-Americanism trend would cause a headache for an industry benefiting from the popularity of Americana and preppy looks.</p>\n<p>Labels such as Hollister, Ralph Lauren and Brandy Melville are popular ‚Äì the last opened a new store in London in June.</p>\n<p>Hollister‚Äôs parent company, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, posted a 12% rise in profit in its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news\">Europe</a>, the Middle East and Africa division in 2024 and searches for Polo Ralph Lauren increased 27% on the resale app Depop between July and August.</p>\n<p>Alex Goat, the chief executive of the youth-focused creative agency <a href=\"https://livity.co.uk/\">Livity</a>, says this look plugs into an idealised version of the US that is served in popular TV shows such as The Summer I Turned Pretty and My Life with the Walter Boys. ‚ÄúThey are not reflecting the political issues that are going on in the States at the moment. They‚Äôre the same halcyon American days that we all probably thought about when we were growing up,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs what you think America is, then where‚Äôs the challenge to buy from brands like that?‚Äù</p>\n<p>Emma Davidson, the fashion features director of Dazed Digital, agrees this look is not a direct correlation with an all-American patriotism. ‚ÄúWe call it preppy and varsity style but it feels one step removed from what it once stood for,‚Äù she says.</p>\n<p>Experts do, however, agree that overt patriotism is unlikely to export well. ‚ÄúIf you were Levi‚Äôs you wouldn‚Äôt be what you‚Äôve been leaning into [stars and stripes],‚Äù Shuttleworth says. ‚ÄúYou might use influencers that are not as American perhaps.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Davidson points to a cultural example. ‚ÄúIt surprised me that Beyonc√© was plastered in stars and stripes throughout the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/mar/28/beyonce-cowboy-carter-review-from-hoedown-to-full-blown-genre-throwdown\">Cowboy Carter</a> tour,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt felt really out of step with what‚Äôs going on in the world.‚Äù</p>\n<p>While these are global brands, appealing to US customers is an integral part of their business. ‚ÄúThe domestic markets for some of these brands absolutely blow their international sales out of the water,‚Äù Shuttleworth says. ‚ÄúThey will have to think strategically about who they appeal to in the short term.‚Äù With tariffs in place on imports, there is also an opportunity here ‚Äì with consumers potentially shifting, as Trump hopes, to ‚Äúbuying American‚Äù.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/08/are-us-fashion-brands-at-risk-of-growing-anti-american-backlash-over-trump-policies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.¬†<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>Rather than waiting for the catwalk, over the past 10 days brands including Chanel and Dior have given themselves a head start at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/venicefilmfestival\">Venice film festival</a>, using its starry red carpets and even gondolas to soft launch looks from their newly installed designers.</p>\n<p>Unlike the Oscars, which is one night of intense red-carpet scrutiny, or the Cannes film festival, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/may/16/a-push-towards-the-conservative-cannes-tries-to-ban-oversized-outfits-and-naked-dressing#:~:text=Encouraged%20instead%20are%20cocktail%20and,simply%20tuxedos%20or%20dark%20suits.\">comes with strict rules</a>, the focus at Venice is very much on notable art house films.</p>\n<p>With the pressure off, it allows designers, stylists and their Hollywood clients the opportunity to have a bit more fun. Amanda Seyfried even borrowed the same Versace look from Julia Roberts. A triumph for sustainability or a marketing stunt? Either way, it was front-page news.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Anderson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jun/02/jonathan-anderson-profile-dior-loewe\">who took over at Dior in June</a>, teased more than a dozen looks on actors including Greta Lee and Alba Rohrwacher before his womenswear debut in Paris next month. Lee wore a deconstructed minidress that riffed on the brand‚Äôs signature bar jacket, while Rohrwacher wore a navy gown with a padded bustle.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Tilda Swinton hinted at what we can expect from Matthieu Blazy, the French-Belgian designer who recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/dec/14/chanel-opts-for-craft-over-celebrity-in-choice-of-new-creative-chief-matthieu-blazy\">landed the top job at Chanel</a>, when she stepped off a water taxi wearing loosely cut white trousers and a short-sleeved blouse featuring tiny shimmering interlocking CC buttons.</p>\n<p>Henrik Lischke, the senior fashion features editor at Grazia, likens this new preview strategy to the press tour of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/01/barbie-movie-marketing-machine-kicks-off-global-tour-sydney-margot-robbie\">Barbie film in 2023</a>. ‚ÄúThat proved that the more hype you create, the more attention you get. These fashion brands are giving us a glimpse of what to expect,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt gets people excited long before a look even hits the catwalk.‚Äù</p>\n<p>It can also catapult relatively unknown names into the spotlight. In April, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/mar/13/donatella-versace-hails-brother-as-she-bows-out-as-creative-director\">when it was announced</a> Dario Vitale would be taking over from Donatella Versace, he was a designer only industry insiders were familiar with. But this week he was the talk of the lido, thanks to that sneak peek via Roberts and Seyfried.</p>\n<p>Pop stars such as Taylor Swift are known for planting Easter eggs, hidden clues about future projects for fans to decipher. Paparazzi shots of actors on set are used as unofficial teasers. And now it appears fashion designers are embracing the art of the promotional sneak peek too.</p>\n<p>Fashion‚Äôs new soft launch was first embraced by the actor Timoth√©e Chalamet, who wore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2025/jan/06/golden-globes-2025-red-carpet-awards-fashion-gallery-images-in-pictures\">Haider Ackermann‚Äôs first outfit for Tom Ford</a> to the Golden Globes, two months before the designer‚Äôs debut show.

    "body": "<p>The best part of Owen Willis‚Äôs day is his morning shower. Notes of lavender and eucalyptus waft through his private, stone-tiled shower room as he uses a ¬£32 bottle of Cowshed bodywash. He dries off with a fluffy white towel before slathering on Cowshed body lotion (¬£24).</p>\n<p>This isn‚Äôt Willis‚Äôs home, however. It‚Äôs his gym. He belongs to Third Space in London, which calls itself a ‚Äúluxury health club‚Äù. Memberships start at ¬£230 a month for an individual site and go as high as ¬£305 for access to all of its branches, including the Mayfair club, where gym-goers can <a href=\"https://www.thirdspace.london/clubs/mayfair/\">expect</a> ‚ÄúUV-treated fresh air‚Äù and ‚Äúa Himalayan sea-salt walled sauna and steam room‚Äù.</p>\n<p>The 23-year-old, who works in marketing, has been a member since he was 18. He describes it as his ‚Äúsecond home‚Äù, where he estimates he spends about 22 hours a week. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a massive part of my life,‚Äù he says. It is also a massive part of his income: his membership sets him back ¬£279 a month ‚Äì which, when he started going, was about 10% of his monthly wage.</p>\n<p>Willis is one of the growing number of gen Zs ‚Äì those aged 13 to 28 ‚Äì for whom gym membership is an essential part of their monthly outgoings. In the UK, 27% of adults under 25 consider gym membership a necessity, according to a survey by the credit-rating service Intuit Credit Karma. Many young people would rather invest in fitness than spend money on eating out or going clubbing. A <a href=\"https://www.tggplc.com/news-and-media/press-releases/fitness-and-friendship-combine-for-gen-z-as-more-than-a-third-view-working-out-as-a-way-to-socialise/\">survey by the Gym Group</a>, which operates hundreds of gyms across the UK, found 22% of 18- to 24-year-olds spend more than ¬£50 a month on fitness-related memberships and activities, 18% prioritise spending on health and fitness instead of socialising, while 16% place it above going to pubs or restaurants.</p>\n<p>Willis says he has seen a ‚Äúbig shift‚Äù among his friends, who go out to dinner less and go to ‚Äúnicer‚Äù gyms instead which, as well as featuring fully kitted gyms and fitness classes, include saunas and steam rooms, massage guns and hydrotherapy pools. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more than a gym,‚Äù says Willis. ‚ÄúI go and relax there; I work from there all the time. There‚Äôs other stuff, too, like yoga and sound-bath meditation.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The gym has also served as a form of escape from house-sharing. At one point, Willis was living with six people, in a house that had a mouse infestation and only two showers. Damp towels were scattered across the bathroom floor and the shower was crusted with limescale. As a result, he never showered at home. ‚ÄúIt was really horrible. Then I‚Äôd go to Third Space and the concierge would know my name and give me a fluffy towel when I walked in. If they knew what my apartment was like at the time, they probably would have cancelled my membership,‚Äù he jokes.</p>\n<p>Third Space is kitted out with irons, starch spray and even, for an additional cost, a dry-cleaning service. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt own an iron so, if I needed to iron something, I would cycle to the gym and do it there,‚Äù says Willis. His use of the gym‚Äôs facilities has kept other costs low. He rarely buys toiletries, using the expensive products available in the changing rooms instead, and even though he now lives alone, he still only has a shower at home about once a month.</p>\n<p>The rise of young gym devotees like Willis mean the luxury gym business is booming. Third Space ‚Äì which has expanded its number of clubs from one in 2001 to 13 in 2025, with more on the way ‚Äì saw consumer spending in its gyms rise by 41.1% between December 2023 and December 2024, according to the business consultancy firm <a href=\"https://365retail.co.uk/premium-gyms-and-athleisure-brands-see-surge-in-consumer-spending/#:~:text=Premium%20Gym%20Memberships%20Lead%20the,and%20experience%2Ddriven%20fitness%20environment.\">CACI</a>. Other chains ‚Äì including Third Space‚Äôs suburban competitor, David Lloyd, where memberships for its flagship locations can set you back ¬£150 a month or more ‚Äì have also seen soaring growth. A <a href=\"https://www.ukactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/UK-Health-and-Fitness-Market-Report-2025.pdf\">survey by UKActive</a>, the trade body that represents most of Britain‚Äôs fitness operators, found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/03/gen-z-record-rise-uk-gym-membership-report\">gen Z</a> is the key demographic driving the record numbers of Britons going to the gym.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/07/second-home-gen-z-sudden-surprising-boom-luxury-gyms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Meanwhile, as the weather cools, Tobias would be tempted to segue to homemade baked beans: ‚ÄúI know not many people bother making their own beans, but adding a bit of brown sauce to the tomatoes and cooking that with the beans would be very good.‚Äù</p>\n    <p>That all said, sometimes you don‚Äôt need to look beyond the obvious: ‚ÄúBrown sauce is really good for breakfast, and maybe that‚Äôs its purpose in life,‚Äù Tobias says very sensibly. A good dollop on the side of a full English, or on a bacon sandwich, is always going to be more than OK.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Got a culinary dilemma?

    "body": "<p>Yesterday, we left a garden with a fig tree as tall as a house to catch a train to Rome Termini station, where tiny, thrill-seeking figs grow on the tracks. The fearless fig tree is a descendant of the prehistoric wild caprifig, which spread from Caria (hence the species name <i>carica</i>) in ancient Anatolia, across the Mediterranean. Cultivation is thought to have started in Egypt and the Levant, probably between 4000 and 2700BC; particular evidence of this is the common fig (<i>Ficus </i><i>carica</i>) on the stone walls within ancient Egyptian tombs called <i>mastaba</i>, painted so their occupants could enjoy the fruit in the afterlife.</p>\n<p>Dozens of examples are described in a research paper by the professor of Egyptology Noha Hany Gerges Salama, including paintings within a fifth-dynasty mastaba of Iymery, in Giza. One painting in particular depicts two fig trees, both of which have a boy standing in their branches and picking fruit, while men under the trees collect fallen figs in baskets. Another exquisite painting shows two men seated opposite each other, one of whom is holding a plate holding three enormous figs. Salama notes what a common food source fresh and dried figs were in ancient Egypt, and used often to enhance flavour and sweeten, but also how figs, their leaves and the sap from the branches provided a natural rennet for cheese-making and yeast for wine-making.</p>\n<p>The many varieties of figs fall into two broad groups: those that reproduce without pollination, and those that rely on little gnat-sized fig wasps to do it for them. Either way, figs are botanically not a single fruit, but a cluster of more than a thousand tiny flowers, which are thought of as seeds. Figs are also one of the few fruits to taste best when over-ripe, when those thousand tiny fruits have matured into an ambrosial cross between honey and jam, and as a result perfect for attracting both wasps and this week‚Äôs recipe.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs a variation on the wonderful <i>crostata di ricotta e visciole</i> (sour cherry and ricotta tart) from the Jewish-Roman tradition, using figs and orange instead, and I have also varied the pastry by adding some (optional) orange zest and ground almonds. Always work quickly with pastry, and with cold hands, and don‚Äôt skip the chilling or the preheating of the baking tray, which prevents a soggy bottom. And if you can‚Äôt find figs, fig jam works beautifully, too.</p>\n<p>You can serve this tart hot out of the oven, but it is better, I think, when it has cooled a bit, so both the ricotta and fig layers have had the chance to firm up, which makes it easier to cut. Like its cherry cousin, the tart is also wonderful at room temperature and fridge-cold, especially for breakfast.</p>\n<h2>Fig, ricotta and orange tart</h2>\n<p>Serves <strong>8‚Äì10</strong><strong>150g cold butter</strong>, diced<strong>250g plain flour</strong>, plus extra for dusting<br/>\n  50g ground almonds<strong>1 pinch of salt\n  60g icing sugar\n  2 medium eggs</strong>, lightly beaten, plus extra for brushing</p>\n<p><strong>1 unwaxed orange</strong>, 2 strips of zest pared off, the rest of the zest finely grated, plus 2 tbsp juice</p>\n<p><strong>400g fresh figs</strong>, chopped, or 300g fig jam</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>175g</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>caster sugar</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>500g ricotta<br/>1 egg</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>1 egg</p>\n<p>Rub the butter into the flour and ground almonds until the mix resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add the salt, icing sugar, grated orange zest and eggs, then mix to make a soft pastry. Wrap in greaseproof paper and chill in the fridge for at least an hour.</p>\n<p>Put the figs in a pan with the two strips of orange zest, orange juice and 100g of the sugar. Bring to a boil, turn down to a lively simmer and cook for five to seven minutes,<strong> </strong>until the figs are tender and collapsing, but not mushy.</p>\n<p>On a lightly floured surface, roll out two-thirds of the pastry into a disc a little larger than a 24cm tart tin. Drape the pastry over a rolling pin, unfurl it into the tin and push it into the corners. Trim off the excess pastry with a knife.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/28/rachel-roddy-recipe-fig-ricotta-orange-tart\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/coffee\">Coffee</a> gets paired up with flavors of all kinds ‚Äì vanilla, hazelnut, chocolate ‚Äì and each one coaxes something new out of your morning brew. But there‚Äôs a fresh pairing you might have seen bubbling up on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tiktok\">TikTok</a>: banana.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Banana in your coffee. It‚Äôs not as strange as you might think. I spent most of the summer swimming in banana lattes, affogatos and cold brews, and now I‚Äôm a believer. Here‚Äôs why I think you might be too, and how easy it is to make your own at home.</p>\n<h2>Why it works</h2>\n<p>Most of the syrup flavors at your local cafe skew toward dessert: cinnamon, almond, caramel. They‚Äôre sweet, familiar, and they take the edge off espresso without drowning out its flavors.</p>\n<p>Banana brings the same sugar-and-smoothness treatment, but with a twist. There‚Äôs a fruit-forward nose that brightens the subtler notes in light and medium roasts, plus a creamy lift, almost custard-like, with a soft vanilla undertone that wraps it all together. It‚Äôs a complex, multi-layered flavor, and once you‚Äôve tasted it with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/coffee\">coffee</a> you‚Äôll wonder how you ever doubted it could be anything but <i>delicious</i>.</p>\n<p>I first encountered it about five years ago at a South Korean-owned cafe in Portland, Oregon, called <a href=\"https://www.sorosoropdx.com/\">Soro Soro</a>. I saw banana latte on their menu and I just had to try it. I was amazed that it wasn‚Äôt syrupy sweet, and tasted like fresh bananas, not banana-flavored candy.</p>\n<h2>The key ingredient</h2>\n<p>Unlike most coffee flavorings you‚Äôll find at a cafe, we‚Äôre not talking about banana-flavored syrup here. The primary ingredient in any banana coffee preparation is banana milk. It‚Äôs not a plant-based concoction like soy milk or almond milk; it‚Äôs ordinary dairy milk used as a vehicle for banana concentrate.</p>\n<p>One of the most popular brands, Binggrae, is widely available everywhere from <a href=\"https://fave.co/4lMfpRq\">Amazon</a> to <a href=\"https://fave.co/4n8ztyB\">Instacart</a>, and is ubiquitous at Korean groceries like <a href=\"https://www.hmart.com/banana-flavored-milk-drink-6-8oz-200ml--6-packs/p\">H Mart</a>. It‚Äôs been steadily gaining popularity over the last few years, thanks in part to K-pop fans who noticed their favorite idols drinking Binggrae in video clips online.</p>\n<p>\n      <sub>$7.99 at Instacart</sub>\n      <sub>$12.99 at Amazon</sub>\n    </p>\n<p>But it‚Äôs been around since the 1970s, when the South Korean government was trying to encourage people to drink more milk to boost the domestic dairy industry and combat still-widespread malnutrition in the aftermath of the Korean war. At the time, bananas were a popular (if scarce) fruit, so companies like Binggrae seized the opportunity and made the first of the banana milks that you may have seen popping up at US cafes in the last few years. There are tons of competitors out there too; <a href=\"https://www.hmart.com/banana-milk-38-54floz-190ml-/p\">Haio</a>, <a href=\"https://fave.co/46bbiJZ\">Mooala</a>, and the veteran <a href=\"https://fave.co/4mMRIJS\">Nesquik</a>‚Äôs banana milk powder. You can even <a href=\"https://mykoreankitchen.com/korean-banana-milk/\">make it yourself</a>!</p>\n<h2>Quick and easy banana iced latte</h2>\n<p>This one takes just a minute and requires no <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/16/best-espresso-machines-uk\">espresso machine</a>, but it tastes so much like a cafe-fresh iced latte you might find yourself spoiled for them. It‚Äôs the recipe I have been sipping on constantly this summer as Seattle is blasted by heatwave after heatwave.</p>\n<p>In a mason jar, take two tablespoons of good quality instant coffee (my favorites are <a href=\"https://fave.co/3I4z6Gf\">Colcafe</a> or <a href=\"https://fave.co/3K2sNDG\">Verve</a>), and add a splash of hot water, just enough to dissolve the crystals. Stir. Add ice, pour your banana milk over the top (about 10-12 ounces), close the jar and shake vigorously. What you‚Äôre doing here is threefold: you‚Äôre aerating the mixture, making it creamier, you‚Äôre breaking off tiny ice crystals that help that creaminess stick around, and you‚Äôre making sure the whole thing is fully and completely mixed. Take off the lid and enjoy right from the jar. Seriously, it‚Äôs ridiculous how good this one is.</p>\n<h2>Classic iced latte with banana milk</h2>\n<p>Normally if you‚Äôre making an iced espresso drink, you‚Äôre adding a flavor syrup and two shots of espresso to a cup full of ice, then pouring your milk of choice over it. For banana coffee you‚Äôre doing most of the same work, but with a couple of differences.</p>\n<p>Don‚Äôt own an espresso machine yet? The <a href=\"https://fave.co/47kG1FE\">De‚ÄôLonghi Stilosa EC230</a> was the Guardian‚Äôs favorite budget pick, when we evaluated the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/16/best-espresso-machines-uk\">best espresso machines</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/03/banana-korean-coffee\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But only when it‚Äôs warm outside.</p>\n    <p><strong>I have to say, this sounds like a lie.</strong> And yet there is undeniable proof of it, in the form of a survey of 2,000 people that was recently commissioned by LG.</p>\n    <p><strong>The television manufacturing brand?</strong> That doesn‚Äôt make it any less valid. What‚Äôs more, there‚Äôs a good chance that the survey is conservative. The true number of icy beer fanatics is probably much higher.</p>\n    <p><strong>Why is that?</strong> Because another 10% said embarrassment was holding them back from requesting ice in their beer, and another 20% said that they had previously been told off by friends, family and bar staff for requesting it.</p>\n    <p><strong>Seriously, though, why is putting ice cubes in beer a bad thing? </strong>Because beer is already delicately flavoured enough as it is, so diluting it with melted ice risks rendering it tasteless. Plus, a lot of work went into crafting that flavour profile. Don‚Äôt just mess it all up because you like your glass to clink when you swirl it.</p>\n    <p><strong>Where did this horrible trend</strong><strong> originate?</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/france\">France</a>, apparently. In the southern regions, it is normal to do it on a hot day.</p>\n    <p><strong>Even though TikTok is perpetually full of American people complaining about France‚Äôs innate hatred of iced drinks?</strong> Listen, things change. People put ice cubes in beer. It‚Äôs progress.</p>\n    <p><strong>This has to be the worst drinks trend of the year. </strong>Clearly someone hasn‚Äôt seen Materialists yet.</p>\n    <p><strong>Oh </strong><strong>God, why?</strong> Because that‚Äôs the film where Dakota Johnson orders a drink that‚Äôs half beer and half Coca-Cola, known as a diesel in Germany.</p>\n    <p><strong>What is happening to the world? </strong>Calm down. People drink shandies all the time, and that‚Äôs beer and lemonade. What‚Äôs so bad about using a different fizzy drink?</p>\n    <p><strong>I suppose that does make more sense than putting ice cubes in beer.</strong> Don‚Äôt worry, this isn‚Äôt actually going to be the future.</p>\n    <p><strong>Why‚Äôs that?</strong> Because younger generations typically drink less than their older counterparts. And this, combined with the World Health Organization‚Äôs goal to reduce alcohol consumption by 20% per capita by 2030, means that drinking culture as we know it is on the verge of disappearing.</p>\n    <p><strong>Oh fine, I‚Äôll turn a blind eye this time.</strong> That‚Äôs more like it. Barman, one half-beer, half-cola slushie, please.</p>\n    <p><strong>Do say:</strong> ‚ÄúI put ice cubes in my beer to stay cool.‚Äù</p>\n    <p><strong>Don‚Äôt say: </strong>‚ÄúI prefer to submerge a baked potato in mine to make it more filling.‚Äù</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/02/ice-cubes-in-beer-is-this-popular-pub-order-atrocious-or-ingenious\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The M&amp;S sandwich received a certain amount of criticism, along with <a href=\"https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/ms-strawberries-cream-sandwich\">some surprisingly good reviews</a>. But both sandwiches were controversial, not least from a nutritional standpoint (the Tesco sandwich contains 31.5g of sugar, over a third of the recommended maximum daily intake for an adult), but also because they upset our notion of what a sandwich is. Aren‚Äôt they supposed to be savoury? Aren‚Äôt they supposed to be lunch, rather than dessert?</p>\n<p>Bur sweet sandwiches are not uncommon ‚Äì anything with jam in it counts ‚Äì and the sandwich itself is not a rules-based enterprise: it‚Äôs more of a continuous trial-and-error process ‚Äì even as you eat a sandwich you‚Äôve just made, you‚Äôre thinking about how it could be better next time. When it comes to sweet fillings, you‚Äôve got to try at least a few before you reject them out of hand. Here are 12 ideas to get you started.</p>\n<p>A note: most sweet sandwiches do not require a recipe, and are subject to endless modification. Feel free to experiment with different breads, flavours and proportions ‚Äì you may as well have it the way you want it.</p>\n<p>First up, a deep-fried peanut butter and jelly (clear jam) sandwich, from food blogger Davie Leite at the website Leite‚Äôs Culinaria. Arguably, the classic PB&amp;J is already a sweet sandwich ‚Äì but the addition of a sugary deep-fried batter turns this humble childhood treat into the kind of snack that helped kill Elvis. <a href=\"https://leitesculinaria.com/94164/recipes-deep-fried-peanut-butter-jelly-sandwiches.html\">The recipe</a> offers two extra options I immediately rejected: sliced banana (no thank you) and a white chocolate ganache for dipping (are you kidding?).</p>\n<p>A sturdy sourdough bread is recommended. I might have sliced it a little too thick ‚Äì of no consequence taste wise, but it makes it harder to fry. Be careful not to go overboard with the fillings. Slap it together as you normally would, dip the whole thing into the batter, and deep fry it in hot oil, flipping once.</p>\n<p>If you‚Äôre looking for rare examples of foodstuffs that are not improved by deep-frying, you can start here. You could tinker with proportions all day and still not make something palatable out of this heavy, greasy, sticky mess. In case it was just me, I forced some on my oldest son, who simply shook, went quiet, then said, no.</p>\n<p>Other sweet fried sandwiches include <a href=\"https://minimalistbaker.com/grilled-nutella-banana-sandwich/\">the grilled Nutella banana sandwich</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/melissaharrison/easy-nutella-desserts\">grilled Nutella and marshmallow sandwich</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.monpetitfour.com/banana-french-toast-sandwiches-3/\">banana french toast sandwich</a>. The classic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QB7VbPDC5o\">Monte Christo sandwich</a>, while technically savoury (it‚Äôs ham and cheese on french toast), is traditionally served in the US dredged in icing sugar, with jam. As an American, I apologise.</p>\n<p>The Japanese strawberry and cream sandwich ‚Äì or ichigo sando ‚Äì on which M&amp;S based its version, is easy enough to recreate at home. Just <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gevh9jT_yS0&amp;t=2s\">watch recipe developer Marc Matsumoto</a>. I substituted brioche slices for the authentic Japanese milk bread: it‚Äôs easier to find.</p>\n<p>First, carefully wash, top and dry your strawberries ‚Äì five per sandwich. Whip a generous quantity of double cream, sweeten to taste and set aside.</p>\n<p>The final key component in this recipe is strawberry jam ‚Äì spread a thin layer on both bread slices and heap the whipped cream on top in shallow pyramids. On one half push your largest strawberry into the centre of the cream and then position four more round it, pointy ends facing the corners of the bread.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/27/sandwich-surprise-12-delicious-and-diabolical-ways-to-sweeten-your-sarnie\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Customise this one by swapping the almonds for pistachios, and serving it with cherries or other seasonal fruit. Do seek out the anise seeds, though, because they add such a lovely pop of flavour.

To make the praline, put the sugar and 30ml water in a small saucepan and set it over a low heat. Stir until the sugar dissolves, then turn up the heat to medium-high and cook, without stirring but swirling the pan occasionally, until the mix turns a deep golden colour. Stir in the almonds, then pour on to the lined tray, sprinkle with sea salt and leave to cool and harden.

In a medium heatproof bowl, whisk the egg yolks, honey and 40g sugar, then set the bowl over the pan, ensuring the base isn‚Äôt touching the water. Whisk for six to eight minutes, until thick and pale, then take off the heat and whisk (ideally over a bowl of ice) until cooled.</p>\n    <p>Put the egg whites in the bowl of an electric mixer and whisk until white and foamy. Gradually beat in the remaining 40g sugar, whisking until it dissolves and the mix comes to firm peaks. Scrape the meringue into the egg yolk bowl, but don‚Äôt mix it in just yet.</p>\n    <p>In the same bowl and with the same whisk attachment (no need to wash them), whip the cream to soft peaks.

Scrape the mixture into the lined tin, smooth the top and freeze overnight (or for up to a week).</p>\n    <p>About 30 minutes before serving, prepare the nectarines. In a medium bowl, whisk the sugar, lemon juice, honey and salt. Halve and stone the nectarines, then cut them into 1cm wedges. Toss with the syrup and herbs, then leave to macerate.</p>\n    <p>To serve, lift the semifreddo out of its tin using the overhang, then cut into roughly 2¬Ωcm-thick slices.

    "body": "<p>At the end of the 17th century a French travel writer who crossed the Channel was clearly impressed by the sweet, comforting treats offered to him, declaring with relish: ‚ÄúAh! What an excellent thing is an English pudding!‚Äù</p>\n<p>More than three centuries on, <a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/\">English Heritage</a> has sounded the alarm that the good old British pudding is facing extinction.</p>\n<p>Research from the charity suggests two-thirds of households in England, Wales and Scotland make puddings only once a month or less, while a third never bake or boil or steam one.</p>\n<p>English Heritage warned that if nothing was done to stem the tide, the great British pudding will not exist in 50 years.</p>\n<p>Dr Andrew Hann, a senior curator of history at English <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/heritage\">Heritage</a>, said: ‚ÄúSweet puddings are closely intertwined with British history and it would be a huge shame for them to die out.‚Äù</p>\n<p>For the purposes of this research, the charity defines puddings as cooked sweet courses that follow a main meal ‚Äì so not just traditional ‚Äúpuddings‚Äù typically made in mould or basins but also dishes such as apple pies or crumbles.</p>\n<p>Hann waxed lyrical about the sort of puddings his mother would make. ‚ÄúShe regularly produced a delicious pudding after the main course ‚Äì things like steamed sponge pudding with coming out of a pudding basin with the syrup dribbling down the side. There was a whole repertoire of delicious puddings. People are not generally making these sort of hot desserts but turning to things like ice-cream, yoghurts or fruit.‚Äù</p>\n<p>English Heritage said recipes for sweetened meat pies from the medieval period had been found and that by the Tudor and Stuart times, puddings sweetened with honey or fruit were common, although many would also have contained meat.</p>\n<p>Hann said puddings were once a luxury for the well-off but as sugar became more widely available, more people could enjoy them. The 20th century was probably the heyday of the British pudding.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúHowever, the research shows a clear shift away from the traditional dessert over the past 50 years,‚Äù Hann said. ‚ÄúAs more women entered the workforce from the 1970s onwards, households no longer had as much time to cook and started to prioritise convenience. If this decline continues, we can expect the classic great British pud to all but vanish within the next 50 years.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The research, which was carried out by YouGov, found 2% of British households eat a daily homemade pudding.</p>\n<p>While half of people born before 1970 said their parents made puddings several times a week, that was the case for only 26% of those born in the 1970s. The downward trend has continued since then.</p>\n<p>In an attempt to reignite Britain‚Äôs love affair with puddings, English Heritage has introduced two new pudding-inspired ice-cream flavours to its sites: sticky toffee and apple crumble and custard.</p>\n<p>The charity is also launching The English Heritage Baking Book in early September. It contains recipes for all the nation‚Äôs favourite puddings but also some of the forgotten ones, accompanied by notes on their history.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-15\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<h2>Four British classics at risk</h2>\n<p><strong>Twelfth Night </strong><strong>cake</strong><strong/>By the reign of Elizabeth I, Twelfth Night involved a celebratory cake, typically a rich, yeasty fruit bread flavoured with spices, and a token or bean hidden inside. The person who found the bean became the Lord of Misrule or King of the Bean, and would have to organise the evening‚Äôs revelry. The cake survived the Reformation. People began to use eggs to raise the cake, and as sugar and fruit came down in price, the cake became less of a fruited bread and more like a rich fruit cake. Over time, it was replaced by the Christmas cake.</p>\n<p><strong>Soul cake</strong><strong/>Also know as a soulmass-cake, they were traditionally given to children or poorer people, known as ‚Äúsoulers‚Äù, who would go from door to door singing songs or reciting prayers over Allhallowtide (Halloween, Saints‚Äô Day, and All Souls‚Äô Day). There are written references to the custom from as far back as 1511.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>If you‚Äôve heard of savagnin (nope, not sauvignon), you may well be one of those in-the-know wine drinkers who have been ushered in the direction of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/jura\">Jura</a>, this grape‚Äôs iconic region, after being priced out of your favourite burgundy. And while there are some similarities between the two regions, a focus on chardonnay and pinot noir being the most obvious, there are plenty of other varieties for discerning wine nerds, and savagnin is definitely one of them.</p>\n    <p>It‚Äôs a grape variety that‚Äôs been grown in France for 900 years, with high acidity and a late-ripening in the vineyard, and it‚Äôs known for the complex, age-worthy styles of wine it can create. It‚Äôs also grown just over the border in Switzerland, where it‚Äôs known as heida, as well as in Australia, where it was once mistaken for albari√±o. In the Jura, however, this high-acid grape produces nuanced still wines, and wines made in the <i>vin jaune</i> style, for which the wine is matured under yeast to give it a nutty, complex character akin to that of a biologically aged sherry such as fino.</p>\n    <p>The curious character of these wines makes them a sommelier‚Äôs secret weapon, as <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/donalde81/\">Donald Edwards</a>, consultant sommelier, tells me: ‚ÄúVin jaune scratches an itch that‚Äôs hard to sort any other way: oily, sharp, salty, a little bit wrong, but also ridiculously moreish. The Jura‚Äôs chardonnays seem to rewrite exactly what that variety can be in terms of expression, but it‚Äôs the savagnins that really epitomise the area, snarling at you, while at the same time being defiantly discordant in the most thrilling way. ‚Äù</p>\n    <p>Because of the region‚Äôs relatively small output (a quick glance at <a href=\"https://www.decanter.com/wine/wine-regions/jura/\">Decanter</a> reveals 230 wineries and an average production of 11 million bottles, so a fraction of France‚Äôs other regions), you‚Äôre more likely to find savagnin, and other Jura wines, for that matter, in more boutique-y retailers. They‚Äôre also likely to be a lot more expensive than, say, sauvignon, or any other such wine that‚Äôs produced everywhere and by everyone.</p>\n    <p>Imagine my surprise/shock/delight, then, when the Wine Society recently announced that it‚Äôs bringing a c√¥tes du Jura to its own-label range for ¬£18.50. Yes, I know as well as you that this isn‚Äôt a bargain in the literal sense, but it‚Äôs not too bad a shout considering the <a href=\"https://www.thewinesociety.com/product/letoile-savagnin-domaine-de-montbourgeau-2018/\">100% savagnin currently on the society‚Äôs website</a> is ¬£27, while a lot of other Jura frequently topples over the ¬£30 mark. Hopefully, this might also open the doors for supermarkets and other big retailers to do the same, so my wallet can take less of a flogging every time I want to open my mouth to the nutty, savoury flavours of the Jura.</p>\n    <h2>Four Jura wines to pique your interest</h2>\n    <p><strong>The Society‚Äôs Exhibition C√¥tes du Jura </strong><a href=\"https://www.thewinesociety.com/product/the-societys-exhibition-jura-2020-en.aspx\">¬£18.50 The Wine Society</a>, 13.5%.

The Foliage Is Absolutely World-Class</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Blue-Ridge-Parkway.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"726\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Blue-Ridge-Parkway-1024x726.jpg\" alt=\"Blue Ridge Parkway \" class=\"wp-image-215028 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Blue-Ridge-Parkway-1024x726.jpg 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Blue-Ridge-Parkway-300x213.jpg 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Blue-Ridge-Parkway-768x544.jpg 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Blue-Ridge-Parkway-960x680.jpg 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Blue-Ridge-Parkway-1080x765.jpg 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Blue-Ridge-Parkway-1200x850.jpg 1200w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Blue-Ridge-Parkway.jpg 1846w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Blue-Ridge-Parkway.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-2\" loading=\"lazy\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p>\n<p>Let's be clear: Virginia's fall color show is a national treasure. The state is home to the legendary <strong>Shenandoah National Park</strong> and a huge stretch of the <strong>Blue Ridge Parkway</strong>, two of the most iconic foliage destinations in the entire country.</p>\n<p>In mid-to-late October, the mountains explode into a breathtaking panorama of fiery reds, oranges, and yellows. Unlike some other destinations where you have to hike for miles to get a good view, Virginia makes it incredibly easy to find those jaw-dropping vistas. It‚Äôs a top-tier foliage experience that still feels like an insider‚Äôs secret compared to the more crowded spots up north.</p>\n<h3><strong>2.

The state has a massive and surprisingly trendy wine scene, with hundreds of beautiful vineyards offering tastings with incredible mountain backdrops. The <strong>Monticello Wine Trail</strong> near Charlottesville is a must-do.</p>\n<p>More of a beer person? Virginia has you covered. The craft beer scene is booming, especially along the <strong>Brew Ridge Trail</strong>, a scenic route that connects a half-dozen amazing breweries at the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It‚Äôs the perfect way to spend a crisp fall afternoon.</p>\n<h3><strong>3.

This 105-mile road runs the entire length of Shenandoah National Park, winding along the crest of the mountains.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs a bucket-list experience, with 75 overlooks offering stunning views of the colorful valley below. You can spend a whole day cruising, pulling over for photos, and taking short, easy hikes to spectacular viewpoints. For an easy hike with a huge payoff, check out the <strong>Stony Man</strong> trail‚Äîit‚Äôs a gentle 1.6-mile loop that leads to one of the most incredible vistas in the park.</p>\n<h2>Virginia's Fall Vibe Check</h2>\n<p>Explore Shenandoah National Park and the Blue Ridge Parkway for some of the most iconic fall color shows in the entire country.</p>\n<p>Sip your way through hundreds of scenic vineyards on the Monticello Wine Trail or check out the booming craft beer scene on the Brew Ridge Trail.</p>\n<p>Cruise the legendary Skyline Drive, a 105-mile road with 75 overlooks offering breathtaking views of the colorful Shenandoah Valley.</p>\n<p>Get a premium, New England-style fall experience for a fraction of the cost, with great deals on flights and hotels.</p>\n<p>Use a cozy and historic town like Charlottesville or Staunton as your perfect home base for exploring the mountains and wineries.</p>\n<h3><strong>4.

Jersey royals are my favourite, but other good (and widely available) options include celandine, ratte, arran, pink fir apple and vivaldi, though farm shops may have even better options on offer.</p>\n<h2>2 ‚Ä¶ and try to buy small ones</h2>\n<p>Choose potatoes that are fairly even in size, and preferably small enough easily to boil whole; you may need to cut any larger ones in half to ensure they all cook through in roughly the same time, but try to minimise this, because potatoes cooked whole in their skins will have a better texture.</p>\n<h2>3 Prep the spuds</h2>\n<p>Give the potatoes a good wash; true new potatoes should still have some dirt clinging to their frail skins, but don‚Äôt bother to peel them any more than necessary, because those skins hold much of the flavour, and also protect the potato flesh from the hot water. Put the spuds in a pan just large enough to hold them all comfortably.</p>\n<h2>4 Cook the spuds</h2>\n<p>Add enough cold water just to cover, then salt very generously (don‚Äôt worry, because most of it will go down the drain after cooking). Cover and bring to a boil, then uncover, turn down the heat and simmer until just cooked through (test the largest potato with a fork or skewer to check). This method takes longer than dropping them in boiling water, but it means that the outsides won‚Äôt overcook.</p>\n<h2>5 Start the dressing</h2>\n<p>Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk the mustard (any variety will do here, but I like the tanginess of dijon), vinegar (cider or white-wine would work, as would lemon juice) and a pinch of salt until smooth, then gradually whisk in the oils ‚Äì if you prefer your dressing to have a lighter or stronger flavour, feel free to use neutral or olive oil alone, respectively.</p>\n<h2>6 For a homemade mayo</h2>\n<p>Drain the potatoes, put them back in the hot pan to steam dry, then cut in half or quarters.</p>\n<p>Toss with the vinaigrette and leave to cool.</p>\n<p>For a quick mayonnaise, in a container that‚Äôs <i>just</i> wider than the head of your stick blender, whizz an egg ‚Äì or, for a plant-based alternative, four tablespoons of aquafaba and 10 chickpeas ‚Äì with a tablespoon of mustard and a teaspoon of vinegar or lemon juice.</p>\n<h2>7 Finish the mayo</h2>\n<p>Pour 225ml neutral oil and 25ml extra-virgin olive oil on top of the egg or chickpea mixture, then put the stick blender on the base of the container and whizz at high speed until you see white clouds billow up from underneath. At this point, lift the still whizzing blender head <i>very </i>slowly, and mix until all the oil is combined. Season to taste.</p>\n<h2>8 Flavour the mayo</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/may/11/how-to-make-potato-salad-recipe-felicity-cloake\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Join Longreads and  help us to support more writers.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Drew Johnson | Longreads | September 9, 2025 | 5,443 words (19 minutes)</i>\n    </p>\n<p>On an October afternoon in 1868, James M. Hinds was assassinated by a Klansman on a lonely road in Monroe County, Arkansas, not far from the district Hinds represented in the US House of Representatives. Hinds had been traveling with Joseph Brooks, a fellow Republican. The two men had traveled by steamboat up the White River, on their way to a political gathering. When the steamboat captain learned that he was transporting Republican leaders, he put Hinds and Brooks off at an earlier stop, in land they did not know.</p>\n<p>In Indian Bay, they asked a man named George Clark for directions. Clark, who had been heard threatening the lives of any Republicans who would dare to come speak, gave the men directions and then went to retrieve his shotgun. He rode up behind the two men and shot Brooks with one barrel before shooting Hinds with the other, at close range.</p>\n<p>As Hinds lay dying, he used a pencil to write a note on his hatband:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p/>\n      <i>My name is James Hinds. I am shot in the body and shall live only a few minutes. My wife is at East Greenwich, N.Y. Wife, take care of my two daughters, Jennie and Annie.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>During his lone term, Hinds carried the flag for Reconstruction, the massive effort by the Republican Party to manage just how and whether the former Confederate states and their inhabitants would rejoin the Union while also determining just how and to what extent the formerly enslaved would truly join the Union. Unlike many of his contemporaries, even among Republicans, Hinds moved among the newly freed men and women of his adopted state of Arkansas. He was rumored to work with the Union League to support Black political participation, and helped launch a pro-Reconstruction party in Arkansas, publicly referring to the formerly enslaved as ‚Äúfellow citizens‚Äù and vowing on behalf of the party to ‚Äúdig deep down to the granite rocks of eternal truth and justice and upon them lay its foundation.‚Äù He walked at the head of freedmen marches in Little Rock. He believed in the possibility of a history that we, as a nation, chose not to pursue.</p>\n<p>But redistricting erased Hinds‚Äôs own district, and he died a lame duck congressman, out canvassing in hostile territory, pursuing the goals of his constituency, party, and country, with no immediate selfish goal in plain view. After his death, Charles Sumner, a US senator from Massachusetts, referred to Hinds as a ‚Äúvindicator of the rights of men‚Äù‚Äîpraise that is engraved on Hinds‚Äôs burial marker. Today, Hinds is a kind of forgotten Keats of American politics: a briefly notable figure, once held up as a martyr but then erased by a change in the tides of history, one whose name, per Keats‚Äôs epitaph, truly was <i>writ in water</i>. He has the double distinction of being the first US congressman to be assassinated while in office and being virtually forgotten despite that.¬†</p>\n<p>In all likelihood, you have never heard of Hinds. I had never heard of him either. His words aren‚Äôt etched into marble monuments across the nation. You can‚Äôt read about him in any of the classic sources. Eric Foner doesn‚Äôt mention him in his seminal history of Reconstruction, nor does John Hope Franklin or even Heather Cox Richardson. <i>The Encyclopedia of Southern Culture</i> doesn‚Äôt know who Hinds was. And let‚Äôs not restrict ourselves to the good guys. The old, ‚ÄúLost Cause‚Äù literature of Reconstruction-as-Biblical-Plague School of Southern History leaves Hinds right out, too. Walter Lynwood Fleming‚Äôs 1919 ‚Äúclassic,‚Äù <i>The Sequel of Appomattox</i>,<i> </i>ignores Hinds. Nor does J. Lesslie Hall‚Äôs <i>Half-hours in Southern History </i>include Hinds in its slow drip of the Lost Cause narrative, written in a manner suitable for school-age children. Hinds is hard to find.¬†</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/09/09/congressman-james-hinds-assassination/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Annie Chun is the co-founder of Gimme Seaweed. (Image: Courtesy of the company)</p>\n<p>Korean-born Annie Chun grew up watching her mother roast seaweed on the stovetop. She‚Äôs now the co-founder of Gimme Seaweed, a popular, healthy and sustainable brand.</p>\n<p>Fun fact: ‚ÄúGim‚Äù means <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/a-seaweed-farmer-talks-kelp-2023s-hottest-superfood/\">seaweed</a> in Korean.¬†</p>\n<p>And ‚Äúgim‚Äù is something that Annie Chun remembers well from her childhood in Seoul, near South Korea‚Äôs west coast. Growing up, she often ate foods from the ocean ‚Äî including the <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/the-surprising-way-seaweed-could-replace-plastic/\">seaweed</a> that her mother would roast on the stovetop with a touch of sesame oil. It was delicious, with fresh flavor and <i>umami</i> characteristics, and Chun thought of it often, long after she moved to California as an adult.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThat memory stayed with me, and years later, it inspired the idea for <a href=\"https://gimmeseaweed.com/\">Gimme Seaweed</a> ‚Äì taking something that I loved as a child and reimagining it for a new audience,‚Äù says Chun, a longtime food entrepreneur who has worked in restaurants and the food industry for over 30 years. (She <a href=\"https://www.just-food.com/news/south-korea-usa-c-j-corp-buys-annie-chuns-of-us/\">sold</a> her previous company, Asian food brand Annie Chun‚Äôs, for $6 million in 2009 to CJ Corp., a big Korean food manufacturer.) In 2012, she and her husband, Steve, who had been developing seaweed-based product ideas, ‚Äúrecognized an opportunity‚Äù to make the traditional Korean side dish more mainstream in the U.S. ‚Äì and launched Gimme Seaweed (a play on ‚Äúgim‚Äù) as an organic, non-GMO, sustainable brand.</p>\n<p>Seaweed is considered a regenerative crop, a nutrient dense ‚Äúsuperfood‚Äù that can absorb carbon dioxide and make the ocean cleaner. In recent years, the industry has exploded in popularity, and startups are not just making food with seaweed (like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/26/umaro-is-turning-ocean-farmed-seaweed-into-imitation-bacon/\">imitation bacon</a>) but also turning the eco-friendly plant into <a href=\"https://oceanographicmagazine.com/news/seaweed-biofuels-study/\">biofuels</a> and <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/the-surprising-way-seaweed-could-replace-plastic/\">plastic alternatives</a>.¬†</p>\n<p>Chun‚Äôs company, which is USDA-certified, has partnered with <a href=\"https://repurpose.global/\">rePurpose Global</a> to reduce plastic pollution, as well as the <a href=\"https://conserveturtles.org/\">Sea Turtle Conservancy</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.climatecollaborative.com/about\">Climate Collaborative</a>. Its seaweed snacks are sold in grocery stores and large retailers like Target, Walmart and Costco.</p>\n<p>Below, Chun answered our questions about where she sources her seaweed, what keeps her motivated, and how she plans to make seaweed a regular part of American diets.</p>\n<p><i>(Answers, provided via email, have been lightly edited for length and clarity).¬†</i></p>\n<h2><strong>In the late 1970s, you immigrated to San Francisco, where your family owned a Korean restaurant. Were you surprised that seaweed wasn‚Äôt widely eaten in the U.S.?</strong></h2>\n<p>Seaweed consumption has evolved in the United States, and it seemed to gain some popularity around the time that the famous 1980 miniseries ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080274/\">Sh≈çgun</a>‚Äù was screened here. Sushi also grew immensely during this period, and seaweed is a core part of sushi, so seaweed is widely eaten, just not in the form that we typically eat in Korea.¬†</p>\n<p>It was a bit surprising how unfamiliar roasted seaweed was to Americans. For many Americans, seaweed is what they see washed up on the beach, so there is a real ‚Äúyuck factor‚Äù that we have had to overcome.</p>\n<p>At Gimme Seaweed, we realized that we needed to make seaweed feel exciting, modern and relevant, particularly for younger, more adventurous snackers. It‚Äôs amazing that children have been early adopters. We focus on bold, unexpected flavors like chili lime or our newest, Korean BBQ. We found that when you meet people where they are, with flavor and fun, they‚Äôre far more open to trying something new.</p>\n<h2><strong>When you and your husband founded Gimme Seaweed some 13 years ago, was it difficult to source your product?¬†</strong></h2>\n<p>In 2012, there were no USDA-organic seaweed snacks, so we had to do extensive work to convince the farmers to convert to organic farming and get both the Korean and U.S. governments to approve our organic seaweed. We wanted to create a product that honored the integrity of the ocean and represented seaweed in a way that felt authentic, clean and meaningful. That‚Äôs why we chose to source our red porphyra (nori) seaweed from South Korea, where the minerals along the coastal waters create ideal growing conditions ‚Äì producing seaweed that‚Äôs both nutrient-dense and incredibly flavorful.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/the-woman-behind-those-seaweed-snacks-in-your-kids-lunch-box/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Thompson <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DN70nvFDG2d/?igsh=NDYzMGw0eTc4OXox\">turned hers into a salad</a> with pepper, spring onion, tomatoes and cucumber. Inspired, I rushed out to buy a bag (yes, I see the irony, too) and made a salad using leftovers. And, of course, ended up with half a bag of orzo in my cupboard.</p>\n    <h2>Orzo salad: an anti-recipe</h2>\n    <p>I‚Äôve called this an anti-recipe because I think recipes are often guilty of creating food waste by being too prescriptive. I want you to cook with love, confidence and creativity, using up whatever you can find. So, use orzo if you have it; if not, another pasta or even a grain can be quickly cooked up to create a satiating salad.</p>\n    <p>Build an imaginative meal using leftovers saved from a previous lunch. Stale or out-of-date ‚Äì but still safe to eat ‚Äì nuts, seeds and spices. You can tell if they‚Äôre off by the rancid, oily smell and bitter taste. Other foods you can revive and reuse: wrinkly veg and wilted herbs from the crisper drawer (revived in ice water), tinned or frozen vegetables, and odds and ends of cheese.</p>\n    <p>Serves <strong>2 as a main or 6 as a side</strong></p>\n    <p>All ingredients and quantities are optional and should be added to taste</p>\n    <p>For the salad<strong>300-400g cooked orzo</strong> (from about 125-150g uncooked)<strong>130-260g cooked beans or pulses</strong> (eg ¬Ω-1 can drained cannellini, brown lentils or kidney beans)<strong>200-300g vegetables</strong>, cooked or raw (eg, frozen peas, diced boiled sweet potatoes, green peppers)<strong>100-200g cheese</strong> (eg, feta, parmesan, cheddar), sliced or crumbled<strong>50-100g toasted nuts and/or seeds</strong> (eg, cashews, almonds, peanuts, pumpkin or sesame seeds)<strong>50-100g other store cupboard ingredients</strong> (eg, sun-dried tomatoes, dried apricots, sultanas) <strong>30-50g fresh soft herbs</strong> (eg, parsley, coriander, mint), stalks finely chopped, leaves roughly chopped<strong>Other leftovers</strong>, to taste ‚Äì I had a small amount of fennel frond pesto salad (recipe coming up in a couple of weeks), which I added to the mix.</p>\n    <p>For the dressing<strong>Leftover salad dressings</strong> (eg, caesar, French, honey and mustard), or drizzle on 2‚Äì4 tbsp oil (eg, extra-virgin olive oil, avocado oil, hemp oil) and 1‚Äì2 tbsp lemon juice, wine vinegar or ume vinegar (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jun/18/umeboshi-recipe-turn-unripe-stone-fruit-into-japanese-condiment-recipe-apricot-plum-peach-umeboshi-ferment-zero-waste-cooking\">my apricot umeboshi recipe</a> for the latter)</p>\n    <p>Tip the cooked and cooled pasta into a large bowl. Now build the salad like a buddha bowl, arranging each ingredient side by side, so you can see exactly what you‚Äôve got before mixing.</p>\n    <p>Add the beans or pulses, followed by the cooked and raw vegetables.

    "body": "<p>Salted fish, and salted hake in particular, reminds me of holidays. It‚Äôs very popular in southern Europe, where there are hundreds of recipes to choose from. The salting draws out some of the water and improves the fish‚Äôs flavour and texture, and it‚Äôs a method that pre-dates refrigeration, when salt was used to preserve food. <i>Esqueixada</i> is a Catalan salad of sorts that‚Äôs fresh, cooling and utterly delicious. The fried hake, meanwhile, is a little heavier, but addictive and perfect for sharing with a cold aperitif. Both are regulars on our summer menu, and we often flip between the two.</p>\n<h2>Esqueixada (pictured top)</h2>\n<p>Prep <strong>15 min</strong>Cure</p>\n<p><strong>30 min<br/></strong>Chill</p>\n<p><strong>2 hr+<br/></strong>Cook</p>\n<p><strong>15 min<br/></strong>Serves</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>4</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>For the salted hake<strong>2 thick hake </strong><strong>fillets</strong> (about 200g each), pin-boned<strong>50g coarse sea salt</strong></p>\n<p>For the esqueixada<strong>2 </strong><strong>salted hake fillets</strong> (see above and method)<strong>2 </strong><strong>very ripe large tomatoes</strong>, coarsely grated to a pulp and skins discarded<strong>2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</strong>, plus a little extra to finish<strong>2 tsp </strong><strong>top-quality white-wine vinegar</strong><strong>1 tbsp chopped flat-leaf parsley</strong><strong>Salt</strong>,<strong> </strong>to taste<strong>\n  2 tbsp black olives</strong>, pitted</p>\n<p><strong>1 tbsp salted capers</strong>, well rinsed</p>\n<p><strong>2 small salad onions</strong>, tropea ideally, though spring onion whites will do, peeled if need be, trimmed and finely sliced</p>\n<p>To make the salted hake, lay the fish in a dish or tray large enough to hold the fillets side by side without overlapping. Sprinkle evenly with the salt, turn to coat on all sides, then cover with clingfilm and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Wash the salt off the fish, pat dry on kitchen paper and return to the fridge to chill and firm up for at least two hours, and ideally overnight.</p>\n<p>Bring a large pan of salted water to a gentle simmer, then drop in the salted hake fillets, making sure they are submerged. Take the pan off the heat and leave the fish to poach in the residual heat for six to eight minutes, until the hake turns opaque and flakes easily. Transfer the fish to a plate and leave to cool at room temperature.</p>\n<p>Gently flake the hake into a large bowl and add the tomato pulp, olive oil, vinegar, parsley and a small pinch of salt. Fold gently, taking care not to break up the natural flakes of the fish, then taste and, if need be, adjust with more vinegar and a little salt to taste.</p>\n<p>Spoon the salad into four shallow bowls, garnish with the olives, capers and sliced onion, finish with a little extra-virgin olive oil and serve.</p>\n<h2>Fried salted hake with a√Øoli</h2>\n<p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong>Cure</p>\n<p><strong>30 min<br/></strong>Chill</p>\n<p><strong>2 hr+<br/></strong>Cook</p>\n<p><strong>15 min<br/></strong>Serves</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>4 as a snack</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>For the a√Øoli<strong>1 garlic clove</strong>, peeled and grated<strong>2 egg yolks\n  30g </strong></p>\n<p>\n      <strong>dijon mustard<br/></strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>30ml white-wine vinegar</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong><br/>¬Ω tsp fine salt<br/>200ml sunflower oil<br/>50ml extra-virgin olive oil<br/>5ml lemon juice</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>¬Ω tsp fine salt</p>\n<p>200ml sunflower oil</p>\n<p>50ml extra-virgin olive oil</p>\n<p>5ml lemon juice</p>\n<p>For the fried fish<strong>125g </strong><strong>plain flour</strong>, plus a little extra for coating the hake<strong>250ml sparkling mineral water\n  750ml sunflower oil</strong>, for deep-frying </p>\n<p>\n      <strong><br/>2</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>2</p>\n<p><strong>salted hake fillets</strong>(see recipe above), each cut into 4 pieces</p>\n<p><strong>Salt</strong>, to taste</p>\n<p><strong>1 lemon</strong>, cut into wedges</p>\n<p>First make the a√Øoli.

It will add brilliant bite, freshness and pepperiness.‚Äù</p>\n    <p>The same goes for bruschetta, or toasts with hummus, olive oil and gentle spices such as cumin, says Anna Jones, author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/easy-wins-9780008526658/\">Easy Wins</a>. She‚Äôs no stranger to growing cress, either: ‚ÄúI did it with my own kids, and it‚Äôs a really good lesson in seeing and feeling where food comes from.‚Äù She also recommends using the stuff where you might watercress, rocket, salad leaves or fresh, summery herbs (think chives). ‚ÄúI would love a cream cheese sandwich with a bit of salt, a bit of cucumber and <i>lots</i> of cress,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúOn a hot day, that would feel quite fun and afternoon tea-ish.‚Äù In a similar vein, Birkett might stir cress through cream cheese or ricotta for a ‚Äúsuper-simple spread‚Äù to spoon on to sandwiches or jacket potatoes, or for spreading on crackers. Otherwise, simply stir cress into hummus or, if there‚Äôs yoghurt in the fridge, another slam-dunk dip would be ‚Äúthick strained yoghurt, a squeeze of lemon, maybe some grated garlic and finely chopped cress‚Äù, which would be perfect for scooping up with cucumber sticks or pitta chips.</p>\n    <p>Cress is also a good gateway to greens, says Georgia Levy, author of <a href=\"https://thelunchbox.substack.com/\">The Lunch Box Substack</a>: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very good way to get children familiar with seeing flecks of green in their food,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúTry stirring some through a bowl of macaroni cheese or their favourite pasta dish, and then, in future, that can be replaced by spinach or herbs.‚Äù Well, that‚Äôs the hope, anyway. If, however, your children are already au fait with herbs, Jones would be inclined to throw her cress into a salad: ‚ÄúI often make a herb salad with basil, mint, a bit of parsley and cress.‚Äù But be sure to dress it with something slightly sweet, she adds: ‚ÄúA bit of honey, say, or maybe maple syrup.‚Äù</p>\n    <p>Finally, mix cress into spuds, Birkett says: ‚ÄúScatter homegrown cress on a buttery potato or sweet potato mash to add a lovely freshness and a touch of grown-up flavour that little palates might just surprise you by loving.‚Äù In theory at least, children should be more open to trying new foods if they‚Äôve had a hand in growing them, Birkett says: ‚ÄúThat sprinkle of cress will feel like a proud moment for them, as well as a sweet garnish.‚Äù</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Got a culinary dilemma?

In this recipe, after roasting, I‚Äôve used one of my favourite braising liquids ‚Äì a mix of soy sauce, sake and sesame ‚Äì to bring the aubergine back to life.</p>\n    <h2>Soy sauce, sake and sesame oil-braised aubergines</h2>\n    <p>Cooking sake can be bought in larger supermarkets and Chinese grocery stores (if you can‚Äôt find it, use a nice drinking sake that will go nicely with the meal instead). Cook the rice before starting on the aubergines and cover it with a lid ‚Äì it will stay warm for an hour.</p>\n    <p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>35 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>4</strong><strong>3 large or 4 medium aubergines</strong> (1.1kg)<strong>4 tbsp sunflower oil</strong>, or rapeseed oil<strong>5 tbsp light soy sauce</strong><strong>¬º tsp fine sea salt</strong><strong>6 tbsp cooking sake</strong><strong>2 tsp light brown sugar</strong><strong>2 tsp seasoned rice vinegar</strong><strong>5 tbsp toasted sesame oil</strong><strong>3cm x 3cm piece fresh ginger</strong>, peeled and finely grated<strong>4 garlic cloves</strong>, peeled and minced<strong>1 red bird‚Äôs eye chilli</strong>, slit lengthways<strong>100g spring onions</strong>, halved across the belly, then cut lengthways into long, thin strips (and rinsed, if need be)<strong>Toasted sesame seeds</strong>, to finish<strong>Cooked plain rice</strong>, to serve</p>\n    <p>Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7, and line two large trays with baking paper. Trim the tops off the aubergines, then cut each one into eight long wedges. Put these in a bowl with the sunflower oil, toss with your hands to coat, then lay the wedges side by side on the oven trays. Bake for 25 minutes, until soft.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, make the braising liquid. In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, a quarter-teaspoon of salt, the sake, brown sugar, rice vinegar and three tablespoons of toasted sesame oil.</p>\n    <p>Put the remaining two tablespoons of sesame oil in a small frying pan on a medium to low heat and, once hot, add the ginger, garlic and chilli, and fry for two minutes, until pale golden. Add the spring onions, stir for a minute, then add the soy and sake mixture, take off the heat and mix well.</p>\n    <p>When the aubergines have had their 25 minutes, transfer them to a smaller, lipped baking tray, laying the wedges on top of each other. Stir the braising liquid again, then pour it all over the aubergines and shake the tin to make sure all the aubergines are covered. Roast for a further 10 minutes, sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve with rice alongside.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/may/24/vegan-recipe-aubergine-braised-soy-sauce-sake-sesame-oil-meera-sodha\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>This is exactly my kind of recipe. It‚Äôs easy, flavourful and, as a bonus, it‚Äôs crispy, too. In fact, it‚Äôs so simple, you could make the mixture with your eyes closed or, better still, give it to a six-year-old to do (they could also make it with their eyes closed). The key is the black beans, because they crisp up perfectly, and the condiments, which supercharge the flavour. There is one small catch, though: the onions need caramelising until they‚Äôre jammy, and ready to top the patty. You don‚Äôt <i>have </i>to do this, but I‚Äôm here to tell you that it is worthwhile (especially if there‚Äôs a six-year-old already making the burgers).</p>\n    <h2>Crispy black bean burgers</h2>\n    <p>If you like, prep the patties a day in advance and chill until needed.</p>\n    <p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>30 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>4</strong></p>\n    <p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>30 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>4</strong></p>\n    <p><strong>Olive oil\n  2 large onions</strong>, peeled and thinly sliced</p>\n    <p><strong>1 tsp salt<br/>400g tin black beans</strong>, not drained</p>\n    <p>400g tin black beans</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>80g dried breadcrumbs<br/>1 tsp dried garlic granules<br/>1 tsp dried onion granules<br/>1 tbsp chipotle paste<br/>2 tsp dijon mustard<br/>1 tbsp tomato ketchup</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>1 tsp dried garlic granules</p>\n    <p>1 tsp dried onion granules</p>\n    <p>1 tbsp chipotle paste</p>\n    <p>2 tsp dijon mustard</p>\n    <p>1 tbsp tomato ketchup</p>\n    <p>To serve<strong>4 burger buns \n  Vegan mayonnaise\n  Iceberg lettuce \n  Finely sliced tomato</strong></p>\n    <p>Put three tablespoons of olive oil in a medium frying pan set over a medium heat and, once it‚Äôs hot, add the onion and a half-teaspoon of salt, and cook, stirring often, for 20 minutes, until quite reduced and frazzled. Take off the heat.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, spoon a couple of tablespoons of the liquid (aquafaba) from the tin of beans into a small bowl or mug and set aside. Drain and rinse the beans, tip into a large bowl and roughly mash; leave a few whole or in big chunks. Stir in the breadcrumbs, garlic granules, onion granules, chipotle paste, mustard, ketchup and a half-teaspoon of salt, then use your hands to mix until well combined; if need be, add some or all of the reserved aquafaba.</p>\n    <p>Divide the bean mix evenly into four, roll each piece into a ball, then put them one by one between two sheets of baking paper and press out to roughly 10cm- to 12cm-wide patties (I tend to make mine a wee bit bigger than the burger buns).</p>\n    <p>To cook the patties, put two tablespoons of olive oil in a medium frying pan, then fry two of the burgers for about six minutes in total, turning them once halfway, or when the base is crisp and golden. Remove and set aside, add another two tablespoons of oil, then repeat with the other two patties.</p>\n    <p>To serve, split and toast the buns, spread a generous dollop of mayo over the cut side of the bases and top with a leaf or two of iceberg lettuce. Add a bean patty and a couple of thin slices of tomato, and finish with a quarter of the caramelised onions. On with the lids and eat immediately.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/may/17/meera-sodha-vegan-recipe-crispy-black-bean-burgers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A fiber- and <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/high-protein-breakfast/\">protein-rich breakfast</a> doesn‚Äôt just taste delicious‚Äîit also supports hormone balance, mood, and focus. (Meaning, that 10 a.m. Zoom feels a lot more doable.)</p>\n    <p>This Smoked Salmon Breakfast Bowl is the first edition in my new <strong>Savory Breakfast Bowl series</strong>, and it‚Äôs my current go-to. Vibrant, satisfying, and so quick to throw together, it‚Äôs packed with heart-healthy fats and fresh ingredients. It feels equal parts nourishing and elevated‚Äîexactly the kind of breakfast I want when I need all-day energy.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/camille-styles-july-2025-32-865x1297.jpg\" alt=\"smoked salmon breakfast bowl ingredients\"/>\n    <h2>How to Build This Bowl</h2>\n    <p>Let‚Äôs break it down. At the base, I start with a big handful of peppery arugula‚Äîit‚Äôs the unsung hero of this bowl, giving the whole thing a peppery, fresh bite. Then comes buttery avocado (I mash it just slightly with a fork), a couple slices of silky smoked salmon, and a jammy egg that‚Äôs cooked just how I like it: 7 minutes in boiling water equals a soft-set white with a golden, slightly runny center.</p>\n    <p>To finish it off, I scatter on chopped chives and dill, a generous sprinkle of everything seasoning, and a squeeze of lemon to bring it all together. Simple ingredients, major flavor.</p>\n    <h2>Why It‚Äôs a Power Breakfast</h2>\n    <p>This bowl checks all the boxes when it comes to starting the day strong:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Protein:</strong>Between the egg, salmon, and avocado, you‚Äôre getting around 20 grams of protein to keep you full and energized for hours.</li>\n      <li><strong>Healthy fats:</strong>Avocado and salmon bring the<a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/good-fats-for-skin/\">omega-3s</a>, which are great for brain health and glowing skin.</li>\n      <li><strong>Greens first:</strong>Kicking off the day with leafy greens supports digestion and helps you hit those veggie goals early.</li>\n      <li><strong/>No carb crash here‚Äîthis combo supports sustained energy and a steady mood all morning long.<a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/meal-plan-to-balance-blood-sugar/\">Blood sugar balance</a>:</li>\n    </ul>\n    <graphic src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/camille-styles-july-2025-59-865x1297.jpg\" alt=\"smoked salmon savory breakfast bowl - 20 grams protein\"/>\n    <h2>How to Meal Prep It</h2>\n    <p>This bowl comes together in under 10 minutes, but here are a few ways to speed things up even more on busy mornings:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Soft-boil your eggs in advance.</strong>I‚Äôll usually make a batch at the start of the week and keep them in the fridge. Just peel and slice when you‚Äôre ready to eat.</li>\n      <li><strong>Pre-wash your greens.</strong>I store a container of washed and dried arugula in the fridge so I can grab a handful whenever I need it.</li>\n      <li><strong>Make it portable.</strong>Layer everything into a glass container for a breakfast that travels well.

She never asked if I was happy, only if I‚Äôd eaten well, which I assume to her were the same thing.

    "body": "<p>Modern Hackney Wick has a working overground station, several reformer pilates studios and, since the middle of last year, a new-build courtyard where <a href=\"https://inisfishisland.com/\">Inis</a>, an Irish-influenced bistro, serves thick chunks of Guinness cake and bowls of potato scallops with dainty silver jugs of curry sauce. Eat at Inis, then walk back via the artisan fromagerie and the padel court.</p>\n<p>The Wick was not always thus, especially for diners. Those who knew the place in the noughties, before its decimation and reconstruction for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012\">the 2012 London Olympics</a>, may well lament those bygone days. At one point circa 2005, <a href=\"https://www.formans.co.uk/restaurant/\">Forman‚Äôs fish restaurant</a>, which boasted a ‚Äúview of the canal‚Äù, was one of the ‚Äì cough ‚Äì sole options round these parts. Back then, the canal, where these days young things frolic, was a swamp of shopping trolleys and sad-looking swans, and your salmon en croute might be accompanied by the spectacle of dehydrated ravers trying to find home two days after Friday‚Äôs squat party. Gentrification has come at a price, though, with stratospheric rents, in particular, but there are now also street art tours, sourdough pizzas and a great many places where you can buy terrible pre-mixed cocktails.</p>\n<p>None of that is anything quite like Inis, which is open for breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner, and owned and run by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lynseycoughlan/\">Lynsey Coughlan</a>, formerly of <a href=\"https://thegingerpig.co.uk/\">the Ginger Pig</a> butcher, and ex-art director Lindsay Lewis, alongside head chef Craig Johnson. Inis, from the offset, seemed determined to treat its clientele as grownups and its postcode as a proper community in need of a nice, neighbourhood restaurant. The place clearly wanted to be somewhere to come and come again, and to take your parents to whenever they were in town. There‚Äôs alfresco dining, though that‚Äôs possibly advisable only if you‚Äôre keen on Lime bikes, joggers and enjoying the cleaner, fresher canal. Oh, and importantly, especially if, like me, you only really like five people and two of those are Irish wolfhounds, it‚Äôs dog-friendly, too.</p>\n<p>Inis is Irish in spirit, but it isn‚Äôt Irish-themed. Yes, you can expect Guinness on draft, of course, and Irish breads all rich with treacle and rye, oysters from the west coast of Ireland, Sunday roasts and mince on toast. Irish people who miss their mother‚Äôs cooking might go for the house-glazed ham with coleslaw, the Ogleshield cheese pastries or the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_fillet_roll\">chicken fillet rolls</a> inspired by days frittered away on Pearse Street in Dublin. At night, however, the dinner menu reaches for deliciously lofty moments when rare duck and cucumber meet tahini and sweet, punchy hoisin, when a tranche of Cornish turbot comes festooned with sea vegetables, when elegant house martinis match with delicate watermelon salads, and when hunks of rare onglet come piled with excellent, al dente bobby beans and assertive homemade horseradish.</p>\n<p>The style is fresh, hyper-seasonal and absolutely homemade. It‚Äôs this that draws me back here time and again, the from-scratch element of the cakes and breads, in particular, because that‚Äôs as rare as hen‚Äôs teeth in British casual dining. On my first visit to Inis in its opening weeks, I popped by for a mid-morning coffee and maybe some soda bread with raspberry jam, and perhaps even a bowl of hot smoked trout on new potatoes, but I was immediately seduced by a fearsome and glistening lump of fine-looking Guinness cake that seemed to wink at me from under its glass cloche. ‚ÄúIs it freshly made?‚Äù I asked Coughlan. She assured me that chef had only recently tipped this majestic beauty out of its tin, and that it would be on that evening‚Äôs dinner menu and served with custard. At that exact point, my love affair with Inis was born.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/31/inis-london-e3-grace-dent-restaurant-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Bellota bills itself as offering an ‚Äúelevated tasting menu‚Äù (seven courses, and eight at weekends) and boasts only a maximum of 20 seats, all of them lined up around a counter overlooking married chefs Ruben Aquilar Bel and Gabriella Fogarasi at work.</p>\n<p>On its website, Bellota promises to be ‚Äúrelaxed and welcoming‚Äù, which before going I severely doubted, because tasting menus rarely are: ‚ÄúI found the chef‚Äôs 657-word soliloquy on articho√•kes very relaxing,‚Äù said no one ever. However, on entering the restaurant on a recent Saturday and finding a room hewn in a rhapsody of calm browns and golds, and Fogarasi herself greeting us at the door, well, Bellota actually felt rather zen. There is a cosiness here that doesn‚Äôt at all feel like your average flash-harry fine-dining metropolitan joint. On a sold-out night of two sittings, there were a mere four staff working all evening. There were no hostesses leading us 40 steps to our seats, no pushy sommeliers, no kitchens stuffed with staff ostentatiously shouting, ‚ÄúOui, chef!‚Äù</p>\n<p>Bellota is homespun, sure, but it‚Äôs not remotely amateur-hour, and the meal service is gloriously well honed. Within mere moments of us taking our seats, warm loaves of Fogarasi‚Äôs sourdough bread appeared in cute hessian bags and with a glut of salted butter; we were offered more bread throughout the meal, just in case the tasting-menu portion sizes weren‚Äôt already sating enough. As Aquilar Bel talked earnestly about the txakoli he‚Äôd paired with his hake in salsa verde and escalivada vegetable raviolo, a satisfied hum of Suffolk folk eating good bread and butter enveloped the room.<br/>\n  Bellota‚Äôs genesis has been financed by <a href=\"https://www.restaurantonline.co.uk/Article/2025/05/09/linda-keenan-ive-seen-some-phenomenal-cooks-but-if-you-dont-have-real-teamwork-in-the-kitchen-it-doesnt-work/\">Linda Keenan</a>, who has connections to London‚Äôs well-loved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/oct/30/noble-rot-soho-london-w1-restaurant-review-grace-dent\">Noble Rot</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jul/06/clove-club-london-restaurant-review\">the Clove Club</a>, and, although dissecting something as grubby as money is unappetising, her golden touch matters. Bellota may well be the brainwave of two relatively unknown chefs and tucked away in a quaint West Suffolk market town, but there‚Äôs something hugely beguiling going on here, and even verging on swaggering.</p>\n<p>From the first snacks of hot, crisp, truffled croquetas ‚Äì better than many I‚Äôve tasted even in Spain ‚Äì moving on to that masterful al dente raviolo stuffed with roast sweet red pepper and aubergine with just a touch of sherry vinegar, all dressed in a heavenly manchego sauce, it‚Äôs clear that this is a restaurant without so much as a hint of naivety.</p>\n<p>A hunk of south-west coast hake is crisscrossed with sombre-looking squid ink and served with a fiery green pepper sauce, a piece of grilled langoustine, a padr√≥n pepper and a few palourde clams. Next, rare slices of Creedy Carver duck on a silky puree of heritage carrots with a slick of rich duck jus. Each dish, as we finish it with a sigh, is swept away and replaced like clockwork with something else sticky, rich or magnificent. The chefs move purposefully and in relative silence, with no flapping, no fussing, no shouting and no underlings locked in the walk-in freezer for ‚Äúbanter‚Äù. Just fabulous food. How very modern indeed.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/24/bellota-bury-st-edmunds-grace-dent-restaurant-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The pair met at <a href=\"https://atelier-robuchon-saint-germain.com/\">L‚ÄôAtelier de Jo√´l Robuchon</a> in Paris, moved on to run the now defunct L‚ÄôEnvie in Brive-La-Gaillarde, south-west France, before spending the best part of a decade in Jeon‚Äôs native Korea. In 2019, they settled in Bristol to open the very popular <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/aug/11/bokman-bristol-laser-like-focus-restaurant-review\">Bokman</a>, where dumplings, kimchi fried rice and cherry-flavoured soft-serve Jersey ice-cream are the order of the day.</p>\n<p><i>ssam</i>and sauces on the side.</p>\n<p>Their latest venture is a little more earnest, authentic and pared back, though. It‚Äôs billed as a traditional neighbourhood Korean barbecue restaurant, but it‚Äôs actually a little stranger and more homespun than that. While London restaurant investors might splurge tens of thousands of pounds on imported chandeliers, Dongnae uses Ikea-alike student bedsit paper lanterns in its two-store shopfront space, and has spent very little indeed on furniture, wallpaper and counters. Rather fittingly, in fact, it feels a bit as if you are <i>in</i> a student bedsit, only with Robertson doing the communal cooking every night.</p>\n<p>In keeping with this general aura, the menu itself is delicate, bespoke and thoughtful, too. Expect octopus and lamb fat <i>kkochi</i> (skewers), assorted punchy kimchis, hand-dived scallops, cockle and mussel bibimbap, and Korean beef tartare. Expect cold, bracing Korean soups and peculiar but unforgettable pond-green puddings ‚Äì but more of that later. At lunch, there is an √† la carte and a ¬£24 set menu and, at dinner, the option of a <i>hanjeongsik,</i> an omakase-style seven-course menu that changes daily, and offers a handpicked flurry of Korean loveliness.</p>\n<p>Dongnae is odd, unique and absolutely a roaring hit with Bristol‚Äôs diners. It may not be to everyone‚Äôs taste, especially if your only knowledge of Korean cooking is generous portions of Brit-pleasing scallion pancakes, bulgogi and, of course, bubbling sweetcorn in cheese sauce, all washed down with peach soju. Instead, here there are ginger old fashioneds, a low-intervention wine list, delicate servings of grilled monkfish with octopus alongside tiny bowls of seasoned seaweed or mustard leaf kimchi, and a very good raw sea bass <i>mulhwe</i> soup made with fresh sugar tomatoes. And if you get a bit lost trying to make head or tail of the menu, Dongnae‚Äôs staff will expertly guide you through it and explain the difference between your <i>naengcha</i><i>e</i> and your <i>naengguk</i>. Yes, <i>yukhoe</i> is like beef tartare, and here it comes with a mound of leaves, cucumber and radish, all designed to be rolled up in sheets of nori. Bowls of soft, glossy yellow tofu come festooned with whiffy grated bottarga, though the front of house couldn‚Äôt, of course, help me transfer it to my mouth when it evaded my attempts to capture it with the dainty chopsticks. We ate a hunk of hot grilled mackerel and cubes of wagyu that arrived on a cute little grill with generous <i>ssam</i> and sauces on the side.</p>\n<p><i>ever</i>tasted‚Äô: Dongnae‚Äôs mugwort and black sesame cake.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/17/dongnae-bristol-grace-dent-restaurant-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In the photograph, chef Locatelli, with his flowing, silver locks and impish expression, has himself the look of a Renaissance-era mover and shaker. Great art meets great art, it seems to say. Come for the <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/michelangelo-the-entombment-or-christ-being-carried-to-his-tomb\">The Entombment</a> by Michelangelo in Room 2 on Level 2 and stay for the orecchiette with nettle pesto on the first-floor mezzanine next to the gift shop. Or even just for a coffee and a cake at <a href=\"https://locatelliatnationalgallery.co.uk/bar-giorgio/\">Bar Giorgio</a>, which is really just a coffee stand in the entrance hall that serves Locatelli‚Äôs chantilly cream-filled brioche buns for ¬£7 a pop.</p>\n<p>Locatelli‚Äôs new arty venture is in partnership with the catering company <a href=\"https://searcys.co.uk/\">Searcys</a>, which controls the dining offering at a number of large, unwieldy venues ‚Äì the Gherkin, the Barbican and Battersea power station, to name just a few ‚Äì as well as vast hangars in Pall Mall, Westminster and farther afield. This is an outfit that specialises in posh-ish experiences in mega-high-footfall sweet spots.</p>\n<p>The National Gallery, especially in summer, is a far cry from Locatelli‚Äôs much-famed, Michelin-starred restaurant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/jun/01/foodanddrink.shopping4\">Locanda Locatelli</a>, where small portions of pricey pasta, drilled service and twinkly lighting <a href=\"https://www.locandalocatelli.com/\">created</a> a charming ambience. So charming, in fact, that after your <i>linguine</i><i> all‚Äôastice</i> or <i>strozzapreti al pomodoro</i>, you could almost forgive a bill that felt a bit like being run over by a Piaggio scooter on Piazza Venezia in Rome.</p>\n<p>Locatelli‚Äôs skill at creating ambience is being tested at the National Gallery, especially at the moment, when school‚Äôs out for summer and this elegant, echoey gallery that‚Äôs packed with old masters is overtaken by quacking hordes of crepe paper- and crayon-wielding school trips from overseas. These children would rather be anywhere else but staring at <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/hans-holbein-the-younger-the-ambassadors\">The Ambassadors</a> by Holbein the Younger, and are probably busy giving each other dead arms while I pick at my burrata and panzanella antipasti.</p>\n<p>But here‚Äôs the thing: I liked Locatelli at the National Gallery <i>a lot</i>. Head chef <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/imma_winelee/\">Imma Savinelli</a> and general manager <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/costanzo_cappella_\">Costanzo Cappella</a>, who front this latest Locatelli venture, have pulled off something unique in this pretty space with its pistachio-coloured, velour banquettes, gold furnishings and cute dessert trolley that delivers large, fat slices of tiramisu. The place is dashingly handy for meeting friends, too, and has a big, serious horseshoe bar that serves gin sours, <a href=\"https://www.diffordsguide.com/cocktails/recipe/18/adonis\">adonises</a> and breakfast martinis.</p>\n<p>What‚Äôs more, the lunch menu is a million times more interesting than the usual museum or gallery scones and sandwich fare. Here, there is piping hot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jul/20/how-to-make-the-perfect-fritto-misto-recipe-felicity-cloake\">fritto misto</a>, a choice of five fresh pasta dishes, including, when we visited, a juicy bowl of delightfully pungent red gurnard with thick pappardelle, fresh tomato, almonds and black olives that was nothing short of delicious. Someone is actually cooking here, not cynically heating things up for tourists; other pastas on offer might include handmade braised veal tortellini dotted with a punchy gremolata and served in a parmesan sauce or calamarata with sea bream.</p>\n<p>Earlier, a small, warm, rustic loaf of potato-and-rosemary sourdough had appeared with a glug of very good olive oil for dipping, which we ate with a bowl of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/dec/09/vegan-giardiniera-italian-pickles-recipe-meera-sodha\">giardiniera</a> (pickled vegetables), including fennel and carrot. One of the highlights of lunch was a vegan offering, baked aubergine, roasted until soft but not decimated, dressed with a very good soy ‚Äúricotta‚Äù, sweet cherry tomatoes, toasted hazelnuts and basil pesto.</p>\n<p>From the mains, there was rib-eye with rocket pesto and pot-roast chicken with polenta, both of them served with potato <i>arrost</i><i>o</i>, should one see fit. The <i>contorni</i> section, however, is a bit limited ‚Äì there‚Äôs just those spuds, some green beans and a rocket salad ‚Äì and I chose badly from the dessert trolley with a Sicilian lemon tart that seemed slightly old and was not remotely zingy. We should have had another of those pricey chantilly cream buns.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/10/locatelli-at-the-national-gallery-london-grace-dent-restaurant-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

To make this a grownup rather than a nursery dinner, serve with lemon-and-paprika-spiked chard, or spinach or kale, if that‚Äôs what you have; I am growing a surfeit of chard, so I always need new ways to use it up.</p>\n    <h2>Eggs in a basket with smoky chard</h2>\n    <p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>10 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>2 </strong><strong>(but scale up if you‚Äôre hungry)</strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>2 </strong>\n      <strong>tbsp olive oil\n  1 </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>garlic clove</strong>, peeled and finely sliced</p>\n    <p><strong>150g rainbow chard</strong>, roughly chopped</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>1</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>tsp hot smoked paprika<br/>1</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>1</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>tsp flaky sea salt</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong><br/>Juice of ¬Ω lemon</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Juice of ¬Ω lemon</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>2 large slices good</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>white bread or sourdough</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>\n        <br/>\n      </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>2 medium</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>eggs</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>50g</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>Greek yoghurt</strong>, to serve</p>\n    <p>Put a tablespoon of the oil in a large frying pan on a medium heat, add the garlicand fry for 30 seconds.

Season with a half-teaspoon of flaky sea salt and the lemon juice, then taste and add more salt as needed. Transfer the chard to a bowl and wipe out the pan with kitchen roll.</p>\n    <p>While the chard is cooking, use a round cutter to stamp out a circle from the centre of each slice of bread. Put the remaining oil in the now-empty chard pan on a medium heat, then lay in the bread (one slice at a time, if the pan‚Äôs not big enough for both) and its cut-out circle, too, if there‚Äôs room and fry for a minute just to get a little colour. Flip over, break an egg into the hole in the centre and fry for a minute or two, until the white is just set and the yolk runny; if you prefer your eggs over easy, by all means flip for 30 seconds to seal the other side.</p>\n    <p>Scatter each basket with a pinch of sea salt and serve with the smoky chard, fried bread circles and a big spoon of yoghurt alongside.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/08/eggs-in-a-basket-with-smoky-chard-recipe-rukmini-iyer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>There are a handful of moments on the culinary calendar that feel like striking gold: rhubarb in January, peas and broad beans in spring, summer cherries and tomatoes, and, for just a few short weeks in late-summer, figs. Typically, they might be torn over yoghurt and granola for breakfast or baked into a tart with frangipane, but they belong in the savoury kitchen, too. Combined with salt, savoury ingredients and a little vinegar, a good fig will bring a gorgeous sweet-sour note to your dinner table.</p>\n<h2>Polenta with sweet-and-sour figs and pecorino</h2>\n<p>As the warmer months come to an end, I like to cook with both comfort and freshness in mind. Rich, buttery, warming polenta is offset with a vibrant, bright, jammy topping of onions, rosemary and torn figs. Shave over some pecorino for a funky, savoury twang, and you‚Äôve got a dish that‚Äôll scratch that late-summer itch.</p>\n<p>Prep <strong>15 </strong><strong>min</strong> <br/>\n Cook <strong>45 </strong><strong>min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>4</strong></p>\n<p>For the polenta<strong>250ml whole milk\n  150g coarse cornmeal\n  30g butter</strong>For the sweet-and-sour figs</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Olive oil</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>2 red onions</strong>,</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>peeled and thinly sliced</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>(2-3 sprigs),<br/>10g rosemary</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>10g rosemary</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>leaves stripped and finely chopped</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>, to serve<br/>Sea salt and black pepper<br/>20g brown sugar<br/>20ml aged balsamic vinegar<br/>6-8 ripe figs<br/>Pecorino romano</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Sea salt and black pepper</p>\n<p>20g brown sugar</p>\n<p>20ml aged balsamic vinegar</p>\n<p>6-8 ripe figs</p>\n<p>Pecorino romano</p>\n<p>Put 600ml water and the milk in a pan, then whisk in the cornmeal. Set the pan over a medium heat and bring to a boil, whisking constantly. Turn down the heat to low and let it tick over, stirring every now and then ‚Äì if things start to get a bit too thick, add a splash of water to loosen. You don‚Äôt need to stand there whisking away the entire time; just check in on the polenta every five to 10 minutes, and give it a good stir.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, set a frying pan on a medium heat and add a shot of olive oil. Add the onions, half the rosemary and a pinch of salt, then toss in the warm oil and cook for 10-12 minutes, or until the onions are starting to caramelise. Add the sugar and vinegar, and continue cooking until the onions are jammy. Tear the figs in half, drop them into the pan, stir to coat, and finish with the remaining rosemary.</p>\n<p>Once the polenta has had 45 minutes or so in the pan, whisk in the butter. This is the moment to adjust the texture; I like my polenta gently to relax into the bowl. If it‚Äôs too thick, add a little water or milk; if it‚Äôs too thin, keep cooking. Spoon the polenta into warm bowls and top with the jammy onions. Use a mandoline or cheese grater to shave some pecorino over the top and serve.</p>\n<h2>Roast chicken legs with beans and figs</h2>\n<p>A chicken leg is, for my money, the ultimate midweek ingredient. With very little effort, it really sings and can be cooked with little hands-on time. This traybake uses slightly under-ripe figs, orange, fennel seeds and capers to create a chicken and bean dish that‚Äôll fly into your weekly rotation. When out of season, swap the figs for dried fruit such as apricots, dates or prunes.</p>\n<p>Prep <strong>10 </strong><strong>min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>1 hr 15 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>4</strong></p>\n<p><strong>4 skin-on, bone-in chicken legs</strong><strong>\n  Fine sea salt\n  3 onions</strong>,</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>peeled and cut into wedges</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>4 tbsp capers<br/>5 garlic cloves</strong>,</p>\n<p>5 garlic cloves</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>peeled, gently squashed with a knife, but left whole</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong><br/>Peeled zest of 1 orange</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Peeled zest of 1 orange</p>\n<p>\n      <strong><br/>1 tbsp fennel seeds<br/>Olive oil<br/>700g jar</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>1 tbsp fennel seeds</p>\n<p>Olive oil</p>\n<p>700g jar</p>\n<p><strong>cooked white beans</strong>,</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>not drained</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong><br/>6-8 slightly underripe figs<br/>2-3 tbsp sherry vinegar<br/>15g fresh oregano<br/>Extra-virgin olive oil<br/></strong>\n    </p>\n<p>6-8 slightly underripe figs</p>\n<p>2-3 tbsp sherry vinegar</p>\n<p>15g fresh oregano</p>\n<p>Extra-virgin olive oil</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/08/sweet-sour-fig-polenta-roast-chicken-recipes-ben-lippett\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Get the ratio of this three-tier national treasure wrong, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/12/world/canada/Nanaimo-Bar-Outrage-Canada.html\">as the New York Times stood accused</a> of doing in 2021, when its Instagram account posted a picture of squares that one user described as ‚Äúan insult to Canadians everywhere‚Äù, and you‚Äôll discover you can push them only so far.</p>\n<p>The Times is not alone in attracting ire. So popular are nanaimo (pronounced nuh-NYE-mo) bars, named after the British Columbian town where they are said to have originated, that Canada Post put them on a stamp in 2019 ‚Ä¶ only to face similar <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/nanaimo-bar-canada-post-stamp-controversy-1.5116981\">howls of outrage</a>, albeit in Canadian: ‚ÄúOne hesitates to be critical,‚Äù Nanaimo‚Äôs mayor explained carefully, ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs not a very accurate depiction.‚Äù</p>\n<p>In short, Canadians, who in 2006 voted the nanaimo bar the ‚Äúnation‚Äôs favourite confection‚Äù, feel very strongly about these sugary little treats, a mainstay of kids‚Äô birthday parties, wedding buffets and funeral teas from Nanaimo to Nova Scotia, though if Justin Trudeau had any problem with <a href=\"https://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/nanaimo-bars-served-at-white-house-state-dinner-1036082\">the version served up</a> by White House chefs during his state dinner with Barack Obama in 2016, he was too polite to say so. Please don‚Äôt hold back in the comments below ‚Äì I‚Äôm British, I can take it.</p>\n<h2>The base</h2>\n<p>Before I tasted a nanaimo bar, I had assumed that the base, whose principal ingredients are biscuit and desiccated coconut, was the kind of crunchy affair usually found on the bottom of cheesecakes. I was wrong. With the exception of the Canadian Living recipe, which sticks it in the oven for 10 minutes to dry it out, the nanaimo relies on the coagulating power of refrigeration, rather than on heat.</p>\n<p>Revelation two: instead of the large lumps of biscuit suspended in chocolate that one might expect in a British fridge cake, this base is made from fine crumbs soaked in sweet, cocoa-flavoured butter, giving it a soft, almost squidgy texture. Once I‚Äôve come to terms with this fact (I do love a crunchy base), I need to decide the best replacement for the graham cracker crumbs demanded by Canadian recipes. Graham (pronounced ‚Äúgram‚Äù) crackers, are a peculiarly North American phenomenon named after what <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/graham-cracker\">the Encyclopedia Britannica describes</a> as the ‚Äúeccentric ‚Ä¶ clergyman and health reformer‚Äù Sylvester Graham, who travelled around early 19th-century New England warning against the dangers of lust, as incited by, among other things, refined sugars and grains. His unsweetened, fatless crackers were made from coarsely ground wholemeal wheat flour. Modern equivalents, Britannica explains, ‚Äúwould likely be unrecognisable to Graham, as they are typically made with refined white flour, sugar and trans fats, and are flavoured with honey or cinnamon; chocolate varieties are also common‚Äù.</p>\n<p>They are also ¬£18 a box online, excluding delivery, which means they will not feature in my recipe, though I do buy a bag of graham cracker crumbs to try to work out the nearest equivalent. To my surprise, they‚Äôre a fine, if slightly gritty powder, rather than a crumb, with a flavour somewhere between a British digestive and a rich tea biscuit. The original texture feels somewhat irrelevant, so, having given rich tea, digestives and Hobnobs (<a href=\"https://cupcakejemma.com/products/nanaimo-bars-downloadable-recipe?srsltid=AfmBOopWvGERzAI6qMO7ybrFSofUsqjgIc79Q-W9amwyRzVaWFYKHYnM\">a suggestion </a>from the Cupcake Jemma team here in the UK) a try, I conclude that you should go with whichever takes your fancy. Personally, I enjoy the more restrained sweetness of a rich tea, but you might yearn for the oaty nubbliness of a Hobnob or the more malty flavour of a digestive. That said, I‚Äôve deliberately left in a few larger chunks to give the base a more interesting texture, which may be offensive to nanaimo purists ‚Äì in which case, keep whizzing.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/07/how-to-make-perfect-nanaimo-bars-recipe-felicity-cloake\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

To be fair, my use of the word ‚Äúprecinct‚Äù to describe this lovingly titivated landmark feels a bit shabby, as does ‚Äúretail experience‚Äù. And plain old ‚Äúmall‚Äù definitely won‚Äôt do, because Battersea‚Äôs collection of 150-odd shops is very much in the la-di-da, aspirational, lululemon, Mulberry and Malin+Goetz range of money-frittering, all set over multiple floors with dramatic mezzanines. This is a sumptuous paean to industrial chic, with pleasing air-conditioning and polished floors, and there is currently no more jocund and luxurious a place in London to spend money you don‚Äôt have on things you don‚Äôt need.</p>\n<p><i>har gau</i>prawn dumplings.</p>\n<p>In keeping with all this luxury, Battersea‚Äôs flagship restaurant right now is the new Duck &amp; Rice, created 10 years ago by the renowned Hong Kong-born British restaurateur <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2004/dec/05/foodanddrink.features6\">Alan Yau OBE</a>, who also founded the likes of <a href=\"https://www.wagamama.com/\">Wagamama</a>, <a href=\"https://taogroup.com/venues/yauatcha/\">Yauatcha</a> and <a href=\"https://taogroup.com/venues/hakkasan/\">Hakkasan</a>. The original Duck &amp; Rice‚Äôs claim was that it was a Chinese gastropub, which, to my mind, confused it as a brand. Yes, it is indeed housed in a former pub on Berwick Street, but at the time it felt more like a very modern Cantonese restaurant that served roast duck, dim sum, ‚Äúsmall chow‚Äù and wok dishes, most of them around the ¬£10-¬£15 mark, as well as so-called ‚Äúhero dishes‚Äù such as lobster laksa for ¬£72. Yes, they sell Pilsner Urquell, which in 2015 was very gastropub-ish, but they also offer an array of lychee, chilli and blue cura√ßao cocktails, which is, well, a bit Ritzy‚Äôs nightclub.</p>\n<p>At the new Duck &amp; Rice Battersea, however, they have ¬£415 bottles of Vega Sicilia, which isn‚Äôt at all gastropub, and much more quaffing an oligarch‚Äôs cellar with George Osborne while celebrating the glorious 12th. This is made all the more peculiar by the fact that you‚Äôre indulging in such pompery at a restaurant that has the dystopian address of ‚ÄúUnit L1-003, Level 1, Phase 2‚Äù, and that‚Äôs next door to a champagne bar called <a href=\"https://batterseapowerstation.co.uk/retailers/control-room-b/\">Control Room B</a>.</p>\n<p>Even so, I find the Duck &amp; Rice Battersea fascinating, not least because the great British public are, in 2025, still yet to fully submit to spending big money on important dinners inside shopping centres. The food courts of Westfield, the <a href=\"https://traffordcentre.co.uk/\">Trafford Centre</a> and so on are swamped with all manner of casual dining options, but for important anniversaries and birthday dinners, we still lean towards bricks and mortar down the high street or, even better, in some bucolic setting or other.</p>\n<p>Yet here is a restaurant in Battersea power station, just along the way from a pilates studio and a luxury gilet shop, that isn‚Äôt really your typical bowl-of-noodles stopgap joint. When we arrived on a Tuesday lunchtime, we were to start with the only guests, but there were 22 cooks in the kitchen, three bartenders and four floor staff. This is a gargantuan space with little about it to love. Still, a round of plump, voluptuous, wobbly fresh <i> har gau</i>, stuffed to nigh bursting with shrimp, were delicious, as was a plate of venison puffs where crisp, warm, buttery pastry meets rich, long-stewed meat. A ‚ÄúDuck old fashioned‚Äù with Volc√°n de mi Tierra tequila and Mozart dark chocolate liqueur was punchy, even if it rather ripped up the rulebook of what an old fashioned should be.</p>\n<p>For mains, we ordered the classic duck and rice house special, a vegan option of glass noodles with tofu mince and a wildcard Indonesian dish of Assam chilli prawns. After they appeared, however, we entered what I call the ‚Äúservice Siberia‚Äù stage of a meal, when no server speaks to or looks at us ever again. Those main courses were filling, but largely unmemorable: ¬£25 for a glossy, crispy, medium-rare fillet of duck laid across white rice with a bit of cucumber, and tofu noodles that could really have done with more oomph, heat and spark; the whopping great chilli king prawns, on the other hand, were possibly the highlight of the meal: fiery as heck, and in a fragrant pool of bright red, tamarind-heavy sauce.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/07/the-duck-rice-london-sw11-grace-dent-restaurant-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Some had that familiar, synthetic margarine smell, while others really surprised me. Butter obviously wins for its richness and depth of flavour, but some plant-based options are unexpectedly good.

Fully recyclable packaging and minimal additives give this strong sustainability and health credentials, but its soft texture may not suit those seeking a firmer butter alternative.</p>\n<h2><i>Best bargain</i><i>:</i><i><br/></i>Flora original spread</h2>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iceland.co.uk%2Fp%2Fflora-original-butter-alternative-with-natural-ingredients-450g%2F8185.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/06/best-plant-based-spreads-tasted-rated\">¬£1.75 for 450g at Iceland (39p/100g)</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgroceries.morrisons.com%2Fproducts%2Fflora-original-spread-with-natural-ingredients%2F112702171&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/06/best-plant-based-spreads-tasted-rated\">¬£2.65 for 450g at Morrisons (59p/100g)</a>\n    </p>\n<p>‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ</p>\n<p>Its rich, buttermilk-yellow colour and firm texture give this a butter-like feel; it melts beautifully on toast, too.

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Bon App√©tit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>Anyone who has made (or tasted) food editor Shilpa Uskokovic‚Äôs <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/perfect-pie-crust\">Perfect Pie Crust recipe</a> can agree that it is, indeed, actually perfect. But sometimes we want to bake a pie right this second. Other times, there‚Äôs enough going on‚Äîsuch as when hosting Thanksgiving, a barbecue, or brunch‚Äîand preparing <i>one. more. thing.</i> is just too much. That‚Äôs when store-bought pie crust comes in clutch.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, not all premade pie crusts are created equal. For every prepared crust that comes out golden and delicately flaky, there‚Äôs another that‚Äôll never be anything but gray and soggy. That‚Äôs why we put six premade pie doughs (both frozen and refrigerated) through a blind taste test to find the best store-bought pie crust around.</p>\n<h2>How we evaluated</h2>\n<p>To determine our winner, we considered several key factors: First, flakiness; we want to see thin, crackling layers that provide a demure crunch in each bite. The best grocery store pie crust should bake up golden brown, avoid soggy bottoms at all costs, and minimize the layer of squidginess between filling and crust. It should be hardy enough to support the weight of its filling, and, finally, it should be easy-peasy to work with.</p>\n<h2>How we tested</h2>\n<p>To test our six pie crusts, we blind-baked each according to the package instructions, then filled the prepared pie crusts with <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/best-pumpkin-pie\">BA‚Äôs Best Pumpkin Pie</a> filling to finish baking. What followed was a nitpicking, photo finish of a taste test.</p>\n<h2>Honorable mention: Wholly Wholesome</h2>\n<p>There was a moment of silence as our tasters scrutinized Wholly Wholesome‚Äôs flakiness and overall appeal. What they found was a solid contender. Associate newsletter editor Li Goldstein described it as ‚Äúvery natural tasting,‚Äù if not buttery, and Carly Westerfield described it as ‚Äústurdy.‚Äù That checked two of our boxes. A quick peek at the crust-to-filling barrier revealed minimal squidginess.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, trouble arose before we even slid the pie into the oven. The pre-rolled dough had an irregular thickness, resulting in uneven baking. The crust slumped so dramatically during blind baking that we wondered if there would be enough room for the filling (fortunately, there was). Although the crust was delicious, we can only recommend it with reservations‚Äîbe sure to par-bake it filled to the brim with beans or <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/best-pie-weights-are-ball-bearings\">other pie weights</a> and consider chilling it in the freezer for 10‚Äì15 minutes before transferring it to the oven.</p>\n<p><strong>We‚Äôd love it in:</strong> Due to the tendency to slump during the baking process, we prefer Wholly Wholesome‚Äôs dough for <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/slideshow/galette-recipes\">galettes</a>, where the edges work <i>with</i> gravity to secure their fruit fillings. The hearty base will help it withstand any juices released while in the oven.</p>\n<h2>First runner-up: Happy Belly</h2>\n<p>Previously sold under the Happy Belly brand of Amazon products, this pie dough (which is now branded Amazon Fresh) uses bleached flour in its pie crust recipe. As we‚Äôve written about before, using <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/bleached-vs-unbleached-flour\">bleached flour (as opposed to unbleached)</a> has a significant impact on the final texture of a baked good. The former absorbs more fat and sugar, typically resulting in a more tender crust.</p>\n<p>That said, the color of this crust left a little to be desired: Instead of the shiny golden brown we were hoping for, Happy Belly‚Äôs pie crust was a dull grayish yellow. Testers agreed color wasn‚Äôt the <i>most</i> essential factor for a pie crust, but in a blind taste test like this, everything counts. And so Happy Belly took second place.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it won us over:</strong> Each nibble on Happy Belly‚Äôs pie crust gave us something new to love. Was it flaky? You bet it was. Thin and crispy layers shattered with each bite. Did it taste buttery? Absolutely. We loved its rich, mellow flavor. Was it sturdy? Sure.</p>\n<p><strong>We‚Äôd love it in:</strong> Savory preparations play up this crust‚Äôs buttery flavor. Drape a sheet of it over a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/one-skillet-rotisserie-chicken-pot-pie\">skillet chicken pot pie</a> (a layer of egg wash brushed over the top crust will help remedy the gray undertone) or crimp it into a bottom crust for <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/broccoli-and-cheese-quiche\">cheesy broccoli quiche</a>.</p>\n<h2>The best store-bought pie crust: Kroger</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-prepared-pie-crust\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It gives us such an amazing opportunity to grab inspiration and then bring it home,\" says Broomfield, a model, philanthropist, and former NCAA tennis champion. \"We aren't home very often, but when we are, we always focus on trying to carve out time for friends and family, and we love hosting guests and making them feel special.\"</p>\n<p>When it comes to entertaining, Broomfield and Tiafoe, who's currently ranked 17th in men's singles and was a 2024 US Open semi-finalist (and is off to a strong start at this year's tournament!), are the perfect match. \"Frances is more of the guest-list creator, and he creates the vibe,\" says Broomfield. \"He can bring people from different backgrounds and different jobs together and has a really great way of making everyone feel very comfortable.\"</p>\n<p>Broomfield, for her part, uses her impeccable sense of style to steer the vision for the event. \"Hosting is where I'm able to show my creativity.

Top of their list was a bar cart. \"I think everything's much better when you have a couple drinks in your hand,\" jokes Tiafoe.</p>\n<p>The couple chose a gold Art Deco‚Äìinspired cart with two tiers‚Äîwhich means plenty of room for spirits (Grey Goose is a favorite), garnishes, and bar tools.</p>\n<h2>Timeless martini glasses</h2>\n<p>Tiafoe says he likes to make drinks on demand for his guests so that he can tailor each one to their taste. \"I make them one at a time. I've never really done the pitcher [of batched cocktails] thing,\" he says.</p>\n<p>\"That goes back to what I was saying about Frances being an amazing host,\" adds Broomfield. \"He really tries to personalize each person's beverage.\"</p>\n<h2>Candles for ambience</h2>\n<p>Broomfield says that she and Tiafoe will light candles when they're on the road to \"make it feel like home.\" \"And when we're hosting, I think candles definitely pull things together and set the vibe for the night we want,\" she adds.</p>\n<p>This Jo Malone candle that Broomfield recommends balances delicate floral notes with suede. Online reviews say the scent is mild, which means it won't fight with any delicious cooking smells wafting from the kitchen during your dinner party.</p>\n<h2>Curated table settings</h2>\n<p>\"I'm definitely a sucker for decor,\" says Broomfield, who picked out this neutral fringe table runner from Pottery Barn as a great foundation for your tablescape. \"I'll go into a home decor store‚Äîanywhere from Home Goods to Restoration Hardware‚Äîwith my friends looking for one specific thing, and I'll end up coming out with a million different products and forget what I went in there for.\"</p>\n<h2>Le Creuset Dutch oven</h2>\n<p>Both Tiafoe and Broomfield love to draw cooking inspiration from their family heritages. \"Frances has really strong West African roots, so I'll reach out to his mom and see if there's a specific recipe that she can share and that we can put our own twist on,\" says Broomfield. \"I once tried to recreate her peanut butter stew for some people we had over.\" (Tiafoe's verdict: \"Not too bad!\")</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/frances-tiafoe-ayan-broomfield-entertaining-must-haves\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We kept bracing for the screaming motor when we dropped in a full apple, but it just kind of‚Ä¶purred? Even when we loaded it up with hardcore ingredients (which are recommended to be layered on top of softer ingredients, by the way) like carrots, beets, and kale, it powered through almost silently.</p>\n<p>We especially love the giant hopper, because you can throw in big chunks (no endless chopping!) and walk away while it juices. There‚Äôs a smaller hopper on the lid that allows you to continuously load fruits and veggies while it‚Äôs on, or you can pop off the whole lid (the juicer will pause), reload, and let it pulse.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-juicers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>There are many luxuries in a pro tennis star‚Äôs life‚Äîfree time is not one of them. Twenty-one-year-old Coco Gauff, who won her second Grand Slam title this year and is currently the number 3 ranked female tennis player in the world, savors those <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/slideshow/30-minute-dinner-ideas\">morsels of time</a> by connecting with friends and family, watching movies, and, when she can, honing her skills in the kitchen.</p>\n<p>Since moving out of her parents house and into her own place last year, Gauff has been sharing her cooking journey with fans on TikTok and Instagram, documenting her successes and flops in stride. ‚ÄúYou know, it‚Äôs been up and down,‚Äù Gauff says. ‚ÄúI go through some weeks where I‚Äôm an Uber Eats girlie, and then I go through some weeks where I‚Äôm actually cooking and trying new recipes. I‚Äôm not a to-taste cook, I have to follow the recipe down to the T.‚Äù</p>\n<p>While Gauff is a savvy social media native, her cooking videos are candid and unpretentious. It‚Äôs less <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@naraazizasmith/video/7432790396587085099?lang=en\"> Nara-Smith-whipping-up-homemade-Spaghetti-O‚Äôs</a> and more </p>\n<p><i>friend-on-FaceTime-making-dinner.</i>Some of her culinary ventures include a</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@cocogauff/video/7445009517655575854\">creamy Turkish pasta</a>,</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@cocogauff/video/7447212676410789163\">homemade chicken tenders with Texas toast</a>, and</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@cocogauff/video/7442042722694778143\">sweet potato pie and banana bread</a>for a Cousinsgiving celebration. And now she‚Äôs teamed up with Naked Smoothies to create a signature pineapple-and-orange-flavored protein smoothie set to hit store shelves this fall.</p>\n<p>This content can also be viewed on the site it <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@cocogauff/video/7447212676410789163\">originates</a> from.</p>\n<p>We caught up with Gauff ahead of the US Open to talk a little bit more about her burgeoning culinary journey. She shared with us some of her go-to cooking tools and ingredients, the food that filled her dinner table growing up, and how she gets the nutrition she needs to power long matches and a hectic touring schedule.</p>\n<p>When she was growing up, Gauff‚Äôs Louisiana-born father was the cook of the family, so classics like <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/red-beans-and-rice-recipe\">red beans and rice</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/chicken-sausage-gumbo\">gumbo</a> were in regular rotation for dinner. ‚ÄúBasically anything Southern reminds me of home,‚Äù Gauff says. Naturally, Louisiana hot sauce also found its way to the table. ‚ÄúI would love to try more local Louisiana hot sauces, but I really love Crystal.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Pasta has been essential pre-match fuel for Gauff since the beginning of her tennis career and is a staple of her on-the-road diet. When she's home, Gauff says, she tries to experiment with new recipes‚Äîbut it‚Äôs hard to resist the pull of a one-pot meal when you‚Äôre short on time and energy. \"Pasta‚Äôs one of the easier things to cook, so I do find myself gravitating toward that,‚Äù Gauff says.</p>\n<p>To keep things interesting, she mixes up her pasta shapes and sauces. ‚ÄúFor <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/homemade-basil-pesto\">pesto</a> I like to use longer pasta like spaghetti,‚Äù Gauff says. ‚ÄúBut whenever I‚Äôm doing a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/easy-baked-rigatoni-with-italian-sausage\">spicier dish, I like rigatoni</a>.‚Äù</p>\n<p>According to Gauff, Naked originally approached her about a partnership after her mid-match fruit salads went viral back in 2023. ‚ÄúAt first I thought they were joking,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúBut they were like, ‚ÄòNo, we really want you!‚Äô‚Äù</p>\n<p>Gauff worked with the company to come up with a smoothie that would meet her needs on the court. It features pineapple, orange juice, and coconut water and includes 20 grams of protein. ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm an athlete, trying to sneak in that protein when I can is super important for me,‚Äù she adds. (Unfortunately, you‚Äôll have to wait a little longer to try <a href=\"https://www.nakedsmoothie.com/our-products/protein/coco-gauff\">Gauff‚Äôs signature smoothie</a> for yourself as it launches this fall.)</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI would say I‚Äôm definitely your average Gen Z‚Äôer in that I‚Äôm obsessed with the <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-air-fryers-reviewed\">air fryer</a>,‚Äù Gauff says. Hers makes regular appearances in her cooking content, and considering it‚Äôs the preeminent appliance for fast and convenient cooking in this day and age, it‚Äôs a natural fit for a busy athlete. Gauff uses hers for way more than frozen french fries. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll cook an egg on the stove and then put it on top of toast, avocado, and cheese and then put it in the air fryer,‚Äù Gauff says. ‚ÄúIt comes out as a nice little breakfast sandwich.‚Äù</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/coco-gauff-kitchen-must-haves\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Whether you want a simple shot of espresso or a chilled glass of velvety nitro coffee, we found the best coffee makers to suit your needs and budget.</p>\n<h2>Types of coffee makers</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Drip coffee maker</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-drip-coffee-makers\">Drip coffee machines</a>, which typically require little effort, mainly consist of three parts: a water tank, a basket for coffee grounds, and a thermal or glass carafe. Though drip coffee makers come in simple and high-tech versions, their basic functions are the same: The machine heats water, which rains down from a showerhead, saturates the coffee grounds, and drips coffee into a carafe or cup. The best drip coffee makers take into account factors that can extract the best flavor, like water temperature, flow rate, and the bloom time, when carbon dioxide, which can make coffee taste bitter, is released from the grounds.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Espresso machine</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/fellow-espresso-series-one-review\">Espresso machines</a> come in a wide variety of prices and an even wider variety of models. Semiautomatic machines have the same basic layout‚Äîa portafilter basket for pulling a single or double shot, a steam wand for frothing milk, and a hot water dispenser‚Äîbut differ in the quality of their build, their heating mechanisms, and their pumps.</p>\n<p>Superautomatic machines can make espressos, macchiatos, Americanos, and more specialty drinks with the touch of a button. They grind, tamp and brew for you automatically.</p>\n<p>Whether you opt for a manual machine or one that does all the work for you, keep in mind that the best espresso machines should always produce a hot flavorful shot topped with a rich layer of crema.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Pour-over coffee maker</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Pour-over coffee makers, usually cones that sit atop cups or carafes √† la Chemex, utilize a precise pouring technique (ideally from <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/fellow-stagg-ekg-pro-review\">a gooseneck kettle</a>) that blooms the grounds and extracts the best flavors as the coffee drips into the vessel below. Making pour over coffee manually isn‚Äôt the fastest, but it is the best if you care about customizing the flavor of your coffee just so.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Single-serve coffee maker</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/nespresso-vs-keurig\">Pod machines</a> are one of the most popular forms of single-serve coffee makers, but more and more drip machines also offer single-serve capabilities. Pod machines typically offer more drink choices than drip machines, letting you make coffee in different strengths and flavors, espresso(ish), iced coffee, cold brew, and even matcha. Whatever beverage you fancy, the best single-serve coffee makers should make it effortless to prepare and full of flavor.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>French press</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-coffee-makers-of-all-kinds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

One of the world‚Äôs premiere sporting events and the final Grand Slam tournament of the year, the championship takes place annually over the two weeks that straddle Labor Day in New York City.</p>\n<p>If it‚Äôs your first time navigating this tournament, get a Grounds Pass or day session ticket to either of the big stadiums (Arthur Ashe or Louis Armstrong) during the first week. That way you can roam the whole center day and night, catching matches on the smaller outdoor courts as well as the larger enclosed venues. You can often see really good players up close and personal‚Äîlike the time a doubles-playing <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/stefanostsitsipas98/?hl=en\">Stefanos Tsisipas</a> nearly tumbled out of the court while lunging for a ball, his sweaty ringlets brushing the people in the front row.</p>\n<p>Avoid the lunchtime crush at the Food Village, where queues for popular items like <a href=\"https://eatfuku.com/\">Fuku</a>‚Äôs fried chicken sandwich can make you lose precious time chasing down matches. At night, this area, the longest stretch of food vendors along a centrally located picnic area, clears up substantially. Otherwise, there are plenty of food vendors inside the big stadiums and plenty of breaks to grab a bite and get back to your seat.</p>\n<p>So what should you fill up on? Here are our tips.</p>\n<h2>Where can you get a good hot dog at the US Open?</h2>\n<p>It‚Äôs not a sporting event‚Äîand it‚Äôs not New York City‚Äîwithout a good hot dog, and the US Open does not disappoint. Two vendors, Franks &amp; Fries and Franks &amp; Sausages, serve up a foot-long dog, with or without sauerkraut, so you won‚Äôt have to leave your seat for a while.</p>\n<h2>Best bang for your $20?</h2>\n<p>Food is expensive at the US Open. But for less than $20 you can get an exemplary basket of chicken tenders with seasoned waffle fries from the no-name vendor at Louis Armstrong Stadium, Grand Slam Grill, perhaps the best value of the tournament.</p>\n<h2>After you‚Äôve had your first Honey Deuce, what should you drink next?</h2>\n<p>Keeping melon ballers out of garage sale bins since 2006, the <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/honey-deuce-recipe-tools\">Honey Deuce</a> is the US Open‚Äôs signature cocktail. But pace yourself! Attending this tournament is an endurance sport, so stay hydrated (bring a non-glass water bottle to fill up at fountains). And stay alert by visiting a Lavazza tent for a creamy, earthy cold brew to lift you from the afternoon doldrums.</p>\n<h2>Most healthyish meal?</h2>\n<p>Between burgers and barbecue, pastrami and souvlaki, there‚Äôs a lot of gut-busting food options at the Open. If you‚Äôre looking to avoid the meat sweats, head to Korilla BBQ for a tofu rice bowl, which comes with kimchi, corn and kale, and your choice of two sauces squiggled on top.</p>\n<h2>Best portable bite?</h2>\n<p>Trying to get from the Grandstand to Court 17 while grabbing a bite? Skip the sloppy sandwiches and grab a neatly wrapped Mission-style burrito filled with pollo asado or veggies from Dos Toros.</p>\n<h2>Sweetest way to cool off?</h2>\n<p>Grab an ice cream bar from a Van Leeuwen cart rather than waiting in line for a scoop at the vendor‚Äôs Food Village stand. You‚Äôll find two or three flavors like Toffee Brown Sugar, Vanilla Caramel Swirl and Vegan Wildberry‚Äîthe perfect way to cap off a hot day in the sun.</p>\n<h2>Where to get a splurgy sit-down meal?</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/where-to-eat-us-open\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Bon App√©tit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>The OG <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-meal-delivery-services\">meal kit</a> giant, Blue Apron, is still innovating in the world of home-cooking-meets-delivery. This month, the company unveiled a shiny new rebrand that includes a refreshed ordering experience and a business model geared toward busy people (or at least people who don‚Äôt want to cook all the time‚Äîwhich, same).</p>\n<p>The brand is doing away with the subscription model it pioneered in the meal kit space. You can still save a few bucks by opting into autoshipping if you want the familiar set-it-and-forget-it approach, but for those of us who just want a few meals here and there when things get hectic, Blue Apron won‚Äôt lock you into any long-term commitments.</p>\n<p>The options have also expanded. The menu now includes over 100 weekly meals, with 75 that are further customizable (you can swap shrimp for salmon or ground beef for pork, for example). There are also more <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-prepared-meal-delivery-services\">heat-and-eat prepared options</a> for people who want to do as little cooking as possible.</p>\n<p>I tried the new Blue Apron model. Here‚Äôs what I thought.</p>\n<h2>What‚Äôs the Blue Apron ordering experience?</h2>\n<p>Instead of going through a lengthy sign-up flow that requires personal details like your email, zip code, food preferences, and allergies, new and existing customers are directed straight to the weekly menu to select meals. Like shopping for a new back-to-school wardrobe, you simply scroll through the options and add whatever catches your eye to your cart.</p>\n<p>There are now three types of Blue Apron meals:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Assemble and Bake</strong>, which require less prep work and fewer dishes than a traditional meal kit (the meal is often cooked in a foil baking dish that comes in your delivery).</li>\n      <li><strong>Dish</strong>, which are entirely premade and just need to be heated in the microwave or oven.</li>\n      <li><strong>Meal Kits</strong>, i.e., Blue Apron‚Äôs original bread and butter. Think recipe cards and preportioned ingredients. You‚Äôll need to chop veggies and spend some time at the stove.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Since there are no plans or subscriptions, you‚Äôre free to select as many meals from each category as you‚Äôd like.</p>\n<p>While I appreciate this flexibility, I was a little overwhelmed by the expansive menu. Currently, you can only filter the meals by cooking time (5, 15, 30, 45, and 60-plus minutes) and protein type. I‚Äôd love to see filters for allergens or other dietary preferences.</p>\n<p>In addition to full meals, you can also order bottled, premixed smoothies and extra proteins √† la carte, most of which are raw.</p>\n<p>Each item is priced per serving, and Assemble and Bake and Meal Kits can be ordered for two or four people. Dish meals each serve one. Per-serving prices range from $6.99 (a pork and sausage breakfast burrito) to $13.49 (a meal kit of Bacon Gouda Prime Beef Burgers with BBQ Mayo and Arugula Salad). Autoshipping saves you 5% per box. There‚Äôs a $35 order minimum, and standard shipping costs $9.99.</p>\n<h2>What to expect in a Blue Apron box</h2>\n<p>After you place an order, Blue Apron keeps you in the loop with plenty of emails and texts. I ordered in August, and my boxes arrived sufficiently packed with ice packs. Everything was cold, and the raw proteins were kept at the bottom of the box in direct contact with the ice.</p>\n<p>Dish meals arrive in labeled plastic trays, while Assemble and Bake and Meal Kits come in labeled clear plastic bags filled with ingredients. There‚Äôs no way around it: If you‚Äôre doing any amount of prep or cooking with Blue Apron, these meals will fill your trash can with packets, trays, and tiny plastic bags‚Äînot to mention the giant ice packs and cardboard boxes.</p>\n<h2>What I liked about Blue Apron</h2>\n<h3>Meal Kits</h3>\n<p>I sampled the <a href=\"https://www.blueapron.com/recipes/chili-crisp-beef-bao-buns?srsltid=AfmBOorl50yhwph5iXLpXd-YQvU9SS7x-Qy6LqHtR4CYm66SD3Q_-U4B\">Chili Crisp Beef Bao Buns Meal Kit</a>, which is billed as a 25-to-35-minute endeavor. It was involved but not stressful. The buns arrived premade and just needed warming. My tasks included searing shishito peppers, slicing a cucumber for a quick pickle, mixing a three-ingredient spicy hoisin mayo, and shaping and cooking beef patties to fill the buns.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/blue-apron-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But it is also a detriment to your cooking. Sharp knives make quick work of food prep, and clean cuts mean vegetables cook more evenly and proteins aren‚Äôt mangled when they hit the plate.</p>\n<p>All knives need to be sharpened over time to maintain their usability, but some knives require more frequent sharpening. <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-much-should-you-spend-on-a-kitchen-knife\">Carbon-steel knives tend to hold their edge longer than stainless-steel or high-carbon stainless-steel knives.</a> They also tend to be more expensive. If you have a collection of high-end carbon-steel cutlery, we recommend you learn how to use a whetstone or have your knives sharpened professionally for at least biannual sharpening.</p>\n<p>If you have stainless-steel knives, which are much more common in home kitchens, they will need more frequent sharpening, and an automatic sharpener can make the process smooth, easy, and fast. But you do need to remember that automatic grinders can take more material off your knife blade than a whetstone and wear them down over time.</p>\n<p>In any case, there is a good chance that if you‚Äôre reading this, you need to sharpen your knives more often than you currently do, and the picks below are some great options to help keep your knives in tip-top shape whether you‚Äôre a more casual cook or the owner of a high-end single bevel blade.</p>\n<h2>The best electric knife sharpener overall: Chef‚Äôs Choice 15 Trizor XV EdgeSelect Professional Knife Sharpener</h2>\n<p>Pros and cons</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Pros</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Can sharpen single bevel knives</li>\n      <li>Sharpens to 15¬∫ angle</li>\n      <li>Can sharpen, hone, and polish with a strop disc</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <strong>Cons</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Does not have adjustable angle guide</li>\n      <li>Takes practice for beginners</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>The Trizor‚Äôs ability to safely reshape and revitalize a knife‚Äôs blade will put even the most cautious knife owner at ease.</p>\n<p><strong>What we love:</strong> With slots for three different stages, the Trizor can sharpen, hone, and polish any kitchen knife you bring to it. Unlike a whetstone or a pull-through sharpener, where the knife runs along the edge of a static medium, the Trizor uses a motor to spin each of its discs to better mimic a grinding belt used by sharpening professionals.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-knife-sharpeners\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Now at farmers markets and grocery stores across the country, typically from September to December, the honeynut squash as we know it was released around 2009 as a collaboration between the Plant Breeding and Genetics department at Cornell University and chef Dan Barber‚Äôs team at the upstate New York restaurant <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/honeynut-squash-history\">Blue Hill at Stone Barns</a>. Their dream was a shrunken, single-serve butternut squash that needs little more than a high-heat roast to become absurdly delicious. This recipe starts there‚Äîthen adds some creamy, tangy, spicy toppings to gild the lily.</p>\n    <p>In 30 minutes, the squashes emerge from the oven tender and browned, with little cups (where the seeds used to be) waiting to be filled. The answer here‚Äîas it is with cantaloupe halves for some people, you know who you are‚Äîis cottage cheese. Now is the time to get the good stuff. Our test kitchen is devoted to <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-cottage-cheese-good-culture\">Good Culture</a>, but if you can‚Äôt find that brand or another high-quality, whole-milk version, swap in another dairy, like plain Greek yogurt.</p>\n    <p>The rest of the dish can likewise be treated as a template. If honeynut evades you, opt for any winter squash and adjust accordingly. Cottage cheese and chili crisp would be equally gleeful atop butternut quarters or delicata rings (no need to peel either; roast until tender). If seasoned rice vinegar is in your pantry, use that and skip the added salt and sugar in step 3. Whatever the specifics, it‚Äôs a special-enough side dish to also make as a vegetarian main course.</p>\n    <h2>Recipe notes</h2>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#main-content\">Back to top</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/roasted-squash-with-cottage-cheese-chili-crisp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Imagine one giant, ring-shaped √©clair that‚Äôs perfect for slicing and sharing. This version swaps the traditional praline mousseline filling for a banana diplomat cream (just a fancy term for pastry cream lightened with whipped cream) and layers it with candied nuts and slices of banana, cramming everything good about <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/best-banana-pudding\">Southern banana pudding</a> into a flashier, French package.</p>\n<p>The recipe is our showiest to date, and will teach you how to master pate √† choux, a base you can riff on to make classic <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/chocolate-eclairs\">√©clairs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/cream-puffs\">cream puffs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/churros-with-bittersweet-chocolate-sauce\">churros</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/cheddar-and-herb-gougeres\">more</a>.

The time is now, I tell you. So turn on the air conditioning, because we‚Äôre making a lovely, homey peach and blueberry pie. It‚Äôs everything good about summer (fruit! leisure! long days!) tucked away in a crisp, flaky crust, lightly scented with cardamom, and topped off with a brown sugar streusel.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/bake-club\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

And don't forget to join the Bake Club Group chat over on Substack.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>For those uninitiated with the magic of Paris-brest, let us enlighten you. It is a classic French dessert created in the early 20th century to commemorate the bicycle race connecting Paris and Brest. It‚Äôs traditionally composed of a giant wreath made of p√¢te √† choux (the same dough used to make eclairs and cream puffs) and a praline cr√®me mousseline. The ring bakes and expands dramatically in the oven; once it‚Äôs removed and cooled completely, the ring is sliced in half and filled with a light and fluffy cream. It‚Äôs a showstopping dessert that can‚Äôt help but take center stage. This version, an ode to the classic, imbues it with notes of ripe banana and salty-sweet candied nuts for a fun take on banana pudding.</p>\n    <p>The dessert is essentially three separate recipes: The first, the choux, is a simple yet hardworking dough that gets cooked both on the stovetop and in the oven. The initial stovetop cooking step helps the dough puff in the oven, so don‚Äôt skip it. And piping the dough into connected puffs in lieu of one continuous ring allows guests to pull off just the right amount with ease. The banana cream filling gets its bold flavor by steeping the peels (yes, the peels!) in milk before turning it into a pastry cream and lightening it with whipped cream, a concoction known as diplomat cream. To finish it off, candied nuts‚Äîmade by coating pecans in whipped egg white and sugar, then baking them until crisp‚Äîadds a welcomed crunch. (But feel free to use 1 cup store-bought candied nuts to make life easier.) It‚Äôs no doubt a project, but you can make one or all of the components at least a day before to get ahead.</p>\n    <h2>Recipe notes</h2>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#main-content\">Back to top</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/banana-pudding-paris-brest\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Bon App√©tit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>As people who write about food and test kitchen gadgets for a living, Bon App√©tit editors are constantly surrounded by a wide range of products. Between our own purchases and the endless stream of samples sent our way, it means there‚Äôs always something new coming across our desks and into our homes. Every month we‚Äôre rounding up the standouts we‚Äôve tested or bought ourselves that changed the way we cook and eat.</p>\n<p>This month a new piece of kitchen gear that changed our cooking game, a condiment we‚Äôve taken to putting on everything, and a limited-edition bev we‚Äôve been sipping all summer long. Read on for all of the products we‚Äôve been obsessing over this August.</p>\n<h2>Spindrift Yuzu Mandarin</h2>\n<p>I had never taken a sip of a drink and felt like my whole world shifted until I cracked open a can of Spindrift‚Äôs new Yuzu Mandarin sparkling water. It bursts with bright, tangy citrus notes from the real Japanese yuzu juice that are perfectly balanced by the juicy sweetness of Californian mandarins. The result is a flavor that‚Äôs simultaneously nuanced yet familiar. This is a limited-edition, online-only batch, so do yourself a favor and grab a pack (or two, or three‚Ä¶) before it‚Äôs gone. Trust me, this is the ultimate summer porch pounder you need in your fridge. ‚Äî<a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/contributor/olivia-tarantino\">Olivia Tarantino</a>, senior commerce editor</p>\n<h2>Koala Eco Natural Multi-Purpose Kitchen Cleaner</h2>\n<p>Having white kitchen counters means that yes, I‚Äôm spending more time than I‚Äôd like to admit cleaning up drops of egg yolk and streaks of chili crisp after all our summer cooking. I‚Äôve also been trying to make a conscious effort to use natural, nontoxic cleaning products in an area like the kitchen where I‚Äôm regularly eating, and I‚Äôve become obsessed with Koala Eco‚Äôs natural multipurpose kitchen cleaner. I‚Äôd buy it solely for the smell alone, which comes from lemon myrtle and mandarin essential oils, but what matters is that it actually works. Plus, it doesn‚Äôt hurt that the product is plant-based and biodegradable. ‚Äî<a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/contributor/kate-kassin\">Kate Kassin</a>, editorial operations manager</p>\n<h2>KAMA-ASA Black Cutting Board</h2>\n<p>I recently picked up a new cutting board from Kama-Asa, the newish Japanese kitchenware shop in the growing Japanese marketplace collection off Norman Avenue in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. It is <i>so</i> pleasant to prep veg on. My knife feels secure when I use it, and I don't have to deal with the same paranoia about microplastics as I do when I think about plastic cutting boards. Cleanup is a breeze (especially for something that requires hand-washing lest it warp), and it doesn't clash with my kitchen. It doesn't completely replace my wooden cutting board, but it's nice to have a solid number two option. ‚Äî<a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/contributor/joseph-hernandez\">Joseph Hernandez</a>, associate director of drinks and lifestyle</p>\n<h2>Birkenstock Super Birki 2.0</h2>\n<p>I‚Äôve been testing indoor pizza ovens, which meant two full days in the Test Kitchen. On the first day I wore sneakers; by the end of the nine-hour day my feet were so sore. On day two I slipped on the Birkenstock Super Birkis‚Äîand wow. These workhorse clogs did what no sneaker ever could: make a full day of cooking actually comfortable. They‚Äôre loose enough to let your feet breathe, snug enough to support your arches, and super easy to clean thanks to the waterproof upper (clutch when you‚Äôre splashing tomato sauce around). I went for bold green, but they also come in more subtle colors like black and olive green, which Alaina and commerce writer <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/contributor/wilder-davies\">Wilder Davies</a> got. The three of us keep them at the office and switch into them every time we‚Äôre in the Test Kitchen. Pro tip: size down. I‚Äôm usually a 38, and the 37 was perfect. ‚Äî<i>O.T.</i></p>\n<h2>East Fork Guava Everyday Bowls</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/what-editors-loved-august-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Bon App√©tit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>Even if the name AG1 doesn‚Äôt ring a bell, I‚Äôm willing to bet you‚Äôve seen its premier product splashed across your Instagram feed or featured on your favorite influencer‚Äôs story. Launched in 2010, the brand was in many ways ahead of its time when its first <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-greens-powder\">greens powder</a> hit shelves‚Äîand has dominated the supplement space ever since.</p>\n<p>AG1‚Äôs formulation has shifted over the years, but the most significant update yet‚ÄîAG1 Next Gen‚Äîlaunched this past May. Then, at the beginning of August, came three new flavors, marking the first time the brand has expanded beyond its original pineapple-and-vanilla-tinged offering.</p>\n<p>As someone who had never tried <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/nntVzjQ3JMLpxHyAacGiLVHbeLLyQhjUeznk5EpRPa66tuQYbWtnpyVbNqDXwNNQuvoy8KjyW63JSzAx28VPo1x6gB5HQFGiKYxZNjyGh5x798xCj9AWwd7C9x48LRnbZMQSHx2pjyU8sHa2FfyE9oCFwPdYqbEDdM7A1Qd97VXkmPkVJmgfXue7pry8wprNA56LJ9Vw7mPGUQi2BMN8Ared9gpJZpkj6cnsYtxGnXjVpDpTGqCHVaB8T3FHMxY5EDcBuhvRpFkGrdft79CFEAAFRH4VtF9xhrhrSrwM\">AG1</a> before, I went in completely blind while tasting the new Tropical, Berry, and Citrus powders. Here are my thoughts, along with a registered dietitian‚Äôs perspective on all things AG1.</p>\n<h2>What is AG1?</h2>\n<p>AG1 describes itself as a ‚ÄúDaily Health Drink.‚Äù Made with 83 ingredients, think of it as part greens powder, part gut-health-supporting drink, and part adaptogenic elixir. Meant to be taken daily, it claims to aid with energy, mood, immunity, bloating, and digestion.</p>\n<h2>What‚Äôs new about AG1 Next Gen?</h2>\n<h3>Updated ingredients</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://drinkag1.com/blog/post/meet-ag1-next-gen\">AG1 Next Gen</a> is the brand‚Äôs latest iteration, with the biggest change being the addition of eight new ingredients, bringing the total to 83 from 75. Guided by third-party research on probiotics and gut health, the formula also features an updated blend with five clinically studied probiotic strains.</p>\n<p>The new lineup of vitamins and minerals includes molybdenum, boron, and choline. According to Registered Dietitian and Culinary Nutritionist <a href=\"http://kristydelcoro.com/\">Kristy Del Coro, MS, RDN, LDN</a>, ‚Äúmolybdenum and boron are trace minerals that are easily found in food and are not commonly deficient in the average population. Choline, however, is an essential nutrient that is not always consumed in adequate amounts; it is essential for the nervous system and metabolism.‚Äù</p>\n<p>AG1 has also swapped out some existing vitamins and minerals for more bioavailable (i.e., more easily absorbed) forms. This includes an updated slate of B vitamins, which support energy production.</p>\n<p>The Next Gen formula has also been tested in four clinical trials, the results of which you can read about <a href=\"https://drinkag1.com/learn/research/scientific-research\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>New flavors</h3>\n<p>After launching Next Gen in May, AG1 expanded its offerings with three new flavors in August. The lineup now includes the original plus Tropical, Berry, and Citrus. After trying them all, Tropical was my personal favorite, though I appreciated that each flavor seemed designed to complement AG1‚Äôs grassy, earthy undertones rather than mask them. Like the original, all flavors are only lightly sweetened with stevia.</p>\n<p>I tried each straight up, mixed with 8‚Äì12 ounces of water as instructed, but they‚Äôd also make excellent smoothie additions. Try Tropical with pineapple and mango, Berry with blueberries, strawberries, and almond butter, or Citrus with orange juice and banana.</p>\n<h2>What sets AG1 apart from other greens powders?</h2>\n<p>Unlike many competitors, AG1 isn‚Äôt just a greens powder. Its 83 ingredients go beyond fruits and vegetables to include functional adaptogens like ashwagandha, reishi, and rhodiola (intended to aid stress and vitality), plus prebiotics and probiotics for gut health and vitamins to support daily energy.</p>\n<p>Another standout: AG1 is NSF Certified for Sport, meaning it‚Äôs undergone rigorous third-party testing to ensure it contains no substances banned by major athletic organizations and no unsafe levels of contaminants such as heavy metals. Del Coro notes that this certification also guarantees the contents match what‚Äôs listed on the label‚Äîan important distinction in a largely unregulated industry where ‚Äúthere have also been reports of inconsistencies.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Del Coro also points to AG1‚Äôs emphasis on nutrient bioavailability, explaining that ‚Äúthis is an additional step that is not always done.‚Äù Bioavailability refers to ‚Äúhow efficiently and effectively the nutrient is absorbed in the body,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúSo they don‚Äôt just add any form of B12, they use a specific methylated form of B12, which is the best form of B12 for absorption in the body.‚Äù</p>\n<h2>What are some things to keep in mind when deciding if you should try AG1?</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/ag1-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

For even more staff favorites,</i> </p>\n<p><i/></p>\n<h2>August 29</h2>\n<p>I‚Äôve been harboring a desire to make senior test kitchen editor Shilpa Uskokovic‚Äôs <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/chocolate-sheet-cake-with-brown-butter-frosting\">Chocolate Sheet Cake With Brown Butter Frosting</a> for some time. Everyone on staff knows and loves this cake, and I needed to get on board. Sadly, I‚Äôve hesitated to make it for the simple (and totally solvable) reason that I never have <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/powdered-milk\">dry milk powder</a> at home. That changed last week when I finally got around to buying <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/JGMSvp8QkUXHLSmQuuEeR8CpBc8NsPXiczZ4XjfFVvvfDQ8iz6RdGrS4UfozWp5DtGvHrowzsjetrkNHCqoeKPXPdTpSRF6nVVGArrgYVsZSTXM4JqiHQiBWkE71sagHiYk2VuegYFtnSuhTWc1pUcbHguge7RATjjV7kPcTFyfE4K3Kh3H1jGeXHxzH6acfvr5f9wterzRWZzQK5gPf8yjibrw71SghpY8LYY9Lx3qktasXtFdP5bppPrhB8EHmhB5HPdRvaNYkBqSD88J85XXk3wKjn3KZyLWz8hzCyHTA2KLbuAFfmbc2UtgmBk1UhAuTtojyjw1U7G4DJ7qgPziKUXPGmTf5c1u1H5zJWhDNQWFi6Fdh91yEALVE9SC7G9URXttLMsWNxzujJEjiSY1MnNFyu6sDrQWE4eyMwiu6UYoHfQ7ww5mx6\">a bag</a>. I was gleefully rewarded with what turned out to be one of the best cakes I‚Äôve ever made. The cake itself comes together in a flash (and with a whisk, no mixer needed). But the frosting was the real reason I was baking, and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. Toasting the dry milk powder to a beautiful auburn color is a brilliant technique on Shilpa‚Äôs part and imbues the frosting with incredible flavor. The friends I made this for were delighted and left begging for the recipe. <i>‚Äî Carly Westerfield, associate manager, audience strategy</i></p>\n<p>I am obsessed with corn‚ÄîI blame growing up in the Midwest. I could never get enough of the Minnesota State Fair‚Äôs fire-roasted corn (blanketed in butter!). So when social media creator Nasim Lahbichi came out with a recipe for <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT6qCbvYR/\">shrimp and corn coconut curry</a>, I knew I needed to make it. I had some lemongrass leftover from making my own curry paste a couple weeks ago, and this dish was a great way to use it up. You start by blending corn kernels with coconut milk before simmering that mixture with cobs to create a luscious broth. The shrimp get marinated in lemongrass, garlic, chile flakes, salt, and a splash of oil before they‚Äôre seared and then thrown into the broth. What you get is perfectly tender shrimp in a bath of sweet-slightly tangy curry, best served over rice. ‚Äî<i>Urmila Ramakrishnan, associate director of social media</i></p>\n<p>This content can also be viewed on the site it <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@lahbco/video/7539207321969331469\">originates</a> from.</p>\n<p>The nice thing about developing recipes for a living is you have an encyclopedia of them to turn to in times of need. I recently worked on this <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/crispy-salmon-with-avocado-sauce\">Crispy Salmon with Avocado Sauce</a>. The sauce is based on one of my favorites, the pale green guasacaca that comes in way-too-tiny plastic cups alongside an order of arepas. This week I made a batch of the sauce and instead of salmon, my husband cooked two pork chops. We spooned the sauce on the bottom of a silver platter, shingled the pork on top, and scattered over a cup‚Äôs worth of halved cherry tomatoes for a weeknight dinner that felt special but was incredibly quick to make. ‚Äî<i>Shilpa Uskokovic, senior test kitchen editor</i></p>\n<p>For my birthday this week, I was committed to grilling‚Äîeven after my friend‚Äôs propane ran out and we had to pivot to charcoal. The star of the spread was Yia Vang‚Äôs <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/tri-tip-steak-with-tiger-bite-sauce\">Tri-Tip With Tiger Bite Sauce</a> from <a href=\"https://www.unionkitchenmn.com/\">Union Hmong Kitchen</a>.

In the early 20th century, small Rust Belt cities like Utica and Rome were home to a large wave of immigrants who created new-age renditions of familiar dishes such as chicken riggies, Utica greens, and tomato pie in their homes and restaurants.</p>\n    <p>Today the pasta is a comforting regional favorite for serving at everything from festivals to funerals in the upper stretch of New York State.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n    <p>For a French superstar chef whose eponymous NYC restaurant has received two Michelin stars, Daniel Boulud‚Äôs demeanor is unexpectedly laid-back and jovial.</p>\n    <p>His Zoom profile photo shows two versions of Boulud staring at each other through a mirror‚Äîone in black and one in white‚Äîclearly meant to denote good and evil. While he says the depiction is ‚Äúvery me on both sides,‚Äù you really wouldn‚Äôt know it from talking to him. Boulud is laughing as he turns the camera on his phone around to show me his lunch spread, which consists of butter chicken and a large glass bottle of Evian. ‚ÄúI grew up on Evian in France‚Äîand I grew up as a young chef in restaurants drinking it,‚Äù says Boulud.</p>\n    <p>Along with Evian and American tennis star Francis Tiafoe, Boulud organized a Daniel-approved viewing experience for the final rounds of the US Open, with <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-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\">a limited-edition menu</a> at <a href=\"https://www.danielnyc.com/\">Restaurant DANIEL</a> (for a little treat for those outside of New York, boxes featuring some of the menu‚Äôs flavors are available on <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-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\">Goldbelly</a>).</p>\n    <p>We caught Boulud just before his menu launched and, as ever, he was a fount of knowledge about what people should keep in their kitchens. Below, he shares his favorite kitchen utensils, as well as the one ingredient that he believes separates the good from the great in his favorite cocktail.</p>\n    <h2>Daniel Boulud Kitchen 12\" Stainless-Steel Frying Pan</h2>\n    <p>Boulud partnered with cookware brand Sardel for his own line of pots and pans, and he‚Äôs delighted to tell me that he uses them in his own home. ‚ÄúI like to cook a one-pot meal,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúSo you always need a great collection of pots and pans‚Äîit's definitely a must.‚Äù</p>\n    <h2>Sabatier French knives</h2>\n    <p>When it comes to knives for the home cook, Boulud is wary about recommending Japanese knives saying he finds them ‚Äúuncomfortable.‚Äù In what will be a surprise to no one, he usually reaches for a French knife, with Sabatier being one of his preferred brands.</p>\n    <h2>Michel Bras paring knife</h2>\n    <p>If you‚Äôre really drawn to the tempered steel often found in Japanese knives, Boulud recommends the ‚Äúhalf Japanese, half French‚Äù sets made by French chef Michel Bras. ‚ÄúIt's a beautiful knife, and the steel is a tempered steel that is not Damascus steel, but it's very similar and it's really fantastic.‚Äù</p>\n    <h2>A really good wooden spatula</h2>\n    <p>One thing that Boulud is really passionate about having around at all times in the kitchen is a wooden spatula. Aside from the fact that wood is ‚Äúsoft, never gets warm or hot, and it‚Äôs natural,‚Äù Boulud has a sentimental tie to the object.</p>\n    <p>‚ÄúAfter my father retired as a farmer, he bought wood tools and a wood machine from his uncle that was getting too old to work with it,‚Äù explains Boulud. ‚ÄúHe started to make all kinds of tools, including wood spatulas. Thirty years ago when I opened Cafe Boulud he surprised me with a box full of wood spatulas, and he burned the Cafe Boulud logo into all of the handles. Even today, I still cook with his spatulas always.‚Äù</p>\n    <p>Boulud also explains that a wooden spatula is the ideal tool to use when making <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/how-to/article/best-scrambled-eggs\">scrambled eggs</a>, which is the one dish he really believes everyone should be able to make. ‚ÄúScrambled eggs can be delicate, buttery, rich and you can marry that with other things‚Äîtoast with brioche, with smoked salmon, caviar, truffle‚Äîyou name it.‚Äù</p>\n    <h2>The perfect cocktail addition</h2>\n    <p>I'm a Negroni guy, but I like the white Negroni with gin and Suze, and we put a little bit of dry vermouth and a little bit of lemon,‚Äù Boulud says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my way to go because I love the bitterness of Suze.‚Äù</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/daniel-boulud-favorite-kitchen-tools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Bon App√©tit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>Here‚Äôs one thing about me: I‚Äôm a big cereal person. I grew up on Honey Nut Cheerios, Special K, Life, and Chex, and I still remember the glee with which I‚Äôd tear through those <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mini-Cereal-Boxes-Variety-Pack/dp/B0CQC4BSMM/\">mini boxes</a> of sugar cereal that my mom would buy for my brother and me as a treat on (very) rare occasions. So when I started hearing about a new class of cereals popping up‚Äîones labeled ‚Äúprotein cereal‚Äù and listed promises like ‚Äúhigh fiber‚Äù and ‚Äúgrain-free‚Äù‚ÄîI was intrigued.</p>\n<p>We‚Äôre living in a high-protein world now, at least according to grocery store shelves and my email inbox, so the protein-ification of the cereal aisle is hardly surprising. But do any of these cereals actually taste good? I set out on a mission to find out. After tasting over a dozen varieties, I‚Äôm here to report back.</p>\n<h2>The best protein cereal overall: Seven Sundays</h2>\n<p>Specs (Super Fruity Oat Protein Cereal)</p>\n<p><strong>Serving size:</strong> 1 cup<strong>Calories:</strong> 160<strong>Protein:</strong> 5 grams<strong>Fiber:</strong> 3 grams<strong>Sugar:</strong> 7 grams<strong>Price per box:</strong> $9<strong>Favorite flavor:</strong> Super Fruity</p>\n<p>Out of all of the cereals I tried, Seven Sundays is the one I will definitely be buying for myself in the future. Founded way back in 2011, the brand positions itself as an alternative to traditional cereals. It offers a few different cereal product lines, including Little Crispies and the more protein-forward Sunflower Cereal and Oat Protein Cereals, all of which are refined-sugar free.</p>\n<p><strong>What we love:</strong> Unlike some other cereals here, Seven Sundays‚Äô ingredient list is short and simple and consists of items you‚Äôd recognize‚Äîthink coconut oil, sunflower or oat protein, corn, almonds, and cassava. There‚Äôs no monk fruit, stevia, or artificial sweeteners in sight here. Instead, Seven Sundays uses maple syrup, dates, or wildflower honey. The brand‚Äôs take on Fruit Loops is coated in a mix of real fruit powder and citrus extracts rather than any ‚Äúnatural flavors.‚Äù Of course, none of this would matter if the stuff didn‚Äôt taste good; but those ingredients translate to A-plus flavor. This is cereal that tastes nutritious in a good way, a grown-up take on the ultra-processed versions I grew up on.</p>\n<p><strong>What we‚Äôd leave:</strong> With only five grams of protein in the Oat Protein and Sunflower cereals, Little Sundays has the same amount of protein as a serving of good old-fashioned Cheerios‚Äîwhich is to say, not that much. That said, it‚Äôs a delicious cereal in its own right, which is why it‚Äôs our top pick.</p>\n<h2>The best high-protein cereal: Magic Spoon</h2>\n<p>Specs (Fruity)</p>\n<p><strong>Serving size:</strong> 1 cup<strong>Calories:</strong> 150<strong>Protein:</strong> 13 grams<strong>Fiber:</strong> 1 gram<strong>Sugar:</strong> 0 grams<strong>Price per box:</strong> $10<strong>Favorite flavor:</strong> Fruity</p>\n<p>If five grams of protein isn‚Äôt going to cut it for you, meet Magic Spoon. Self-described as ‚Äúthe high-protein, keto-friendly, gluten-free, grain-free, soy-free, wheat-free, naturally flavored, totally delicious, childlike cereal for grown-ups‚Äù (that‚Äôs a mouthful!), it‚Äôs got up to 14 grams of protein per serving and comes in flavors like Fruity, Cinnamon Toast, Frosted Cereal, and Blueberry Muffin.</p>\n<p><strong>What we love:</strong> To put it simply, Magic Spoon is the protein cereal for protein powder and bar lovers. Its primary ingredient is a milk protein blend made up of casein and whey protein concentrate, which is how it gets 12‚Äì14 grams of protein per serving‚Äîmore than any other cereal on this list. It‚Äôs sweetened with a blend of allulose and monk fruit, making it sugar-free, and it has some added inulin for a small boost of fiber (1‚Äì2 grams, to be exact).</p>\n<p>If you‚Äôre an OG Fruit Loops lover, you‚Äôll be pleased to know that, flavor-wise, the Magic Spoon Fruity Cereal was the closest thing I tried that compared to the original. It was my favorite of the flavors I tried, though the Cocoa and Peanut Butter were also pretty tasty.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-protein-cereals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Bon App√©tit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>Nonstick pans are a staple in most kitchens for a reason. They make cooking easy, cleanup quick, and eggs practically glide right out of the pan. But if you‚Äôre looking for something that lasts longer and gets even better with use, it‚Äôs worth considering carbon steel. The best carbon-steel pans offer all the convenience and ease of a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-nonstick-pans\">nonstick skillet</a> with even more durability and versatility.</p>\n<p>Think of carbon steel as a lighter, more agile cousin to <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-cast-iron-skillet\">cast iron</a>. These pans are easier to maneuver, with wide, flat cooking surfaces that are perfect for frying eggs and <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/how-to/article/perfect-french-omelet-hint-will-butter\">omelets</a>, flipping crepes, searing meat, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/quick-recipes/slideshow/25-quick-stir-fry-recipes-cook-weeknights\">stir-frying vegetables</a>‚Äîthe list goes on. When properly seasoned, carbon steel is every bit as slick as ceramic or PTFE-coated pans, but unlike those, it will actually get better the more you use it.</p>\n<p>Carbon steel is tough and durable, compatible with induction cooktops, and can withstand high heat. There‚Äôs no need to worry about scratching its cooking surface, either, which makes it a smarter long-term investment than most traditional nonstick pans‚Äîprovided you care for them properly.</p>\n<h2>Our top picks</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>The best traditional carbon-steel pan:</strong><a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/RADNkTB2Qu42QU3Nj1Q4bQyWbXBM6ipbtPVzCo5xhLgGNr2qe9H9PgZ2t1V84sW8U1YN5cjf788M2i4da2NPMDUn8a85Aq3fUVASxCHMJFGfmHy2rAcxgWppxG2DgMpprcw6aMxhDFwpSqvjh1udnmrn484X2i9qZd81thK8Nbbg8mbE7DByY7CEPhgNrn1bbE5F8jbQ8KhoBqZ97DeNfBS4Fs4mqJcCc7c8JwmtVpgZ81T7BzswvC2548631eAvJvnKfntdUP4qunpWP2BdV9xJbpSNjJZxSoRuDPUH2j9aUJMUdnH2FVfMbBLHrepD5e9YFakkpJbAkeBkTx8cvkBiR4mWPE8yJQRkGZtXdFv3ZFjDMwpgMx\">De Buyer Blue Carbon Steel Fry Pan</a>‚Üí<a href=\"#best\">Read more</a></li>\n      <li><strong>The best budget carbon-steel pan:</strong><a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/3j63gbMkR4nGRWLmxBu6KXTj1CSxTb2d3XaaX7vnu47wC13GQdBLjaJeA2WSKgMsQ8VdeCYpc6E1mwGmUMYY89CnANv47veJZT3guEuzcBAn9C7uThYeLGgRGqtkQG6XstUgG8oZ2AeiY4qpcvCVDmZHJZtvLFwcxGJ1Ryjw4drRQP3wKF2ouBAToRTCLV5QWH3JfY5CxfzgrBTyrWQV7beGgVy6FNb9XhHJiCG76tywHToJMPcJyA53WCAJgXyuFoUkXmmmdr9jEb5mTwyB5QL5Tw8Edd2gyFoMKY2Rte28PmRfL9bbVWYyLxJj6zvh5RmqHypLRTUebdK9JQuHs2r8SfEJsh2z7YE1qLUws6yThkFh9bBFu1dm7Lok\">Oxo Obsidian Pre-Seasoned Carbon Steel Skillet</a>‚Üí<a href=\"#budget\">Read more</a></li>\n      <li><strong>The best nonstick alternative carbon-steel pan:</strong><a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/2QKuUE9XrFFi1YXiFEpQ9ebQfCyN2fgucXsUoQ5cS2gAMEAzKMktw84gJ82keBnbSFp3VWc3YysZd7w4QzmYPpJT4Cq1k8pLsVtkXYyPDGwCGCNn5TiuZ5g27CHj3LimLh9WgUwk5EmmNRUrUTXkymJoTw3S1Ud9Py49RNRDpqEzJWENcUQtC4y5NjaFnh7RcthaBhZ2eAHPvx4Ax2Gm8sNiXqgDxpv47aNKzekp7vv3sUu4xQcMuvmczJFveKX1YR5XfNiSbsphHiUZPTPmC5XkY6SKMBV1CjNNWbDJ6sGGZ7omZddJqzyNMZXLpez1TNaRXJm8pNW\">The Misen Carbon Nonstick</a>‚Üí<a href=\"#Misen-Carbon-Nonstick\">Read More</a></li>\n      <li><strong>A new-and-improved (but slightly unorthodox) alternative:</strong><a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/EAi7madmZTTZPaWY7PTfVqDnmM8DwTxXB2gwnpvuh3WARWjmw2M146qUuopYeeRFkQ9TpunRt3uMeyjmxCdqDgUsi1a7e6DozKwDEBYNNZeJvizCPcqhTadEtxiVvCauPMXUVNw4AcFWZFyW5H1cGD86mVxYXGeYYtQYaR55sNcyT7Aju6jCZsojXgqJnwt5VoZCed2uvSJCCYVAyz9NEYLd7U7dXBdg5YieFbyCYCRHNkPokxz5y4xrHWJfzMbGRpAc2Sa4GcoN5YEQvWL4ZBFW1dJAQKjaTfudCXP8vKfntrCrCZFzEP3Ey3ykBhQrC6KsMaEV6fRKVgev65vChdUxgh1eYLurp6EtpgYGs5zMqHfVZgEuN1g2eDXUihQxz7Y2kVb5ZLpa\">The Strata Pan</a>‚Üí<a href=\"#a-new-and-improved-but-slightly-unorthodox-alternative-the-strata-pan\">Read more</a></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>We get that not every home cook wants to <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/carbon-steel-gift\">season carbon-steel pans</a>.

De Buyer is an old-school name in the cookware world, and the brand‚Äôs carbon-steel pan is probably its best-known product. ‚ÄúI love these as an alternative to all but the <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-cast-iron-skillet\">best cast irons</a>,‚Äù Morocco says. ‚ÄúThey are lighter, easier to use and handle, season faster, and start out with slicker surfaces.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The blue carbon-steel pan is the most affordable pan in de Buyer‚Äôs lineup, and it‚Äôs a bit more user-friendly than the higher end Mineral B and Mineral B Pro lines. One big plus about this pan is that you don‚Äôt have to go through the same initial process that completely unseasoned carbon-steel pans require as it comes with a light layer of bluing as opposed to the traditional beeswax coating that can be a minor hassle to remove. That being said, we‚Äôd still recommend seasoning this pan yourself before using it, as during testing, the surface became much slicker following a few rounds of cooking. The pan also has a welded handle‚Äîno lumpy rivets in the way‚Äîwhich makes it easy to clean, and broad-angled sides ideal for tossing and flipping foods in the pan without a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-silicone-spatula\">spatula</a>. If you want a professional quality carbon-steel pan that isn‚Äôt too intimidating, this is the one.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-carbon-steel-pans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A zippy sherry-vinegar-based dressing is emulsified with a generous amount of richly intense blue cheese. While this dressing might be too heavy and overpowering for a romaine or butter lettuce, it‚Äôs the perfect foil for bitter, crisp <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/what-is-radicchio\">radicchio</a>. Sweet chunks of roasted squash and bits of fragrant rosemary bring this cozy, perfect-for-fall salad together. Toasted hazelnuts give crunch, thin slivers of shallot offer freshness, and if you‚Äôre craving even more blue cheese, go ahead and finish the salad with a few salty crumbles.</p>\n    <p>This recipe is endlessly adaptable. Any crisp, slightly bitter radicchio will do the trick. And if another squash catches your eye at the grocery store, butternut can be swapped out for delicata, acorn, or even roasted chunks of sweet potato. Hazelnuts bring their own fatty depth, but walnuts, pecans, or even almonds would stand in nicely. While blue cheese is what gives this salad its <i>oomph</i>, another soft, rich cheese would also be lovely if you‚Äôre not a fan of the funk. Robiola, goat cheese, or brie would lead you to a similarly glossy, rich vinaigrette. Once it comes time to plate, use your hands to carefully pile the salad into a tall, centerpiece-worthy plate of greens.</p>\n    <h2>Recipe notes</h2>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#main-content\">Back to top</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/radicchio-salad-with-blue-cheese-dressing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>What does ‚Äúfeel-good food‚Äù mean? It depends on whom you ask. That‚Äôs why each month our  Feel-Good Food Plan‚Äîwith delicious recipes and a few wild cards‚Äîis hosted by someone new. This month restaurant editor Elazar Sontag shares the dinner that welcomes him home after months on the road.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Restaurant scouting is the rare gig that‚Äôs every bit as fun as it sounds. There‚Äôs no part of my job I enjoy more than hitting the road for two months in search of the year‚Äôs Best New Restaurants. <i>New Orleans. Oakland. Austin. Asheville. Charleston.</i> The trips blur together, but the thrill never fades. Neither do the stomachaches. After so many double dinners, a great restaurant salad is my salvation. Luckily, chefs were seriously into salad this year. Everywhere I went were hyper-seasonal, beautifully arranged mountains of greens I happily scaled. Of course, I also ate more pounds of <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/best-fried-chicken\">fried chicken</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/creamy-pasta-with-crispy-mushrooms\">cream-thickened sauces</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/siu-yuk-cantonese-roast-pork\">crackly pork belly</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/double-dark-chocolate-no-churn-ice-cream\">ice cream</a> than any amount of greens could counteract.</p>\n    <p>When I finally came home from this year‚Äôs dining frenzy, I craved freshness. Pulling inspiration from some of my favorite restaurant salads, this <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/radicchio-salad-with-blue-cheese-dressing\">squash-and-radicchio number</a> has become my return-to-home comfort food. Sherry <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/three-minute-red-wine-vinaigrette\">vinaigrette</a> is cut through with hunks of creamy <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/tomato-toast-blue-cheese-butter\">blue cheese</a>, a trick inspired by my favorite salad at <a href=\"https://www.viacarota.com/\">Via Carota</a> in New York City's West Village. Instead of eating straight out of the mixing bowl like I normally do, I take a page from <a href=\"https://www.meetinghousebeer.com/\">Meetinghouse</a> in Philadelphia, a standout bar where the stately green salad nearly touches the ceiling, and pile my leaves high on a platter. The salad goes in the middle of the table like a centerpiece, and my partner and I cozy up, casually eating with our fingers. After so many weeks of restaurant meals, it‚Äôs what I‚Äôve missed most.</p>\n    <h2>More Feel-Good Finds for the Month</h2>\n    <p>I refuse to wear pants to the office in New York‚Äôs hottest months, which means my coworkers see a lot of knees (sorry!). How do you make jean shorts and a t-shirt feel‚Ä¶ serious? The answer came to me in a pair of <a href=\"https://www.ghbass.com/collections/weejuns/products/6000-2819c01\">G.H. Bass penny loafers</a>. With no painful, heel-bleeding break-in and a handsome shine that makes me feel like a serious menswear guy, they render even my comfiest fits work-appropriate.</p>\n    <p>When I‚Äôm on the road scouting for Best New Restaurants, I drink a lot of coffee‚Äîthree cups a day is the minimum to keep me energized through the heavy-weight eating. This year in DC, I fell in love with <a href=\"https://lostsockroasters.com/collections/coffee/products/tw0-steps-forward-espresso-blend-12oz\">Lost Sock Roasters</a>, a cafe and small roaster that makes the best cup I‚Äôd had in months. When I got home, I put in a recurring order for four bags of the shop‚Äôs exemplary Two Steps espresso blend. Once a month, right as I‚Äôm hitting the bottom of my last bag, I get the delivery I‚Äôve been waiting for.</p>\n    <p>If you searched my bag right now, you‚Äôd find <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/e11ement-Hypochlorous-Eczema-Procedure-Cleanser/dp/B09RBCWRXH/ref=sr_1_1_sspa\">a bottle of hypochlorous acid</a>. Come over, and you‚Äôll peep another next to my face products. To somebody who failed chemistry in high school, the antimicrobial spray seems like straight-up magic. It‚Äôs gentle enough to spray around the eyes, but stronger than bleach when it comes to disinfection. It goes in my gym bag to cleanse my face after a heavy sweat; was a key part of aftercare for my latest tattoo; and even keeps my pesky summer eczema away. I have yet to find a challenge it can‚Äôt spray away.</p>\n    <h2>Next Time</h2>\n    <p>November‚Äôs Feel-Good Food Plan will be hosted by <a href=\"https://milliepeartree.com/about/\">chef Millie Peartree</a> who‚Äôs sharing how pre-workout meal prepping actually feeds her whole family. We‚Äôll see you next month!</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/feel-good-food-plan-september-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>It's Preptember here at BA and that means we're bringing some of our favorite tools and tricks for meal prep and storage.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>I‚Äôve never liked plastic food storage containers. In my experience, they stain, retain odors, become misshapen, and start to look gross over time. And, of course, there‚Äôs also the concern that microplastics and toxic chemicals can leach into the contents of the containers when <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/can-you-put-plastic-in-the-microwave\">they‚Äôre exposed to heat</a>. That‚Äôs why I ditched plastic for <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-food-storage-containers\">glass storage containers</a> a long time ago. But recently I found a new alternative that I love even more: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Stoneware-Souper-Cubes-individual-portion/dp/B0D3WPKGBN?th=1\">Souper Cubes Ceramic Dishes</a>. The durable rectangular containers are in constant rotation in my kitchen, whether I‚Äôm freezing portions of food for easy weeknight dinners, taking my lunch on the go, or storing leftovers.</p>\n    <p>Crafted from sturdy stoneware, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Stoneware-Souper-Cubes-individual-portion/dp/B0D3WPKGBN?th=1\">Souper Cubes Ceramic Dishes</a> are safe for use in the freezer, dishwasher, and oven up to 450¬∞F. Each dish has a glazed coating that‚Äôs <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/the-best-nontoxic-cookware-tested-by-our-experts\">free of lead and heavy metals</a>, and comes with a BPA-free silicone lid that stretches around the container‚Äôs handles for an airtight seal. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Stoneware-Souper-Cubes-individual-portion/dp/B0D3WPKGBN?th=1\">Souper Cubes Ceramic Dishes</a> come in four colors (white, charcoal, cranberry, and blueberry) and are sold as a set of two 5‚Äù x 5‚Äù square dishes or four 5‚Äù x 3‚Äù rectangular dishes. Since I‚Äôm cooking for one, I opted for the latter, which are perfect for storing smaller portions as well as baking mini breads and loaf cakes.</p>\n    <p>The reason I love <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Stoneware-Souper-Cubes-individual-portion/dp/B0D3WPKGBN?th=1\">Souper Cubes Ceramic Dishes</a> more than any other food storage container I‚Äôve tried is that they are extremely versatile and <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/food-processor-vs-blender\">make meal-prep so much easier</a>. I like to cook large batches of food on Sundays and freeze individual-sized portions in the dishes for hassle-free meals throughout the week. I‚Äôve used the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Stoneware-Souper-Cubes-individual-portion/dp/B0D3WPKGBN?th=1\">Souper Cubes Ceramic Dishes</a> to freeze a variety of <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/dish/pasta\">pasta recipes</a>, chicken and rice, and roasted summer vegetables. I‚Äôve also prepped mini turkey meatloaves in the stoneware dishes, storing the seasoned, uncooked loaves in the freezer, then baking them when it‚Äôs time to dine.</p>\n    <p>The petite <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Stoneware-Souper-Cubes-individual-portion/dp/B0D3WPKGBN?th=1\">Souper Cubes Ceramic Dishes</a> are extremely portable, making them great for toting food to work, a park, or a picnic. I‚Äôve enjoyed fruit salad, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/ode-to-my-salad-spinner\">chopped salad</a>, and lots of leftovers outdoors over the summer, and the container‚Äôs stretchy, tight-fitting silicone lid kept the contents fresh and prevented juices, dressings, and sauces from leaking. And don‚Äôt be fooled by their small size ‚Äî these dishes hold a surprising amount of food.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Stoneware-Souper-Cubes-individual-portion/dp/B0D3WPKGBN?th=1\">Souper Cubes Ceramic Dishes</a> have truly been a game changer in my kitchen. Since lunch or dinner is already waiting for me in my freezer or fridge, I‚Äôm spending less time prepping meals from scratch throughout the week. And besides eliminating plastic, I‚Äôm also cutting down on food waste. The colorful containers don‚Äôt get lost in my already-crowded fridge, so I don‚Äôt need to worry that the food will be forgotten and turn bad. Plus, the lid‚Äôs airtight seal keeps contents fresh for days. I also appreciate the space-saving design of the dishes, which stack neatly when storing food in the fridge or freezer and can be nested inside each other in my cabinet when not in use.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Stoneware-Souper-Cubes-individual-portion/dp/B0D3WPKGBN?th=1\">Souper Cubes Ceramic Dishes</a> are a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-food-processor\">meal-prep superhero</a> that I rely on practically every day, and trust me, you will too.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/souper-cubes-cermamic-storage-containers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In short, true yams are an entirely different vegetable. American yams, on the other hand, are merely mislabeled sweet potatoes thanks to a marketing gimmick from the 1930s. Other varieties, such as Japanese sweet potatoes, have distinct characteristics; while you can often substitute a regular sweet potato, it‚Äôs worth finding a specific variety when a recipe calls for it.</p>\n<p>From there, follow your cravings.

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Bon App√©tit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>Chicago has always been considered one of America‚Äôs greatest food cities‚Äîone where <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-hot-dogs-chicago?srsltid=AfmBOoqjwfWVMDjOtmJ2C-orpfeBA0VNpR8LajBT2w4DGaiJQtj-Y5Ub\">fully loaded hot dogs</a>, deep-dish pizza, and ultra-luxe 18-course tasting menus are revered in the same dining scene. You could practically fill a travel itinerary with places to get Italian beef sandwiches (√† la <i>The Bear</i>) alone. The city's restaurants, caf√©s, and bars reflect the diversity of Chicago's neighborhoods, and knowing where to stay is the key to having convenient access to the best spots.</p>\n<p>Here we break down some of the most commonly trafficked neighborhoods in the Windy City and highlight where to stay so you can hit the must-visit eateries on your list.</p>\n<h2>The West Loop up through West Town</h2>\n<p>The West Loop was once an industrial zone and meatpacking district but has transformed into a lively dining and nightlife hub. Restaurant Row on the main stretch of Randolph Street is filled with restaurants and bars that have taken over old warehouse spaces. The neighborhood's also conveniently located near Chicago‚Äôs west side via the CTA Blue Line (or a quick car ride), which is home to many of the neighborhoods like Logan Square and Wicker Park with the city‚Äôs greatest places to eat.</p>\n<p>Selecting the West Loop as your home base means you can grab chai and chili cheese toasties at <a href=\"https://www.swadesicafe.com/\">Swadesi</a> for brunch, indulge in chili-crisp-laden claypot rice with pork belly at <a href=\"https://www.maxwellstrading.com/\">Maxwells Trading</a> for dinner, and end the night with a whiskey highball at Japanese bar <a href=\"https://barkumiko.com/\">Kumiko</a>. If you venture northwards, there‚Äôs the cult-followed <a href=\"https://www.kasamachicago.com/\">Kasama</a> for Filipino pastries and longanisa sausage breakfast sandwiches, <a href=\"https://www.lulacafe.com/\">Lula Caf√©</a> for James Beard Award-winning brunch with impeccable hospitality, <a href=\"https://www.akahoshiramen.com/\">Akahoshi Ramen</a> (a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-new-restaurants-2024/\">Best New Restaurant of 2024</a>) for transcendent ramen, and <a href=\"https://www.feldrestaurant.com/\">Feld</a> for the freshest seasonal tasting menu in town.</p>\n<p>The first thing you‚Äôll notice upon entering the Chicago Hoxton, which is just a stone's throw away from restaurants on Randolph Street and the Fulton Market District, is its stylish clientele. The hotel's vibrant energy draws a mix of locals and travelers, who meet up with friends or work remotely at the artfully-designed lobby's communal tables or coffee bar.</p>\n<p>The socializing flows into the dining spaces scattered throughout the building: Cabra, chef Stephanie Izard‚Äôs Peruvian rooftop spot, has bright ceviches and savory goat empanadas; Cira is a Mediterranean crowd-pleaser in the lobby; and Lazy Bird's basement lounge offers live music and cocktails. Plus, there‚Äôs a rooftop pool, a rarity in the neighborhood.</p>\n<p>The Hoxton has four options for rooms (Snug, Cosy, Cosy Up, and Roomy). None are palatial in size (the largest rooms are 300 square feet), but all are modern and stylish, with leather headboards, brass lighting, and retro-styled speakers.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Visited by Joseph Hernandez</i>\n    </p>\n<p>This 11-room, three-story property located in the former Historic Free Methodist Publishing House is private and low-key while still being in the center of it all in the West Loop. While the space is now a bed and breakfast, it has lived many lives‚Äîas the Walter Rudolph Casket Factory in the 1930s through 1950s and the Museum of Holography from 1976 to 2009. You can feel that historic charm in its current iteration, even after the hotel‚Äôs renovation in 2016. There‚Äôs original wood paneling and maple flooring, but the property now feels updated to suit a modern day traveler.</p>\n<p>Design varies with each room, which are named after Chicago literary figures, and the communal third-floor living room, meant for lingering, has a grand piano and double-sided fireplace. There‚Äôs also a wine bar, the Press Room, in the basement. Because of the property‚Äôs intimate size, it‚Äôs a great option for a buyout so a big group or wedding party can all stay together.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Visited by Joseph Hernandez</i>\n    </p>\n<h2>Down by the River</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/where-to-stay-food-lovers-chicago\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

For even more staff favorites,</i> </p>\n<p><i/></p>\n<h2>September 5</h2>\n<p>Shilpa Uskokovic‚Äôs <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/tiramisu-basque-cheesecake\">Basque-style tiramisu cheesecake</a> looks like the most complex dessert. In reality, it‚Äôs a simple batter that‚Äôs split in two. One half is adulterated with instant espresso and cocoa, and then the halves are layered in a single pan so they swirl together, baking into a marbled m√©lange of cream and coffee. A splash of Marsala wine drives home the tiramisu theme (I swapped in sweet vermouth, which I usually use for tiramisu too since I always have it for <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/manhattan-drink-cocktail\">Manhattans</a>). Don‚Äôt skip the mascarpone topping. It might seem excessive, but the contrast between dense, custardy cheesecake and ethereal mousse-like topping is kind of the whole point. ‚Äî<i>Joe Sevier, senior editor, cooking and SEO</i></p>\n<p>It might be September, but I‚Äôm still swimming in tomatoes and corn. I came across this recipe from <a href=\"https://maxbaroni.substack.com/\">Max Baroni</a> for a simple butter bean and tomato <a href=\"https://maxbaroni.substack.com/p/roasted-tomatoes-w-lemony-butter\">salad</a> that was super easy to make. I liked everything together, but the star of the show was the vinegar-marinated roasted tomatoes. The sherry vinegar brought out the tomatoes‚Äô natural sweetness, and I found myself grabbing my leftovers to put on toast with the yogurt sauce. I‚Äôm making the salad again before the season is over for a savory-sweet breakfast that instantly sparks joy. <i>‚Äî Urmila Ramakrishnan, associate director of social media</i></p>\n<p>This content can also be viewed on the site it <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DNbFFPtN_fR\">originates</a> from.</p>\n<p>There‚Äôs nothing like a summer tomato (we know them, we love them), but I raise you a summer <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/tomato-martini\">tomato martini</a>. In the past I‚Äôve tossed together a version of my own with juices left over from tomatoes I‚Äôve salted and left to sit for use in another dish, but when Jesse Szewczyk‚Äôs recipe went live, I almost immediately headed to the farmers market. His recipe calls for muddling sweet Sun Gold tomatoes and fresh basil, plus a smidge of salt and sugar until juicy; then stirring in gin, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/yes-you-should-be-using-vermouth-in-your-martinis?srsltid=AfmBOopMqVh9Jmh-_ZWPGxKjaQTX6LuVNmXkKr6zmGUG215BuDpUu6lx\">vermouth</a>, and ice until well-chilled. I strained the drink into a glass with a large ice cube‚ÄîI like martinis on the rocks, don‚Äôt sue!‚Äîand was delighted. Unlike the extra-dirty martini trend we can‚Äôt seem to escape, a tomato martini hits an ideal balance of salty-sweet and savory without overpowering the gin or tasting like an olive jar. I know the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù martini already exists as a concept, but this is a pretty flawless way to toast to the end of summer. <i>‚Äî Rebecca Firkser, contributing editor</i></p>\n<p>Now that it‚Äôs officially September, I intend to grill as many nights as possible while the sun is still high in the sky at dinnertime and the weather is, at least this week, perfect. And when it comes to grilling fish, swordfish is one of my absolute favorites. It‚Äôs meatier and less delicate than other fish, so it takes well to the grill without having to worry about the skin sticking or the fillet falling apart. I love this recipe for <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/10046-grilled-marinated-swordfish-steaks\">Grilled Marinated Swordfish Steaks</a>, which requires only 10 to 15 minutes of marinating in soy sauce, red wine vinegar, spices, and aromatics before throwing the fish on the grill (for just a few minutes per side). The recipe calls for serving with a string bean salad, but I paired it with a medley of grilled vegetables (peppers! eggplant! zucchini! onion!) and it was the perfect Labor Day dinner. <i>‚Äî Kate Kassin, editorial operations manager</i></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/recipes-bon-appetit-editors-cooked-september-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

You should know up front that going the budget route means sacrificing some flavor and consistency.</p>\n<p>Megan Bilosi, the manager of coffee education and training at <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/6exhfamEeE8bsxMYPfbRQCpkp2WKiYzPq7X7kwTxoFg73M8qAjtq41rN9izk8aicf7YfcyYYzSQ8iFcmB2aTdwziNA2oqMj2cNQPDhbzrbCxuegXbGYhf1XzVUmiQWd6ZpqXcUzdtuS6kboebhbyNsXv4AedZt5Djubfv3uyuL4G2evN1om5MfCRDs1wUjAJWNCTuCErLrm5WUXp9dExJNsaWHQUZ6JkTnF118zhMGwHp1UCKeNTzCrrkpWoJinry1UfRhSQ324ZUfVjy5KgCvNn6nPDkQ5Rg2duZRFjvTHY3niE4JFYN733BA9xU\">Sightglass Coffee in San Francisco</a> breaks down a few reasons why: ‚ÄúMost [cheap drip coffee makers] use a single hole or sprinkler style water outlet, which doesn‚Äôt distribute water evenly across the coffee bed. This leads to uneven saturation and inconsistent flavor.‚Äù</p>\n<p>In addition to the shape of the water outlet, there‚Äôs the way it sprays water out. ‚ÄúCheaper machines often don‚Äôt pulse water during the brew. They release it in a constant stream rather than in controlled bursts that mimic manual pouring. This can prevent proper blooming and hinder the overall extraction process.‚Äù</p>\n<p>But even with those limitations in mind, not all cheap coffee makers are created equal, and some that I tried manage the shortcomings Bilosi points out better than others.</p>\n<h2>What counts as a cheap coffee maker?</h2>\n<p>‚ÄúCheap‚Äù is subjective, but everything I considered for this guide costs $100 or less. Besides being a nice round number, it represents a meaningful break from the run of Specialty Coffee Association-certified coffee makers that tightly control water temperature and distribution to mimic a pour-over experience.</p>\n<p>I didn‚Äôt think I could set the top of the price range much lower, though. <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-drip-coffee-makers\">After drinking coffee from more than 30 machines</a> over the last several years, I feel quite confident that if you spend less than $60, you‚Äôll get something disappointing.</p>\n<h2>The best cheap coffee maker: Braun PureFlavor 14-Cup Coffee Maker</h2>\n<p>Pros and cons</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Pros</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Extracts coffee well</li>\n      <li>Even water distribution</li>\n      <li>Adjustable hot plate temperature</li>\n      <li>XL capacity</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <strong>Cons</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Touchscreen might not last as long as buttons</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Specs</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity:</strong> 14 cups<strong>Carafe style:</strong> Glass<strong>Dimensions</strong>: 9\" x 9\" x 15\"<strong>Features:</strong> Adjustable hot plate, over ice mode, fast brew mode<strong>Warranty:</strong> 2 years</p>\n<p><strong>What we love:</strong> Braun has held the title of best budget coffee maker in our testing for years. And even as the price tag of the Brewsense model that has held that spot has increased to over $100, Braun‚Äôs Pureflavor picked up the cheap coffee maker torch. Of all the machines I‚Äôve used in this price range, the Braun produced the most nuanced and flavorful cups of coffee. It did <i>not</i> put out water in one continuous stream, and when I looked at the bed of coffee afterwards, there wasn‚Äôt any channeling, which suggests water was able to filter through relatively evenly.</p>\n<p>The Braun also comes with a number of nice-to-have programmable features. You can set it to brew ahead of time, adjust the temperature of the hot plate so you don‚Äôt scald your coffee, and use a brew over ice setting that will extract a more potent flavor from the ground coffee that will balance out as it melts a carafe full of ice.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-cheap-coffee-makers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Send us any questions you have, or pictures every finished creations.</p>\n<p><strong>SU:</strong> And we'll get together here on the podcast to talk about the recipe.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> So the September Bake Club recipe, which is my banana pudding Paris-Brest, is live now on Bonappetit.com, and we'll tell you a bit about it at the end of the episode. But today we're going to be talking about Shilpa's excellent late summer peach and blueberry pie. Shilpa, can you tell us a little bit about this pie?</p>\n<p><strong>SU:</strong> Listen, first, I think we need to establish that summer is actually the time that most of us should be baking because there's so much-</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> The good stuff.</p>\n<p><strong>SU:</strong> Exactly. There's so much produce, all of the fruit is out there. I know we normally think of baking season as fall and winter, which I get it, it's cold outside and most of us want to be at home baking cozy things. But summer has so much fruit and so we felt it was really appropriate to feature a fruit pie in August. And I know that was asking a lot of readers, but Jesse, I mean, it was lovely to see so many people made this pie.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> No, so many people did. They looked beautiful, they looked great.</p>\n<p><strong>SU:</strong> Way more successful than any of my very early attempts at pie many years ago. Okay, what can I say about the pie? The pie is essentially three components. It has a pie crust, a very flaky pie crust, a recipe that I actually developed a couple years ago and a recipe that I'm very proud of and which has gone on to be very popular with a lot of colleagues and readers. Then there's a filling, which is a peach and blueberry filling. It has lemon juice and cardamom, and it's thickened with a little bit of cornstarch, and it's precooked, we'll get into that and why. And then it's topped off with a cardamom streusel. A streusel top I think is one of my favorite ways to finish a fruit pie. I think it's the best of both worlds, you get a flaky crust and you get this nice streusel on top. And also, my dad always made apple crisp growing up, so it's very reminiscent of that.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/our-ultimate-late-summer-pie\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Ashraf Omar Eldarir, 52, was caught with looted objects in his luggage at New York‚Äôs John F.

Investigators recovered 600 artifacts from its web, including the 590 he brought into the airport inside three large suitcases on January 22, 2020.</p>\n<p>Valued at about $82,000, Eldarir‚Äôs haul included gold funerary amulets, wooden sculptures from tombs and linen garments dating to about 1900 B.C.E., during Egypt‚Äôs <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/essays/egypt-in-the-middle-kingdom-2030-1640-b-c\">Middle Kingdom</a> period.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe defendant looted Egypt‚Äôs cultural treasures and lied to U.S. Customs about them as part of a web of deception he spun to illegally fill his pockets with cash,‚Äù says <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/staff-profile/meet-us-attorney\">Joseph Nocella Jr.</a>, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, in the statement. ‚ÄúThose who steal cultural treasures of other countries and smuggle them into the United States should know that they will be held accountable for their crimes.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The artifacts were ‚Äúso fresh out of the ground that prosecutors said that they still smelled of soil,‚Äù reports <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/08/28/egyptian-antiquities-smuggler-antiques-art-thieves/85835587007/\"> USA Today</a>‚Äôs Michael Loria.

He fabricated and forged proof of artifacts‚Äô provenances, and he alleged that the items belonged to his grandfather‚Äôs collection. Photoshopped images of objects with Eldarir‚Äôs ancestor were found among his ‚Äúforgery toolkit.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Smugglers have been faking documents of origin ‚Äúever since museums and auction houses began to ask for provenance information,‚Äù art crime expert <a href=\"https://www.artcrimeprof.com/\">Erin L.

He took countless flights from Cairo to New York during his decade of crime. In 2018, he ferried in a woman‚Äôs sarcophagus lid, a bearded mask and another larger mask, which he sold for $3,750, $1,500 and $800, respectively. These pieces were purchased by ‚Äúunwitting buyers,‚Äù per the sentencing letter.</p>\n<p>In 2019, Eldarir smuggled a polychrome relief depicting a person beside an upright snake, which he sold for nearly $4,000. Later that year, he brought in two ancient Roman artifacts made of limestone, which he sold for $1,000 and $1,200.</p>\n<p>Rome‚Äôs <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/essays/roman-egypt\">rule in Egypt</a> began with <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Augustus-Roman-emperor\">Augustus</a>‚Äô defeat of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cleopatra-queen-of-Egypt\">Cleopatra</a> and <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mark-Antony-Roman-triumvir\">Marc Antony</a> in 30 B.C.E.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThis is a serious crime that was going on in a pretty blatant way,‚Äù said Judge Rachel P.

The attorney‚Äôs office suggested ‚Äúimprisonment of at least 36 months,‚Äù but Kovner was more lenient: She sentenced Eldarir to six months in federal prison and did not levy a fine, as his assets had already been seized by the government of Egypt.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/man-who-tried-to-smuggle-600-looted-ancient-egyptian-artifacts-in-three-checked-suitcases-is-going-to-prison-180987297/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Ornithologists found the frequency and rhythm of the e-scooter alarm happened to align with the frequency and rhythm of the blackbirds‚Äô natural songs, making it easy for them to incorporate a slightly simplified version into their repertoire. German researchers hypothesize that since the birds seem to find this alarm sound attractive, imitating the sound could give male blackbirds an advantage when searching for a mate.</p>\n<p>And <a href=\"https://www.newsbreak.com/animals-around-the-globe-312249899/4120472141751-this-parrot-species-now-mimics-city-sounds-to-survive\">sulphur-crested cockatoos</a> in Australian cities imitate car alarms, jackhammers, truck backup beepers and phone notification alerts‚Äîreportedly even imitating school bells near schools so well that it‚Äôs caused confusion among students.</p>\n<p>Superb lyrebirds in Australia also mimic car alarms, as well as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjAcyTXRunY\">chainsaw and camera shutter noises</a>, with males displaying a complex and diverse singing repertoire to attract mates.

Workers have been replacing and reinforcing Fallingwater‚Äôs roof, exterior walls and window and door frames. Located in Pennsylvania, Fallingwater is both a <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/documents/140879\">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nationalhistoriclandmarks/nhls-associated-with-flw.htm\">National Historic Landmark</a>, and it‚Äôs cared for by the <a href=\"https://waterlandlife.org/\">Western Pennsylvania Conservancy</a>.</p>\n<p>The conservancy‚Äôs <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/worldheritagepreserved/\">renovation project</a> aims to ‚Äúeliminate water infiltration challenges,‚Äù Fallingwater director <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/people/justin-gunther/\">Justin Gunther</a> tells the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/home/2025/08/25/fallingwater-renovation-project-leaking/\"> Washington Post</a>‚Äôs Ashley Stimpson. ‚ÄúIn the Wright community, we describe our houses by how many buckets it requires to capture all the leaks. ‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre hoping to get to no buckets.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The famous home stretches across <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/media-resources/fallingwater-facts/\">9,300 square feet</a>, including 4,400 square feet of outdoor terraces.</p>\n<p>Born in 1867, Wright became a leader of the <a href=\"https://flwright.org/explore/prairie-style\">Prairie School</a> of architecture, which attempted to build structures that stood in harmony with nature. ‚ÄúWeather is omnipresent, and buildings must be left out in the rain,‚Äù Wright once <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/worldheritagepreserved/\">said</a>. However, some of Fallingwater‚Äôs most iconic features‚Äîsuch as its <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/history/the-kaufmanns-fallingwater/designing-fallingwater/\">terraces, flat roofs and expansive windows</a>‚Äîmade it especially vulnerable to the precipitation of southwestern Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúBecause Fallingwater is so integrated into its landscape, the effects of time and weather have really pushed the building systems to the ends of their useful lives,‚Äù says Gunther in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4luaPP3r_JI&amp;t=1s\">video</a> made by the conservancy.</p>\n<p>The house was built as a private vacation home for <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/history/the-kaufmanns-fallingwater/the-kaufmann-family/\">Edgar J. Kaufmann</a>, a Pittsburgh department store owner, who used it as a weekend retreat for his family and guests.

In 1964, Fallingwater opened for public tours, and it‚Äôs since received more than <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/media-resources/fallingwater-facts/\">6.3 million</a> visitors.</p>\n<p>Back in 2000, the conservancy carried out a major structural strengthening project, Clinton E. Piper, Fallingwater‚Äôs senior administrator of special projects, tells <i>Smithsonian </i>magazine. Apart from regular maintenance, the current renovation is the organization‚Äôs first major conservation effort in 25 years. Workers are also creating a 3D scan of the building, which would assist with repairs in the case of a future catastrophe.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs different technology that we can use now than what Wright used originally,‚Äù Piper says. ‚ÄúBut still, to maintain the same integrity and materials ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a challenging undertaking.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Workers have replaced chunks of damaged concrete, installed waterproof materials beneath terraces and injected almost 12 tons of grout into Fallingwater‚Äôs walls, according to the conservancy‚Äôs <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/projects/world-heritage-preservation/\">blog</a>.</p>\n<p>The house is filled with custom furniture and paintings by the likes of Pablo Picasso and Diego Rivera, making it a fragile workspace. ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre working on Fallingwater, you can‚Äôt drop anything,‚Äù senior maintenance specialist Ben Morrison tells the <i>Washington Post</i>. ‚ÄúNot a nail, not a drill bit, not anything.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Morrison says the prestigious house requires slow, cautious interventions. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do things half at Fallingwater,‚Äù he tells the <i>Washington Post</i>. ‚ÄúWhat would normally take you an hour to do at home‚Äîyou can‚Äôt do it like that here.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Throughout his career, Wright‚Äôs artistic vision reputedly outweighed practical, structural concerns.

The community, which has been a¬†<a href=\"https://ohp.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=21534\">California Historical Landmark</a> since 1949, was originally settled in 1849 by Chinese miners who were pushed out of a nearby mining camp during the California Gold Rush.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The TCU September Lightning Complex is burning across multiple fires and impacting communities in Calaveras and Tuolumne counties.</p>‚Äî California Governor's Office of Emergency Services (@Cal_OES)<br/>Cal OES is coordinating with local, state, and federal partners to support firefighting efforts and community needs.<br/>Visit<a href=\"\">https://t.co/xUxzIcH5jL</a>‚Ä¶<a href=\"\">pic.twitter.com/0F2cHOtquY</a><a href=\"\">September 3, 2025</a></blockquote>\n<p>It was initially called Camp Washington but later became known as Chinese Camp because of the high number of Chinese miners living there‚Äîas many as 5,000 at its peak, per¬†<a href=\"https://www.visittuolumne.com/chinese-camp\">Visit Tuolumne County</a>.</p>\n<p>Many of the buildings have long been abandoned, ‚Äúreclaimed by nature with overgrown greenery,‚Äù according to Visit Tuolumne County. The town has also served as a filming location for a handful of¬†<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?locations=chinese%20camp\">movies</a>.</p>\n<p>Fortune-seekers from around the world, including China, flocked to California after gold was discovered in 1848. Initially, Americans found the new arrivals to be ‚Äúpeculiar‚Äù and often visited Chinese camps for fun, according to PBS‚Äô ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/goldrush-chinese-immigrants/\">American Experience</a>.‚Äù However, that welcoming sentiment quickly morphed into xenophobia and racism.

Previous measurements of solar flare temperatures were based on the temperature of electrons, and it was assumed that electrons and ions would have the same temperature. But using computer simulations to recalculate the temperature of solar flares with modern data, the researchers found that there could actually be important differences in the temperatures of the two particles that can last several minutes. In fact, solar flares could be as hot as 180 million degrees Fahrenheit.</p>\n    <p>The findings were published in the <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/adf74a#apjladf74as5\"> Astrophysical Journal Letters</a> on September 3.</p>\n    <p>The new work offers a ‚Äúparadigm shift‚Äù in the understanding of flare spectral lines, according to a <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2025-09-solar-flares-hotter-previously-thought.html\">statement</a>. Since the 1970s, researchers have tried to find out why these dark or bright lines in what‚Äôs an otherwise uniform spectrum are broader than expected. One controversial hypothesis was that they occurred because of turbulent motions, but scientists have never been able to explain what caused that turbulence.</p>\n    <p>‚ÄúThe new ion temperature fits well with the width of flare spectral lines, potentially solving an astrophysics mystery that has stood for nearly half a century,‚Äù says <a href=\"https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics/people/ar51/\">Alexander Russell</a>, a physicist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland and the study‚Äôs lead researcher, in a statement.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://umdphysics.umd.edu/people/faculty/current/item/126-drake.html\">James Drake</a>, a physicist at the University of Maryland who was not involved in the work, tells Nell Greenfieldboyce at <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/05/nx-s1-5529330/solar-flares-even-hotter\">NPR</a> that he‚Äôs glad to see this new analysis. ‚ÄúWe've been confronting the solar physicists,‚Äù says Drake, ‚Äútelling them that even though they've measured in a lot of detail what's going on with the electrons, they're missing something big.‚Äù</p>\n    <p>The findings might also have important implications for objects like satellites and other spacecrafts. While the Earth‚Äôs magnetic field and atmosphere protect humans and animals from the effects of solar flares, the radiation from these events can <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/solar-storms-and-flares\">affect</a>¬†satellites and pose a risk to astronauts. The events can also disrupt various communications, so understanding their true intensity can help researchers build better equipment in the future.</p>\n    <p>\"We're already busy on the next steps,\" Russell says to NPR. The team is now developing models of the effects hotter ions have on solar flares.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/solar-flares-may-be-more-than-six-times-hotter-than-researchers-previously-thought-finds-new-research-180987296/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Before boarding a plane, I tend to opt for bland and uncontroversial food‚Äînamely, a very beige sandwich, bagel, or wrap that runs minimal risk of unsettling my stomach mid-flight. Such fare is not hard to come by at New York‚Äôs airports, home to many nondescript food purveyors selling shrink-wrapped carbs.</p>\n    <p>Delicious? Not necessarily. Expensive? Shockingly so. But for sheer utility, they curb my airport-induced hunger.</p>\n    <p>On a recent trip to Copenhagen‚Äîdespite my aforementioned preflight dining habits‚ÄîI found myself at the airport hunched over a fire-engine red table devoid of chairs, eating a fully loaded hot dog before noon. Dubious as I was of the concept of an airport hot dog, I was reassured by two things: my Danish boyfriend‚Äôs enthusiastic endorsement of <a href=\"https://www.cph.dk/en/shopping-dining/dining/steffs-place/steffs-place-terminal-3\">Steff‚Äôs Place</a> and the airy, clean vibe of the airport. This was not a place I worried about ingesting a never-before-seen bacterial strain, something I can‚Äôt say about my local airports.</p>\n    <p>The plush but not overwhelmingly bready bun hugged a skinny red-tinted sausage, an inch or so longer than the bun on either end. As I sunk my teeth into the dog, I was greeted to a pleasantly snappy bite, but the real showstopper was the small mountain of toppings. Think translucent, thinly sliced pickles, onions both raw and fried, ketchup, and Danish remoulade, a tangy, mustardy, slightly sweet mayo-based sauce. I inhaled it in roughly two bites. I found myself contentedly full, ideal conditions for a comfortable nap on the plane. The hot dog was not only delicious, but one of the most memorable meals of my trip.</p>\n    <p>Copenhagen is dotted with hot dog stands, most of them charmingly named after their respective owner: Jette‚Äôs P√∏lser (sausages, in English), Allan‚Äôs P√∏lser, John‚Äôs Hotdog Deli, and so forth. According to my source on the ground (my boyfriend), it‚Äôs not uncommon to pay a visit to a hot dog stand after going out drinking in Copenhagen, or for a cheap, no-frills snack in transit in the middle of the day.</p>\n    <p>They‚Äôve been cherished and recognizable fixtures of the country since the 1920s. According to a <a href=\"https://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/eat-drink/legendary-tale-hotdogs-denmark\">brief history</a> of the Danish hotdog on Visit Copenhagen‚Äôs website, sausage stands began to materialize on Denmark‚Äôs streets shortly after the First World War, in the likeness of similar vendors in neighboring Germany, Sweden, and Norway. The most classic version, r√∏d p√∏lse, is a pork sausage fragranced with warm spices like nutmeg and coriander, dyed red with carmine to achieve its distinctive crimson hue. ‚ÄúRegardless of assembly most hotdog vendors will offer similar variations on the basic hotdog format,‚Äù writes Visit Copenhagen. Some stands offer vegan or more ‚Äúgourmet‚Äù riffs, like a black hot dog topped with gold leaf that once featured as a monthly special at John‚Äôs Hotdog Deli, per <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2022/04/21/danish-hot-dogs-copenhagen/\">The Washington Post</a>.</p>\n    <p>Of course, the city has much more to offer on the culinary front than its street sausages. You may be familiar with Copenhagen‚Äôs dining scene via <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/noma-restaurant-closing\">Noma</a>, the perennially lauded fine dining restaurant (which may or may not be <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/noma-restaurant-closing\">shuttering</a> in the near future?) that pioneered New Nordic cuisine. Copenhagen‚Äôs pastries and coffee, too, are widely regarded as some of the finest in the world‚Äîinspired to bring back a bag of grounds for my parents from <a href=\"https://www.prologcoffee.com/\">Prolog Coffee</a> in the meatpacking district on a prior trip, I was overwhelmed by a vast and nuanced selection of beans sourced judiciously from around the world and roasted locally in nearby Refshale√∏en.</p>\n    <p>But there‚Äôs something uniquely accessible, satisfying, comforting, and consistent about a Danish hot dog, an affordable foil to an otherwise very expensive dining city. Most will set you back just about 30 Danish kroner, or roughly $5. ‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt be more, and definitely shouldn‚Äôt be less,‚Äù says my boyfriend. It‚Äôs as reliably delightful as it is egalitarian.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/the-best-meal-i-had-in-copenhagen-was-an-airport-hot-dog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Read on for the pantry products our editors swear by, and how we use them to escape the dreaded dinner rut.</p>\n<h2>Our top picks</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>You won't believe it's not takeout</strong>:<a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/2MivCay8tNdgaQiP3WKHCXDHamNgbGrgqAuuWnNAFxdUfdS2szPt7xssTYdpizHF9BTuJpSWfmLdkHxu7bQKxXbZUQcWrhEcEkacsV3aYYgJqjTvNfdgGSB7CkL9M1bcuACHEsRQTdaHc6sjCJrKDzmSJFCTriMazNqCYYJT4scLXLYzh1CEWqrFrBJdPCWVZvYLxpxFAMPvAhcQztGP3yAgU8rFcXEDyb2DmAxcrfttDFdup6JvTuctDED5jodRSBoyoo2WMgWZNsFyG8Cwk49mZ2dLRNhKfoP2Pk3SJuKEWyUDKDNbdfSkwrw8S9ZRAvV8yvut2owbyUbaV95QWNPdouZznNn4ujv85B3TevSs7gpf3GsMAaAm8kMNwjUutrW\">Maesri Green Curry Paste</a></li>\n      <li><strong>For a fast chili or loaded quesadilla</strong>:<a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/9t8kf9Usx7ZykJ1tbWM8zXPimjBFspLgk8suMDLDaXLdJiKGLZUZvs2SLHdvYJgWm51RsXyPNTvST42qX5tMxGH3UQpiywAhzgQ7LB7i2FzJRMd34QVr5fDwLAgKw58gJnzcqd5sq8LWytSyiNrnYRWLsQXu2WmsBNsueKtgvMwDBbqjVzjCMhRNaWuH9EfHYNHuujxNaWado9SAFyr9ZGsqsA7SAcwWVEWQfednELYyfqXqd8azVeDNjnUcHYfWua2m1J6pM5DSUTU4n6ZmKwVVgcmgNi9TGEnmEMwZtQPPTXnoQBCxzeSeKS4F7evqYbAdQK4BujtF5ProCm9YrnZpSXq8Lt4iFv3wAT2nVAHHK4Dqj4JaKj2jr92t33UqHnVnFPCW\">HeyDay Canning Co.

It‚Äôs the best store-bought one I‚Äôve tried, and my secret to easy weeknight fridge cleanout dinners. I was introduced to it when I developed a recipe for <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/green-curry-coconut-cod\">Green Curry Coconut Cod</a> and have been hooked ever since. Chock full of fresh green chilis, lemongrass, kaffir lime, ginger, and spices, it‚Äôs one of the only curry pastes I‚Äôve found that‚Äôs complex, balanced, and <i>actually</i> spicy.</p>\n<p>Since the cod only uses about half a can, I‚Äôll save the other half in my fridge for the next time I need to scrounge together something nourishing for dinner. I saute the paste in a skillet with some oil and alliums if I have them, then add in coconut milk (which I try to keep on hand), whatever veggies I find in the depths of my fridge (usually a head of cabbage), and some sort of protein (like the fish fillets I often stash in my freezer). I serve the curry over rice and bam‚Äîdinner is ready in a matter of 15 minutes.</p>\n<h2>Heyday Canning Co. Canned Beans</h2>\n<p>There is one ingredient in my pantry that I keep stocked three or four items deep, and that‚Äôs the canned beans from Heyday Canning Co. These preseasoned beans are swimming in sauces built from intensely flavorful ingredients like lemongrass, galangal, guajillo chile peppers, kimchi (yes, actual kimchi), and gochujang. They‚Äôre bold, layered, and taste like someone already did all the hard work of seasoning dinner for you.</p>\n<p>My go-to is the Coconut Curry Chickpeas, a Malaysian-inspired curry with ginger, galangal, lemongrass, and Makrut lime. I warm it up with frozen cauliflower and peas, then spoon it over rice or garlic naan if I have some in the freezer. I also find myself constantly buying tortillas and shredded cheese so I can make quesadillas with Heyday‚Äôs Enchilada Black Beans or use them as a shortcut base for a weeknight chili. ‚Äî<a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/contributor/olivia-tarantino\">Olivia Tarantino</a>, senior commerce editor</p>\n<h2>Red Boat Vietnamese Lemongrass Curry</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/time-saving-pantry-products\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>When Rami Metal walks through the scores of booths at the Armory Show, he looks not only for attention-grabbing paintings but also those that would make great puzzles.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI try to find things that are more detailed and have more variance of color,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf you have 1,000 pieces and 200 of them are pieces of sky, it‚Äôs not fun. You‚Äôll get through 80 percent of the puzzle and say, ‚ÄòUgh, the sky.‚Äô‚Äù</p>\n<p>Museum gift shops have sold puzzle sets of Impressionist and abstract masterworks for years, but there have been few options on the market featuring works by living artists who haven‚Äôt yet had their MoMA retrospective.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs starting to change. A handful of independent jigsaw companies, including Metal‚Äôs <a href=\"https://hellokinstler.com/\">Kinstler Puzzles</a> and <a href=\"https://www.apostrophepuzzles.com/\">Apostrophe Puzzles</a>, have been licensing the work of painters virtually unknown outside the art world for their brainteasers.¬†</p>\n<p>Apostrophe founder Mandi Masden was inspired to launch her Brooklyn-based puzzle company in 2019 after she came across a portrait by artist Charly Palmer that was outside her budget. Her friend gave her a custom puzzle of the artwork instead, prompting her to think about how puzzles could make contemporary art more accessible to the public.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI was really into puzzles as a kid, and I knew a lot of us had memories of them from our childhoods, but the industry itself felt stuck in the past,‚Äù Masden said. ‚ÄúI wanted to make puzzles that focused on celebrating the talent, creativity, and perspective of artists of color, while catering to a segment of the market largely ignored by the industry.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Metal, also a passionate puzzler, found himself fitting together tiny cardboard pieces of Pieter Bruegel‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Tower of Babel‚Äù (c. 1563) and Hieronymus Bosch‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Garden of Earthly Delights‚Äù (c. 1490‚Äì1510) for hours at a time well into adulthood. It was while he gallery-hopped in Chelsea and breezed through art fairs that he realized that the worlds of art puzzles and contemporary art rarely overlapped, and became inspired to combine them.</p>\n<p>Pitching the idea of producing puzzles out of contemporary art to galleries and artists before he actually launched his business was harder. But Washington-based artist Andrea Joyce Heimer liked the concept, and licensed a rendition of her 2019 painting, ‚ÄúIn The Summer We Started Drinking During The Hot Of The Day And By Night Time We Were Monsters.‚Äù He launched Kinstler in 2021 with two additional puzzles by artists Simone Johnson and Rusudan Khizanishvili.</p>\n<p>This month, Kinstler is releasing a new puzzle of Korean artist Ken Gun Min‚Äôs 2023 painting ‚ÄúStranger by the Lake (Bare Ass Creek),‚Äù an homage to a nude sunbathing spot in Los Angeles that was destroyed in a 2009 fire. Min, too, has loved playing with puzzles since he was a child. He was fascinated by the fact that individual fragments didn‚Äôt make visual sense until he fitted them together. Now he sees comparisons between the visual riddles and his current practice.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a mix of abstraction and spontaneity ‚Äî gestural brushstrokes, layers of pigment meeting embroidery ‚Äî but when you step back, they come together to form a story,‚Äù Min said.</p>\n<p>For Masden, a good puzzle starts with a compelling image that tells a story and has a strong point of view. She also loves discovering nuances of brushwork and the layers of depth in a mixed media piece.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something really poetic about the image that emerges from 1,000 tiny pieces of someone‚Äôs curiosity and exploration, and I love being surprised by where that journey takes me,‚Äù she said.</p>\n<p>Both Kinstler and Apostrophe have recruited a diverse stable of artists who earn a commission for every purchase, and their games are available for purchase in museums and bookstores across the country. The latter also donates a portion of each sale to a nonprofit organization working to expand arts education for communities of color.</p>\n<p>Lately, Metal has been drawn to work with subtle shifting color gradients and lots of visual activity. Umar Rashid‚Äôs ‚ÄúBattle of Malibu‚Äù (2020) portrays a fictitious uprising of Los Angeles-area Indigenous tribes against a European imperial force.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037461/the-rise-of-contemporary-art-puzzles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

After graduating from an all-Black high school, McNeil enrolled at the Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina (now North Carolina A&amp;T State University) in the fall of 1959.</p>\n<p>During his first semester on campus, McNeil started talking with a handful of his fellow dorm-mates about taking a stand against segregation. McNeil‚Äôs desire to take action was further solidified when, while returning to campus after the holiday break, he faced discrimination at a bus station in Richmond, Virginia.</p>\n<p>With support and funding from a handful of older Greensboro residents, McNeil and three classmates‚ÄîFranklin McCain, Ezell Blair Jr. (who later changed his name to Jibreel Khazan) and David Richmond‚Äîdecided to take action.</p>\n<p>On February 1, 1960, the four men sat down at the whites-only lunch counter at Woolworth‚Äôs in Greensboro. They tried to order coffee, but the waitress refused to serve them because they were Black. She called over the manager, who asked the four students to leave. But they stayed put.</p>\n<p>The restored Greensboro location of Woolworth‚Äôs was named a <a href=\"https://www.sitinmovement.org/museum-news/post/2319583/restored-greensboro-f-w-woolworth-s-receives-highest-federal-landmark-designation\">National Historic Landmark</a> in late 2024.</p>\n<p>They remained seated even after a police officer showed up, and as white customers yelled racial slurs at them. Eventually, the manager closed the store early and the four men went home.</p>\n<p>They returned to the lunch counter over the next few days, bringing more and more classmates with them. By February 5, the peaceful sit-in had ballooned to hundreds of students, including¬†<a href=\"https://library.uncg.edu/the-woolworth-sit-ins-remembered-by-womans-college-alumni/\">white women</a> from the Woman‚Äôs College of the University of North Carolina (now the University of North Carolina at Greensboro).</p>\n<p>All along the East Coast, protesters began picketing at various Woolworth‚Äôs locations, demanding that the five-and-dime chain store allow Black patrons to sit at the lunch counter and be served. By the end of March, the demonstrations had spread to 54 cities and included thousands of students, per the <i>Times</i>.</p>\n<p>In May, the city of Nashville¬†<a href=\"https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2020/05/10/nashville-lunch-counters-desegregation-civil-rights/4807209002/\">integrated</a> its lunch counters. In late July, about six months after the first sit-in, the Greensboro Woolworth‚Äôs quietly desegregated its lunch counter. Four Black employees were the first to be served, according to¬†<a href=\"https://www.history.com/articles/the-greensboro-sit-in\">History.com</a>.</p>\n<p>McNeil graduated with a degree in engineering physics in 1963. He went on to serve in the U.S. Air Force, working as a navigator on an aerial refueling plane during the Vietnam War.</p>\n<p>He met and married Ina Brown while he was stationed in South Dakota. McNeil held numerous jobs over the course of his career, including as an investment banker, according to the¬†<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-sitin-civil-rights-obituary-0c13287d31e24c8f5f1f0dcee46039bd\">Associated Press</a>‚Äô Gary D.

We‚Äôre going to have to rethink the concept.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Scientists estimate that <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/an-estimated-20-quadrillion-ants-live-on-earth-180980804/\">20 quadrillion ants</a> are crawling around the Earth, according to a 2022 <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2201550119\">study</a>.</p>\n<p>Scientists recently discovered that Iberian harvester ant queens (<i>Messor ibericus</i>) mate with males of another species, the builder harvester ant (<i>Messor structor</i>). When they do, the <i>M. ibericus</i> queens store the <i>M. structor </i>male‚Äôs sperm, then use it to fertilize some of the eggs they lay. Researchers think the <i>M. ibericus</i> queens remove their own genetic material from the eggs‚Äô nuclei, so that when those eggs hatch, they effectively turn out to be <i>M. structor </i>male clones.</p>\n<p>The queens produce males of both <i>M. ibericus </i>and <i>M. structor</i>, and all the worker ants in <i>M. ibericus </i>colonies<i> </i>are female hybrids of the two species.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an absolutely fantastic, bizarre story of a system that allows things to happen that seem almost unimaginable,‚Äù says <a href=\"https://www1.bio.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/186303\">Jacobus Boomsma</a>, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Copenhagen who was not involved with the research, to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02807-0#ref-CR1\"> Nature</a>‚Äôs Max Kozlov.</p>\n<p>Even more perplexing is the fact that <i>M. ibericus </i>and<i> M. structor</i> are not closely related, evolutionarily speaking. The two species diverged more than five million years ago, according to the paper. For comparison, scientists think <a href=\"https://humanorigins.si.edu/education/frequently-asked-questions\">humans and chimpanzees</a> split from a common ancestor that lived between six million and eight million years ago.</p>\n<p>Proving the relationship between <i>M. ibericus</i> and <i>M. structor</i> was challenging. The scientists dug up various <i>M. ibericus</i> colonies they found along the sides of farm roads near Lyon, France, looking for male ants. But among a colony of 10,000 ants, there might be only a few males, writes <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/ant-queen-lays-eggs-hatch-two-species\"> Science</a>‚Äôs Erik Stokstad.</p>\n<p>In the end, they found 132 males from 26 <i>M. ibericus</i> colonies. Of those, about half were nearly hairless‚Äîa hallmark of <i>M. structor</i>‚Äîwhile the others were covered in dense hair, a trait typically found in <i>M. ibericus</i>. DNA testing confirmed their hunch: The hairy males were <i>M. ibericus</i>, and the bald ones were <i>M. structor</i>.</p>\n<p>Even more intriguing, the males of both species shared <i>M. ibericus</i> mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited from the mother, suggesting they had all been born from <i>M. ibericus</i> queens.</p>\n<p>This discovery is so novel and so unusual that the researchers had to come up with a new term to describe the behavior exhibited by <i>M. ibericus</i> queens: ‚Äúxenoparity,‚Äù which essentially means ‚Äúforeign birth.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The team also wanted to go beyond genetic evidence: They hoped to observe births of <i>M. structor</i> ants from an <i>M. ibericus</i> queen. So, they reared colonies in their laboratory. Then, they waited.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt was very difficult, because in lab conditions, it‚Äôs nearly impossible to have males,‚Äù says co-author <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QuMuD-gAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Jonathan Romiguier</a>, an ecologist at the University of Montpellier in France, to <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2494855-queen-ant-makes-males-of-another-species-for-daughters-to-mate-with/\"> New Scientist</a>‚Äôs Tim Vernimmen. ‚ÄúWe had something like 50 colonies and monitored them for two years without a single male being born.

In 2021, that same mammoth <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/oldest-dna-sequenced-yet-comes-million-year-old-mammoths-180977035/\">made headlines</a> when scientists sequenced DNA from one of its molars.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/wkJlJ3-FIJ-yCNjAB6V4mp0Wp8M=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(2592x1728:2593x1729)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/7d/12/7d121e3d-a206-469c-8349-c3460b68d472/mammoth_foot_photo_by_love_dalen.jpg\" alt=\"Brown mammoth foot\"/>\n    <p>For the new study, scientists not only sequenced the DNA of the various mammoths‚Äîincluding 440 that had never been sequenced or published before‚Äîbut they also identified DNA from 310 different microbes living on or in the animals‚Äô tissues. Many of those microorganisms probably showed up after the mammoths died. But the scientists also identified six ‚Äúhost-associated‚Äù microbial groups that likely colonized the mammoths when they were still alive.</p>\n    <p>The researchers can‚Äôt say for certain, but the mammoths might have gotten sick from some of those microorganisms.

The idea for a cultural canon came from the Sweden Democrats, a right-wing, anti-immigration party that‚Äôs not in power but negotiated for the list‚Äôs creation as part of a coalition agreement.</p><p>One aspect of the canon that has made it especially contentious is that it only includes entries that are at least 50 years old.

The canon, he adds, can provide immigrants ‚Äúwith a map and a compass.‚Äù</p><p>Outcry over the list has persisted, including from one member who used to be on the committee tasked with compiling it. Marlen Eskander, founder of the Reading Promotion Institute, left the committee last year and says the canon is ‚Äúvery exclusionary,‚Äù per the¬†<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/02/outcry-as-swedish-cultural-canon-snubs-abba-and-anything-since-1975\"> Guardian</a>‚Äôs Miranda Bryant.</p><p>‚ÄúSetting a 50-year limit is deliberately excluding contemporary experiences,‚Äù Eskander tells the Swedish newspaper <i>Svenska Dagbladet</i>, per the <i>Guardian</i>.

Do I need any more proof of the power of advertising?</p>\n<p>Now, with the release of a study showing a direct correlation between a kid‚Äôs exposure to alcohol advertising and how much of those alcohol brands they consume, I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs time to start recording football games and watching them via our DVR so we can fast-forward through the commercials.</p>\n<p>\n            ‚ÄúFor a long time, a lot of people said, ‚ÄòWell advertising doesn‚Äôt really make a difference,‚Äô ‚Äù when it comes to the impact on underage drinking, said <a href=\"http://www.bumc.bu.edu/care/faculty/timothy-naimi/\">Dr. Timothy Naimi, </a>the lead researcher on the new study and an associate professor at Boston University‚Äôs Schools of Medicine and Public Health.\n    </p>\n<p>Now, there is a good body of evidence showing that when kids are exposed to advertising for a particular brand, they‚Äôre more likely to drink that brand, he said. What‚Äôs been missing until now is an exploration of whether the alcohol ads don‚Äôt just influence the brands underage drinkers tend to choose but how much they drink in total.</p>\n<p>\n            The new study, published in the <a href=\"http://www.jsad.com/doi/abs/10.15288/jsad.2016.77.723\">Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs</a>, was based on a sample of more than 1,000 13- to 20-year-olds from across the country who said they had alcohol in the past month. Researchers then asked if they watched any of the 20 most popular non-sports television shows and how much they consumed of the 61 alcohol brands showcased in commercials during those shows.\n    </p>\n<p>What they found is those underage drinkers who didn‚Äôt see any alcohol ads drank about 14 drinks per month. That number rose to 33 drinks per month for the young people who had seen what amounts to an average amount of alcohol advertising, said Naimi. Underage drinkers exposed to the greatest amount of alcohol ads drank 200-plus drinks in the past month, he said, though very few of those in the study drank that much.</p>\n<p>\n            After factoring out that kids who watch more television may be more likely to drink anyway, researchers concluded that the more exposure kids had to these alcohol ads, the greater the amount they consumed of those brands. These findings are even more significant when you consider <a href=\"http://www.jsad.com/page/news/may2016\">the findings of another study</a>, which found that kids ages 11 to 14 typically see two to four alcohol ads per day.\n    </p>\n<p>‚ÄúI think the message is that this adds to evidence that alcohol advertising matters in terms of youth drinking and it demonstrates good support for the idea that alcohol advertising is not only related to which brands kids might choose to drink but how much they choose to drink in total,‚Äù said Naimi.</p>\n<h2>\n        <strong>Parents the greatest influence on a child‚Äôs drinking</strong>\n</h2>\n<p>\n            Ralph Blackman is president and chief executive officer of <a href=\"http://responsibility.org/\">Responsibility.org</a>, a not-for-profit organization funded by the country‚Äôs biggest distillers. The organization is devoted to reducing drunken driving and underage drinking and promoting responsible drinking among people who are legally allowed to consume alcohol. \n    </p>\n<p>While Blackman said he and his team had not been able to review the findings of this newest study to determine their validity, he said parents ‚Äì more than advertising ‚Äì play the biggest role in determining a kid‚Äôs decision to drink.</p>\n<p>\n            Parents were found to wield 71 times more influence over their children‚Äôs decision to drink versus advertising, according to the <a href=\"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2016/images/09/07/influencesonyouthsdecisionsaboutdrinking-2016-03-11.pdf\">2016 Roper Youth Report</a> (PDF).\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/07/health/kids-alcohol-ads-impact-underage-drinking/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The other, starting with the fuzzy pillows and puffy comforter, is an ode to purple.</p>\n<p>Kim Woodford is the pink aficionado in this well-kept townhome in Brooklyn. She‚Äôs 51 and believes in Santa. Her roommate, Darvena Idlet, is the same age; they‚Äôve lived together for about 45 years.</p>\n<p>What bound these women together so long ago was an illness that struck while they were in their mothers‚Äô wombs. It robbed them of their hearing and much of their vision, and it damaged their brains.</p>\n<p>They have congenital rubella syndrome, which they acquired during an outbreak of the rubella virus, or German measles. The epidemic swept across America from late 1963 into 1965, infecting an estimated 12.5 million people. And though the symptoms of the virus are generally minor, if detected at all, it takes its harshest toll on the unborn babies of infected pregnant women.</p>\n<p>The story of Kim and Darvena, and thousands of others like them, has largely been forgotten in the United States. But the threat posed by a new virus, Zika, has those intimately familiar with the 1960s rubella outbreak asking pointed questions.</p>\n<p>Who is going to take care of the babies irreparably damaged after being born to Zika-infected women? What resources will be available to their families, whose lives will be forever changed? Who‚Äôll step in to help those mothers left alone after fathers walk away? And what will become of these children when they are adults still in need of around-the-clock care?</p>\n<p>What happened more than a half century ago, they say, should serve as a warning now.</p>\n<h2>Hoping for the best</h2>\n<p>Florence Woodford knew her baby might be harmed when she contracted the rubella virus early in her pregnancy. A doctor with the health department who paid a visit to her Brooklyn home told her as much. If her child survived, he said, she or he could be saddled with a long list of disabilities.</p>\n<p>\n            Though it was largely illegal at the time, the doctor suggested Florence consider having an abortion. The US medical community was finding ways to work around restrictions; ultimately the <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/09/health/rubella-abortion-zika/\">rubella virus helped make abortion legal</a>. \n    </p>\n<p>But abortion wasn‚Äôt an option for Florence, a devout Catholic. She chose to hope for the best and believed by keeping her baby she‚Äôd be rewarded. When Kim was born with cataracts, she rejoiced.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs wonderful. That‚Äôll be OK. We could fix that,‚Äù Florence, 76, remembers saying about her second born. ‚ÄúAnd then as time went on, we found out it was a lot more than that.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Kim was among the 20,000 US-born babies harmed by congenital rubella syndrome in the mid-‚Äô60s. They faced a lifetime of defects including deafness, blindness, heart disease, neuromuscular tightness and spasticity, intellectual disabilities, autism and more. During the same period, there were 2,100 neonatal deaths and 11,250 abortions and miscarriages, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>\n<p>Kim ‚Äúlooked different,‚Äù Florence recalls. She was unable to roll over or sit up. She couldn‚Äôt hear. When Florence held her, Kim threw back her head as if she were struggling to see. She cried more than other babies.</p>\n<p>The challenges Kim and her family faced would only grow as she did. Some of the earliest doctors who saw her said she‚Äôd never walk or be toilet trained.</p>\n<p>But then a social worker showed up, first prodding and later insisting that Florence take Kim into Manhattan, where Dr. Louis Cooper headed up the Rubella Project, a long-term research and care effort he founded at Bellevue Hospital.</p>\n<p>Florence wept the entire ride there. She was sure Kim would be taken away from her. Instead, with the doctor‚Äôs help, she found hope.</p>\n<h2>Desperate for answers</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/08/health/rubella-house-zika-babies-future/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>Story highlights</h3>\n<p>Olympian Allison Schmitt struggled with depression after the 2012 London Games</p>\n<p>The swimmer decided to open up after her cousin's suicide</p>\n<p>\n            Imagine that swimming is what you‚Äôve loved for more than 15 years, but whenever you dive into the pool, you feel like a disappointment, unmotivated to go forward. The feeling is almost destructive. That was what was going on in <a href=\"http://www.teamusa.org/usa-swimming/athletes/Allison-Schmitt\">Allison Schmitt</a>‚Äôs mind during training after the 2012 London Olympic Games. \n    </p>\n<p>It hasn‚Äôt always been that way.</p>\n<p>To Schmitt, swimming is a lifestyle, not a responsibility. Even when she felt stressed, she wouldn‚Äôt see swimming as a burden. Instead, she looked at it as something fun.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what keeps me going,‚Äù she said.</p>\n<p>In and out of the pool, Schmitt keeps a positive attitude. She prefers to be a happy person, not the downer. ‚ÄúLaugh it off‚Äù is her go-to coping mechanism.</p>\n<p>Jack Bauerle, Schmitt‚Äôs coach at the University of Georgia until 2013, has known her since 2005. He calls her a giver. ‚ÄúSometimes, she puts her feelings in the back burner so that she could help others,‚Äù Bauerle said.</p>\n<h2>Road to the Olympics</h2>\n<p>A swimming career that would net eight Olympic medals started when Schmitt was 9. As ‚Äúthe kid that wanted to [play] every sport,‚Äù Schmitt was a soccer player but didn‚Äôt end up making the team. She decided to devote her athletic spirit and talents to the pool.</p>\n<p>In fact, Schmitt didn‚Äôt quite like swimming at first; she was just following her older sister, Kirsten. Her fondness for swimming grew as she made friends on the team, and those relationships became an increasingly important part of her life.</p>\n<p>Growing up swimming, Schmitt has always been disciplined. No matter how busy the training, she made sure that she finished schoolwork and didn‚Äôt miss classes.</p>\n<p>It was a surprise when she found out that she made the Olympic team for the 2008 Beijing Games. She thought she wouldn‚Äôt be qualified because she was the ‚Äúslow kid.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt feel like she belonged on the team and even had a ‚Äúbreakdown‚Äù during the training camp.</p>\n<p>Winning a bronze medal in the 4x200-meter freestyle relay and almost making it to the 200-meter freestyle final during the Games gave her confidence.</p>\n<p>Between 2008 and 2012, she trained as hard as she could while studying psychology at the University of Georgia. Before the London Games, she took a year off from school to concentrate on preparing for the game.</p>\n<p>Her effort paid off: She hauled in three golds in the 2012 Games.</p>\n<h2>The shadows of depression</h2>\n<p>The London Olympics marked a high point in Schmitt‚Äôs swimming career. After that, depression crept in.</p>\n<p>She became cranky and got irritated at minor problems. She remembered getting mad at not having the sports drink that she liked on the day of training and thinking, ‚ÄúThis is the worst day ever.‚Äù</p>\n<p>She began to sleep more and more. When she entered the water, she didn‚Äôt feel motivated, instead thinking she was a disappointment.</p>\n<p>Schmitt didn‚Äôt want others to notice. All she wanted was for her team to achieve its goal and to do what she could as a good teammate.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúAllison is the last person you would think that will get depressed,‚Äù said Bob Bowman, Schmitt‚Äôs coach since 2006. ‚ÄúShe just has a bubbly, happy and smiling personality.‚Äù</p>\n<p>He knew something was off when he got calls from a crying, upset Schmitt after the London Games.</p>\n<p>Her performance in the pool also tipped her off. ‚ÄúThe spirit wasn‚Äôt there,‚Äù said Bauerle, Schmitt‚Äôs Georgia swimming coach. ‚ÄúYou could just see the difference sometimes.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Bauerle thought it was just a passing phase, ‚Äúpost-Olympic blues.‚Äù But for Schmitt, this ‚Äúphase‚Äù lasted a little too long.</p>\n<p>She had kept her struggles from friends and family. The hidden pains, however, didn‚Äôt fool fellow Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, her surrogate brother.</p>\n<p>In January 2015, Schmitt was at what she calls the breaking point. She would dive into the water, thinking, ‚Äúoh, my gosh, I can‚Äôt do this anymore.‚Äù She became angrier and more isolated. Then Phelps reached out, telling Schmitt that he would be there to help if she needed anything. Coaches and teammates also came to her aid.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/09/health/turning-points-allison-schmitt-depression-struggle/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The participants were asked to taste different liquid solutions of simple and more complex carbohydrates under normal conditions and then while the sweet receptors on their tongues were blocked.</p>\n<p>The researchers discovered that even when the sweet taste receptors were blocked, the study participants could still detect a starchy taste.</p>\n<p>It was previously assumed that starch was tasteless, but the new findings suggest that starch is broken down into glucose oligomers by an enzyme in our saliva, called alpha-amylase, and these so-called glucose oligomers can be tasted, Lim said.</p>\n<p>Some of the study participants described the taste of glucose oligomers as cereal-like, bread-like or rice-like and generally ‚Äústarchy.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt has long been assumed that simple sugars are the only class of carbohydrates that humans can taste. Thus our findings are surprising,‚Äù Lim said.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúAt the same time, I am not surprised, because humans use starch as a major source of energy, which enables the body to perform its functions.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The team noted its study shows the first direct demonstration that humans can taste glucose oligomers and reveals that human taste is much more complicated than previously thought.</p>\n<h3>Content by Food &amp; Wine</h3>\n<p/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"http://www.foodandwine.com/fwx/slideshow/most-insane-restaurants?xid=pd_cnn_sept16_healthtest\">The most insane restaurants</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"http://www.foodandwine.com/slideshows/best-pizza-unexpected-places?xid=pd_cnn_sept16_healthtest\">The best pizza in unexpected places</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"http://www.foodandwine.com/slideshows/best-burgers-us?xid=pd_cnn_sept16_healthtest\">Best burgers in the US</a>\n    </p>\n<p>For instance, ‚Äúas much as we know that glucose oligomer detection is not through the sweet taste receptor, we do not yet know the exact mechanism of how we detect them,‚Äù Lim said.</p>\n<p>As the mechanism remains a mystery, some scientists said they are dubious about the new study.</p>\n<p>\n            ‚ÄúIt is not likely to be a sixth taste. Instead it is probably just another version of sweet taste initiated by the taste cells that respond to sugars, noncaloric sweeteners and sugar polymers,‚Äù said Dr. <a href=\"http://www.monell.org/faculty/people/margolskee\">Robert Margolskee</a>, director and president of Monell Chemical Senses Center, who was not involved in the study. \n    </p>\n<p>‚ÄúMechanistically it is plausible that there is either a glucose oligomer receptor ‚Ä¶ or that it is from enzymatic breakdown within the oral cavity of the glucose polymers into glucose that then gets transported into the sweet-responding taste cells,‚Äù he said.</p>\n<h2>Other candidates for the sixth taste</h2>\n<p>It isn‚Äôt the first time scientists have made the case for a sixth taste.</p>\n<p>\n            Last year, researchers at Purdue University published a study in <a href=\"http://chemse.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/07/02/chemse.bjv036.abstract\">the journal Chemical Senses</a> that suggested we can detect fat as a taste.\n    </p>\n<p>For the study, which involved two separate experiments, researchers asked 102 adults to taste multiple cups of solutions that each contained a compound for either sweet, sour, salty, bitter, umami or fatty tastes. The study participants were asked to sort each solution into the taste group to which they believed it belonged.</p>\n<p>\n            The researchers noticed the participants succeeded in <a href=\"http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2015/Q3/research-confirms-fat-is-sixth-taste-names-it-oleogustus.html\">grouping the fatty acids together</a> and separately from the other solutions.\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/07/health/starchy-sixth-taste-discovered/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Among the 2,800 girls who participated in the study from 2003 to 2006, 1,200 were randomly assigned to participate in baby simulator programs, while the rest underwent the standard pregnancy prevention curriculum.</p>\n<p>\n            The simulator program, called <a href=\"http://www.virtualparenting.com.au/\">Virtual Infant Parenting</a>, is an adaptation of the American <a href=\"http://www.realityworks.com/products/realcare-baby\">Baby Think It Over</a> program, created by Realityworks. The VIP program consists of workbooks, documentary viewing, four educational sessions and caring for interactive baby dolls over the weekend, from Friday afternoon to Monday morning. \n    </p>\n<p>The fake baby cries when it needs be fed, burped, rocked or changed and tracks mishandling and how well the doll is cared for. At the time of the study, each doll cost about $1,200 Australian, equivalent to about $900 US.</p>\n<p>The study found that 8% of girls who cared for the model babies had given birth at least once by age 20, compared with only 4% of those who took the standard classes. Similarly, 9% of girls in the baby simulator group had at least one abortion, compared with 6% of the non-baby group.</p>\n<p>\n            This is the first long-term study to look at pregnancy outcomes of the program throughout girls‚Äô entire teenage years until they turn 20, said epidemiologist <a href=\"http://telethonkids.org.au/our-people/staff-student-index/b/sally-anne-brinkman/\">Sally Brinkman</a> of the Telethon Kids Institute at the University of Western Australia and lead author of the study. \n    </p>\n<h2>‚ÄòClearly, the program doesn‚Äôt work‚Äô</h2>\n<p>The researchers took into account the girls‚Äô socioeconomic status, family type, prior sexual experience, prior baby-caring responsibility, level of psychological distress, smoking and alcohol use, and education, but the difference between the two groups remains significant.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt is definitely more than just a trend,‚Äù Brinkman said. ‚ÄúClearly, the program doesn‚Äôt work.‚Äù</p>\n<p>According to the study, schools in over 89 countries use the Realityworks baby simulator program, including the United States.</p>\n<p>The president and CEO of Realityworks, Timm Boettcher, said the study recklessly associated its products with the Australian health agencies‚Äô adapted versions.</p>\n<p>The study ‚Äúwas not a representation of our curriculum and simulator learning modality, but the researchers‚Äô ‚Äòadaptation‚Äô and is consequently not reflective of our product nor its efficacy,‚Äù Boettcher said in a statement. ‚ÄúThe RealCare Program, is a combination of curriculum and hands-on aids, and if they are being tested and judged for effectiveness should be judged in their entirety.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Brinkman said that although her study didn‚Äôt involve as many educational sessions as Realityworks‚Äô programs, what the researchers did for the study is overall ‚Äúvery similar‚Äù to what Realityworks recommends. ‚ÄúI would be surprised to see a couple of more educational sessions would make a difference on the results,‚Äù she said.</p>\n<p>She and her colleagues have advocated for an end to the fake baby program, but some schools asked whether the program should be tweaked or the girls should have the fake babies for longer.</p>\n<p>Brinkman is not sure whether such amendments would have an impact and compared the scenario to testing a drug. If research evidence has clearly pointed out adverse effects, ‚Äúit‚Äôs generally not a thing for people to say ‚Äòoh, they just need more of the drug.‚Äô ‚Äú</p>\n<p>Brinkman considers this a cautionary tale and hopes long-term studies can be conducted in the future to evaluate the effectiveness of educational programs before they are widely implemented and cost taxpayers‚Äô money.</p>\n<h2>‚ÄòMaybe it wasn‚Äôt that bad‚Äô</h2>\n<p>Due to the anonymous nature of the study, researchers were unable to pinpoint reasons why the program might not work as well as planned.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/08/30/health/baby-simulator-teenage-pregnancy/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
