    "body": "<h2>Lily Dale is home to about 40 mediums who connect thousands of spiritual seekers with their deceased loved ones</h2>\n<p>As I enter through the gates of Lily Dale, beneath a sign that reads “World’s Largest Center for the Religion of Spiritualism,” life’s pace seems to slow. People rest and chat on the wide porches of Victorian houses, which date back to the years following the western New York community’s founding as a spiritualist camp, in 1879. The small residential neighborhood, about an hour southwest of Buffalo, is easily walkable for most. The occasional passing car is limited to a speed of five miles per hour, so sidewalks are unnecessary. Cats wander the streets along with the pedestrians. On one side of town, kayakers paddle the mirror-clear Cassadaga Lake, its shores dotted with weeping willows, and on the other, hikers wander the trails of an old-growth forest.</p>\n<p>There’s a quiet here, and a feeling of having stepped back in time. So when the spirits start talking, it seems natural, even peaceful.</p>\n<p>The dead are as alive as the living in Lily Dale. The 40 or so mediums who live and work here, identified by colorful signs outside their homes, serve as their voice. The hamlet’s population is only about 300, but in the summer, 15,000 to 20,000 people flock here to immerse themselves in the practices of spiritualism, a philosophy and religion that believes in death as a transition to a higher plane of existence. According to spiritualists, the living can communicate with the dead, and in Lily Dale, that communication is part of everyday life.</p>\n<p>“What I love about this is that we let people know the continuity of life,” Michaelene “Mike” Clevenger, a registered medium, tells me as we sit in the light-filled “reading room” inside of her bright blue Victorian home. “That people don’t just vanish. And that heart connection is still there.”</p>\n<p>Mediums are central figures in spiritualism. They’re believed to be sensitive to the plane of existence where spirits reside, with the ability to deliver messages from the spirits to their loved ones. The talent isn’t necessarily innate, however; spiritualists assert that with practice, anyone can learn to access the spirit realm. And because these spirits are thought to possess a more evolved consciousness, they can offer the living guidance and knowledge. Receiving messages from a deceased loved one can also be a deeply healing experience, mediums say.</p>\n<p>“People come and they haven’t felt their loved ones around them, and I’m able to help them connect,” Willa White, a second-generation Lily Dale registered medium, tells me. “And they’re like, ‘Oh my gosh, that really is my mom, that is my dad, that is my son’—whoever it is and it blows them away. It makes them realize that the love hasn’t died.”</p>\n<p>Mediums in this particular community must undergo an intense, two-year vetting process to be registered with the <a href=\"https://www.lilydaleassembly.org/\">Lily Dale Assembly</a>, the group that operates the spiritualist hub, before they can offer their services. After applying, they sit for an interview with the assembly board and the Lily Dale Mediums League, according to Barry Gasaway, board vice president. The Mediums League, a group of registered mediums that raises funds, hosts events and works out the mediums’ contracts and schedules, created the standards by which new mediums are tested—although the Lily Dale Assembly board has the final say over which mediums are accepted. If a candidate is accepted, they’ll test for a year by participating in outdoor “<a href=\"https://www.lilydaleassembly.org/happenings\">message services</a>” during which mediums convey messages from departed loved ones to a select few in an audience of several dozen to more than 100 people, and <a href=\"https://www.lilydaleassembly.org/mondaynightcircles\">Monday Night Circles</a>, where mediums offer “mini-readings” to groups of three or four people. The board and the Mediums League then decide whether to advance the candidate to year two. Candidates must also conduct private readings, and they’re evaluated on their performance. If they pass, they are allowed to register with the assembly and must renew their registration every year. These mediums are a major draw for visitors who pay for private readings in addition to a $15 daily community access fee during the summer.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/the-tiny-new-york-town-where-mediums-give-voice-to-the-dead-180987270/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Animals of all kinds mix and mingle in the underground refuges, offering troubling opportunities for diseases to jump species</h2>\n<p><i>In theory, it would take just one of these monkeys to bring Paris to a standstill. Or New York City. Or, for that matter, Belgium</i>, thought Belgian ecologist Cédric Vermeulen as he watched recent video footage of patas monkeys, vervet monkeys and a host of other animals navigating the entrances to aardvark burrows in Senegal’s Niokolo-Koba National Park.</p>\n<p>“It was incredible how many species were coming inside, outside and around the burrow,” Vermeulen says. Predators and prey were practically rubbing shoulders as they shuttled in and out of the burrows; warthogs, guinea fowl, leopards, partridges, pythons, porcupines, honey badgers and baboons all made appearances. But what really caught Vermeulen’s attention in the footage he had acquired from remote cameras was the sight of bats and monkeys using the same burrow. Certain bat species are reservoirs for well-documented zoonoses—diseases that jump from animals to humans. Given the close relationship between monkeys and people, the overlap with bats raises the possibility that aardvark burrows are overlooked epicenters of pathogens spilling over from the wild to the human world.</p>\n<p>Vermeulen is a professor at Belgium’s University of Liège, but he grew up in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has spent years researching forest habitats in Cameroon, Gabon and elsewhere in West Africa. To him, the number of animals visiting the burrow on a daily basis was astonishing. With the Covid-19 pandemic scarcely over, seeing so many species in such close contact also <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.71062?af=R\">raised the specter of something sinister</a>: the possibility that these burrows, and others like them, are incubators of disease.</p>\n<p>At 3,525 square miles, Senegal’s Niokolo-Koba National Park is roughly the size of the island of Hawaii. The park is a biodiversity hot spot with expansive wetland, savanna and woodland ecosystems that attract ecotourists and researchers alike. Aardvarks are some of the most common burrowers in the region, and during the dry season of 2023 and 2024, Vermeulen and four graduate students set up cameras to monitor 105 entrances to 92 different burrows.</p>\n<p>That animals are borrowing each other’s burrows <a href=\"https://www.biographic.com/its-time-for-natures-fire-brigade/\">is nothing new</a>. In the park’s scorching savanna, where temperatures can reach 118 degrees Fahrenheit, some animals will seek shelter underground wherever they can find it. Aardvark burrows are also havens for insects, so some animals, including primates, are likely lured in by the small packages of protein they can find lurking in the darkness.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/aardvark\">earth pig</a>\" in Afrikaans.</p>\n<p>Though earlier research has shown that in arid climates aardvark burrows are regularly visited by various mammals, birds and reptiles, scientists in general have spent little time studying how animals mingle in underground habitats. And as Vermeulen says, some visitor pairings are more worrisome than others. One of the species spotted swooping into Niokolo-Koba park’s aardvark burrows, for instance, was the large-eared slit-faced bat (<i>Nycteris macrotis</i>), which is a known carrier of coronaviruses that can infect both primates and humans.</p>\n<p>Scientists have known for decades that bats are natural hosts for common viruses, including rabies, measles, mumps and canine distemper. But over the past 25 years, bats have caught the attention of epidemiologists for carrying emerging viruses like Nipah, Marburg and many coronaviruses, which can all cause severe infectious disease. Ebola is a formidable virus that likely moved from bats to primates to humans. The problem is not the bats themselves, <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/bats-newfoundland-labrador-1.5604728\">which are invaluable to ecosystems</a>, but the chain of infection they set off: A monkey may eat an infected bat and then itself end up as a bush meat meal for a person. Or, a fruit-eating bat may contaminate a mango, which is then picked up and eaten by a person.</p>\n<p>Though we don’t typically think of monkeys as burrow dwellers, they do venture up to 6.5 feet inside, Vermeulen says. “And after that they go to the tourist camp or into the fields to eat human crops.” The park-run tourist camp, Niokolodge, is within four miles of the burrows studied, offering an opportunity for pathogens to hop from bats, monkeys or other infected animals to people.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/could-aardvark-burrows-be-ground-zero-for-the-next-pandemic-180987225/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Growing up, we went to all the games at Stamford Bridge, competed in our local little league as though it were the Premier League, and followed Dad to the pub to watch Sunday matches (the cheeky chips and J2Os were at least half of the allure).</p>\n    <p>I’m pretty sure I’m 12 years old in this photo and closing in on the peak of my sporting career, as I got ready to play football at a nearby park with my siblings Jevan (then nine) and Kiran (just four). Although we didn’t always have the money for the expensive new kits every season (I’m sure you can spot my mismatched camo shorts), we always had <i>something</i> Chelsea to wear. My dad would often dodge the high ticket prices by taking us to watch the women’s team play, as well as the under-21s, where you would witness great talent at a fraction of the cost.</p>\n    <p>One of my most memorable football moments was the extraordinary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/22/chelsea-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">6-0 Chelsea victory against Arsenal in 2014</a>, which I got to enjoy alongside our extended family from the local area. In south-west London, particularly my area of Worcester Park, there has always been a strong Chelsea tradition as a result of the movement of working-class households out to the suburbs in response to overcrowding in inner-city areas like Kensington. This gave the area a strong football culture, which my family was more than happy to be a part of. Now, as a new generation is priced out of the suburbs, that community risks being broken up and dispersed across the country, where I’m sure it will find new places to call home.</p>\n    <p>Even though we’ve all grown up a bit since (it’s certainly been a few years since I’ve been to Stamford Bridge or donned a Chelsea shirt), I’ll always look back fondly on the childhood memories, even as our old kit finds its way from the back of my cupboard to a high street charity shop. Today, Dad still goes every Saturday to coach the little league team I joined almost a decade ago, where my youngest brother, Kiran, has taken my place. Even after a torn ligament left him with limited capacity for the sport, my father is still as committed to his club as ever. My hope is that one day I can give my future children their own memories to cherish, as he has done for me.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/01/my-favourite-childhood-outfit-we-couldnt-afford-new-kits-but-we-always-had-something-chelsea-to-wear\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She met fellow actor James Murray, 50, while working on the BBC drama Cutting It and they married in December 2007. In 2014, the couple set up the Murray Parish Trust in memory of their first child, Ella-Jayne, who died at eight months of a congenital heart defect in 2009. Relaunched as <a href=\"https://www.themurrayparishtrust.com/\">Imagine This</a>, it is the only UK charity solely dedicated to supporting the mental wellbeing of ill children and their families; earlier this year the pair received MBEs in recognition of this work. Sarah and James live in Hampshire with their teenage daughter, Nell.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Sarah</strong>\n      <br/>\n    </h2>\n<p>This picture was taken in Abersoch, north Wales. It was a beautiful summer and the first time I’d been to the house Jim used to own with his brother and sister. Not only was it meaningful to visit an important place for Jim, but it was a fun, party holiday. I look very carefree. We had been together a year.</p>\n<p>Although this image is very idyllic, the first part of our relationship was quite dramatic. It was the early 00s and we were out a lot in Soho, having a great time mostly, but also being fairly tempestuous together. The thing you really love about somebody often becomes the thing you find threatening. While Jim and I were drawn to each other because we’re both out-there, sociable characters, we probably tried to tame each other a bit – which, funnily enough, didn’t work.</p>\n<p>The first time I met Jim was at a party. I didn’t like him much. I thought he was a very attractive man, but once we spoke I realised he had recently worked with my ex-boyfriend and had a preconception of me based on what he’d heard about the relationship. Jim said something inappropriate about the breakup and I remember thinking, what a shame he’s so rude, considering he’s so nice-looking.</p>\n<p>The next time we met was a month later at a read-through for Cutting It. He walked in and I thought, “Christ, it’s him.” This time, we became good friends. I didn’t realise that I liked him romantically until some of the cast went to play pool one afternoon. Jim took a shot, and had his back to me, and I said to my friend, “Something’s happened. I really fancy him.” I guess it was love at first back.</p>\n<p>Just over a year after this photo was taken, we were married and I was pregnant. Jim and I lost our first daughter, Ella-Jayne, to Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. It was an incredibly distressing, life-changing time for us. My memories of that whole period are blurry. Even though she only lived for eight months, Ella-Jayne made a huge impression on so many people. Her memorial was a beautiful experience and we both read eulogies.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t easy on our relationship; Jim and I found it difficult to look after each other. Grief is all-consuming and we realised we had to do something. We found this amazing initiative called <a href=\"https://handsupholidays.com/\">Hands Up Holidays</a>, and went to Vietnam and Cambodia to work in various orphanages. On our return, we felt an enormous amount of strength, having been with children who had experienced unimaginable trauma but still had smiles on their faces. If they could carry on, so could we.</p>\n<p>The death of a child is difficult to get through as a couple, and maybe without setting up our charity we wouldn’t have made it. Now, Imagine This takes up most of our time, while acting feels like a holiday. We still have friends over to socialise every weekend, but we’re not nearly as wild as we were 20 years ago.</p>\n<p>Our relationship has settled into something much more peaceful. We’ve watched each other grow up, and now what I find most attractive about him isn’t nearly as superficial as the view of his back – it’s the way he throws himself into his passions.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>James</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/31/sarah-parish-and-james-murray-actors-married-look-back\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

New school year, new me, new cast-iron conviction I can put the rocky road on the top shelf after I’ve used it in my girls’ packed lunches and not get it down until tomorrow.</p>\n<p>This is the first and most pressing item on the list: diet. Ten days out from Iberico ham night at the all-inclusive buffet in Spain, and I’m still more jamón than woman. It wouldn’t have mattered 10 years ago. But you can’t stuff your face with cold cuts and eat cake for breakfast, lunch and dinner (what? I’d paid for it, am I <i>not </i>going to eat it?) in middle age without triggering intense thoughts of death. And so this morning, after the drop-off: a return to the thrilling self-denial of two slices of misery bread from the health food store (fibre content: dysentery level). And a resolve to settle on a stable position re chia seeds, once and for all.</p>\n<p>Also this morning, a cold, critical eye on the house after six weeks of people being in it all day. Pressing concerns include working out how to empty the chamber in the handheld vacuum and moving the leaning pile of clothes by the door to a charity shop – not a risk-free task, by the way. Shelter is so fancy these days that, like trying to offload books at Strand Books in New York, you suffer the very real possibility of being publicly shamed for having your sad castoffs from Primark rejected. On the pile, a single, bankable item – a Tory Burch shirt from back when I was trying to be someone else and a symbol of the occasional necessity of retiring one’s dreams. I will never get around to selling that shirt on Poshmark. I know that now.</p>\n<p>It’s the same every year, this routine. Even though it’s modish these days to accept that “resolutions” pinned to a particular time of year don’t work, and we’re better off tweaking our general attitude year-round, I won’t give up this enjoyable period. I like a few weeks of stern reckoning. At the very least, the shortlived gusts of energy that come with them can be enough to clean the fridge and figure out where that clicking sound’s been coming from. Not the smoke alarm.</p>\n<p>What remains curious is that the primary impetus during these periods tends towards small, trivial home- and diet-related chores, never anything big, like that massive deadline for the massive thing that’s on my mind and will somehow have to take care of itself. I know this is what we call displacement activity; the delusion that, through attention to the little things, we can get a better aerial view of What Is Really Going On. Which, in my case, for the past three months, has definitely been obscured by that pile of clothes by the door. It’s also the case that doing something physical but mindless, like wiping and scrubbing or folding and sorting, can put you in the slack-line mental state that allows bigger things to jump out. And I don’t mind a bit of displacement activity if it delivers the instant reward of striking one or two items off the endless mental to-do list.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/04/summer-resolution-new-school-year\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She lived on the pension and died with a run-down brick veneer villa unit in an over-50s complex, an old car worth close to nothing, and a small amount of cash.</p>\n<p>We were surprised she’d left that much. Yes, she’d worked full-time for 50 years, six days a week, and through much of the 70s and early 80s made close to $40,000 a year – or almost $250,000 in today’s money. Once she owned a beautiful home in Brisbane, on a huge block, in a tree-lined street. She took three holidays that I can recall: twice to Melbourne to visit me, and once to Cairns. She never held a passport. Her best dress came from Myer; everything else was from Kmart. She never went to the theatre or even the movies; she didn’t eat in restaurants or drink alcohol. She left no expensive jewellery or furniture, she gave nothing to charity, she wore no makeup, she had no fancy tastes in anything.</p>\n<p>So where did all the money go?</p>\n<p>She gambled it.</p>\n<p>When we were children, this meant the track, mostly at the Gabba dogs on Thursday nights or at the TAB where she worked, or, on her rare days off, via telephone betting. She knew the name of almost every dog and horse, every trainer, every jockey. I remember when my sister and I were little, she would drive us to the library at Carina and wait in the car, listening to the trots, while we chose our books.</p>\n<p>Then, in the early 90s when pokies were legalised in Queensland, she fell hard. She would spend most Saturdays and Sundays by herself in those dingy rooms, sitting on a stool, chain smoking and pressing the buttons for hours, watching the lights, praying for the bells to ring and for coins to tinkle from the slot. Hours would pass. She wouldn’t eat or drink much, in case someone took her machine while she went to the toilet and it paid out.</p>\n<p>It was more than a hobby. This was before mandated limits, and my mother gambled fast, ferociously, without any sign of fun. She grumbled. She swore and grimaced and cursed her luck and whatever club she was in and the way life was stacked against her. Watching her, I always felt she was hard at work at a job both difficult and unpleasant, as though she hated money and couldn’t wait to get rid of it.</p>\n<p>I understand that addiction is a complex pathology, but as a teenager I judged her. I sometimes wondered if, were she ever prevented from gambling for some reason, she would have emptied the contents of her purse into the sink and set fire to it.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/31/i-used-to-judge-my-mothers-gambling-addiction-now-i-think-she-was-longing-for-a-fairytale-ending\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Since my father’s funeral six months ago, I still call my mother almost every day. We live worlds apart, geographically and ideologically, but despite me being in Europe and she in the US, and despite our religious and political differences, we still manage to keep talking. After all, she’s my mom.</p>\n<p>This year has not been easy, having lost my job, my father and what continues to feel like my country. I worked for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usaid\">USAID</a> and believed in America’s capacity to help solve global problems while helping others in need, but the current administration ended such work, calling it wasteful. Two days after that, my father passed away, and as our family gathered to mourn, we received news that my mother’s cancer had returned and spread to her bones. Such news was devastating, but doctors offered hope. Though there was no cure, there was a pill available to stem the spread, sometimes even for many years.</p>\n<p>Even grief couldn’t bridge our differences, though. At our family gathering, my mother confronted me about USAID, claiming that the agency funded terrorists and performed sex changes on children. Such disinformation about our actual health and development programs had taken root and was spreading.</p>\n<p>I know I am not alone in a country of families divided by politics. In our case, my mother and most of my extended family have embraced a form of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/christianity\">Christianity</a> that intertwines closely with conservative politics. Some carry Patriot Bible editions with an American flag on the cover while others send their kids to school in T-shirts emblazoned with silhouettes of rifles.</p>\n<p>Our information environment accelerates these divisions. Last month, my mother forwarded an article arguing that people who criticize Israel don’t do so out of concern, say, for casualties, but from discomfort with accepting that God is always on Israel’s side. I tried to get her to see the humanity with the same principles she taught me – to love one another, to care about suffering – but she dismissed the suffering as “God keeping his promises”. I was irate and one sister had to break it up, and both sisters stayed silent about the point.</p>\n<p>Such clashes about principles are what test our relationship the most. We’ve learned boundaries, so when I talk to my mom, it’s generally about her treatment, the weather, plans for the day, family memories and family history. Like her medical treatment, our relationship requires attention to potential flare-ups.</p>\n<p>Obviously I am still coming to terms with our differences, but she is my mom and I love her. I keep calling and she keeps answering. And our relationship is improving. The calls were initially to keep her company, but they are turning out to be good for me, too, as I am learning better about what comprises our love. The conversations also feel symbolic of something larger.</p>\n<p>If I struggle to find common ground with my mom, how can I expect others to bridge similar divides? The essential functions of our body politic are under threat, and I suspect that, like my mother’s condition, there’s no single cure except the daily discipline of care and listening with mindful hearts.</p>\n<p>It is comforting to stay in our like-minded communities where our views face no challenge, where we don’t speak or, better, listen to others. It’s easy to dismiss those who disagree as uninformed rather than seeking the seed of peace, common ground. My mother raised me to be curious about the world, to care about people beyond our family, and to seek truth even when it’s uncomfortable, lessons that came from the same tradition of faith that now seems to divide us.</p>\n<p>I don’t pretend our calls are always easy or successful, but I am learning patience. I’m learning that to maintain the relationship requires me to show up consistently, avoid stepping on landmines but hold my ground on key principles (like love and peace), and to listen even when I am itching to challenge. And through our consistency, we are finding moments of genuine connection.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/28/usaid-trump-family-differences\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The TV, rotating between Bluey, the Wiggles and K-pop Demon Hunters (when the toddler is napping), has been on for days as we battle yet another winter lurgy that drains me yet barely touches the surface of my two daughters, who vomit on the carpet one minute then ask for ice-cream the next. My seven-year-old makes cameo appearances at school, only to catch the next illness and bring it home to the family, our toddler demonstrating what a fine job she’s doing at developing her immune system with fevers, snot, vomit and a bout of conjunctivitis that never seems to end. The house is covered in crumbs and yoghurt splodges, there are no clean clothes and the gastro I got on my birthday set off my chronic illness into the worst flare since being diagnosed in 2021.</p>\n<p>I am running on fumes, but there’s no stress leave when your boss is a toddler. Had I been born in 19th-century England, my “nervous exhaustion” would earn me an opium tincture and a month by the sea – which in my opinion was about the only bright idea they ever had for women’s health (the seaside, not the opium). But instead, I crawl through my days, exhausted and desperate for sleep, only to lie awake all night, shaking with unexplained panic as adrenaline courses through my body.</p>\n<p>The psychologist Herbert Freudenberger first popularised the term <i>burnout</i> in the 1970s after he experienced his own collapse while working punishing hours at a free substance abuse clinic in New York. He noticed the same exhaustion and disillusionment in fellow caregivers, whose state reminded him of the very addicts they were treating. Once shorthand for drug overuse, <i>burnout</i> was reimagined by Freudenberger to capture the toll of relentless caregiving – but Google the term today and it’s almost always framed in a corporate context, with domestic work and caregiving barely getting a mention.</p>\n<p>What exactly is burnout? <a href=\"https://www.beyondblue.org.au/mental-health/work/burnout\">Beyond Blue</a> describes it as a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by excessive demands, whether at work or in your personal life. At its core, burnout is the gradual erosion of energy and spirit, making even the simplest tasks feel monumental and everyday functioning almost impossible.</p>\n<p>In her 2023 memoir Holding the Baby, the journalist Nell Frizzell explores gendered attitudes toward tiredness. She notes how society valorises exhaustion in traditionally male-dominated roles like soldiers, financial traders or endurance athletes, while overlooking fatigue in roles largely carried out by women such as nurses, cleaners or breastfeeding mothers.</p>\n<p>Frizzell highlights the dangers of sleep deprivation and how parents, especially mothers, are expected to just “keep going”, tackling the mammoth task of keeping a tiny baby alive while recovering from pregnancy, birth and huge hormonal shifts. She shares “funny” anecdotes of “mistakes” mothers have made in the depths of exhaustion (making tea with a dishwashing tablet, trying to settle a baby upside down).</p>\n<p>But when we step back, it reveals a harsher reality: society isn’t structured to support mothers. If a parent were acting bizarrely due to drugs or alcohol, there would be concern and intervention; but when the cause is sleep deprivation, it’s shrugged off as par for the course. These anecdotes underscore just how physically and mentally taxing motherhood can be – demands that science confirms are truly extraordinary.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aaw0341\">2019 study in Science Advances</a> found that metabolic demands during pregnancy rival those of extreme endurance feats like the Tour de France, ultramarathons and Arctic expeditions, making it one of the most physically taxing human experiences. We would never hand an Arctic explorer a baby to care for full-time the minute they complete their expedition – so why do we expect women to manage full-time childcare the moment they give birth?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/26/theres-no-stress-leave-when-your-boss-is-a-toddler-but-theres-so-much-more-society-could-be-doing-to-help-mothers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>Thomas Swick Examines the Parallels Between Two Joyous (and Thankless) Vocations</h3>\n<p>The summer I graduated from college I started freelancing and took up tennis. The first venture was understandable—I wanted to be a writer, a still viable if inherently unstable profession in 1974—while the second was not so obvious, as we were still a few years away from America’s tennis boom. A Swede who looked like a Norse-god-turned-rock-star had won the French Open that spring, providing a hint of what was to come, but Björn Borg was not the reason people gravitated to the three public courts in my new Washington, DC, neighborhood. Most came for the exercise and the camaraderie; those courts were the only ones I’ve ever found that you could go to alone and find someone to hit with. Often, people playing singles would invite those waiting to join them for doubles.</p>\n<p>Writing and tennis became my two passions. Both require intense concentration, in order to be any good, and diligent practice, and both make use of imagination—which in tennis takes the form of anticipation—and creativity. And back then they each employed a soon-to-be-obsolete tool: My wooden Slazenger made hitting winners difficult in the same way that my humming Selectric made rewriting sentences cumbersome. Unlike tennis players, writers can correct their unforced errors.</p>\n<p>There are other differences of course. Writing is a solitary, sedentary, indoor activity while tennis is a social (certainly at those Quebec Street courts), active, outdoor pursuit. It produces sweat while writing has been associated with blood. (“Just sit down,” Red Barber explained the process, “and open a vein.”) In fact, writing and tennis sometimes seemed more conflicting than complementary; I was often on the court working on my backhand when I should have been at my desk developing my voice.</p>\n<p>Tennis took off in this country in the late 70s with the emergence of attitude, which replaced, or at least challenged, the old decorum. Martin Amis, writing years later about this phenomenon in <i>The New Yorker</i>, confessed that the word “personalities”—when used in sentences like “Modern tennis lacks personalities”—translated in his mind to one that also serves as a synonym for anus.</p>\n<p>Prominent among these were John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors, whose mutual loathing and on-court confrontations brought to mind—at least some minds—the televised clashes of Norman Mailer and Gore Vidal. On the women’s side, Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova began an intense rivalry that could have made them the Mary McCarthy and Lillian Hellman of tennis if not for the fact that they became good friends.</p>\n<p>The writing I lost to playing tennis suffered further from my watching tennis. Though, with some of the big servers, in those serve-and-volley days, I could at least catch up on my reading as only the last few games of a set, and the tiebreakers, were essential viewing. I was heartened to learn, from a magazine profile of Samuel Beckett, that he too wasted hours watching televised matches. Good thing there was no Tennis Channel then.</p>\n<p>In 2011 my two passions merged when I got an assignment to cover the US Open for a now defunct online magazine. Arriving at the media center, I picked up a request form for player interviews. Roger Federer, I figured, would be unavailable—which was ok, as he’d already been dissected by David Foster Wallace—so I wrote down the name of the only other player I really wanted to meet: Andrea Petkovic, the buoyant German whose favorite writers, according to her website, were Goethe and Oscar Wilde.</p>\n<p>I got the interview, but was joined by two other writers who, unfortunately, were more interested in tennis than literature.</p>\n<p>In recent years, changes in the game have distanced it even further from writing. The top players now have teams—coach, hitting partner, physio, nutritionist, sometimes a psychologist—which lessen their lonely crusader status. They lose a big point and gaze up imploringly at their boxes. Writers also experience frustration—blocks, editors—but have no one to turn to for support. Though some now look to ChatGPT.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/failing-better-on-the-tennis-player-and-the-writer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But I wasn’t the narrator.”</h3>\n<p><i>This first appeared in Lit Hub’s </i>Craft of Writing<i> newsletter— sign up here.</i></p>\n<p>I started taking notes for the novel that became <i>Buckeye</i> (which is set almost entirely in a small town in Ohio) in 2016, and I thought it would be on the short side. I thought it would focus on two characters and take place over the course of a week or so. Not far into experimenting with early scenes, I started to glean that the story I wanted to tell was actually about two very distinct families, and three generations. Also, instead of a week of narrative time, I was looking at forty years.</p>\n<p>The whole business felt tricky to me. I needed to figure out the best way to tell the story, yet I didn’t want to get <i>too </i>clear a sense of the story beforehand, because I wanted to leave room for discovery as I wrote. So, I needed to figure out the best way to tell a story I hadn’t figured out yet. My gut said should be a third person narrator. My gut also said it should be told from multiple perspectives, since no single perspective could adequately deliver the story I had in mind. The way I’d always written third person multiple-perspective narration in the past was to lay down a section break each time the perspective changed to a different character. If I stuck to that for <i>Buckeye</i>, I was going to need a hell of a lot of section breaks.</p>\n<p>Don’t get me wrong—I <i>love</i> section breaks. Whenever I teach, I tell students, <i>Section breaks are your friend. </i>They can be useful to ratchet up tension, or nail a moment, or make a question echo in the reader’s mind, or just give the reader—and the writer—a breather. But I’d noticed in my own work that, because of my approach, whole scenes tended to get plugged into one perspective. (It wasn’t too often that I wasn’t interested in dropping a section break into the middle of a scene.)</p>\n<p>Wouldn’t it be nice, I thought, to be one of those writers who could tell this whole story with one narrative voice that moved from character to character, strategically and smoothly—like the world’s tiniest and most efficient drone? What’s it like to be able to do that? What’s it like to be one of <i>those </i>writers? Because, I thought, in someone else’s hands, this could be a really interesting third-person-omniscient-narrated novel.</p>\n<p>Having spent several months taking notes, by then, and having gotten a sense of all the characters, I actually thought that about my own idea. I actually wished it into someone else’s hands. How ridiculous is that?</p>\n<p>Pretty goddamned ridiculous.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>For once in my writing life, I decided to give it a try. I told myself that if I could establish the narrator’s ability to move into different perspectives within the first three pages of Chapter One, that would function like a contract with the reader I would then be obliged to honor. A whack-a-doodle approach, maybe, but nothing calls me to action more reliably than a sense of obligation. By that point, I’d written the first paragraph, introducing the reader to one of the main characters, a boy named Cal Jenkins, who’s born in 1920 and has uneven legs that kids make fun of in grade school, and I’ve introduced the reader to a second boy, named Sean Robison, who tells Cal that he, too, has irregular legs, and that they’re each meant for something special in God’s eyes but will have to wait to find out what that is.</p>\n<p>I was happy with the simple description I’d given Sean Robison—<i>flush-cheeked and small for his age</i>—and while I knew he was a walk-on character who was barely going to earn his SAG card, I had a clear picture of his face in my mind and was fond of him. I was also looking for a spot to sign a contract.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/patrick-ryan-on-the-secrets-of-the-omniscient-narrator/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Too many folk milled about, too many by far. Logs crackled in the firepit. The tables groaned under a weight of food and drink too profuse for the number of retainers who abided here while the Lord of Omlath was absent, and something was wrong with their eyes . . . a sort of dull light. They moved in a jerky, mechanical way, as if someone had wound them up and set them to clanking from task to task. Disconcerting, to say the least.</p>\n<p>The explanation soon became apparent. In a flower-carved throne at the head of the hall, the Lord of Shadows presided.</p>\n<p>The Master of Darkness swung his gaze to us when we entered, and his obsidian eyes seemed to pierce all hopes and disguises. “Ah,” he said, “entertainers. Come! Play a song for your great lord.”</p>\n<p>Sir Barm stiffened beside me. I followed his gaze and beheld a willowy slip of a teenage girl lounging on the steps at the Shadow Lord’s feet. She wore a fetching red gown, a gold circlet over brown curls, and she possessed the same delicate pasty features as her dad, though they looked better on her. From how Sir Barm was gaping, I knew at once that his love for her was no fickle impulse. There was a story behind it, though I hadn’t listened when he told it to me. This could spell trouble.</p>\n<p>“Lords and landed gentry!” Bacchus said, bowing. “Behold — we trifling troubadours shall traipse through twittering tunes, endeavoring to entertain for the honor of your encores!” And with that, he began to play.</p>\n<p>I’d hired the man for a reason. Neither Sir Barm nor myself had the faintest idea what to do with the musical paraphernalia strapped to us, so we banged our drums and blew our pipes at random . . . and somehow, Bacchus made a song of it. He wound our cacophony into a greater melody, sweeping discordant notes along as if they were intentional. The song reared to the vaulted roof, reverberated among the ceiling beams, sank low and mournful into the souls of our listeners. In this song, wrought partially of my own ineptitude, I recalled every grief of my life, relived each failed and faithless moment, remembered all my bitter choices, until I longed to weep. And still it continued.</p>\n<p>Bacchus was rearing the song toward a triumphant crescendo when jeers interrupted him. His accordion squawked in protest, and the music fell apart. All heads turned toward the source of the desecration.</p>\n<p>“You call <i>that </i>music?” the Shadow Lord’s daughter asked. “There weren’t even lyrics! When I hear music, I want poetry. I want to hear about ancient deeds of valor. In short . . . I want <i>recitations.</i>”</p>\n<p>A cruel smile played on her rosebud lips as she rose and sauntered toward us.</p>\n<p>“Play a <i>good </i>song, a song with <i>words</i>,” she said. “Make them play one, Daddy . . . or chop off their heads!”</p>\n<p>The Shadow Lord looked bemused. He raised his eyebrows at us. “Well, boys? You heard my daughter.”</p>\n<p>I clenched my jaw.</p>\n<p>Bacchus was shooting me worried glances, but he should’ve been more concerned about Sir Barm. The knight was trembling from head to heels, his accordion emitting tiny squeaks as he took shuddering breaths, his gaze fixed on the teenager. When she halted a foot away from him, I feared he would go into cardiac arrest.</p>\n<p>“Oh lovely Lady,” Bacchus said, “while your request reveals rarified refinement, we troubled troubadours are poor players of proper parts, being best at instrumental anthems and —”</p>\n<p>“Don’t sell yourself short,” she said, smirking. “You’re professionals, right? A least <i>one</i> of you must have a decent voice. You, knees?” she asked, looking me up and down pointedly. “Or how about you, goldilocks?” Her eyes drank in Sir Barm’s impressive physique.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/03/11/podcastle-882-how-to-steal-the-plot-armor-part-two-of-two/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I swear, winter is the worst season for them. You get a few enterprising farm boys during the spring and summer, and fall’s the time for disinherited princes looking to reclaim kingdoms that their uncles stole from their murdered fathers, but winter is when the big ones arrive. There’s nothing worse than sitting down in front of the hearth, a tome on your knee and a tankard of ale at your elbow, all cozy while the blizzard howls outside — and hearing a knock at the door.</p>\n<p>You’ll have no peace till you open it. When you do, you’re greeted by the sight of a hulking, smelly barbarian, snow clinging to his fur cloak, sword bigger than your leg strapped over his back, with a story of an omen-prompted journey into the mountains to seek one who will tutor him in magic, or guide him to hidden paths, or interpret runes on an ancient map, and might you be that one? And, of course, you are. Try to deny it and he’ll point out that the prophecy specified the man he sought would be holding a tome and a tankard, and would be venerable of years, knobby of knees, bearded of chin, and dark-skinned as the night. Really, they might leave out the knobby knees part, just once. Do they think I have no feelings?</p>\n<p>Over my lifetimes, I’ve developed quite the repertoire of tricks for sending heroes away. They never catch on that a person living in a shabby cottage at the highest pass of the most remote mountain in the farthest corner of the world might not want to be bothered, the insensitive jackanapes. So I always had to use other strategies.</p>\n<p>The beginner’s mistake is thinking rigor alone will deter your average hero, but it only encourages most of them. Their eyes light up when you swear to only take them on as a ‘prentice if they descend into the Tomb of the Necromancer and steal the ruby eye from the idol of Ang’Vel’Nazsh. If they survive this perilous deed, then you really can’t put them off.</p>\n<p>No; the secret is to give them dishonorable, icky chores, like cleaning your chamber pot or mucking out your pigsty. That usually works.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there’s a breed of hero that revels in humiliation, and might, I shudder to add, even be a bit turned on by it. Such a one was the young gallant who galloped into my life that winter day.</p>\n<p>It was one of those bright, cold mornings when life in the mountains feels almost a treat, the pines resplendent with icicles and the snow an unbroken field of dazzling white. He arrived while I was hobbling on my staff from the barn to the cottage, having just fed the old nag. I focused on my footing, and so didn’t immediately notice the rider dismounting outside my door.</p>\n<p>“Hail, honored wizard!” the man called, startling me half out of my wits. “Lo, I have ridden many weeks and endured many perils to seek you.”</p>\n<p>I sighed as I looked him over. He had the usual shaggy golden hair and storm-blue eyes, the usual disregard for animals (his poor horse was half dead), and the usual lack of sense when it came to dressing for the weather, clad as he was in silver armor that glittered with frost, and a thin cape of purple silk.</p>\n<p>“What can I do you for?” I asked irritably. “Enchanted sword? Vague riddle that will come in handy at some future date? Bit of relationship advice?”</p>\n<p>“Wizard, I seek a guide for a quest most perilous into the heart of the Ash Lands, where I shall forge a blade from star-metal and challenge the Master of Shadows for supremacy, along with the right to woo his daughter.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/03/04/podcastle-881-how-to-steal-the-plot-armor-part-one/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She could hear their scrabble-claws and clacker-tails, their dripping maws and teeth. If they were trying to round her up for a crossroad deal-making, they were going about it all wrong.</p>\n<p>That’s what happened when devils got hungry. They made mistakes.</p>\n<p>Kiki hummed as she walked, watching eddies of dust form tornadoes on the road ahead. It was a swagger of a walk, born of a perfect record: Kiki 72, Devils 0. She would have been bored, if she hadn’t been so eager for an encore.</p>\n<p>“Come on out!” she hollered.</p>\n<p>They tumbled forth in a gray-green tangle of many-jointed limbs, an acrid smell preceding them: sulphur and grave dirt and candy apples stuffed with razorblades. Their voices tangled like a nest of snakes: <i>Are you hungry? Are you thirsty? Are you vengeful? Are you sad?</i></p>\n<p>For a moment she felt it—the thirst like three weeks eating salted pork, the grief that could only end in retaliation—and then Kiki popped open her molded-plastic carrying case and pulled out her guitar: Mona Lisa.</p>\n<p>Mona Lisa was fierce. She was raw. She was a fine-tuned devil-killing music monster.</p>\n<p>They never stood a chance.</p>\n<p>Kiki laughed, high and wild, as her fingers danced through “Voodoo Child”—acoustic, sadly, but that was the state of the world these days. In Kiki’s head she was rocking steel strings and a hundred watts. She was playing to a crowd of twenty thousand and <i>crushing</i> <i>it</i>.</p>\n<p>The first trio of devils hit a solid wall of sound and crumpled, bloody and squealing, to the earth. The others skittered away, and she chased after them, shouting, “Come back, you cowards!”</p>\n<p>She needn’t have worried. They raced for the crossroad, so desperate they didn’t even notice what was waiting for them there.</p>\n<p>Kiki’s hellhound.</p>\n<p>He was short and squat, with the jowls of a Neapolitan Mastiff and the blue-black coat of a Friesian horse. He had curling horns for ears and deep pits of flame for eyes, and he swallowed those devils in two bites apiece.</p>\n<p>“Ozzy!” Kiki scolded. “What did I say about wandering off?”</p>\n<p>He slumped hard against her leg, whining, and she pulled out a spare bone pick to loosen the gristle from his fangs. He let out a particularly un-hellish yip when she accidentally jabbed his gum.</p>\n<p>“Well next time don’t chomp them around the ribs!” she said. “Honestly, Ozzy…”</p>\n<p>He tilted his head for scratches, and Kiki complied. She was still flush with the high of performing, the heart-fluttering, head-buzzing, loose-muscle happiness that only came from a good tune. It didn’t matter if there was no audience. She had Ozzy.</p>\n<p>And then a voice like rotting garbage slithered down the breeze: “Isn’t that just too sweet to stomach?”</p>\n<p>Kiki spun, guitar drawn against her belly. An enormous toad-like devil was sitting on top of an overturned city bus, wide and squat and green, with a short, sharp horn protruding from the center of its forehead. A nasty wall of cacti stood between them, holding the beast out of guitar range.</p>\n<p>That bit of foresight was alarming. The devil should have been all riled up by the scents of blood and bone. It should have been slavering at her heels, stripped bare by hunger. But it only watched her with narrow-eyed satisfaction.</p>\n<p>Like it approved of what it saw.</p>\n<p>“Are you hungry?” it croaked. “Are you <i>weary</i>?”</p>\n<p>Ozzy growled, and the devil chuckled wetly. Kiki snapped, “There is nothing on this earth I’m willing to trade you, devil, and not a thing in hell you have to offer me, so either go home or come closer and hear me play.”</p>\n<p>It tapped one soggy foot against the glass of an upturned window. “I left a gift inside.”</p>\n<p>“I <i>just</i> told you—”</p>\n<p>“I’ll see you on Luna Mesa,” the devil said, and it vanished in a burst of tar bubbles.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/02/25/podcastle-880-tales-from-the-vaults-kiki-hernandez-beats-the-devil/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 879: The Tawlish Island Songbook of the Dead</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated PG-13</p>\n<h3>The Tawlish Island Songbook of the Dead</h3>\n<p/><p>The living have been leaving Tawlish for centuries; this evacuation is only the latest and last. There are good reasons for it: the freshwater spring gone brackish; the water, always encroaching; the colicky, relentless wind. No schools for the children. No doctor. We should have seen it coming, but sometimes we forget what the living need.</p>\n<p>We cannot cross salt, so we watch from shore. Our loved ones and descendants wade into the sea. The men strain to hold the boats steady against the waves. Everyone’s weighed down by possessions, a village crammed into sacks and lifeboats. Spoons, spindles, fish-hooks, balls of yarn. A clothes-peg doll in a twist of old apron. Seabirds’ eggs wrapped in blankets: habits ingrained by generations of scarcity. They’ve even dug up their potatoes.</p>\n<p>Katie Zell’s mother is already on the boat. The songbook is tucked inside her jacket.</p>\n<p>Thirty-seven people. Only some of them look back.</p>\n<p>They leave cold firepits and fulmar bones, middens, empty crofts with the thatch already collapsing. Sheep they’ve blessed and turned loose to fend for themselves.</p>\n<p>And us. The dead of Tawlish.</p>\n<p>Katie Zell’s father has been dead longer than she’s been alive. Before he drowned, he’d hoped to sing her lullabies: the ones he sang to her older brothers, the ones his grandparents sang to him. Now, in farewell, he rests his hand briefly on her curls. Most of the living are oblivious to the dead, but the Zells are a noticing kind of family.</p>\n<p>Katie raises her hand to his; perhaps she mistakes the cold brush of it for sea-spray. It’s enough. He smiles. That’s all there is time for: Katie’s uncle lifts her from the shore, over the churn of the sea, and seats her next to her cousin on the boat.</p>\n<p>Old Maureen Stornaway is furious, sees evacuation as defeat. She clenches a knuckle of island rock in her pocket. Tiny luminosities watch her from shore: the ghosts of three of her children. She strains her eyes and peers back through the sea-mist. Maybe something shines there. After decades of loss, of wishing them still with her, this is the first and last time that she almost makes them out.</p>\n<p>The rector, smug, takes nothing. He doesn’t need to. He has a house on the mainland, and — as far as he’s concerned — he’s saved thirty-seven souls.</p>\n<p>A Tawlish tradition: the living and dead send each other gifts. The living give tobacco and carved pipes, posies of sea-vetch, griddle-cake. Packets of seeds for Lizzie Knell. Wooden rattles and teething rings. Handkerchiefs embroidered with our names. They slip our gifts into the flames so that they’ll cross over to our side. Burnt offerings. The wind chases the sparks out of the sky. The gifts arrive smelling of smoke.</p>\n<p>Our gifts are less generous. All we can send are dreams.</p>\n<p>Tonight, all together, we dream safe passage for the living. Grudgingly, because they’re abandoning us; jealously, because we want them here: their songs and laughter reminding us who we are, their bones buried beside ours in the thin Tawlish soil. We dream them returning.</p>\n<p>We dream them bringing our songbook home.</p>\n<p>The songbook holds all the magic of Tawlish. Spell-songs that nudge the wind and sing fish into nets, that knit bones and heal coughs and call the drowned ashore for burial. The rector feared our spell-songs, but they made life here possible.</p>\n<p>We wish the living had left the songbook behind. Burned it as a farewell gift, perhaps. There’s no magic on the mainland, after all; the spells work nowhere but Tawlish. Perhaps we’re being childish — what use to the dead are spells for fishing and healing? — but we want it back.</p>\n<p>We miss the songs.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/02/18/podcastle-879-the-tawlish-island-songbook-of-the-dead/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 878: The Carving of War</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated R</p>\n<h3>The Carving Of War</h3>\n<p/><p>Odili was a child when Nkeala, her grandmother, died. All she remembered of her were her braids, a tangle of clouds that reached for the floor. She remembered her eyes, how they swallowed her face. To look into them was to be lost in a vastness. It was to find eyes — owl eyes, bold eyes, brown eyes — staring back at you. Most of all, she remembered her kindness, an unending sea.</p>\n<p>Nkeala had been dìbìā — keeper, to Idemili; the roaring python, they who drowned oceans, mother of mothers. At the birth of time, Idemili, like beads dancing on a fragile waist, had wound herself around the clans of Obosi. Out of her mouth, the Eke River poured, its brooks and streamlets giving sustenance to the corn in the farmlands, the antelopes of the wild and the Irokos that split the sky. Odili’s family was bound in perpetuity to Idemili. With her grandmother’s passing, the fanged staff fell to her mother, Adaugo. In the past, a few keepers had met their fate with defiance. Odili’s great-great grandfather, Agbadike, had refused the staff when it passed to him. Setting the shrine of Idemili ablaze, he invoked the ritual of blood in a bid to sever the bond that tethered his life to the deity. Three days after, a breadfruit fell from a tree and split his skull in half.</p>\n<p>Like moth to fire, Adaugo embraced the mantle of keeper. Before her twelfth birthday, she could already perform the passage rites of ancestors. Beneath the glow of a horned moon, she’d slay a ram, its body thrashing beneath her knee. Immersed in its blood, she’d wade into the Eke, bridging the fold between the living and the dead. Ancestors past would come walking through her, blessing and cursing the ones they left behind. When she was heavy with Odili, Adaugo ventured into Idemili’s mouth and emerged unscathed, spirit water coursing through her veins. One of the dwindling few, Adaugo knew the words to the eternal utterances and the anchors that held them. The clans of Obosi had revered Nkeala; Adaugo, they feared. She was power unbridled, her dedication to Idemili undying. Like her mother and keepers before her, Adaugo stayed unwed.</p>\n<p>“We are the rage of Idemili, unburdened by the constraints of love and companionship,” she’d remind Odili, “We are fire and water, we are rain and lightning, our bodies are nothing but vessels.”</p>\n<p>Still, keepers were mandated to bear offspring and preserve their line. Without a present father, a mother who in all entirety was of another realm, Odili roamed the village unchecked, her python familiar slithering beside her. More than a companion, it had become a parent, regurgitating rabbits and bush rats for her to roast and eat.</p>\n<p>When the first missionaries came to their village, Odili was drawn in by their flaky bread and the trinkets that hung from their neck, how they shimmered in the light. At the rooster’s crow, she’d run into the village, into the shack that doubled as a chapel, to watch the priests bless communion, to watch Edward. Edward was a mass server and Edward was beautiful. With her eyes, she’d follow him and when he caught her stare, she’d hold it till he flushed red and looked away. He intrigued her, the sapphire of his eyes, his hair; the burning of dawn, the way he said her name, like a song lived in the walls of his lips. When first he kissed her — a gentle kiss, his nose brushing against hers, he had closed his eyes. Odili kept hers a door, ajar.</p>\n<p>When the priests baptized her in the Eke, Odili didn’t feel new, born again, like Edward had said she would. And when she received communion, the blood of Christ sweet on her tongue, only then did her mother come raging like a flood, her screams claps of thunder.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/02/11/podcastle-878-the-carving-of-war/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 877: The Hand That Feeds</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated PG-13</p>\n<h3>The Hand That Feeds</h3>\n<p/><p>Last Christmas a mermaid died in the school swimming pool. It was only a small pool, built up at the sides with wooden panels, more like a tank for training children in. That meant it froze over very easily, but a mermaid couldn’t know that. It stood in a courtyard in the shadow of the school, and the sun reached it only at rare intervals.</p>\n<p>Behind it lurked a stone and sulking outhouse, pebbledash walls lashed together with a corrugated plastic roof. In its damp darkness the children undressed, and tripped, and snapped tight, powdered rubber caps over their skulls. Under its benches something black grew wetly out towards them. It was the hut that Freya hated most of all.</p>\n<p>Miss Wallace had caught Archie Dorrick from Upper Third belting down the corridor but she hadn’t told him off, not properly, just asked him why he needed to be rushing so quick. He said there was a mermaid dead in the pool, that it must have happened in the holidays, and Miss Wallace was so interested that she didn’t ask Archie why he had been down there on his own, which was definitely cigarettes.</p>\n<p>Miss Wallace was young and pretty and was allowed to wear any jumper she liked, unlike Freya, who was a pupil and had to wear a plain grey one like everybody else. Miss Wallace also had colourful bracelets on her arms and hair that rose up above her head and fanned out like branches. When she moved they swayed about her; the bracelets and the hair both. In the older years they had a teacher for English and a teacher for history and a teacher for comparative mythography, but Freya was only nine so Miss Wallace was her everything teacher, and she needed no other.</p>\n<p>Freya’s last teacher had been Mr Heagerty, who had folded himself into a corner of the classroom, spiderlike, and spoke to them only in riddles. His interest in the outside world was oblique at best, and he’d never once worn a bracelet or even a colourful tie. For Miss Wallace, the outside world was the whole point, it was something to push both your hands into and wiggle about. That was why Class 7C were allowed to follow her, symmetrical grey cygnets, through the hall and out the fire escape and down the iron stairway that led to the pool with the mermaid in it.</p>\n<p>The ice was frozen over most of it, a thin sheet, breakable. One arm punctured the surface, a long, grey-brown javelin that reached up and out and seized around the metal rung of the ladder in a tight fist. Frost followed up it and caught on the trail of fine hairs that sloped along its back. Freya couldn’t see down below the ice; Miss Wallace had them at a distance, she had first dibs on exploration. Freya jostled her way to the front of the group. She knew she had to be as close as was allowed.</p>\n<p>Miss Wallace stared down at the mermaid, and her hair quivered, and her breath came out in clouds. Below her the arm was stiff, and quiet, and altogether too close to her throat. In the end it was Juno Clarke who asked the question that held them all close with a ferocious anxiety. Juno asked if Miss Wallace was sure it was really dead, and Miss Wallace said yes, and everyone turned to Juno and sneered at her stupidity.</p>\n<p>Then Miss Wallace said “I can prove it,” which was something she said a lot, and she felt around inside her pockets and pulled out her fountain pen. Freya had long watched and desired that pen; it shone bronze and under Miss Wallace’s direction bled blue, looping calligraphy that far outranked Freya’s lumpen hieroglyphs. Miss Wallace took off the lid, and lifted the pen high, and then stuck it deep, deep into the mermaid’s arm.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/02/04/podcastle-877-the-hand-that-feeds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

That’s less than the price of a taxi to the airport. This fierce competition makes hopping between Italy’s iconic cities more affordable than ever.</p>\n<h3><strong>2.

When you factor in getting to the airport, going through security, and then traveling from your destination airport back into the city, the train is the undisputed speed king in Italy.</p>\n<p>Take the country's busiest route: <strong> Milan to Rome</strong>. A flight is technically about an hour, but the entire door-to-door journey can easily take 4-5 hours. The high-speed </p>\n<p><i>Frecciarossa</i>train connects the city centers in just</p>\n<p><strong>2 hours and 59 minutes</strong>. You can leave your hotel in Milan after breakfast and be at the Colosseum in time for lunch. No stress, no security lines, just pure speed and convenience.</p>\n<h3><strong>3.

The high-speed network has recently expanded, opening up incredible, less-visited regions that are perfect for a fall trip.</p>\n<p>The new high-speed line now pushes all the way down to the “toe” of Italy's boot, making the stunning and authentic region of <strong>Calabria</strong> easier to reach than ever. Imagine zipping down to coastal towns to enjoy the last of the warm Mediterranean sun without the summer crowds.

We may not have had to deal with social media influencers giving their Labubus butt implants (this is <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DKgfBdAB5z2/?utm_source=ig_embed\">a thing now</a>), but it was a toxic time to be a woman. British tabloids were full of topless Page 3 girls, and we were fed a steady diet of body-shaming magazines, heroin-chic fashion and the idea that Bridget Jones, who weighed only 62kg (9st 10lb), was disgustingly fat.</p>\n<p>If you’ve forgotten how awful things were, just look online: reminders keep going viral. Last week, for example, clips of shock jock Howard Stern’s infamous 2000s “Buttaface Competition” started circulating on <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@knowyourmeme/video/7538855401803058446\">social media</a>. This was a contest to find the “best” body and “ugliest” face, which involved women parading around in bikinis with paper bags on their heads. In one clip the crowd starts mock retching as a very conventionally attractive woman takes the bag off her head. I don’t know where that woman is now, but I hope she is living her best life.</p>\n<p>Another <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2025/08/07/lifestyle/maxims-unsexiest-women-list-surfaces-with-surprising-first-place-winner/\">recently viral</a> memento from the bad old days: an 18-year-old article from the lad mag Maxim, listing the “Unsexiest Women Alive”. Sarah Jessica Parker, labelled a “Barbaro-faced broad”, was described as the “least sexy woman in a group of very unsexy women” by the 2007 list. Parker was quite understandably <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/being-voted-unsexiest-woman-alive-hurt-so-much-says-sarah-jessica-parker-as-she-cries-all-the-way-to-the-bank-6618744.html\">upset by this</a>, later saying: “It’s condemnation, it’s insane. What can I do?”</p>\n<p>The Maxim piece, which has been scrubbed from the internet, also took aim at Britney Spears, saying she had “lost the ability to perform, but gained … about 23 pounds of Funyun pudge”. While cruel, that sort of commentary was not unusual: it’s really no wonder that Spears, sexualised and picked apart her entire life, had a breakdown in 2008. In a memoir that came out in 2023, Spears wrote that shaving her head in 2007 and acting out were her ways of “<a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2023-10-18/britney-spears-shaves-head-book-the-woman-in-me\">pushing back</a>”.</p>\n<p>Spears isn’t the only star who has spoken out about the way she was treated by journalists back in the day. Last year, Kate Winslet broke down during a TV interview when she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/03/i-hope-this-haunts-you-kate-winslet-says-titanic-era-body-shamers-were-absolutely-appalling\">discussed being body-shamed</a> as a 22-year-old actor during the Titanic era. Winslet was bullied relentlessly: the Titanic director James Cameron reportedly nicknamed the actor “<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/10/kate-winslet-avatar-james-cameron-titanic-reunion-history-feud?srsltid=AfmBOopBJUscVbljOS9CDPjYA90xe1w_z-lZ3guS2HQoyeCTj5e1C5Pz\">Kate Weighs-a-Lot</a>” and the late comedian Joan Rivers, a real piece of work, <a href=\"https://people.com/health/kate-winslet-criticism-her-weight-straight-up-cruel/\">joked</a>: “If Kate Winslet had dropped a few pounds, the Titanic would never have sunk.” Rivers had form on the body-shaming front: she also once wagged her finger at Oprah Winfrey and instructed her to <a href=\"https://people.com/health/oprah-winfrey-joan-rivers-called-her-out-for-gaining-weight/\">lose 15 pounds</a>.</p>\n<p>Now it seems Victoria Beckham is to speak out about the scrutiny of her body during her Spice Girls era in an upcoming Netflix docuseries. “When you look back in hindsight at the media environment in the 90s, it was super hard,” an industry insider <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2025/08/17/entertainment/victoria-beckham-reveals-source-of-body-image-issues-sources/?_gl=1*1yunrtu*_ga*NDI3MTA0MzIzLjE3NTQzMTQxMDU.*_ga_0DZ7LHF5PZ*czE3NTU0Mzk3NTUkbzM1JGcxJHQxNzU1NDM5ODU4JGo0MSRsMCRoMA\">told Page Six</a> of the series, which comes out next month. Sources also told the outlet that the documentary “looks back on archival footage including when TV presenter Chris Evans pushed [Victoria] to be weighed live on air in 1999 – just two months after she gave birth to Brooklyn”. (<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/victoria-beckham-weighed-chris-evans-video-b2113900.html\">His verdict</a> after she got on the scales: “Not bad at all.”)</p>\n<p>“Can you imagine doing that nowadays?” Beckham asked <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/victoria-beckham-chris-evans-weigh-b2112028.html\">Vogue Australia</a> in 2022, about that televised post-partum weigh-in. Not really, no. A quarter of a century after that Evans stunt, there isn’t as much overt body shaming on mainstream media as there used to be. But that doesn’t mean that things have drastically changed for the better. Nor does it mean, as Beckham said in 2022 to Grazia, that being thin is “<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/victoria-beckham-diet-thin-curvy-b2080607.html\">old-fashioned</a>”.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/19/unsexiest-women-alive-list-body-shaming\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>‘I’m such a feminist,” <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/helen-mirren\">Helen Mirren</a> told Saga magazine, but there are some jobs a woman can’t do. To be precise: “You can’t have a woman [as James Bond]. It just doesn’t work. James Bond has to be James Bond, otherwise it becomes something else.”</p>\n    <p>Mirren is starring opposite Pierce Brosnan in the film adaptation of Richard Osman’s The Thursday Murder Club, in which they both play amateur sleuths in a care home. Happily, that is a unisex job. Brosnan might also describe himself as “such a feminist” – he has never said so explicitly, but in 2019, he said a female Bond would be “exhilarating”. However, he’s now back on team men, saying: “I’m so excited to see the next man come on the stage and to see a whole new exuberance and life for this character.” Exhilaration, excitement, exuberance: all qualities I don’t think I’ve ever seen in any Bond, across the great gamut of maleness, from Connery to Craig. But who am I to judge? Whenever 007 gets a new pen that can poison someone from 50 paces, the thrill racing through his veins might be implied by his slightly less stern visage. Truly, masculinity is an unknowable frontier.</p>\n    <p>A couple of things, before we hand the franchise over to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/feb/21/stars-shaken-stirred-amazon-deal-james-bond\">Amazon, who bought it for more than $1bn earlier this year</a>. The essential qualities of Bond are as follows: he can kill on command without conscience, except when he has a conscience; he is patriotic; he is irresistible to women; he favours discreetly tailored, monochrome clothing; he can drink neat spirits without becoming intoxicated; and he always introduces himself in reverse order, to people who tend to already know his name. None of this screams “man”, except perhaps the patriotism, if you understand emotionally charged nationalism as a drumbeat of the patriarchy. Having said that, women can serve the patriarchy just as well as men – look at Mirren. Sorry, that is totally uncalled for: her feminist membership cannot be revoked, at least not on the basis of her Bond opinions, since that would be handing 007 too much power in the realm of gender.</p>\n    <p>On a separate point: is Bond a feminist, and if he is, does that mean it’s fine for him to remain a man in perpetuity? It’s a tricky one. His value system has changed so much over the 25 films, from his early “lovable chauvinist” years to his late “anguished quester after the truth of the self” iteration, a lesser person than myself might think the masculine ideal had itself gone on a journey since it first put on a dinner jacket in 1962. That, however, is a fruitless line of analysis, since if we were to take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jamesbond\">James Bond</a> as too literal a representation of the changing social expectations of men, we’d have to conclude that they can be any which way, so long as they’re prepared to take out a minor dictator with piano wire and have a disregard for due process.</p>\n    <p>Arguably more important than any of that is what the Amazon takeover will do to the franchise, given the semi-recent history of the tech company – it invented an AI recruitment tool in 2018 that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-45809919\">effectively trained itself to prefer male candidates</a>; it was shown to have embedded sexism in its sports coverage, after <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-66508514\">Alexa didn’t know what a Lioness was</a>; and, according to employees, it has <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2023/10/amazon-jeff-bezoss-company-promoted-sexism-through-meritocracy.html\">an office culture in which you’re never not at work</a>, which automatically excludes sane people – and come on, a lot of those are going to be women. Does this sound like a safe pair of hands to take over the management of a fictional character whose arc we would hope is going to continue to bend towards gender justice? Not really, but at the same time, if Amazon did spring a female Bond on the world, and used that as feminist-washing, proof in perpetuity that none of the sexist algorithms were created deliberately, well, that would be quite annoying.</p>\n    <p>Nobody overreact, but surely what this moment in history is crying out for is a gender-fluid Bond.</p>\n    <p>Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/18/does-james-bond-have-to-be-played-by-a-man-helen-mirren-seems-to-think-so\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Then her father caught her and she was too terrified to try to contact him again.</p>\n<p>Five decades on, Price has written This Happened To Me, a memoir that reads, in part, like a detective story, piecing together clues to create a picture of the horror that had been done to her as a child, as well as her path to healing. When we speak over Zoom, Price is in her office at Wellesley College, the women’s college in Massachusetts, where she researches commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) – a world away from the rural Pennsylvania town where she grew up. For as long as she can remember, Price was sexually abused by her father until she was about 12, and he left the family. What she didn’t discover until she was an adult was that he had also been drugging her and, in the middle of the night, “selling” her to men.</p>\n<p>The book, she says, “really poured out of me”. If it was difficult to write about an almost unimaginable crime, she points out this is what she does as a career. “I research child sex trafficking. I haven’t been trafficked in about 40 years – not to say that I’m healed completely, but this is a subject matter [I work on] all of the time.”</p>\n<p>Price is also used to talking about her own experience as part of her work, and has had decades of therapy, including taking part in the pioneering trauma treatment by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/sep/20/trauma-trust-and-triumph-psychiatrist-bessel-van-der-kolk-on-how-to-recover-from-our-deepest-pain\">psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk</a> in the early 90s; Kolk included Price as a case study in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/sep/20/trauma-trust-and-triumph-psychiatrist-bessel-van-der-kolk-on-how-to-recover-from-our-deepest-pain\">his bestselling book The Body Keeps the Score</a>. He was the one who first told her that her PTSD would be a lifelong condition to manage, and she does, with therapy, exercise, sleep and nutrition, as well as a steady, loving marriage. “I’m lucky to have the resources,” she says. “It’s a ton of privilege that goes into it.”</p>\n<p>Much of Price’s book is based on the decade-long investigation she worked on with the journalist Janelle Nanos, which became <a href=\"https://apps.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2022/07/kate-price-remembers-something-terrible/\">a 2022 piece for the Boston Globe</a>. “In the same way that I was able to thrive in school, I could compartmentalise, thinking this is a research project. Yes, it’s my life, but …” She doesn’t finish the thought. “I would say, actually, it was incredibly healing. My sister and I had these incredible conversations that we’d never had, that started when I was working on the article, but continued as I was working on the book. That was happy emotion, quite the opposite of this gut-wrenching stuff.”</p>\n<p>Growing up, Price witnessed the violence of their father against her older sister. Her sister, who was constantly compared unfavourably to Price, appeared to hate her. In the course of her research, Price would find out her sister had also been trafficked by their father. Price also endured their father’s physical violence; she remembers being four and hiding in cupboards when he came home from his job as an electrician, wishing it would open into Narnia, before being beaten by him. When she was six, in a rage, he carved an X on her arm with his penknife, telling her she belonged to him, then threw her down the stairs into the basement.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/18/i-was-completely-dehumanised-by-my-father-how-kate-price-uncovered-the-horrifying-truths-of-her-childhood\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Then came ‘shrinking girl summer’ – is everyone getting smaller except me?, 10 August</a>). Once again, a healthy, intelligent woman is made to feel not good enough by society because she is larger than a size 10.</p>\n    <p>Then came anger, not with Stokes but with the media and brands that propagate a culture of skinny worship. I was born with a rare physical disability and have spent years coming to terms with the way my body is. I look disabled, I have scars from operations and a spinal curve surgeons couldn’t straighten, and I use mobility aids. To me, Stokes presents as an attractive, successful, healthy woman who is non-disabled (although this is her private business) with the good fortune to have two children. I wish Stokes and others could see themselves in that vein. Granted, it took me years to be happy in my own skin and see the strengths of my body, everything I’ve been through and the pleasure it can give and receive, but it’s doable.</p>\n    <p>We are living in dark times when non-disabled women and men are wrecking their mental health and putting their physical health in danger with fad diets and weight-loss jabs, shrinking themselves to an ever-hungry and cold status to please others’ gazes and get likes on TikTok and Instagram. As a society we should be ashamed that we are engendering this, putting people at risk of eating disorders, malnutrition and mental health issues.</p>\n    <p>We only have one body and if you’re fortunate enough to have one that works properly, you’ve won the jackpot.<strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p>\n    <p>Self-loathing, shame, isolation and the desire for slenderness are not an intrinsic or inevitable aspect of being fat, as features such as Rose Stokes’ seem to suggest. They are caused by fatphobia. This has been ruthlessly exploited by weight-loss industries, including the contemporary manufacturers of GLP-1 drugs. These purveyors are not called to account when their products fail or harm their users. Instead, fat people are made to feel responsible. We should have tried harder.</p>\n    <p>For a more balanced view, I invite Guardian editors, writers and readers to consider a social movement that has been active for at least 50 years and which takes a critical view of the obesity‑industrial complex.</p>\n    <p>The scholarly field of fat studies and the public health model known as “health at every size” are offshoots. There are many of us working in these areas, providing a more nuanced and hopeful understanding of fat subjectivity.<strong>Charlotte Cooper</strong><i>London</i></p>\n    <p> Rose Stokes’ article strikes a chord across the femisphere. I would add that body dysmorphia has never been confined to women whose bodies don’t conform to skinny standards. The body-positivity movement liberated all women from these impossible strictures. It’s no coincidence that as soon as it arrived, and women began to take up more and powerful space, drugs were pumped out to make sure we take less.<strong>Danuta Kean</strong><i>Hastings, East Sussex</i></p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/15/the-dark-side-of-shrinking-girl-summer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A very long time.</p>\n    <p>My experience as a gender non-conforming 37-year-old woman is that, since I was about eight, I have been regularly mistaken for a boy or man, and that a few times a year, these incidents are deeply embarrassing to me or involve someone being openly hostile.</p>\n    <p>For example, in 2022, when flying to the US, I was detained for an enhanced search because they did not believe that I was female, as stated in my passport. I was humiliated to the point of tears, not least because I had recently shaved my head for brain surgery for a tumour and had a prominent scar.</p>\n    <p>I have long lived in a world where I expect to be mistaken for a man and feel on edge as a result. My crimes? Being 5ft 8in, slim-ish, with short hair, an angular face, a deeper voice, and preferring loose clothing. Perhaps my walk is a little confident. The chromosomes remain XX.</p>\n    <p>This isn’t about the trans or non-binary debate. The real issue is that in this country, we have an extremely reductive view of what even a biological woman should look like, sound like and dress like. To an extent, the challenge to binaries has unfortunately and bizarrely played a role in reducing the visual and social footprint of natal womanhood even further. I am regularly asked by well-meaners my pronouns too – something I find just as insulting.</p>\n    <p>The way I am is no statement, no protest, no challenge. It is simply how I have always been.

Then he sat down with Katie Miller to tell her all about his baking skills in the very first episode of her brand-new podcast. Which, by the way, I have heroically listened to all 44 excruciating minutes of so that you don’t have to.</p>\n<p>Miller, for the uninitiated, is a Maga bigwig and married to Stephen Miller, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>’s far-right chief of staff and a man so odious his own uncle once wrote an article calling him a “<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/08/13/stephen-miller-is-an-immigration-hypocrite-i-know-because-im-his-uncle-219351/\">hypocrite</a>”.</p>\n<p>A Trump loyalist, Miller has form when it comes to surrounding herself with odious men: she held top communications jobs during Trump’s first term and, earlier this year, became a spokesperson for Elon Musk’s pet project, the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge).</p>\n<p>In May, she absconded to a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-loyalist-katie-miller-crosses-battle-lines-continue-work-elon-musk-2025-07-18/\">mysterious role</a> at Musk’s private ventures. I imagine that she was attracted to Musk’s views on free speech (summed up as: I can say whatever I fancy but you can’t) because it’s been reported that when Miller was in university she once stole and threw away student newspapers because she didn’t like the <a href=\"https://www.spectatornews.com/opinion/2019/10/katie-waldmen-stole-newspapers-in-college/\">politician they endorsed</a>.</p>\n<p>Now, she’s launched the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@katiemillerpod\">Katie Miller Podcast</a>, the first episode of which came out on Monday. Why jump from the highest echelons of government into podcasting? According to Miller, <a href=\"https://x.com/KatieMiller/status/1953409168234168422\">it’s because</a> “as a mom of three young kids, who eats healthy, goes to the gym, works full-time, I know there isn’t a podcast for women like myself”.</p>\n<p>In a promo video, in which she sits cross-legged on an armchair (with shoes on!) in front of a bookshelf with three books on it, including The Great Gatsby and To Kill a Mockingbird, she explains that “there isn’t a place for conservative women to gather online” and she wanted to create a space to have “real honest conversations” about what matters to women.</p>\n<p>Apparently what matters to women is the minutiae of vice-president Vance’s life: the first 44-minute episode, which I suggest she rename <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brief_Interviews_with_Hideous_Men\">Brief Interviews with Hideous Men</a>, was devoted to fawning over a man who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/31/jd-vance-podcast-feminism-immigration\">said</a> professional women “choose a path to misery” when they prioritize careers over children.</p>\n<p>Miller, who is not a natural host, awkwardly serves softball questions (“is a hotdog a sandwich?”) while Vance drones on about what a great daddy and vice-president he is and how much he loves ice-cream and joking around with Marco Rubio. The closest they get to a controversial topic is Vance talking about all the memes he’s inspired and saying that one of his favourites features the pope, Usha Vance and a couch. (There have been online jokes that Vance was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/04/jd-vance-critics-trump-vp\">intimate with a couch</a> and that he <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/post/194199/jd-vance-kill-pope-francis-investigation\">killed the pope</a>.) There is also light mockery of Late Show host Stephen Colbert, whose show recently got <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/18/stephen-colbert-late-show-ending-trump\">cancelled</a>.</p>\n<p>Other than the memes, the most memorable moment of the episode is when Miller seems to imply that her husband subsists entirely on a diet of mayonnaise, like some sort of anaemic vampire. Stephen Miller also apparently runs around his house with his shoes on, as does JD. Usha, sensibly, takes her shoes off at the front door. All of this is exactly the sort of content I’m sure the busy mums are desperate for.</p>\n<p>Miller has said she thinks there is a gap in the market for podcasts aimed at conservative women, but the market says otherwise. While young women in the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/aug/07/gen-z-voters-political-ideology-gender-gap\">tend to be progressive</a>, there is a thriving “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/24/womanosphere-conservative-women\">womanosphere</a>” of anti-feminist media aimed at conservatives. Some of these outlets don’t explicitly cater to young conservative mums in the way that the Katie Miller Podcast says it does, but they’re still aiming for the same general demographic.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/14/katie-miller-podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Between cross-country flights, <a href=\"https://isabelleeyman.substack.com/p/what-the-dying-teach-the-living\">caregiving for my father</a>, and toggling between Oregon and New England, I felt suspended. It was like living in two worlds at once, never fully grounded. As the season shifts, I’m not just welcoming cooler air and longer shadows—I’m noticing the crispness in the mornings, the golden light spilling across my Portland streets, and how the sunlight catches in my eyes in a way that makes me feel fully awake again. I’m craving a September reset: a return to rhythm, <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/health/healthy-habits/founder-wellness-rituals/\">to rituals</a>, and to a steadiness that feels like home.</p>\n<p>Fall has always been my season of becoming. Summer’s spontaneity is beautiful in its own way, but it can leave me untethered, spinning from one thing to the next. This year, my intention isn’t to return to who I was before. It’s to step into someone new: rooted, aligned, and intentional. My September reset is made up of small adjustments that help me find my footing again. These aren’t grand gestures or sweeping overhauls, but everyday practices that remind me I can always start anew.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=How to Reset This September (Without Overhauling Your Whole Life)&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/september-reset/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/drinking-coffee-fireplace-865x1296.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>How to Approach Your September Reset</h2>\n<p>A September reset doesn’t mean completely overhauling your life or chasing a brand-new version of yourself. After a summer that had me juggling travel and constant transitions, I’ve realized the most meaningful shifts are subtle, small adjustments that help me feel centered and steady. They’re the practices I return to when I want to feel like a real and complete person again. (Not someone who’s—frantically, chaotically—going through the motions.)</p>\n<p>Think of this reset as a gentle guide rather than a checklist. The goal isn’t perfection—it’s alignment and a sense of reconnecting with your authentic self as the days grow cooler and the season turns.</p>\n<h2>10 Simple Changes to Inspire Your September Reset</h2>\n<p>As I step into fall, I’m focusing on the everyday practices that help me return to myself—clearing space, inviting presence, and creating the consistency I’ve been craving. They’re not about reinventing my life, but about realigning with it in ways that feel manageable, meaningful, and (spoiler!) completely within reach.</p>\n<h3>1. Clear Space at Home</h3>\n<p>After a summer of <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/fashion/2-week-carry-on-packing-list/\">suitcases</a> and scattered piles, I need blank surfaces and organized drawers. The chaos of caregiving and travel left my home feeling more like storage than sanctuary. I’m starting small: a 20-minute tidy before bed, tackling one drawer at a time, and creating little pockets of calm.</p>\n<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Pick one surface and clear it completely. This could be your nightstand, desk, kitchen counter, etc. Notice how that small change improves your energy.</p>\n<h3>2. Reclaim Morning Rituals</h3>\n<p>This summer, my mornings belonged to everyone but me. Early flights (or recovering from late ones), appointments, and unpredictable schedules made starting the day with intention impossible. Now, I wake a bit earlier to make coffee, journal, or sit quietly by the window. Even five mindful minutes can anchor my day.</p>\n<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Before reaching for your phone, take a few deep breaths and ask yourself: How do I want to move through today?</p>\n<h3>3. Cook with the Season</h3>\n<p>After months of takeout and eating on the go, I’m craving meals that ground me. Not only that, but I miss the way shopping at the farmer’s market would make me feel connected, both to my local community and to myself. September markets are full of squash, apples, and late-summer tomatoes. Cooking with <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/fall-seasonal-vegetables/\">these ingredients</a> feels like reestablishing roots, nourishing both body and soul.</p>\n<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Choose one seasonal recipe this week that invites slowness, like <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/best-roasted-root-vegetables/\">roasting vegetables</a> or baking bread.</p>\n<h3>4. Move with Intention</h3>\n<p>This summer, I often pushed through exhaustion with long, intense workouts, thinking that more miles or higher intensity was the only way to feel strong. Now, as I <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/marathon-training/\">train for my marathon</a>, I’m learning to honor movement that feels purposeful and restorative: a focused run at a comfortable pace, a barre class to stretch and build strength, or a <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/walking-for-mental-health/\">mindful walk </a>through my neighborhood. Movement has become about experiencing presence in my body, not just sweat. It’s a practice that grounds me while still challenging me.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/september-reset/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In reality, it’s a simple batter that’s split in two. One half is adulterated with instant espresso and cocoa, and then the halves are layered in a single pan so they swirl together, baking into a marbled mélange of cream and coffee. A splash of Marsala wine drives home the tiramisu theme (I swapped in sweet vermouth, which I usually use for tiramisu too since I always have it for <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/manhattan-drink-cocktail\">Manhattans</a>). Don’t skip the mascarpone topping. It might seem excessive, but the contrast between dense, custardy cheesecake and ethereal mousse-like topping is kind of the whole point. —<i>Joe Sevier, senior editor, cooking and SEO</i></p>\n<p>It might be September, but I’m still swimming in tomatoes and corn. I came across this recipe from <a href=\"https://maxbaroni.substack.com/\">Max Baroni</a> for a simple butter bean and tomato <a href=\"https://maxbaroni.substack.com/p/roasted-tomatoes-w-lemony-butter\">salad</a> that was super easy to make. I liked everything together, but the star of the show was the vinegar-marinated roasted tomatoes. The sherry vinegar brought out the tomatoes’ natural sweetness, and I found myself grabbing my leftovers to put on toast with the yogurt sauce. I’m making the salad again before the season is over for a savory-sweet breakfast that instantly sparks joy. <i>— Urmila Ramakrishnan, associate director of social media</i></p>\n<p>This content can also be viewed on the site it <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DNbFFPtN_fR\">originates</a> from.</p>\n<p>There’s nothing like a summer tomato (we know them, we love them) but I raise you a summer <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/tomato-martini\">tomato martini</a>. In the past I’ve tossed together a version of my own with juices leftover from tomatoes I’ve salted and left to sit for use in another dish, but when Jesse Szewczyk’s recipe went live, I almost immediately headed to the farmers market. His recipe calls for muddling sweet Sun Gold tomatoes and fresh basil, plus a smidge of salt and sugar until juicy; then stirring in gin, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/yes-you-should-be-using-vermouth-in-your-martinis?srsltid=AfmBOopMqVh9Jmh-_ZWPGxKjaQTX6LuVNmXkKr6zmGUG215BuDpUu6lx\">vermouth</a>, and ice until well-chilled. I strained the drink into a glass with a large ice cube—I like martinis on the rocks, don’t sue!—and was delighted. Unlike the extra-dirty martini trend we can’t seem to escape, a tomato martini hits an ideal balance of salty-sweet and savory without overpowering the gin or tasting like an olive jar. I know the “perfect” martini already exists as a concept, but this is a pretty flawless way to toast to the end of summer. <i>— Rebecca Firkser, contributing editor</i></p>\n<p>Now that it’s officially September, I intend to grill as many nights as possible while the sun is still high in the sky at dinnertime and the weather is, at least this week, perfect. And when it comes to grilling fish, swordfish is one of my absolute favorites. It’s meatier and less delicate than other fish, so it takes well to the grill without having to worry about the skin sticking or the fillet falling apart. I love this recipe for <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/10046-grilled-marinated-swordfish-steaks\">Grilled Marinated Swordfish Steaks</a>, which requires only 10 to 15 minutes of marinating in soy sauce, red wine vinegar, spices, and aromatics before throwing the fish on the grill (for just a few minutes per side). The recipe calls for serving with a string bean salad, but I paired it with a medley of grilled vegetables (peppers! eggplant! zucchini! onion!) and it was the perfect Labor Day dinner. <i>— Kate Kassin, editorial operations manager</i></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/recipes-bon-appetit-editors-cooked-september-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Behind her, the bombed-out ruins of Mariupol’s maternity hospital. More than a dozen people, including women in labour, were injured in the attack in March 2022. The woman photographed, Iryna Kalinina, later died along with her unborn baby.</p>\n<p>In the three years since then, maternity care in Ukraine has remained under constant attack, with <a href=\"https://www.attacksonhealthukraine.org/\">more than 2,000 strikes on medical facilities</a>, including 81 affecting maternal care and delivery rooms. Just last month, Diana Koshyk, seven months pregnant, was killed when a missile struck a maternity hospital in the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region.</p>\n<p>Over the past month, the Guardian has visited three maternity hospitals on the frontline to witness how Russia’s full-scale invasion and attacks on healthcare facilities have taken away women’s fundamental right to a safe childbirth.</p>\n<p>At each hospital, women and the staff working there face terrible danger: circling drones, artillery, ballistic missiles and the targeted degradation of healthcare infrastructure. They risk themselves to bring new life into a country where there are now <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/ukraine/\">three deaths for every birth</a>.</p>\n<p>Even with renewed hopes for an end to the war, Russia’s brutal tactics have fuelled a demographic crisis for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>.

As the windows were blown in and glass sprayed across beds, the women – some pregnant, others with newborns and one in active labour – were rushed across the river to a perinatal centre for urgent medical care. All were suffering from shock, but the woman in labour needed an urgent caesarean section. Staff operated quickly and mother and baby survived.</p>\n<p>Such bombardment has become all too common in Kharkiv, which has been under heavy and sustained attack since the first hours of the war. In June, the city was hit with the largest number of attacks since the full-scale invasion began. At the perinatal centre now taking care of women, doctors say they have delivered babies in the middle of air attacks, and carried out surgery while bouncing up and down from the impact of explosions.</p>\n<p>The city itself is heavily scarred by war. Broken glass lines the pavements outside the hospital, while two buildings opposite lie derelict after suffering damage. The centre’s windows are filled with sandbags, their plastic panes crossed with tape to contain any breakage. Power cuts are routine, with caesareans having been carried out by torchlight in the past.</p>\n<p>It is a lot of stress to contend with if you are pregnant. Doctors say they have seen medical complications and breakdowns – one new mother refused to take her child home after she learned her husband had been killed at the front. The hospital now employs a psychologist to help ease the fears of women who are reluctant to even come to the hospital due to the risk it could be hit.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/21/russia-ukraine-war-childbirth-demographics-targeting-attacks-maternity-hospitals-kharkiv-sloviansk-khersonbirth-crisis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>There are plenty of places where no one would bat an eyelid at the sight of a thong bikini; on a beach in Brazil or around the Love Island fire pit, visible butt cheeks are practically de rigueur. But my first sighting this year was not while surfing in Australia or sunbathing in the Caribbean, but at an open-water swimming spot, on a rainy day in Scotland.</p>\n<p>I should not have been surprised. Tiny swimwear is huge news this summer. It is no longer confined to sunny climes, but cropping up everywhere from lidos to leisure centres – and lochs, apparently.</p>\n<p>The trickle down from catwalks and influencers to holidaymakers and shoppers is notable. A search for “thong bikini” on Asos yields 187 results, ranging from high-leg styles, to side-tie, to tanga (somewhere between a thong and a standard brief), while high-street outlets including <a href=\"https://www2.hm.com/en_gb/ladies/shop-by-product/swimwear.html?clothingStyles=Thong\">H&amp;M</a>, <a href=\"https://www.calzedonia.com/uk/women/swimwear_and_beachwear/bikini_bottoms/thongs/\">Calzedonia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.zara.com/uk/en/woman-beachwear-l1052.html?v1=2418954\">Zara</a> all have thong bikini bottoms in their collections. And, as with any trend, there are plenty of celebrity forerunners, including gymnast <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DMd73FqRwHD/?img_index=1\">Simone Biles</a>, model <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DMVhs0Mxoj4/\">Heidi Klum</a>, actor <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14606647/Sofia-Vergara-bottom-bikini-poolside.html\">Sofía Vergara</a> and singer <a href=\"https://sg.news.yahoo.com/nicole-scherzinger-celebrates-turning-47-124500796.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJCrmLdZgtXinISpG1B2-Sw4c7NTzL0WwFs_gCh4j8fHb3BJqXJxovFTgVdSLZWoeY0ImCud7bFZShAbLmsxEimPNxuyAnCZv0RRuw0cPAkBsQTgLyrUJTmppxBNG4mtX0PjwkxVlAmT0x5q3VN8htUOC2W-lngR7WJYlBX1_LTC\">Nicole Scherzinger</a>. Rapper <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DKCnqqWR0V6/?hl=en\">Lizzo</a> is a longtime fan.</p>\n<p>“I won’t lie, it was nerve-racking initially,” says Victoria, 29, who wore a thong bikini for the first time on a recent solo trip to Naples. As for many new converts, part of the appeal lay in the fact that she would be able to avoid the significant tan lines created by fuller coverage swimwear. “I saw thong bikinis everywhere and wished I could wear one. But then I thought about it and was like, it’s just a bum. Men wear those teeny-tiny trunks where you see everything, so why can’t I wear this? Plus, it was really comfy.”</p>\n<p>The itsy-bitsy bikini revolution may have come to the fore this summer, but it has been rumbling for some time. In 2023, the New York Times declared that “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/16/style/g-string-thong-trend.html\">more women are adopting the ‘less is more’ philosophy</a>” when it comes to beachwear; the same year, fashion site Who What Wear called thong bikinis the “<a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/uk/thong-swimwear\">controversial swimwear trend you’ll see on every beach this summer</a>”. In 2024, New Zealand site The Spinoff asked: “<a href=\"https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/20-01-2024/why-is-every-bikini-bottom-a-thong-now\">Why is every bikini bottom a thong now?</a>”</p>\n<p>“I think we’ve moved into another age of body consciousness – a much more expressive moment,” says Shaun Cole, associate professor in fashion at the University of Southampton. “People are saying: ‘It’s my body and I can show it off in ways that I choose to, and if that involves wearing clothing that is sometimes deemed socially unacceptable then I’m going to do that.’”</p>\n<p>Gen Z, in particular, are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/aug/12/the-new-taboo-how-flattering-became-fashions-ultimate-f-word\">less inclined to restrict themselves</a> to clothes deemed to be “flattering” – a term that has fallen spectacularly out of favour. Thong bikinis, once the preserve of those who conformed to a particular body type, are now being manufactured in a more inclusive range of sizes and marketed more diversely.</p>\n<p>“Women of all shapes and sizes are leaning into bolder cuts with real confidence as part of a wider cultural shift towards body positivity and self-expression, which is great to see,” says Aliya Wilkinson, founder of luxury <a href=\"https://www.osale-plage.com/\">swimwear label Ôsalé</a>. Her brand doesn’t yet offer thong styles, but she plans to introduce them in the future.</p>\n<p>“In the west, fashion has long found ways to augment the butt, to make it look bigger and put emphasis on this part of the female body,” says Roberta Sassatelli, professor of sociology at the University of Bologna and co-author of <a href=\"https://www.politybooks.com/bookdetail?book_slug=9781509550074\">Body and Gender</a>. “This is perhaps because the butt is deemed to be very sensual but is not related to reproduction. Because it is totally related to pleasure, it feels more liberated.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/21/the-thong-bikini-boom-why-the-skimpiest-swimwear-is-back-and-suddenly-mainstream\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>It’s summer reading time, and I have finally dived into Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s Dream Count, her highly anticipated return to fiction after a 12-year hiatus. This week, I give a review of sorts – what was most striking about the work is how it feels of a certain time, and how Adichie is an icon who sits between two eras.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Feminist icon to pop culture artefact?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Dream Count is as much a book as it is a publishing event. In the years between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/15/americanah-chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-review\">her previous novel, Americanah</a> – a book so successful that it has made the New York Times’s list of the best fiction of the 21st century – and her latest offering, Adichie became a cultural figurehead. Dream Count returns to the themes that Adichie is in greatest command of: an existence that sits between living in Africa and living in the diaspora. The Covid pandemic acts as a backdrop to the lives of four female protagonists, and between them there are the roiling affairs of the heart, disappointments and assaults and bodily wreckage whose collective toll starts to be felt, or “counted”, in middle age.</p>\n<p>The central figure is modelled on Nafissatou Diallo, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/27/strauss-kahn-affair-backstory\">allegedly assaulted in 2011 in a hotel room</a> by the French economist Dominique Strauss-Kahn. It is a “gesture of returned dignity”, Adichie says in her author’s note. But it is also an example of how the author always leans into the sharp and jagged realities of womanhood, with no desire to smooth its edges. Adichie is, above all, a a matter-of-fact narrator of bodily ravages: bad<strong> </strong>sex, small penises, postpartum injuries, fibroids and heavy bleeding. This is my favourite quality of Adichie’s. She doesn’t traffic in banalities or <a href=\"https://confluence.gallatin.nyu.edu/context/interdisciplinary-seminar/the-magical-negro-trope-in-literature-and-film\">idealisation of Black women</a> as poetically and magically tragic or noble. They just are.</p>\n<p>In Dream Count, Adichie’s style is as confident and singular as ever. Almost too much so. Her strong voice inserts itself into the mouths of her protagonists, who sometimes pronounce things that only she writes, rather than what regular people say: “Each day with Chuka,” one character narrates, “I encountered his otherness.” Ultimately, the reader always feels in safe hands. This novel is about intersecting female relationships in a female universe of voices and points of view, and there is something cosy and mutually affirming in that.</p>\n<p>Yet it also feels artificial (which is the writer’s prerogative, after all, to construct their narrative world), as if these characters were performing some grand allegory of a woman’s arc. I found myself thinking: just let them speak! Just let me embrace these women you have so tenderly portrayed. Which brings me to my main sense of the book: it felt like a series of set pieces, rather than a coherent work of fiction; an extended commentary on gender relations and societal expectations of women. I didn’t feel carried along, more an audience to strong but disconnected accounts and introspections.</p>\n<p>There is something in this that may be related to the moment that transformed Adichie from a literary sensation to a pop culture behemoth. Her book-length essay We Should All Be Feminists, a landmark treatise on, well, why we should all be feminists, became a totem of a particular era of mid-00s trends. It was the time of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/13/lean-in-sheryl-sandberg-review\">Lean In</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/apr/21/girlboss-review-netflix-sophia-amoruso-britt-robertson\">Girl Bosses</a> and a broader fourth-wave feminism that revived the movement through online activism, #MeToo, and women’s marches.</p>\n<p>Audio excerpts from Adichie’s Ted Talk on feminism were picked up by Beyoncé and featured in her 2013 hit Flawless. Dior <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/fashion/news/a43431/dior-we-should-all-be-feminists-shirt-rihanna-charity/\">designed T-shirts with “We should all be feminists”</a> printed on them. It was a weird time. Adichie was a perfect icon for that moment: strident, smart but also glamorous – marrying liberal progressive politics on gender with accessibility. She became the <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2016/12/chimamanda-adichie-on-black-hair-and-redefining-beauty.html\">face of the beauty brand No 7</a>, was on Vanity Fair’s <a href=\"\">best-dressed list</a>, and embraced fashion and beauty <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/28/fashion/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-boots-no7-makeup.html\">as a rebuke</a> to those who see them as somehow diminishing women’s intellect.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-10\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/aug/19/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-author-dream-count-writer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>“Marriage is a business deal and it always has been.” So says Dakota Johnson’s Lucy, an elite Manhattan matchmaker in Celine Song’s second feature, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/materialists\">Materialists</a>. Lucy may be a modern woman, but her world looks eerily similar to the marriage mart of Jane Austen’s day. For Lucy and her clients, it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife. Or rather, a “high quality woman”, as Lucy would unironically put it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jun/10/materialists-review-celine-song\">Materialists </a>drops us head first into a world where coupling off with a partner is a purely financial endeavour; where foolish notions of love are not merely ignored, but deemed to be irrelevant; where women must choose passion or practicality.</p>\n<p>If all of this sounds rather archaic or even regressive, that’s because it is. And Song knows it. After all, she frequently cites Jane Austen, specifically Pride and Prejudice, as one of her biggest inspirations for the film: “What an amazing fantasy Pride and Prejudice is, because in that story, the love of your life is also the answer to all your practical problems,” she said to <a href=\"https://www.curzon.com/journal/celine-song-materialists-interview/\">Curzon</a>.</p>\n<p>Just as this year’s best picture winner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/03/anora-review-sean-baker-screwball-cinderella-tale-vaults-him-towards-greatness-mikey-madison\">Anora</a> was widely viewed as the anti-Pretty Woman for flipping the fantasy of the rich-guy-falls-for-sex-worker-and-whisks-her-out-of-poverty on its head, Materialists functions as a sort of anti-Pride and Prejudice. As Song notes, Austen’s beloved novel offers a similar fantasy: that the man you love might also be the answer to your practical financial problems.</p>\n<p>In Materialists, as in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/anora\">Anora</a>, the fantasy doesn’t quite play out. Not that Lucy is naive enough to expect it to. No, this heroine is all practicality and sense. “I will die alone or marry a rich man,” she says with resignation at the beginning of the film. This businesslike approach to love doesn’t just come from her day job: she has been burned by passionate love in the past: her ex-boyfriend John is a 37-year-old waiter who, despite having the face of Chris Evans, can’t seem to make it as an actor.</p>\n<p>She gets her chance at the dream marriage of convenience when she meets Harry, an uber rich guy who seems nice enough and has a $12m apartment. He is, her colleague says enviously, a “unicorn”. This is another unexpected echo of Anora – when Ani, a sex worker looking for a way out of poverty, meets and marries a wealthy young Russian, Vanya, her colleague, also envious, snarks, “Oh, you caught your whale”.</p>\n<p>Each of these reverse fantasies are driven by heroines who are adamantly uninterested in romance. It marks new territory. Even in Austen’s day, heroines clung to the fantasy of a love match despite the practical realities of their time. And we progressed from there. The early screwball romcoms of the 1930s and 40s brought us headstrong heroines, while the 80s and 90s screen romances were filled with “working girls” who were independent, self-sufficient women. Now, it seems, we are entering a new era defined by heroines who openly, proudly proclaim their desire for a practical match – an era of young women who have given up on love.</p>\n<p>Fascinatingly, this is playing out in the real world, too. For a generation of young heterosexual women, a “unicorn” or a “whale” is seen as the ultimate prize. “Watching Materialists when the poor man propaganda wins and Lucy picks a broke 37-year-old failed actor over rich, loving Harry who would give her the world,” one person wrote in a TikTok <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@livetheedream/video/7516269301712719134\">video</a> in response to Materialists that scored more than 22,000 likes. “I will <i>not</i> fall for broke guy propaganda, she fumbled <i>hard</i>,” another <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@nellajoelsgf/video/7517366589998763266\">wrote</a> – also liked more than 22,000 times.

I was doing sit-ups when, suddenly, the left side of my body was overtaken by tingling. A colorful corona bloomed in my left eye. I found it hard to speak. My wife drove me to the emergency room. There was a cardiology investigation. Then there were others. I got a neurologist, and then a gastroenterologist. I started getting monthly blood tests. Doctors scanned my brain and tested my nerves. Each test showed me to be in good health. And yet symptoms of <i>something</i> have persisted. Where I live, family doctors are hard to come by, so I’ve been required to piece together my own care. My wife provides tremendous emotional support, but we’re not all so fortunate. Where, then, should we look for solace? Viola Zhou’s mother has lived with chronic kidney problems for two decades. As China’s aging population puts increased pressure on the nation’s healthcare infrastructure, Zhou’s mother has seen her marriage fracture and her daughter leave the country. In her isolation, she has turned to DeepSeek, an AI-powered chatbot, for medical guidance, tasking it with interpreting her medical records, changing her diet, and reducing her immunosuppressant dose. She warmly thanks the chatbot, and it responds in kind. Zhou brings her mother’s chat records to specialists, who point out the errors in Dr. DeepSeek’s responses. And yet Zhou’s mother dismisses the shortcomings. “DeepSeek is more humane,” she tells Zhou. “Doctors are more like machines.” These days, there is no shortage of stories about people in crisis who turn to AI for support, sometimes to perilous ends. Zhou’s feature reminds us that such stories are symptoms—of technological limits, isolation, and dysfunctional healthcare systems. —<a href=\"https://longreads.com/author/fitzheraldtribune/\">BF</a></p>\n<h2>2. <a href=\"https://www.nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/god-dog/?src=longreads\">God Dog</a></h2>\n<p><i>Mina Tavakoli</i> | <i>n+1</i> | <i>September 2, 2025</i> | <i>3,089 words</i></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/09/05/the-top-5-longreads-of-the-week-577/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It was here.”Outside, it looks just like one of the many small towns we wind our way through, halting for a week or two to put up a show. It has been raining for days. The university dome in the distance glistens with dark moss against the ponderous sky. The fairground is all mud, sludge and clumps of grass, sucking in our tent posts like a fumbling, ungainly monster. A group of local men, hired to dry up enough ground to put up the main circus tent, have been working since the morning. So why does this miserable earth feel like a familiar taste, again?We wonder if Johuree would like a cup of tea. He agrees. There is no milk, but he sips the dark brown brew in silence.We watch.“There is a cottage at the far end of the town. Little more than ruins now, I presume. Would you like to visit?”Johuree never goes anywhere. We don”t recall him ever stepping out into the daylight. We don”t recall much anything. Though we travel far and wide with the circus, we have never left the camp site and gone “sightseeing”, as some others in the troupe are in the habit of doing.</p>\n<p>Nor has he.</p>\n<p>“He was my friend. My brother. We had fought together through our darkest hour.”</p>\n<p>Johuree never reminisces, the least of all about family. We are not sure if there is anything to reminisce. He shifts his bulk upon the faded patchwork rug that is the only seat for guests in our tent. He places the empty cup and plate delicately on the floor.</p>\n<p>We sit on wooden chairs set against the mirror and the dressing table. We nod.</p>\n<p>“Well, then. We leave after lunch and return by sundown. I will send Bansiram out to find a pair of hooded raincoats for you . ”</p>\n<p>After he leaves, we fiddle around our tent, grappling with the thought.</p>\n<p>Eventually, Elia speaks, “Our . . . father.”</p>\n<p>“Should we put on our makeup?” says Sascha.</p>\n<p>“He didn’ t say. ”</p>\n<p>“He didn ‘ t say not to.”</p>\n<p>That is a fact. We never leave the tent without our makeup. But then, we never leave to go anywhere but up on the stage.</p>\n<p>“What if we dress up as one of each?” Elia suggests. “You take the light one, I take the dark.”</p>\n<p>This sounds reasonable. Sounds like the way we think people in the non-circus world might dress.</p>\n<p>Our efforts meet Johuree’ s approval. We are less sure that his silver ringmaster jacket is the appropriate attire for a visit to the dead. But we do not know what is, so we hold our judgement.</p>\n<p>“Going out, babu saab?”</p>\n<p>Wading through the mud towards us is one of the men working on the ground. Soaked, mud-splattered kurta pajama lingers against translucent skin that stretches tight over his bones. The man sucks vigorously at a sodden beedi.</p>\n<p>“Just taking the children out for a walk. Bit of sightseeing.”</p>\n<p>“Some weather for sightseeing.”</p>\n<p>“Not likely to improve any time soon, is it?” Johuree displays his teeth.</p>\n<p>The man stares at us. We recede under the hoods of our oversized raincoats.</p>\n<p>Then he smiles. “Let me come with you. I know the town well – places to see, things of interest.”</p>\n<p>“A generous offer, but really—”</p>\n<p>The man picks up our pace. “Which places would you like to visit? The university? Some of our magnificent—”</p>\n<p>“Another day, perhaps,” Johuree is curt, impatient. “This afternoon we will just pay a visit to the Padri Sahib ‘s house.”</p>\n<p>“On that account, I’ m afraid you are about ten years too late. The Padri Sahib is long dead. There is nothing left of his house and garden but weeds and mud. And a grave.”</p>\n<p>“Then my children will look at weeds, mud and a grave.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/04/22/podcastle-888-tales-from-the-vaults-this-sullied-earth-our-home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 887: “The Cuckoo of Vrežna Mountain</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated PG-13</p>\n<h3>The Cuckoo of Vrežna Mountain</h3>\n<p/><p>I realised I was in love with Ivor the day he went up the mountain to speak with the goddess.</p>\n<p>We were at that age when the affectionate ease of childhood tips over into something different, when every touch could be the casual brush of friendship or something more and I would never know in advance which was which. There were many times, in those days, when Ivor would take my hands in his, larger and warmer and smooth with the orange-blossom oil he rubbed into them; and I would jerk away with some hasty apology and adjust my trousers while he was not looking. To this day, I find the smell of oranges arousing at the most inopportune times, of which, in a town known for its citrus trees, there are uncomfortably many.</p>\n<p>Which is to say that it was not entirely unexpected, this matter of my being in love with him, except insofar as I had never considered the option until it was upon me; and if we had been boys further up the coast, away from the Oracle and her mountain, perhaps this would have been a cause for celebration: the sort of slow exploration of love and youth that ends, mutually, in a friendship deeper than it was before.</p>\n<p>But Ivor was a scion of the city Vrežna, and his mother Silva was a devout woman. Her ways were the old ways, and that was why I awoke early one morning to climb a mountain with Ivor and wait out the dew, wait out the dawn, wait out the moment he emerged from the goddess’s temple a betrothed man.</p>\n<p>The temple stood facing the sea, the bulk of the mountain shielding it from the town below. It was a simple structure, columned and open to the elements with a tall pointed roof. Inside, the floor was given over to a shallow pool of water that was a hand deep at most. There was no altar. The Oracle did not accept gifts.</p>\n<p>Ivor splashed through the water like a man born to the task. Silva and I remained outside, but the demarcation was immaterial. The Oracle’s temple was curiously small. It was easy to see everything that went on inside. Vrežna’s people claim that only those born within sight of her mountain could see the Oracle’s physical form. I do not know if this is true. I do know that until that day, until I looked at the thing slumped at Ivor’s feet, I had never seen anything in the temple.</p>\n<p>It was a woman, slumped against the shallow steps rimming the pool. Her skin was the same light brown as Ivor’s but mottled with pale splotches, like someone had spilled ink that sapped colour rather than granted it. Her open eyes were an even grey. She looked as though dead, I thought, until her lips opened around an indrawn breath.</p>\n<p>“How strange,” Silva said to me, and it took me a moment to realise that she was not looking inside the temple, not speaking of the woman lying there, “to stand with one of the Godless on the Oracle’s mountain. Or perhaps three dead gods is not enough for you? Would you strike down our Vrežna, given the chance?”</p>\n<p>She said it as if she had not herself stamped the permission form that allowed a non-Vrežni access to the mountain.</p>\n<p>“Two dead gods,” I murmured. “The third survives.”’</p>\n<p>“Even worse! Yours are not the only people to suffer the death of a deity, nor would you have been the only ones to seek out new beliefs, but to willingly abandon a living god? <i>That</i> is why they call you Godless.”</p>\n<p>This was a game she played with me. Once, I had been a playing piece: a child of the Godless brought to Vrežna by a dying father, the perfect subject for a performance of generosity. She’d taken me in, raised with me her son, never in anything like brotherhood but as an ornament, to single her out in the crowded world of Vrežna society.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/04/15/podcastle-887-the-cuckoo-of-vrezna-mountain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We only have the one left, and most people would not appreciate having it gone.”</p>\n<p>“Some might, though.” Above them, the ceiling fan whirls, valiantly trying to assuage the heat. The maintenance company, when Houyi called, gave the next available date for fixing the air conditioning as Monday, which — while not too far away — is crucially not today. “The tanuki pack in Arlington Heights or all those hipster vamp kids in Logan Square, I’m sure they’d come down to personally thank me. Besides, I didn’t say I was going to kill the sun. Just rough it up a little, teach it a few lessons about respect.”</p>\n<p>“A truly terrifying prospect. Gods and men tremble at your approach, naught but the bravest of heroes can dare but stand when you draw near.” On her Sudoku puzzle, Chang’E pencils in a seven, frowns, and then erases it. “Humans have lived thousands of years without air conditioning, Houyi. We can survive a few days.”</p>\n<p>“Aiyah, but that was thousands of years ago, before we had electricity and coal and acid in our rain. This sun’s been getting far too bold, I say. In the old days, I would already have a fast mount and a full quiver to chase the whelp down.”</p>\n<p>“If you are mulling over old battles,” Chang’E says, “perhaps it would be better if you had something else to occupy your mind.” Placing her Sudoku book on the coffee table, she stands up. “I have a task for you, my husband.”</p>\n<p>The effects of these words are instant. “A task, is it? Well! Let’s have it. What is it you need, my best beloved? The first fallen feather from a newborn phoenix, a sprig of new buds from the world tree, the last dried slices from this millennia’s crop of divine peaches on Kunlun Mountain?”</p>\n<p>“Something like that.” Chang’E takes her purse off the wall hook, smooths down an errant wrinkle in her dress. “We are in need of groceries once more, my beloved. I would appreciate your help in seeing this task to completion.”</p>\n<p>“In this weather? Do you care so little for your husband that you would have him roasted to ashes?”</p>\n<p>“I care enough for my husband that I would not have him starve, yes. Besides, we’ll be spending most of the time indoors, and the stores have air conditioning.”</p>\n<p>“The trials we must brave in this cruel world,” Houyi says, sighing as he reaches for his cane. “To think that after all our years of service, this is how the world repays its heroes of lore: with broken air conditioning and technicians unavailable until Monday.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t forget to put on sunscreen,” Chang’E says, checking her sunhat in the hallway mirror. “You may have bested his brothers before, but the sun is still a formidable foe.”</p>\n<p>Houyi, dutifully trundling their shopping cart across narrow sidewalks and cracked asphalt, is sweating by the time they reach Tai Hwa Market. On instinct, he reaches for a chilled Tsinghua to place in their cart.</p>\n<p>“No,” Chang’E says, slapping his hand away. “No alcohol on an empty stomach.”</p>\n<p>“Betrayed by those closest to me,” Houyi laments as he lets himself be led away from the refrigerated drinks. “What is the use of immortality if a man cannot simply have a cold drink when he desires?”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/04/08/podcastle-886-houyi-the-archer-fights-the-sun/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 885: Prisoners</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated PG</p>\n<h3>Prisoners</h3>\n<p/><p>The fortress was as large as a city and empty as a dried-up well. During the days, I followed a tattered map annotated by many hands and took many wrong turns through cramped hallways, treacherous stairways, and rusty gates. At night, I couldn’t sleep. Resting on the cold, stone floor, I clutched a delicate metal ringlet weighed down by heavy keys, worried I might lose it.</p>\n<p>After five days, the claustrophobic ceiling finally opened up into a courtyard. The air was cold and fresh. The full moon illuminated a cloudy sky. At the center of the courtyard, a rusty cage hung a few feet off the ground — just enough distance so that the man’s feet couldn’t touch the stone floor. The man was as gaunt as the cage. They were one and the same with the way he sat: motionless, his thin arms wrapped around the bars, his thin legs protruding from the bottom.</p>\n<p>He slept with a shallow breath, now and then shuddering and whimpering. His eyes fluttered open, and he groaned.</p>\n<p>“Who’s there?” he said weakly in an accent I had not heard in a long time. Although his hair was jet black and his face free of wrinkles, the frailty of his words made him appear a hundred years old. He straightened up and said more firmly, “What do you want?” The illusion broke, and he looked like a much younger man. He looked familiar, like a childhood friend.</p>\n<p>I tried to control the excitement in my voice and hide the reason I was there. “When I heard about you, I had to come see for myself.”</p>\n<p>“Who are you?”</p>\n<p>“I’m the Queen.”</p>\n<p>His face was impassive. “Is that so? Come closer — I can’t see very well.”</p>\n<p>I stepped forward, a breath away from his reach.</p>\n<p>His eyes studied me. My red silk gown flowed as smoothly as ocean waves, the jewels in my hair gleamed in the moonlight, and the perfume on my feet smelled of petrichor. The chaos priest had painted the penumbral edge of judgment on my forehead. The heavy set of keys hung on my belt.</p>\n<p>“Are you going to free me?” he said and laughed bitterly.</p>\n<p>“That was my intention, but first, I have some questions for you.”</p>\n<p>“You would have brought guards if you intended to free me. I’ve had this conversation countless times with countless people. I don’t know the answer to what you’re looking for. You’re wasting your time.”</p>\n<p>“You’ll find it hard to believe how much time I’ve already spent trying to find you.”</p>\n<p>“Your forebears wanted the same thing. Whatever means they used, it always ended the same way: they died, and I am still here, locked up in this cage.”</p>\n<p>“They were not my forebears.”</p>\n<p>The man’s eyebrow arched. “A revolution then? That must be quite a story.”</p>\n<p>“Allow me three questions. That is all I ask.”</p>\n<p>He looked tired. He shifted his legs and grimaced. “And you’ll free me afterward?”</p>\n<p>“That depends on your answers.”</p>\n<p>The man sneered and nodded. “Of course.”</p>\n<p>“Why were you put into this cage?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“I stole a piece of bread,” he said, “Next question.”</p>\n<p>“I was told you didn’t need food to survive.”</p>\n<p>“The bread wasn’t for me.”</p>\n<p>The man’s eyes were like dark pools of water where the depths were deeper than the ocean, and I couldn’t see below the surface.</p>\n<p>“Please, tell me more. You must answer my questions to the best of your ability.”</p>\n<p>The man sighed. “Very well. This was centuries ago when a revolutionary movement overthrew the Emperor. They deemed everyone equal: the farmer was equal to the merchant who was equal to the noble. The central government rationed food to every person. But why did the farmer have to till the land when everyone was equal? Why work harder only to have your surplus taken by officials to be split among everyone else?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/04/01/podcastle-885-prisoners/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Artists create Reborns as one-of-a-kind collectibles, often from ordinary play dolls transformed into art suitable for hands-off display—or hands-on cuddling.</p>\n<p>While reasonably durable, Reborns are not children’s toys. Rough play may damage them.</p>\n<p/><p><i>How do the dolls become “reborn”?</i></p>\n<p>An artist re-paints each doll with more lifelike skin-toned paints, mixed to achieve the actual skin tones of real babies across the racial spectrum. Delicate veins and blue wash undertones give the newborn baby a more realistic appearance. Hair is sewn strand by strand into plastic bald or molded hair-grooved heads through a process called micro-rooting. Glass beads weight the baby’s body, head, and limbs for the authentic feel of holding a living infant.</p>\n<p>Electronic devices can be added that mimic a heartbeat and respiration. Other devices can make the baby warm to the touch, or make it emit infant sounds. Magnets can be inserted in the mouth and glued onto on an actual baby pacifier (Nuk, Avent, Gerber, etc.). When the magnetized pacifier sticks to the magnet in the mouth, the baby appears to be sucking on a binkie, just like a real baby.</p>\n<p>*WARNING*: Strong magnets! Can be harmful to pacemaker wearers and others with medical implants.</p>\n<p/><p><i>Why are Reborns so expensive?</i></p>\n<p>BabyMaker<sup>TM</sup> uses only real glass eyes imported from Germany, the best mohair available, aquamarine glass beads from the Czech Republic for weighting, and rare earth magnets for each baby. Art, packing, and shipping supplies also contribute to the cost.</p>\n<p>Each baby takes a minimum of three weeks to create, and goes home with its own layette, which includes a three-piece outfit, sleeper, hat, diapers, and receiving blanket, as well as birth and adoption certificates.</p>\n<p><i>Where can I buy a Reborn? What sort of person buys a Reborn? How lifelike are they?</i></p>\n<p>Most Reborns are sold through online nurseries, such as BabyMaker<sup>TM</sup>, or at art conventions and fairs.</p>\n<p>Almost all purchasers of Reborns are women, though we do have customers of other sexes and genders. Some customers collect Reborns as they would regular dolls. Often, older, single women treat Reborns as substitutes for the children they cannot have. Some customers who have lost a child, or have become empty-nesters, find adding a Reborn to the family comforting. Cuddling a Reborn, like cuddling any baby, causes a release of the hormone oxytocin, which produces a sense of emotional well-being.</p>\n<p>Reborns are so lifelike they are sometimes mistaken for real babies. A few have even been “rescued” from parked cars after passers-by called the police.</p>\n<p><i>I want a baby so much I feel as though I have a hole in my heart, but I’m forty-four, had several miscarriages back when I was married, and now find myself without a partner. I don’t have the money to adopt or to pay for artificial insemination through an anonymous donor. I know it’s a lot to hope for, but what are the chances my Reborn will become real?</i></p>\n<p>Think long and hard about what you’re asking. Reborns never need diaper changes, feeding, or bathing. They never vomit all over their beds in the middle of the night. You’ll never have to endure tantrums, visits to the principal’s office, or screams of “I hate you.”</p>\n<p>Your baby may be stolen, but will never be kidnapped. Reborns never suffer broken hearts, and never grow up to become drug addicts or criminals.</p>\n<p>Best of all, your child will never fall victim to an untimely death. Reborns provide all of the cuddles with none of the pain.</p>\n<p>*WARNING*: Consult a health professional if you find yourself socializing only with your Reborn.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/03/25/podcastle-884-tales-from-the-vaults-all-of-the-cuddles-with-none-of-the-pain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But New Year’s Day would be my fifth wedding anniversary with Jamie — our “wood” anniversary — and he had gotten tickets to a burlesque show because he thought he was hilarious. Predictably, he insisted that it would be wasteful to skip the show because the tickets were fifty dollars each. Plus, booze was included. Plus, he could watch women dance out of their clothes, which was significantly more interesting than watching me sit around all night in the oversized sweater and leggings I’d been wearing since Christmas.</p>\n<p>“Plus, Mary,” he said, “maybe you’ll surprise yourself and have fun for once.”</p>\n<p>And so I pulled a black slip dress over my leggings and twisted my unwashed hair into a bun, and Jamie and I squeezed into the dingy black box theater just as the first dancer finished her set. Jamie muttered something about me making him late again before disappearing to the bar. He didn’t ask me if I wanted anything, which was fine because I didn’t. My temples pounded along with the bass blaring from the too-close speaker. Everyone in the audience was standing, and the guy directly in front of me was well over six feet tall and completely blocking the stage. The back of his jacket was a maroon velvet that looked so soft and dark that I longed to press my face against it until the bass stopped pumping and my brain stopped throbbing.</p>\n<p>And then the bass stopped pumping.</p>\n<p>I pushed up onto my toes to peer around the velvet jacket as slow piano and the first rich notes of Des’ree’s “Kissing You” wrapped around me and pulled me forward until I found myself standing in front of the tall man.</p>\n<p>By the time you glided onto the stage, I had somehow edged my way to the front of the crowd. They introduced you as Ale Mary. Your sequined teddy glinted like a disco ball with every slow, luxurious spin, and your arms were clad in long feathery wings, which you used to cover and uncover your body in delicious, teasing motions. You were the most glamorous woman I had ever seen.</p>\n<p>And each time you spun toward the audience, you looked directly into my eyes.</p>\n<p>By the time the song ended, Jamie had made his way to the front of the house and draped his heavy arm around my neck. I barely felt it.</p>\n<p>“I have to pee!” I yelled over the music, untangling myself from him. He nodded, eyes glued to the stage. The next dancer was already down to pasties and a thong, flossing a purple boa between her legs.</p>\n<p>I didn’t want to fight the crowd to the back of the house, so I slipped through a door to the left of the stage. I realized my mistake as soon as the door clicked shut behind me and an icy wind whipped down the alley outside the theater with enough force to make my eyes water.</p>\n<p>“Shit.” I grabbed the door handle and yanked. Nothing. “Shit. Shit. <i>Shit.</i>”</p>\n<p>I spun around and growled, eager to kick the nearest dumpster or brick wall or some other big hard alley thing, and nearly collided with you. My eyes pricked with embarrassment, but I was not going to cry in front of you.</p>\n<p>You extended a gloved hand. You were holding an old-fashioned cigarette holder, smoke curling off the tip and spiraling into the frosty air in serpentine curls. “Want a drag?”</p>\n<p>“Um, I . . . I don’t smoke.”</p>\n<p>“Me neither.” You laughed and your whole body shook with a raw, chaotic energy that complicated the graceful, glamorous persona you’d presented on stage. “I needed some air so I bummed this off one of the gals. I found this prop cigarette holder in the green room; couldn’t resist trying it out.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/03/18/podcastle-883-redo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>On the bus making its way through Kerala to the misty hills of Vagamon, a group of 15 women, many wearing hijabs and dupattas, with colourful shirts pulled over jeans, hum a melodious tune, clapping and swaying in rhythm.</p>\n<p>Once off the bus, the women start their hike through the lush tea plantations. Reaching a peak, they stop to face out over the vast valley, link hands and sing a hopeful song about newfound freedom.</p>\n<p>This is India’s first “divorce camp”, founded by 31-year-old Rafia Afi for women who are divorced, separated, widowed or suffering in their relationships to come together at a healing retreat. “The idea is to normalise divorce and give it dignity,” she says.</p>\n<p>“Divorce can be beautiful too, when two people decide they do not want to be together,” Afi says. “I want to remind people it doesn’t have to mean the end of your whole life.”</p>\n<p>Her own divorce last year pushed Afi to slowly “embrace” being on her own. “I started creating content on social media, speaking about healing and single parenting. Many people connected with that and began messaging me.</p>\n<p>“It was disturbing to realise that not everyone had a support system like I had with my family and friends; most of them faced judgment and couldn’t speak up,” she says.</p>\n<p>It sparked the idea of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DNiKawns1bN/?img_index=1\">Break Free Stories</a>, divorce healing camps designed to build a community of women who could connect with others going through similar experiences.</p>\n<p>Afi has been documenting the camps in Kerala, from the backwaters of Alappuzha to the fishing port of Kozhikode (also known as Calicut), on social media. Two-day nature-themed retreats, held a few weekends each month, accommodate 15–20 women from different backgrounds and cost upwards of 1,700 rupees (£15), though Afi offers a few free spots for those unable to pay.</p>\n<p>Each camp begins with games to break the ice before moving into activities such as hiking, dancing and music sessions.</p>\n<p>“Once the women feel comfortable with each other, we have storytelling sessions and healing conversations in a safe, non-judgmental space. We also talk about becoming financially independent. By the end of the camp, the women rebuild and reclaim their stories, and strangers become friends,” Afi says.</p>\n<p>Zaki J, a musician and lawyer, was initially invited to conduct music sessions at the camp, but she realised that many participants, particularly survivors of domestic violence, were looking for legal advice as well.</p>\n<p>“I started conducting legal sessions to bridge that gap. Many blamed themselves for breaking up their families by contemplating divorce; the objective is to break societal norms around gender abuse and educate every woman on her rights, divorce and safety laws.</p>\n<p>“My mother died at the hands of my father. That pushed me to become an advocate to fight a case against him,” she says. “I want to help others take the right step at the right time.”</p>\n<p>According to the most recent <a href=\"https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR375/FR375.pdf\">National Family Health Survey</a> to be published in India, 32% of married women aged 18-49 reported domestic violence. Women are routinely put under pressure to remain in abusive marriages, even as dowry- and marital violence-related deaths continue to make headlines.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-16\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>Afi says: “Suicides and murders linked to marital abuse are happening all around us, and I want parents to realise that walking out of a bad marriage is an act of courage.</p>\n<p>“Too many people see separation as shameful, choosing death over divorce. Society romanticises silent suffering and that’s dangerous – I want to change that narrative.”</p>\n<p>Many of the nearly 150 women who have attended the camps so far say the experience has been transformative. Surya Kalarikkal says: “My marriage was traumatic and the divorce difficult. I had forgotten how to smile from the heart. But at the camp, we cried, we laughed, and I let out all my emotions for the first time in 15 years.</p>\n<p>“We realised that divorce can be freeing. I found the courage to take legal action if anyone defames me as a divorcee. As we checked out of the hotel, we felt like freshers, without any stigma.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/aug/29/women-divorce-indian-retreats-camps-marriage-domestic-violence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

That said, a lot of plus-size designs on the market in the high street are, well, quite crap. They are frumpy, ill-considered and not fashion-forward or exciting. Which is why this summer I was inspired to launch a <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frixolondon.com%2Fcollections%2Frixo-x-billie-bhatia%3Fpg%3D1&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/27/how-to-find-plus-size-dress-red-carpet-formal-smart\">collaboration with dress brand Rixo</a> – a 16-piece collection of size-inclusive dresses that evoke a sense of freedom, the idea that with one swish of a great dress over your head you are handled, you are stylish, you are good.</p>\n<p>Before I designed my own collection (I have found myself living in <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frixolondon.com%2Fproducts%2Falina-dress-bhatia-floral-black&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/27/how-to-find-plus-size-dress-red-carpet-formal-smart\">my floral design</a> for most of the summer), I had to think carefully about what plus-size shoppers need from a dress.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.zara.com/uk/en/zw-collection-linen-tie-dye-tunic-dress-p04043241.html\">zara.com</a>\n    </p>\n<p>I know that dresses can be generous in silhouette, so I am not always restricted to those few that are actually in my size. Searching for kaftan-style or even just oversized options, and going into stores to examine the shape has proved fruitful in my search for dresses that may not have been specifically made for me. For example, a lot of high street retailers have a high summer rotation of oversized dresses, including a <a href=\"https://www.zara.com/uk/en/zw-collection-linen-tie-dye-tunic-dress-p04043241.html?v1=454020483\">tie-dye tunic from Zara</a> (£69.99) that I recently tried on in store and, to my surprise, walked away with.</p>\n<p>Online is a more perilous battlefield to navigate unless you have already had a touchpoint with the brand and know how their sizing tends to run.</p>\n<p>I know that The Frankie Shop is typically generous in its sizing, so I didn’t hesitate to add its <a href=\"https://eu.thefrankieshop.com/products/avery-shirt-dress-white\">oversized shirt dress</a> (€245, or about £210) to my basket. Understanding brands, and knowing that sizing isn’t always as straightforward as what you see on the hangar, led me to find a dress that became my “made it” moment. It is a butter-yellow satin, floor-length <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.net-a-porter.com%2Fen-gb%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2Fbernadette%2Fclothing%2Fgowns%2Fnathalie-off-the-shoulder-taffeta-gown%2F1647597358560414&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/27/how-to-find-plus-size-dress-red-carpet-formal-smart\">Bernadette dress</a> (£815), which was a size 14 and still fit my size 24 body.</p>\n<blockquote>I never deemed myself, or my dress, worthy of standing in front of a wall of photographers on the red carpet</blockquote>\n<p>The Fashion Awards are the biggest red-carpet fashion event of the year in the UK and, by virtue of my job as a fashion journalist, I have been fortunate enough to attend many times. However, in previous years I have never walked the red carpet. I never deemed myself, or my dress, worthy of standing in front of a wall of photographers and holding my head and shoulders as if I belong with all of the other brilliantly and beautifully dressed attendees.</p>\n<p>That was until last December, when I wore that yellow Bernadette dress and felt – perhaps for the first time in my life – that I was as worthy of being in that heralded space as everyone else. The dress was cut so that a sliver of shoulder was on show, it drifted over my shape rather than clinging to it, it nipped in under my arm so that it still gave me an element of shape, and the colour received more compliments that I could count.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-11\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Sign up to Inside Saturday</p>\n<p>The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

    "body": "<p>Hello and welcome to The Long Wave. I’m Eromo Egbejule, the Guardian’s west <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa\">Africa</a> correspondent. This week, I spoke to Tems about her latest project: the Nigerian singer-songwriter and producer has been helping African women overcome many hurdles in the music industry.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>‘The future of African music is female and connected’</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>In February, the singer Tems won the second of her two Grammy awards for the single Love Me Jeje, a milestone that made her arguably the most successful Nigerian woman in music since Sade Adu.</p>\n<p>“Dear God, thank you so much for putting me on this stage,” Tems said, flanked by her mother and members of her team. It was yet another win for the rising talent since her breakthrough five years ago on the track Essence with fellow Nigerian superstar Wizkid.</p>\n<p>As a newcomer in Nigeria’s music industry, Tems, born Temilade Openiyi, faced many challenges. Unable to afford beats for her songs, only a handful of people believed in her vision in those early days.</p>\n<p>Today, the 30-year-old is a household name, collaborating with megastars such as Beyoncé and Drake. She has also performed at festivals and on stages that many of her peers still covet – the 2023 NBA All-Star Game half-time show, Coachella in 2024, and at this summer’s Fifa Club World Cup final.</p>\n<p>Succeeding as a musician in Africa remains a tough endeavour and only a few make it to stardom. On that slope to success are many barriers, including lack of funding and infrastructure, that are even further compounded for women who additionally face misogyny. “There are some people who I looked up to in the industry but, surprisingly, they also wanted sex,” the singer Yemi Alade said in <a href=\"https://dailypost.ng/2016/12/19/record-label-owners-promoters-guilty-sexual-harassment-yemi-alade/\">an interview in 2016</a>.</p>\n<p>The Beninese-French singer Angélique Kidjo has also spoken of <a href=\"https://theworld.org/stories/2015/06/10/its-hard-make-it-female-musician-especially-africa\">people discouraging her</a> from playing the drums, with one person insisting “drums are not made for women to play”.</p>\n<p>Tems told the Guardian: “When I first started gaining a platform, it was incredibly empowering to have women I admired, like Rihanna, Adele and Beyoncé, connect with my music. Their recognition validated my journey and, in some cases, led to opportunities to collaborate. Now, I want to give other women that same platform.”</p>\n<p>This is why, in early August, Tems assembled 20 of her countrywomen in the industry to help them forge their own paths to success.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Tackling imbalances</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Tems’s initiative isn’t the only one tackling these imbalances head-on. The Lagos-based nonprofit <a href=\"https://www.audiogirlfoundation.org/\">Audio Girl Africa</a>, which describes itself as a “pan-African sisterhood building the future”, holds workshops and mentors female artists, A&amp;Rs, marketers, and other music business professionals. In Nairobi, the <a href=\"https://santuri.org/Santuri-Electronic-Music-Academy-1\">Santuri Electronic Music Academy</a>, founded in 2021, has trained dozens of female producers and engineers.</p>\n<p>At the continental policy level, the <a href=\"https://au.int/en/pressreleases/20241220/empowering-africas-creatives-au-women-and-youth-financial-and-economic\">African Union’s Afri’Talent cohort</a>, launched in December in Ethiopia, supports women and youth in the arts, including music, as part of a drive to unlock $100bn for African creatives by 2030.</p>\n<p>Until now, no programme on this scale had been backed by an artist of Tems’s standing. The first edition of the singer’s <a href=\"https://www.leadingvibe.com/\">Leading Vibe Initiative (LVI)</a> was held in Lagos, Nigeria, this month to position African women as decision-makers and creators, not just performers or content add-ons.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-17\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>She and a roll call of stars were on the speaker roster, including the veteran rapper Sasha P, vocal coach Joyce Olong and producer-songwriter Bloody Civilian, who counts Black Panther: Wakanda Forever among her numerous production credits.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to spotlight the incredible women across the Nigerian music industry who have navigated their careers on their own terms … I wanted participants to hear from people with first-hand experience who could truly empathise with the struggles,” Tems<strong> </strong>told the Guardian.</p>\n<p>At LVI, there were workshops and masterclasses on long-term strategy and creative autonomy from industry-renowned A&amp;Rs and executives at the Africa divisions of Sony and Universal Music. Participants also got to use<i> </i>iZotope, audio software created for the programme, to boost their technical skills.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/aug/26/tems-women-sexism-african-music\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Maybe not – but body-shaming is definitely back, 19 August</a>). I keep hearing about the 1990s being a toxic period for women. But when exactly did that stop? When was this idyllic period in which body acceptance took place? Because I must have missed it. I would have welcomed a break from obsessing about my body, calorie counting, and from the feeling of being a total failure whenever I stopped running.</p>\n    <p>I was born in 1984, developed early, and was taught that the additional space I took up with my body was shameful. I remember the teacher calling me up to retrieve my test results as the classroom began a steady chant of “Mooooooo”.</p>\n    <p>At 41, I can’t remember a time when my weight was not connected to my worth. Whether it was family, friends, or perfect strangers, my body has always dictated how I was seen, if at all. Despite the celebrities who have promoted body positivity, only to lose weight and be celebrated later, it rarely trickles down. And I wonder if it is more for optics than reality.</p>\n    <p>I’ve recently gained about 15lb and started running again. Most days, I don’t feel as though I have a right to be on the path. I tie a jacket around my waist to hide my butt. On the bad days, I even go so far as to take a more isolated route. That extra weight means that there is something wrong with me and that it needs to be “fixed”. This has and always will be the reality for so many women. Let’s not pretend it ever went away.<strong>Lindsay Kirker</strong><i>Calgary, Canada</i></p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/24/lets-not-pretend-body-shaming-ever-went-away\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The high court’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/aug/22/noel-clarke-loses-libel-case-against-guardian-over-sexual-misconduct-investigation\">dismissal</a> of the actor Noel Clarke’s case against the Guardian is about more than one actor’s failed libel claim. Mrs Justice Steyn’s judgment is about power and complicity as well as the failure to protect vulnerable people. In her verdict, she agreed with the Guardian that there were “strong grounds to believe that [Clarke] is a serial abuser of women”.</p>\n    <p>The court heard testimony from <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Noel-Clarke-v-Guardian-News-and-Media-press-summary.pdf\">26 witnesses</a> before concluding that Clarke had engaged in harassment, bullying and abuse of power over many years. The judge accepted some of his evidence, but found him to be neither credible or reliable. The Guardian’s journalists, by contrast, were meticulous and gave Clarke reasonable opportunity to respond as well as fairly presenting his denials. Without women speaking up, Clarke would never have been exposed.</p>\n    <p>The judge rightly agreed that these were plainly matters of public interest. But in law it is not enough for an editor to say that a story is important. It must also demonstrate responsible journalism: it must have careful corroboration and fair presentation, and not be given to sensationalism. The editors and reporters produced a final article, the judge agreed, that was <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Noel-Clarke-v-Guardian-News-and-Media-22.08.25.pdf\">measured, accurate and balanced</a>. Crucially, their belief that this work was in the public interest was “reasonable”.</p>\n    <p>Beyond the law is a wider, all too familiar story. Clarke was not just another actor; he was being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/apr/30/how-bafta-spent-two-weeks-grappling-with-noel-clarke-dilemma\">honoured by the British film academy</a>, Bafta, for his “outstanding British contribution to cinema” even as serious allegations began to circulate. But the deeper indictment is of an industry that turned a blind eye. Clarke was rewarded and celebrated while women who spoke out risked their careers. The structures of power that enabled him – and the colleagues willing to look away – are the same factors that have ended up sheltering abusers across society.</p>\n    <p>This is the culture that allowed him to flourish. It is the culture that required #MeToo before voices were heard, and that now faces a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/mar/30/metoo-movement-backlash-womens-rights-young-men\">backlash</a> in which powerful men are recast as victims. In Britain, a star celebrated by his peers has been exposed as a serial abuser only after years of whispers were ignored. In her summing up, Mrs Justice Steyn punctured Clarke’s line of defence in a passage that was both subtle and resonant. These were, she reasoned, deliberate acts of abuse, later rationalised through minimisation and self-deception.</p>\n    <p>The lesson of this case is twofold. First, it is a victory for investigative journalism. When reporters act responsibly, the courts will uphold their right to publish. The Clarke case and allegations on shows such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/aug/14/second-bbc-masterchef-contestant-edited-out#:~:text=Banijay%2C%20the%20production%20company%20behind,it%20should%20not%20be%20aired.\">MasterChef</a> have sparked reforms, prompting a BBC culture review and the creation of an independent industry standards body. The second part of the lesson is that awards, plaudits and silence sustain harassers and abusers more effectively than any legal defence.</p>\n    <p>Clarke’s reputation lies in ruins, not because of gossip, but because of findings tested in court. For years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/aug/22/from-noel-clarke-to-gregg-wallace-why-is-the-uk-still-battling-a-toxic-tv-culture\">Britain’s TV industry</a> tolerated a toxic culture where the misconduct of powerful men was seen as unmentionable and staff were resigned to silence. The industry’s power imbalance – dominant executives and stars versus insecure freelancers, a situation worsened by shrinking production budgets – is widely blamed. The story here is not just about one man’s downfall. It is about a culture that looked away – until it could no longer deny the truth.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In the distance, Joshua trees saluted the golden hour’s infinity with their cheerful punk spikes and victorious fringed limbs, but all I could see was a faint rose tinge on the granite wall inches from my face.</p>\n<p>The rope connecting me to my climbing partner below dangled from my harness like a wet noodle. It would only go taut and hold me if I fell, but first, I’d fall a distance—much farther than I wanted to fall. When I looked down at my feet to find the next foothold, the wind blew my hair into my eyes and mouth.</p>\n<p>“Help me,” I whispered, or more like prayed.</p>\n<p>A voice spoke inside my head. Not God’s—mine.</p>\n<p><i>No one is coming to save you</i>, it said. <i>You got yourself into this, and you must get yourself out. There is no God. There is only gravity, dirt, rock, and sky</i>. The crack was within sight, but not within reach. The crack would make me safe. I could put my hands in the crack, and they would stay there. I could jam my toes in the crack and stand up on my feet. I could put a metal piece of protective gear in the crack, and make sure it was stuck there, and clip the rope knotted between my belly and groin to it.</p>\n<p>All that mattered was just holding on.</p>\n<p>Then, if I fell, I would not fall so far.</p>\n<p>But until I got there, all there was to hold on to was a slight vertical bump, like a doorjamb. It was like trying to hold yourself on a wall by pinching the edges of a piece of molding.</p>\n<p>I couldn’t hold on much longer. My rubber-shod toes were pressed on little nubs the size of chicken nuggets. (If I were a better climber, the bumps would be no wider than dimes.) Soon, my legs would start to shake and my fingers would start to slip.</p>\n<p>I could not stay where I was. I had to make a move.</p>\n<p>I looked longingly at the crack above. The voices of my mentors told me what to do.</p>\n<p>“Place your feet <i>with intention</i>,” said Glenn, with his Deadhead ponytail and Lennon glasses and sinews never obscured by sleeves.</p>\n<p>“Make a <i>plan </i>for your feet,” said Flora, in her kind and measured scientist voice.</p>\n<p>“Just hold on!” chuckled Fred, in his SoCal drawl, miming with his huge, strong fingers. “You’d be surprised how much your <i>body </i>wants to live.” Sometimes, when I climbed, I heard other voices—like my last real boyfriend’s, a pathological liar who had threatened to decapitate me—so I pulled on the rock with the strength of someone who could kill him first. Now, clinging on, things people had said to me no longer mattered.</p>\n<p>What was true and what was not no longer mattered. Love and trust did not matter, marriage and babies did not matter. All that mattered was just holding on.</p>\n<p>I didn’t need a ring or a house or even a van. I was closer to forty than thirty, but at this exact moment, I didn’t need to figure out how to finally achieve everything that had thus far eluded me, nor make peace with not having and maybe never getting anything my heart desired. This was the one place in the world where sorrow and shame couldn’t reach me. All I needed, and all I wanted, was to claw myself six feet higher and jam my hand in the crack.</p>\n<p><i>There</i>, was my only thought. <i>Now</i>.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>My mind was quiet while my brain calculated. Then it told my body: <i>Go</i>.</p>\n<p>I breathed in and reached up. I breathed out and placed my foot with intention. Each time my fingers grasped a new bump or dent or wrinkle or edge, I thought only: <i>Yes</i>.</p>\n<p>Then I arrived. It was just a broken place, with space inside its darkness.</p>\n<p>I never let any man see me cry, but I could let the rock see.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/holding-tight-when-to-fall-and-when-to-keep-climbing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>Beverly Gologorsky on Her Friendship with Fellow Writer Jane Lazarre and the Mentorship of a Writer’s Group</h3>\n<p>Phillip Roth once said that only a fool would sit in a room for thirty years doubting himself.</p>\n<p>Writers are indeed fools grateful for the gift of creativity despite the constant doubt. We commune mostly with the blank page, which is what I was doing thirteen years ago when my friend Jane Lazarre phoned to ask me to join a writer’s group she was forming. Jane, an author of memoirs, novels and poetry had also contacted two other writers who were on board. Was I interested? At the time I was working on a novel in progress and no one yet had read any of it. Was I ready to share? I wasn’t sure.</p>\n<p>Jane and I had been friends for eons. We met in 1978 when our children were entering kindergarten in the same elementary school. I’d started a full time job that required me to be at work before school began, and Jane offered to take both her son and my daughter to school, her generosity legion.</p>\n<p>It was also around the time her acclaimed memoir <i>The Mother Knot</i> was published, a sensitive, gorgeously written book that challenged the myths of motherhood and childbirth, and engendered many study groups, arriving as it did during the second wave of feminism. </p>\n<p>In the years that followed our friendship grew. We mentored each other as writers: read, edited and discussed each other’s work before it entered (or didn’t) the world. As women we nurtured each other with all that that entails.</p>\n<p>Her published work was fearless, honest, controversial, work that left readers thinking. Her poetry could be elegiac or salt of the earth, her fictional characters alive.</p>\n<p>A group would offer something more than she might achieve working alone.</p>\n<p>Jane, a white woman married to a Black man, was the mother of two Black sons. If one of her young sons were late getting home she’d worry aloud he could’ve been stopped by the police, unfortunately too possible.</p>\n<p>In her book <i>The Whiteness of White </i>(published by Duke), she discusses this fear with the insight and passion of mother-love and a deep understanding of racial history. Much of her work dealt with racism; she taught about it, wrote about it, led a creative writing program at the New School educating white people about racism. </p>\n<p>Given her past successes, why did she want a writer’s group and why then, I wondered?</p>\n<p>She was tired of listening only to herself is what she said. A group would offer something more than she might achieve working alone. She was confident that work in progress read by others could help us know if our words and the feelings we hope they portray are heard as intended. Is the piece evoking what the writer wants? Wasn’t she afraid negative commentary might interfere with work? She wasn’t, said slipping out of isolation for a few hours would be good, hearing other writer’s problems could be helpful.</p>\n<p>Maybe it was luck, but our small cluster of women quickly cemented.</p>\n<p>Jane was persuasive. Just try it, she said. I did.</p>\n<p>We were a small group of published women writers whose everyday lives differed. We met one evening a month to discuss our work. Sounds tame. But placing unfinished or untested writing in front of the eyes of other experienced and respected writers actually takes courage. It also takes trust to believe, never mind accept, another writer’s critique of one’s own work. We’re all such guardians of our words. However, the sincere, generous and intelligent opinions offered about each piece read bestowed confidence in their writers. Maybe it was luck, but our small cluster of women quickly cemented.</p>\n<p>We discussed one or two pieces an evening, giving each total attention. When it was my turn, I submitted work and listened closely to each comment. Jane asked if it was inertia, fragility or fear that guided my character’s decisions? An important question. I didn’t have an answer. It sent me back to figure one out, which changed the novel’s trajectory.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/how-writing-in-community-can-forge-friendships-and-evoke-change/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Josh brought the candles, I brought the book, and Deek brought the lamb. We’re still not sure where he found it.</p>\n<p>“Reckon it’ll work?” The beach wind was chilly, and Deek’s voice was muffled beneath his coat.</p>\n<p>“Duh,” I said, taking out the Necronomicon we’d found in the Halswell Community Library three weeks ago. But actually I had no idea ‘cos even though the demon goatfish stuff had gone really well, this one was at the end of the book and written in blood or maybe crappy red ink. Really, this was all Dad’s idea. “You boys should do something with your holidays instead of playing on the TV all the time,” he’d said. I brought this up the next time we hung out. “We boys should do something with our holidays instead of playing on the TV all the time,” I told them. This was mostly because they were playing Mortal Kombat III which I wasn’t really good at and I got bored watching them, but also because when I thought about the holidays ending I always felt kinda sad, so I thought it’d be cool to do a big one before we had to go back to school. Anyway they murmured Yeses from their bean bags so here we were, summoning an ancient sea god from the fathomless abyss.</p>\n<p>We arranged the stuff. I had to do the virgin blood since I was born in September, and then we draw a crappy pentagram on A3 paper and made the lamb stand in it. It grazed mournfully on seaweed as we started chanting. There were cool words like <i>omnia</i> and <i>noctis</i> like the opening bit from Final Fantasy VIII, but after a while we had to restart ‘cos we forgot to pull our hoodies down to look evil.</p>\n<p>We went on for half an hour. It got colder. The waters rose. The moon shone. The lamb tried to eat the tome. No ancient sea gods emerged.</p>\n<p>“Maybe it’s the candles,” I suggested.</p>\n<p>“Where the fuck does it say it can’t be lavender scented,” Josh said testily.</p>\n<p>“Come on, guys. This is lame. Let’s go home.” Deek paused. “Where’s the sheep?”</p>\n<p>We turned to look at the lamb, who was gone. We circled around calling out Lamb and Baa and other things until we saw a trail in the sand that led all the way to the edge of the sea. The bubbles frothed red.</p>\n<p>Then a wet femur flew out and bounced one two three times on the sand. In the distance a great wave was forming beneath the blood-red moon. We held our breaths in anticipation. Then we had to start breathing again because the wave was taking a while.</p>\n<p>Deek was wondering which one we’d get. I reckoned He Who Knows The Fate Of Stars would be cool but Josh wanted The Twilight Pharoah because he’d recently watched <i>The Mummy</i>. Then Deek said he wanted The Bloated Black Goat Of Endless Wailing which set us up for a killer your mum joke. Then the big wave loomed closer and we had to run up the beach, and when it receded it left a rugby-ball-sized thing squirming in the sand. We leaned closer and poked it with sticks. The thing was squidlike with several tentacles and a mouth of tiny fangs. Its skin was spotted slimy green, and it gazed at us dickishly with a single red eye.</p>\n<p>“Mrwro’gh’graba!” it said. We pondered.</p>\n<p>“Is that Latin?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“It’s French,” said Deek confidently. His family had gone to Europe last year. “Bonsuwahhhh.

Buddy wagged his tail until she unbuckled him from the sidecar. He bolted downhill toward the rock quarry.</p>\n<p>Janet groaned, praying he didn’t go into the quarry. If she entered, there were too many rocks to count, and she’d never leave. Never be safe again. She whistled through her teeth. Buddy barked but did not return. He must have discovered yet another helpless creature to save. She took the dumplings they’d bought and entered her old clinic, walking across the foyer and through the doorway into her home’s adjoined kitchen. She stowed the dumplings in the fridge, her mouth watering at their greasy scent.</p>\n<p>“So much for breakfast.”</p>\n<p>Not that she minded her dog’s single-minded insistence on healing the injured. It was an obsession they shared. She did wish it was a less painful preoccupation.</p>\n<p>Janet trudged after Buddy, wincing as her arthritic feet complained about the rough pavement. She passed the pines on her left without looking at them. That way, she didn’t feel the need to count the trees. They were every bit as dangerous as the quarry.</p>\n<p>“Buddy?” He barked but didn’t come. She found him at the forest’s edge, fifty meters from where the rock quarry gouged out the earth. The October breeze gave her a whiff of the pit’s sulfur stink. She coughed at the lingering taste and refused to look in the hole.</p>\n<p>Buddy had curled himself around two wounded fairies. He thumped his tail and whined at her, his wrinkled face worried.</p>\n<p>Janet had retired and closed her old veterinary clinic months ago, but her dog didn’t care. He wouldn’t leave the fairies until Janet healed them. She knelt. “What’s the problem this time, Buddy boy?”</p>\n<p>Blue blood covered the female’s long burgundy hair and smelled of copper. She had one wing torn off and Janet tensed against the uneven number.</p>\n<p>Buddy whined, nudging Janet’s hand. Though not a trained service dog, he always knew when she needed distraction.</p>\n<p>The female fairy stood up, her fists raised. She stood about as tall as a grapefruit and was equally intimidating. She spoke in a squeaky voice that Janet couldn’t hear.</p>\n<p>Cursing, Janet repositioned the hearing aids in her ears. They squealed until she adjusted them. Getting old sucked.</p>\n<p>Janet put her hand over her heart. “I offer you healing and hospitality.” Humans and fairies ignored one another, but Janet took healing seriously. It and Buddy were the only things that mattered. “Let me carry you back to my clinic, Tink.”</p>\n<p>Blue droplets spattered the grass when the fairy shook her head. “You may call me Tulip. I will be fine. The bleeding has stopped. Please, carry my king.”</p>\n<p>He had wavy black hair twinkling with hidden lights, a broken leg, and a haughty expression when he raised his palm. “No human shall touch our glorious self.”</p>\n<p>“That’s fine, your gloryship,” Janet crossed her arms. “You can set that compound fracture yourself.”</p>\n<p>He didn’t have wings, but Janet wished he could fly away.</p>\n<p>Tulip at last convinced him to be carried. She declined the same privilege but lay on Buddy’s back and rode him inside the clinic.</p>\n<p>Janet took a deep breath and avoided looking at Tulip’s wing. Instead, she placed the king on the cold exam table and clicked on the lights. She brushed her gray hair behind one ear and repeated the gesture on the other ear for the sake of symmetry.</p>\n<p>One king. Nothing she could do about one missing wing or one ruler, but together, they were an even number. Problem solved. Kind of.</p>\n<p>“This will hurt. I can give you a sedative.”</p>\n<p>He shook his head. Janet shrugged, disinfected the wounds with iodine, and pulled the bone segments into place. The king paled, but refused to look where the bones had jutted through the skin.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/05/27/podcastle-893-counting-fairies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 892: TALES FROM THE VAULTS – The Cambist and Lord Iron</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated PG</p>\n<h3>The Cambist and Lord Iron: A Fairy Tale of Economics</h3>\n<p>For as many years as anyone in the city could remember, Olaf Neddelsohn had been the cambist of the Magdalen Gate postal authority. Every morning, he could be seen making the trek from his rooms in the boarding house on State Street, down past the street vendors with their apples and cheese, and into the bowels of the underground railway, only to emerge at the station across the wide boulevard from Magdalen Gate. Some mornings he would pause at the tobacconist’s or the newsstand before entering the hallowed hall of the postal authority, but seven o’clock found him without fail at the ticker tape, checking for the most recent exchange rates. At half past, he was invariably updating the slate board with a bit of chalk. And with the last chime of eight o’clock, he would nod his respect to his small portrait of His Majesty, King Walther IV, pull open the shutters, and greet whatever traveler had need of him.</p>\n<p>From that moment until the lunch hour and again from one o’clock until six, Olaf lived and breathed the exchange of foreign currencies. Under his practiced hands, dollars became pounds sterling; rubles became marks; pesos, kroner; yen, francs. Whatever exotic combination was called for, Olaf arranged with a smile, a kind word, and a question about the countries which minted the currencies he passed under the barred window. Over years, he had built nations in his mind; continents. Every country that existed, he could name, along with its particular flavor of money, its great sights and monuments, its national cuisine.</p>\n<p>At the deep brass call of the closing gong, he pulled the shutters closed again. From six until seven o’clock, he reconciled the books, filled out his reports, wiped his slate board clean with a wet rag, made certain he had chalk for the next day, paid his respects to the portrait of the king, and then went back to his boarding room. Some nights he made beans on the hotplate in his room. Others, he would join the other boarders for Mrs. Wells’ somewhat dubious roasts. Afterward, he would take a short constitutional walk, read to himself from the men’s adventure books that were his great vice, and put out the light. On Saturdays, he would visit the zoo or the fourth-rate gentleman’s club that he could afford. On Sundays, he attended church.</p>\n<p>He had a reputation as a man of few needs, tepid passions, and great kindness. The romantic fire that the exotic coins and bills awakened in him was something he would have been hard pressed to share, even had he anyone with whom to share it.</p>\n<p>Which is to say there could not be a man in the whole of the city less like Lord Iron.</p>\n<p>Born Edmund Scarasso, Lord Iron had taken his father’s title and lands and ridden them first to war, then to power, and finally to a notorious fame. His family estate outside the city was reputed to rival the king’s, but Lord Iron spent little time there. He had a house in the city with two hundred rooms arranged around a central courtyard garden in which trees bore fruits unfamiliar to the city and flowers bloomed with exotic and troubling scents. His servants were numberless as ants; his personal fortune greater than some smaller nations. And never, it was said, had such wealth, power, and influence been squandered on such a debased soul.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/05/20/podcastle-892-tales-from-the-vaults-the-cambist-and-lord-iron/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 891: Trending Now! Help With Legal Fees for Reluctant Swordsman</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated PG-13</p>\n<h3>Trending Now! Help With Legal Fees for Reluctant Swordsman</h3>\n<p/><p>Hi, I’m Joshua Henzel. You might have heard of me from the New York Post article or all the YouTube videos. I’m the guy with the giant flaming sword who’s suing the NYPD. One thing the articles and videos got right is that I do have to stab myself in the heart to ignite the flame. But no, I don’t do it “for fun.” If the flame dies, so do I.</p>\n<p>I’m sick of all the lies and If I’m going to ask people for help, they should know the whole story, so I’m going to tell my side of everything. My lawyer told me I should only tell part of the story (sorry, Mr. Schmitz!), but my best friend Billy told me that lawyers are paranoid little poops and I trust Billy. (He didn’t say “poops” exactly, but I don’t like profanity, so I edited it, even though he says I’m way too young to be such an f-wording prig).</p>\n<p>I’ve never done a GoFundMe before, so I’m going to have Billy read it before I post it, but I don’t think he’s done one of these before either. If I screw anything up, tell me and I’ll try to fix it. Billy told me I should record a video for the GoFundMe, but I don’t really like my face or the sound of my voice much. (My face is narrow and pointy and my voice is high and squeaky.)</p>\n<p>So, when I meet new people, the first thing they talk about is all of the “debunking” videos and how there’s no way I can easily stab myself with a seven-foot-long, thirty-pound flaming sword. The first thing I tell them is that the newspaper lied; it’s only six foot two inches and ten pounds, but that’s still two inches taller than I am so I understand why they’re skeptical. The second thing I tell them is that it’s not that easy, there’s a lot of preparation involved.</p>\n<p>In my apartment, I have an iron stand that’s bolted to the wall in the kitchen that angles it just right. I don’t have many visitors so I usually just leave the sword in the stand. My kitchen is small so there isn’t a lot of room, but I can still get to the counter and all the appliances without singeing myself.</p>\n<p>It’s trickier when I go out. For a while I didn’t go out much, but then my uncle told me that staying inside all the time wasn’t good for me, so I started to take more walks. I usually only need to relight the flame every few hours, but it’s unpredictable. The shortest it ever lasted was fifteen minutes and the longest was a bit more than eight hours. And stabbing myself early before the flame starts to go out doesn’t seem to make it last any longer.</p>\n<p>If the sword is unsheathed, I can see the fire dying down and that gives me a little more warning. But if I can’t see the sword, it takes longer for me to notice. It starts with a . . . twinge isn’t the best word, but I don’t have a better one. Imagine that your heart is an old, worn guitar string and some cruel musician with a pick as sharp as a knife starts playing Misirlou on you at twice the normal speed. When my chest feels like that I know I have two minutes tops.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/05/13/podcastle-891-trending-now-help-with-legal-fees-for-reluctant-swordsman/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

You were quite the topic of conversation upstairs.</p>\n<p/><p>PALMER: Oh, I’ve heard that before. [laughter]</p>\n<p/><p>INTERVIEWER: Have you been afraid at all, talking so openly? That you might lose your audience, be fined, perhaps even arrested?</p>\n<p/><p>PALMER: Talk about what, John? [laughter] But do you see what I mean? I’m sitting here right before you and you’re avoiding saying what I am. We’ve got a bill sitting in Parliament, we have people demanding change, and yet we still can’t — or won’t — talk about what I am. Now you asked me about the war as part of my show. What kind of man would I be, that I could natter on about death and devastation, but fear saying what I am? What kind of society are we creating, where it’s acceptable to joke about genocide, but not to acknowledge the affection between two consenting adults? [applause]</p>\n<p/><p>INTERVIEWER: A very strong opinion, well put. Perhaps some of our politicians should take a few years off.</p>\n<p/><p>PALMER: You’d be surprised, the things you learn about yourself.</p>\n<p/><p/><p>The little pub was tucked away in a cul-de-sac, just past the train station: the end of the line, and as such it was hardly ever crowded, and those who drank there kept their eyes on their pints. Anne had come across it when running a small circle nearby. It seemed a good place to meet, and better for the day proving rainy. When Mr. Palmer entered, placing his umbrella in the rack and brushing water off his trenchcoat, not a single one of the half-dozen people looked up.</p>\n<p>He ordered a pint and made his way to Anne’s table, a wary expression on his face. She was already nursing her own pint, still trying to figure out how best to ask her questions. That he took the time to take off his coat and fold it neatly, to sit down and adjust his chair just so, made her wonder if he was also weighing out his words.</p>\n<p>“Miss Wood,” he began. “If it cannot be done, you could have just said so on the telephone. We knew it was unlikely —”</p>\n<p>She held up a hand, quieting him. He took a sip of his beer as she began speaking in turn, taking equal care with her words. “It is not impossible, Mr. Palmer. But it is a very risky undertaking. There is every chance that one or both of you could be lost in the process. You would both be dead, truly dead.”</p>\n<p>“We’ve discussed that possibility,” Mr. Palmer said firmly.</p>\n<p>“There is also the chance that one of you could be lost, and the body as well, leaving the other spirit alone but still anchored to this plane,” she pressed.</p>\n<p>“And we have discussed that as well; we were going to ask that, if it comes to pass, you would do what you can to help the remaining spirit move on.” He continued when she started to speak, “we have weighed all the risks, Miss Wood. I appreciate your concern, but we have been debating this for over two years now —”</p>\n<p>“It’s a chancey thing to have a spirit bound to an object,” Anne cut in. “If that photograph was somehow destroyed, you would lose Harry — yet it’s not clear to me where exactly he would end up. He might move on, or he might simply drift through the world, unable to materialize.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/05/06/podcastle-890-the-obrien-and-palmer-show-part-two-of-two/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Please welcome Timothy Palmer. [applause]</p>\n<p/><p>PALMER: Thank you. Thank you very much. It’s great to be here, John.</p>\n<p/><p>INTERVIEWER: Before we get started, I must tell you that we polled tonight’s audience before you arrived. Over the years you’ve done some remarkable cameos in films and television, and we asked the audience what was the line they most wanted to hear you say. The winning line was from ‘The Ladies of St. Agnes.’ [laughter and applause]</p>\n<p/><p>PALMER: My God, I’m funny and I haven’t even said anything. [laughter] It’s every comedian’s dream. [He starts to stand up] Well, I’m off, you can put my fee in the mail. [laughter]</p>\n<p/><p>INTERVIEWER, handing PALMER a slip of paper: This is the line in question. [to audience] Ladies and gentlemen. Timothy Palmer, from his memorable cameo in ‘The Ladies of St. Agnes.’</p>\n<p/><p>PALMER, looking directly at the camera: They never taught us this in Sunday school! [laughter and applause]</p>\n<p/><p/><p>The advertisement had read:</p>\n<p/><p><i>WANTED</i></p>\n<p><i>Medium for private séance. Familiarity with occult history and practice required. Serious inquiries only.</i></p>\n<p/><p>Anne hadn’t needed the job; she certainly hadn’t wanted the job. Private séances usually started creepy and ended worse. There were plenty of small circles a person could join, that would come to your house if necessary. Private was the last resort for those who were too emotional or demanding, or it was a lure put out by men with very particular fetishes. The last time Anne had done a private séance she had been trapped for hours in a stuffy, pitch-dark living room while the client verbally abused his dead wife. Anne had desperately wanted to sever the link, but she had been terrified the man would turn his rage on her. When she had finally been released she felt physically and emotionally beaten. It had taken her weeks to recover.</p>\n<p>Yet the advertisement would not let her be. When she knocked the newspaper off the table it fell open to that page; when she went to run her errands the grocer was reading that selfsame page, the butcher wrapped her Sunday meat in the page, and she found herself staring at the ad as she ate a cone of chips for lunch. When she finally boarded the bus for home and found a newspaper in her favorite upper-level seat, neatly folded to show the exact quadrant with the ad in it, she threw up her hands and admitted defeat.</p>\n<p>The man’s voice on the phone was pleasant at least, and oddly familiar; the address he gave was a posh neighborhood, the kind of neighborhood that would probably call the police if a woman screamed, if for no other reason than to restore its tranquility. And the fee he suggested was more than generous, so perhaps for once the spirits were doing Anne a favor. That favors usually came with caveats she didn’t let herself dwell on.</p>\n<p/><p/><p>The advertisement may have chosen her; still Anne prepared for the worst. She wore her best wool suit and her red felt cloche subtly embroidered with symbols of protection, which she believed made her look professional with just a touch of the bohemian. Others wore turbans and muumuus and silver-painted amulets, selling theatrics first and foremost. She had found the money better, if more intermittent, by presenting herself as a kind of spiritual consultant. Certainly it reduced the groping, and if all else failed she had brass knuckles in her purse that she had bought after that last, disastrous séance.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/04/29/podcastle-889-the-obrien-and-palmer-show-part-one-of-two/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Doctors may have discovered the secret to mending a broken heart in a world-first clinical trial.</p>\n    <p>Hundreds of thousands of people worldwide are living with takotsubo cardiomyopathy, known as broken heart syndrome, which causes the heart muscle to change shape and suddenly weaken. It is usually triggered by severe emotional or physical stress, such as losing a loved one.</p>\n    <p>Patients may experience symptoms similar to a heart attack and face twice the risk of dying early compared with the general population. Some experience heart failure, resulting in debilitating symptoms such as fatigue, as well as a shorter life expectancy. There is no cure.</p>\n    <p>But now, doctors may have the answer. The world’s first randomised controlled trial for broken heart syndrome has found that 12 weeks of tailored cognitive behavioural therapy, or a heart recovery exercise programme involving swimming, cycling and aerobics, helped patients’ hearts recover.</p>\n    <p>Details of the breakthrough were revealed at the European Society of Cardiology annual congress in Madrid, the world’s largest heart conference.</p>\n    <p>Dr David Gamble, a clinical lecturer in cardiology at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/universityofaberdeen\">University of Aberdeen</a>, who presented the research, said: “In takotsubo syndrome, there are serious effects on the heart, which may not return to normal. We know that patients can be affected for the rest of their lives and that their long-term heart health is similar to people who have survived a heart attack.”</p>\n    <p>The trial data highlighted the importance of “the brain-heart axis”, Gamble said.</p>\n    <p>“It shows that cognitive behavioural therapy or exercise could help patients along the road to recovery. Both are very cost-effective interventions, and we hope that further studies could lead to them being used to help this underserved group.”</p>\n    <p>The study involved 76 patients with takotsubo syndrome, 91% of whom were women and the average age was 66. Patients were randomly assigned to receive CBT, the exercise programme, or standard care. All received all other care and treatment recommended by their cardiologist.</p>\n    <p>The CBT group had 12 one-to-one weekly sessions, adapted specifically to their condition by the researchers, as well as daily support if needed.</p>\n    <p>The exercise group went through a 12-week exercise course, which included cycling machines, treadmills, aerobics and swimming, gradually increasing in number of sessions and intensity each week.</p>\n    <p>Researchers used a sophisticated imaging technique called 31Pmagnetic resonance spectroscopy, which allowed them to study how patients’ hearts were producing, storing and using energy. In the CBT and exercise groups, there was a significant increase in the amount of fuel available to patients’ hearts to allow them to pump, which was not seen in people who had usual care.</p>\n    <p>The average distance that patients that had CBT could walk in six minutes increased from 402 metres to 458 metres. People who completed the exercise programme were able to walk an average of 528 metres in six minutes, compared with 457 metres at the start.</p>\n    <p>There was also an increase in patients’ VO2 max – their body’s maximum oxygen consumption at peak exercise – of 15% in the CBT group and 18% in the exercise group. Increases in walking distance and VO2 max are signs of improvement in health.</p>\n    <p>The findings suggest the treatments could produce long-term benefits such as reducing symptoms and the risk of dying for those with broken heart syndrome, experts said.</p>\n    <p>Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, a clinical director at the British Heart Foundation, which funded the trial, said: “Takotsubo syndrome can be a devastating condition that can affect you at a really vulnerable time if triggered by a major life event.</p>\n    <p>“People may not be as surprised that an exercise programme helped heart patients, but it is intriguing that this study also showed that cognitive behavioural therapy improved heart function and patients’ fitness. More research is needed to find out whether these approaches improve survival or symptoms over the long term.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/30/exercise-therapy-mend-broken-heart-syndrome-takotsubo-study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The study adds to a long list of reproductive harms associated with Pfas exposure.</p>\n    <p>“Prior studies have identified that Pfas were associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, but the potential influence of Pfas’s exposure on [recurrent miscarriages] remained uncertain,” the study’s authors, with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, wrote. “Our investigation identified significant associations between [some Pfas] and increased risks of unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortions.”</p>\n    <p>Pfas are a class of about 16,000 chemicals typically used to make products that resist water, stains and heat. They are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down and accumulate in humans and the environment. The chemicals are linked to cancer, kidney disease, liver problems, immune disorders, and other serious health problems.</p>\n    <p>Some Pfas compounds are linked to developmental issues like birth defects and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/forever-chemicals-pfas-low-birth-weight-obesity-research\">low birth weight</a>. In men, the chemicals are thought to lower sperm quality and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/22/toxic-pfas-chemicals-testes\">cause DNA changes</a> that can impact the offsprings’ health later in life.</p>\n    <p>About 5% of women experience recurrent miscarriages and half of those have no explanation, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.</p>\n    <p>Among the chemicals that showed the strongest association were PFHxS, which is a common Pfas water pollutant. Several of the compounds for which researchers found associations were “short chain” Pfas, meaning smaller chemicals that industry has said are generally safer and less toxic than older and larger Pfas.</p>\n    <p>However, there is little independent research on many short chains, but what does exist points to high toxicity, and the new research adds to increasing concerns over their safety.</p>\n    <p>The biological mechanism by which Pfas may cause miscarriages is unclear, the authors wrote, but they theorized that it had to do with the disruption of normal thyroid hormone metabolism, and other hormonal impacts.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Baby food manufacturers have been given 18 months to improve the quality of their products in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/england\">England</a>, amid mounting concerns that leading brands are nutritionally poor.</p>\n    <p>The new <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/commercial-baby-food-and-drink-voluntary-industry-guidelines\">voluntary guidance</a> from the government calls for a reduction in sugar and salt levels in food for infants and toddlers.</p>\n    <p>It also requests clearer labelling of products to address misleading marketing claims that make baby foods seem healthier than they are.</p>\n    <p>This will cover products with labels such as “contains no nasties”, which are high in sugar. Others are labelled as snacks for babies, which goes against government recommendations that children aged six to 12 months do not need snacks between meals, only milk.</p>\n    <p>It comes after researchers found that leading brands, such as Ella’s Kitchen and Heinz, were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/28/leading-baby-food-brands-making-high-sugar-meals-study-finds\">making sugar-heavy, nutritionally poor baby food</a> that failed to meet the needs of infants.</p>\n    <p>A report by the University of Leeds school of food science and nutrition, <a href=\"https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/faculty/doc/commercial-baby-foods-crisis-addressing-health-marketing-inequalities-uk\">published in April</a>, found that some brands also carried misleading marketing claims, and urged the government to impose the same traffic light system found on chocolate bars and ice-cream.</p>\n    <p>The report’s authors said the new voluntary guidelines were disappointing and would have limited impact. Dr Diane Threapleton, the lead author of the Leeds study, said: “They’re quite narrow in scope, only looking at sugar and salt. But salt is not a major concern in UK baby food.”</p>\n    <p>She raised particular concern that the voluntary guidelines did not address the poor nutritional value of many purees and pouches, which were targeted at weaning babies. The NHS <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/start-for-life/baby/weaning/what-to-feed-your-baby/from-around-6-months/\">advises parents to start weaning when a child is about six months old</a>, with vegetables that are not sweet, such as broccoli, cauliflower and spinach.</p>\n    <p>“These products are often too watery. Children need really energy-dense food, rich nutrient-dense food with lots of different fibres and different sources of iron and zinc,” she said. “But these purees, particularly those targeted as first weaning foods, are really low in energy. They are bad substitutions, especially if you’re displacing a nutritious milk feed.”</p>\n    <p>High levels of sugar in children’s diets is a significant factor contributing to high rates of childhood obesity in the UK, which is among the highest in western Europe. At the start of primary school, <a href=\"https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/national-child-measurement-programme/2023-24-school-year\">more than 22% of children in England are obese or overweight</a>, according to the latest official statistics.</p>\n    <p>The public health minister, Ashley Dalton, said the guidelines would help parents who were often <strong>“</strong>bombarded with confusing labels, disguising unhealthy foods packed with hidden sugars and salt”.</p>\n    <p>Prof Simon Kenny, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\">NHS</a> England’s national clinical director for children and young people, said: “These new guidelines alongside clearer labelling will help empower busy parents to make nutritious choices that give their children the best possible start in life.”</p>\n    <p>Last year a House of Lords report found commercial infant foods “are routinely high in sugar and marketed misleadingly”. It called on the government to introduce <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld5901/ldselect/ldmfdo/19/1910.htm#_idTextAnchor110\">mandatory legal standards for commercial infant foods</a>, without input from manufacturers.</p>\n    <p>A Department of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/health\">Health</a> and Social Care spokesperson said it expected manufacturers to meet the labelling guidelines within 18 months, adding: “If businesses fail to act, we will consider tougher measures.”</p>\n    <p>Another study found legislation in England to restrict supermarket sales of foods high in fat, sugar or salt had led to millions fewer products being bought.</p>\n    <p>Researchers at the University of Leeds estimated that 2m fewer such products were sold per day after the law took effect in 2022. The number of items high in fat, sugar or salt sold in Tesco, Morrisons, Sainsbury’s and Asda dropped from 20 out of every 100 before the legislation to 19 out of every 100 afterwards.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/22/baby-food-firms-18-months-improve-quality-products-england\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Meanwhile the climate crisis, extractive industries and criminal gangs have reduced safe territories, destroyed livelihoods and created food insecurity.</p>\n<p>It is increasingly women who are proving fundamental to fighting back, the stalwarts of their communities. A <a href=\"https://fimi-iiwf.org/en/biblioteca-propias/updated-global-report-fimis-road-to-beijing30/\">report published this year</a> to mark the 25th anniversary of the International Indigenous Women’s Forum (Fimi) cites the many ways women are the key protectors of cultures and land.</p>\n<p>“Looking ahead to November’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/29/climate-is-our-biggest-war-warns-ceo-of-cop30-ahead-of-un-summit-in-brazil\">Cop30 in the Amazon</a>, the call is clear: the world must stop seeing Indigenous women as victims and recognise us as the strategic actors we are,” says Teresa Zapeta, executive director of Fimi.</p>\n<p>We spoke to five women leaders about their work and inspiration.</p>\n<h2>Florence Jaukae Kamel, Papua New Guinea</h2>\n<p>Florence Jaukae Kamel , in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/papua-new-guinea\">Papua New Guinea</a> (PNG), was 17 when she had the first of her five children. They were young teenagers in 2009 when she left their father after he broke her tooth with a punch that left her blood splattered in the dirt.</p>\n<p>When she told her brothers what had happened, they insisted she return.</p>\n<p>Kamel refused, renting a small hut in her village of Iufi-ufa with eight Papua New Guinean kina, (£1.40) to her name. “I was jobless,” she says, “I was living in the village by doing gardening, and I had experienced all this abuse.”</p>\n<p>Already known for pushing frontiers in fashion and politics – in 2002 Kamel was the first woman voted into local government in Goroka province, where she raised eyebrows with her unique dresses, woven in fabric previously reserved for <i>bilum</i><i> – </i>a cloth bag used to carry everything from food to babies. “People said: ‘What is Florence doing?’ Some thought it was against our custom. But when people talked they motivated me to do more – I wore them every day, I had a whole wardrobe.”</p>\n<p>In 2002, she set up a women’s collective weaving bilum. By 2006, she was dressing the PNG Commonwealth Games team, and has since exhibited in fashion shows and art galleries.</p>\n<p>Weaving is more than an income, “It’s a bond, it’s a heartbeat,” Kamel says. “We share stories. We create laughter, joy, the peace that women need.”</p>\n<p>She established an annual <a href=\"https://www.ncc.gov.pg/goroka-bilum-festival-gaining-momentum/\">bilum festival</a>, which has grown to a network of 3,000 women sharing stories and techniques, alongside training in marketing, money management and climate adaptation.</p>\n<p>The network includes a safe house for women suffering domestic violence, with plans to build another.</p>\n<p>“Most of the women here are unemployed and the skill they have is weaving. We are helping them to keep telling the stories that originate in their communities, and the training helps them understand what the markets are like overseas,” says Kamel, 53.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got women who have bought sewing machines; women who have bought land. It has had a huge impact.”</p>\n<p>They visit the elderly to collect oral histories, and run programmes for girls – many of whom are now in school because their mothers can pay school fees. “It makes me happy, seeing women having their own earnings and making decisions,” Kamel says.<strong>Michelle Duff</strong></p>\n<h2>Roeurn Heng, Cambodia</h2>\n<p>In 2019, Roeurn Heng saw on Facebook that part of Phnom Radang – a mountain sacred to her community – had been sold to investors.</p>\n<p>Living in Mondulkiri province, near Cambodia’s border with Vietnam, the elephant tour guide and farmer had watched more and more land being <a href=\"https://www.khmertimeskh.com/50745457/the-great-outdoors-plans-to-set-up-40-eco-tourism-projects-in-mondulkiri/#google_vignette\">developed for </a><a href=\"https://www.khmertimeskh.com/50745457/the-great-outdoors-plans-to-set-up-40-eco-tourism-projects-in-mondulkiri/\">tourism</a>. “If the mountain disappears, it is like losing the identity of the entire Indigenous people,” she says.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/sep/01/indigenous-women-protecting-land-culture-communities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I made a visit to Verdun, France in 2013 because I wanted to walk the fields of World War I’s longest and bloodiest battle. I’d heard craters made by the millions of artillery shells fired during the fighting could still be seen in every corner of the sprawling terrain. I was in town a little more than two hours on a stop from Luxembourg to Paris, just enough time for a bus tour ride and a walk around the necropolis.</p>\n<p>A lifelong fan of military history, I found I knew very little about the first world war. Deep trenches and barbed wire, steel helmeted dough boys charging across No Man’s Land all came to mind but Verdun turned out to be something entirely different. Bombs of all kinds fired during the battle still rise from the earth there.</p>\n<p>My tour guide told us things I’d never heard at any other battlefield. If we venture into the wooded areas, we shouldn’t stray off the paths, he said, we had to be careful where we stepped. Our safety could not be guaranteed. The old munitions, they were still out there and some of them were still alive. I noticed a sign during one of the brief bus tour stops. Red and weather faded, it read:</p>\n<p><i>ATTENTION – DANGER</i></p>\n<p><i>VISITEURS, CES RUINES SONT DANGEREUSES !\n</i></p>\n<p><i>Visitors, these ruins are dangerous.</i></p>\n<p><i>RESTEZ SUR LES SENTIERS BALISÉS\n</i></p>\n<p><i>Do not proceed out of the marked lanes</i></p>\n<p><i>ET SURVEILLEZ LES ENFANTS.\n</i></p>\n<p><i>And watch over children.</i></p>\n<p><i>N’OUBLIEZ PAS QUE LES ENGINS DE GUERRE</i></p>\n<p><i>PEUVENT ENCORE TUER.</i></p>\n<p><i>Do not forget that old war implements can still kill.</i></p>\n<p>When I asked my guide if these signs were to be taken seriously, he nodded gravely and told me, <i>Absolutely, with the utmost diligence.</i> Farmers plowed up lead and iron shrapnel and even whole hand grenades by the pallet every harvest season. The government has an entire department of technicians called <i>démineurs</i> (literally de-miners) dedicated to disarming and disposing old war implements and they still couldn’t keep up with what was left behind.</p>\n<p>So, it seemed, the war wasn’t really over. There I was, standing on a live battlefield. What a strange phenomenon. <i>Do not forget that old war implements can still kill.</i> The sentence’s restrained temperament with its eerie bureaucratic authority, quiet yet menacing.</p>\n<p>I left town shortly after but Verdun remained fixed in my mind. I read all I could. I quickly came to find that the Battle of Verdun was more of an artillery duel than a conventional infantry battle. Sure, there were attacks and counterattacks and waves of soldiers traversing across No Man’s Land. Three quarters of the entire French Army spent time in Verdun.</p>\n<p>But what everyone writes about is the artillery. Both sides fired tens of millions of shells nonstop over ten months. Some you could hold in your hand. Others were so large you could vanish behind one. They fired so many they lost count. No one knows the exact total.</p>\n<p>The hills surrounding Verdun were literally reduced in height from the ferocity of the artillery barrages leveled against their slopes. They blasted and scorched topsoil until it disappeared. The explosions disinterred hastily buried bodies while burying other men alive. It destroyed trenches and supply lines leaving men cowering in cratered ditches, dying of thirst, licking rainwater from the brims of their helmets.</p>\n<p>Entire villages vanished overnight. Thousands of residents fled their homes under falling snow and shell fire. Many never returned. Those who did found their homes unrecognizable. Fleury, once a village of 500, changed hands sixteen times. It was reduced to a white smear that could only be identified from the air.</p>\n<p>Even years after the war ended, nothing would grow. Other sites of fierce fighting such as The Somme and Flanders quickly returned to their former selves. Verdun remained a scabbed moonscape, which some observed as a mark from God as the supreme example of “man’s inhumanity to man.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/the-wwi-battle-that-never-ended-finding-unexploded-mines-in-verduns-fields/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>On the Late Italian Writer’s Masterpiece, “In Farthest Seas”</h3>\n<p>“It’s nice to have confirmation, in the midst of a literary world where everyone loses their minds or in some way grows stupid, that you are a serious person, forging ahead with your story, your line.”</p>\n<p>In 1964, the Italian writer Lalla Romano received this compliment from one of her most steadfast admirers, and one of her editors at the publishing house Einaudi, Italo Calvino. Although Romano would continue to produce novels for several more decades, Calvino had already intuited that her books were, one by one, tracing a meticulously rendered personal story, or—depending on one’s interpretation of the Italian word <i>storia</i>—a personal “history.” </p>\n<p>Romano, in fact, rarely strayed from her own experiences, relationships and memories for the subjects of her writing. As a result, her books come together to form one of the fullest and most intimate expressions of a life in 20th-century art.</p>\n<p>While this journey through memory in many ways culminated in 1987 with her masterpiece <i>In Farthest Seas</i>, Romano’s artistic “line” was always a striking and even unorthodox one. Before finally becoming a novelist in post-war Milan, Romano had a promising early career as a painter in Turin, where she also published her first collection of poetry in 1941. Her first book-length work of prose would follow ten years later, a collection of dreams titled<i> Le metamorfosi </i>(<i>The Metamorphoses</i>).</p>\n<p>Although Romano rightly considered her depictions of dreams to be realistic, the book itself, with its uncanny, fragmented narratives, could not have been more distinct from the neorealist literature that was in vogue at the time. In fact, the book’s originality was immediately appreciated at Einaudi by Natalia Ginzburg and Cesare Pavese, with Ginzburg describing Romano’s dreams as “beautiful, fecund, vivifying.”</p>\n<p>But, for Romano, exploring such meaningful relationships and turning them into art was a necessity.</p>\n<p>As she had often done in painting through portraiture and landscapes, Romano turned increasingly in writing to the people and places around her—to the periods and spaces that had touched her the most, through love, strife and, at times, tragedy. Along with books on her childhood in the Alpine village of Demonte, near Cuneo, or on her years as a university student in Turin, much of Romano’s most important work explored disarmingly personal moments of her life as a wife, mother, and even grandmother, perspectives that were still relatively rare in Italian literature. And yet Romano approached these topics with both poetic rigor and emotional honesty, knowing that they were as worthy subjects for literary works as any.</p>\n<p/>\n    <p>In the case of her 1969 book <i>Le parole tra noi leggere</i> (<i>Light Words Between Us</i>), Romano’s sincerity about her uneasiness and even reluctance towards motherhood was shocking for the time, while the sheer number of details and documents she shares concerning her own son, Piero, and their difficult relationship could surprise readers to this day. Romano later said that Piero had read and been amused by the book, but when it won Italy’s most important literary award, the Strega Prize, its heightened success turned his prominence as a character into something far too burdensome, causing their already strained relationship to deteriorate further. </p>\n<p>But, for Romano, exploring such meaningful relationships and turning them into art was a necessity, as she would say in an interview: “Writing is my way of being.” Like her other books comprising private connections and recollections, Romano preferred to call <i>Le parole</i> a novel rather than a memoir or autobiography, seeing the distinction between fact and fiction as an irrelevant one for literature. As she would state in reference to her later book <i>In Farthest Seas</i>: “I do not fear <i>lived experience</i>. Art is abstraction.” Or as she wrote elsewhere, emphasizing the very impossibility of composing a “factual” memoir: “for me memory coincides with invention.”</p>\n<p>It is astonishing that such a powerful and acclaimed book on the topic of a spouse’s passing came so many years before the genre of the literary “grief memoir” became popularized.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/lalla-romano-was-writing-autofiction-before-it-existed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

When asked, as writers often are (at parties, in emails, to fill space), what I was working on, I answered, <i>Nothing. </i>This wasn’t true, but I felt it was. My project was to stay alive. Which required more effort than I could admit.</p>\n<p>The despair began when I finished my first book. Or, rather, it resumed. The book had been something I could throw myself into entire. Writing was an interruption in suffering, a transformation of it; writing about my life gave me an escape from my life. <i>Entering the poem as a method of leaving the room.¹</i></p>\n<p>I was living in Wisconsin, a miserable place to live when you are prone to misery. In Wisconsin it is winter all the time. Even when the glassy lakes thaw back into water, there’s this coldness that lingers. It seeps inside. In deep. I think of that time, and a shiver runs through.</p>\n<p>I had been brought to Wisconsin to write poems. When the first book closed itself—like a door, final, against me—I thought, <i>Okay, I will write the next book. </i>Then The Subjects rushed in. And I thought, <i>No, not that book.</i></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p><i>I don’t want to write the true book; it’s the one I want to write: I tear it from myself.²</i></p>\n<p>I did not want to write that book, so I stopped writing. But the writing did not stop. It had its own mind, one inside mine.</p>\n<p>I did not want to write about The Subjects. I wanted to write about pleasant things, like dogs. If I wrote poems about dogs, then it would be proof I was happy and well-adjusted. But there are certain subjects that, once they’re yours, force themselves to the front of the queue. And I did not have a dog. I have a cat, Sylvia, named after exactly whom you think.</p>\n<p>I said I’d stopped writing—to you now, and to anyone who asked in those days. What I meant was I’d stopped writing the way I knew how to write, what I recognized as writing, the way I had always written. Before it had been simple, if not easy: I sat at my desk and unstoppered my mind and waited until everything I had to say emptied onto the page, and then the writing was done. It felt good to do it. But this was different—I didn’t want to say anything about The Subjects, anything at all. And yet, I had to write poems; poetry paid my rent.</p>\n<p>I tried many ways to outrun what there was to say, to shove it down, to go around. But poems are cleverer than the people who write them. And your Subjects—like light, like water, in your hands—ultimately find an opening and slip through.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p><i>Night Poems</i></p>\n<p>What you won’t say takes up space. Creates a block. I wanted to say something else, anything else, but the unsaid becomes a stone in the throat.</p>\n<p>I believed I could only be a good person (worthy of love and my place on this earth) if I was a good poet, and I believed the way to be a good poet was to write a poem every day. My self-loathing was ouroboric—I felt terrible, so I could not write, and because I did not write, I felt terrible. Obediently I returned to my desk every morning and, all day, obediently I sat in my silence—like a child forced to sit in the mess she’s made, as punishment. <i>I felt very bad. </i>Then night.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/on-not-writing-and-letting-wildness-be-your-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She currently works for El País and, along with writer Guillermo Alonso, co-directs the podcast Arsénico Caviar, which won the Ondas prize for best conversational podcast.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>For a brief moment back in 2016, the internet’s obsession was the physical and mental well-being of an English YouTuber named Marina Joyce. Joyce was girlish and princesslike, with long blond ringlets and huge blue eyes, who uploaded innocent videos where she tried on pastel-colored clothes, opened gifts sent to her by different brands, or ate sweets she thought were exotic because they came from Asia. And because the internet’s blurring of boundaries often means you can’t discern whether you are viewing erotic content or family content (or, perhaps, both at the same time), a widely disparate community followed her—from little girls who wanted to wear the same pink dresses to bald men in their fifties who probably masturbated to videos of her eating ice cream.</p>\n<p>But after a while, her followers began detecting subtle changes in her behavior. In one of her videos, Marina Joyce was at a party, smiling at the camera and showing off her outfit, but something in the way she walked around (languid and listless) or the way she responded to questions (taking about three seconds too long to grasp them) set off all the alarms. This gave rise to a conspiracy theory, according to which Joyce had been kidnapped by her boyfriend or by a cult (it was unclear which) and was being abused and forced to upload videos against her will.</p>\n<p>The evidence shown by these internet detectives consisted of short video clips where, if you paid attention, you could hear a subtle and whispered “help me” that, apparently, she would have added in the editing. There were also videos of Joyce seemingly looking at the back of the room, somewhere behind her camera, in order to get the approval of her captor while she answered questions from her followers. Fans also showed screenshots where her limbs appeared to have bruises, scratches, or small wounds. This was irrefutable evidence. Marina Joyce continued to act friendly and cheerful, but behind the smiles, she often looked sleepy, dazed, or drugged. Some screenshots, which ended up on forums or posted to Twitter accounts dedicated exclusively to the exciting case, showed subliminal messages she was supposedly using to draw people’s attention. These messages were hidden among the beautiful white lacquered shelves covered in brand gifts that were always in the background of her videos. Her followers, and those who had followed the trending hashtag #SaveMarinaJoyce, ended up calling the Metropolitan Police to rescue her. The Met went to her house but found nothing suspicious and left.</p>\n<p>I’m thinking about Marina Joyce in the cold meeting room I’ve reserved for a call with the accounts team to talk about the Christmas campaign. I’m also thinking that, if the police were alerted by a loved one and arrived here right now, they wouldn’t find anything suspicious either—just a woman in an office, like Marina was just a woman in a room. Only my true fans would notice unsettling changes in my behavior meeting after meeting, day after day, video after video. They would discuss it online in forums and post long explanatory threads on Twitter. Perhaps I’d even be a trending topic for a few hours. The same woman who used to have fun behind her camera now seems sleepy, dazed, and even drugged.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/discontent/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

They ran back and forth all night, feasting on spiders and midges and the slower moths, but they were sticky-footed and rarely lost their grip. This one scampered away while she smacked herself in the face, much harder than she’d intended, so that she saw stars and bit her tongue, all at one.</p>\n<p>Dawn, seeping gray, outlined the window, showing the shutter slats as faint lines of light. She nursed her tongue, which felt awkward and painful in her mouth, and swallowed blood as she swung herself up and out of bed, abandoning thought of sleep. Once she’d had a soldier’s knack of being able to sleep anywhere, anytime, but nowadays that skill was long gone and she was lucky to pluck a few uneasy hours from a night.</p>\n<p>Cold stone struck her feet as she stood, and she fished around under the bed for the knitted socks that served her as slippers, disreputable and threadbare but warmer than being barefoot. The narrow chamber had only the single window; she moved to it and swung the shutters open, then leaned out on the wide stone sill.</p>\n<p>From this vantage point, you could see the hospital’s main courtyard, empty now except for the caged roses set among gravel and a single servant using a rake to set that gravel into long, undulating lines running from north to south. By midday the gravel would be covered by footprints and the porch underneath her window, the only spot where the hamper-addicts could smoke the licorice-scented weed, would be surrounded by crumpled butts. For now, though, everything was silent and still.</p>\n<p>Pulling her head back, she shrugged on a robe even more disreputable and went down to look for breakfast.</p>\n<p>In theory, they were served every morning at the second turning, but old dietary habits died hard, and Ambra was unused to waiting to eat while on campaign. She was not the only one — most of the patients here were Knights or other military — and so the cook kept jars of jerky and field-cookies on a counter, and the kettle of water above the kitchen fire was always hot for tea, tended by a sleepy-eyed kitchen minion during even the smallest hours of the night.</p>\n<p>The kitchen was already awake, though, sliding paddles covered with loaves of bread as well as fancier pastries into the already-roaring ovens. The subcook frowned into a vat of sour gruel being heated, stirring to break up larger lumps. Ambra poured herself lemon tea, then grabbed a field-cookie and took it with her, nibbling at the grainy edge, its flavor more hearty than sweet.</p>\n<p>Outside in the garden, she paused to survey her surroundings, eyes narrowed as her head swept across the humped, flower-laden graves, a few small memorial benches, the field supplying the hospital’s vegetable needs, and the hedge-maze. She couldn’t see into the last but moved to a bench near its entrance, sitting down with a sigh.</p>\n<p>“Have you thought about my request?” a voice said beside her elbow.</p>\n<p>She jumped, startled. “Dammit, Gray, I told you to stop doing that.”</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t,” the voice began, then paused. “Well, actually, I suppose I was.” The owner of the voice popped their head out of the hedge-maze. “But I wasn’t trying to sneak up on you on purpose. That time. I saw you coming and thought I’d give you a moment to sit down.”</p>\n<p>“So you could ambush me.”</p>\n<p>“So you could catch your breath.”</p>\n<p>She ate the rest of the palm-sized cookie in three savage bites, not tasting it. But her voice was mild. “As to your request, I don’t think I’d be a very good teacher.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/07/08/podcastle-899-broken-all-my-boughs-and-brittle-my-heart/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He drew out the rune-etched broadsword of young Haddad’s great-grandfather and laid it in the boy’s hands, along with the elegant sheath that lunar moths had woven from their own silk. Then came the maps that would send Haddad on the next leg of his journey: those that told how to navigate mountains by constellations of the sky, and those of the eight oceans that could only be read amid sea breeze.</p>\n<p>Underneath that pile of iron and parchment and enchantment, the little Haddad wriggled. He was barely visible under the pile of destiny he held.</p>\n<p>“Wait! What do I do with this one? Does it re-dead zombies?”</p>\n<p>Abraham couldn’t see which item he was holding up and asking about, not under that mess of rainbow folds and sacred cartography. Did he have time to help the boy sort all this out? He fished around his robes with his gnarled hands until he felt the chill touch of the astral pocket watch. He flicked it open and gaped. He was three hours behind.</p>\n<p>Haddad’s head poked out from under the cloak and broadsword, his brown eyes wide and imploring. “Wait! Just one more minute. Which way do I take through the Forest of Tombstones?”</p>\n<p>“You’re the hero. You need to figure these things out on your own.”</p>\n<p>“I’ve been trying, but assembling my party is hard and nobody has escaped the Forest of Tombstones alive. They all come back zombified. Please, I just need to know whether to go east or south.”</p>\n<p>Oh, the Forest of Tombstones. Abraham had been through that blighted place twice in his younger years, on other business trips with other heroes. He really ought to install a signpost at the entrance.</p>\n<p>“Go south,” he said. “The real trick is to go slowly. If you try to rush through the Forest of Tombstones, its curse will wake more of the residents. It’s like quicksand, but with ghosts.”</p>\n<p>“Is there quicksand?”</p>\n<p>“Yes. But again, you . . .”</p>\n<p>“I need to figure these things out myself. Yes, sir.”</p>\n<p>Then Abraham flicked the astral pocket watch closed, and its enchantment opened the gateway. Light spilled into the clearing, splitting open a circular portal in the murky air. Its radiance drove every bug and rodent from its sight. Even Abraham had to shield his eyes from it. He needed new glasses.</p>\n<p>As he stepped through, he thought the boy thanked him. It went too fast for him to be sure.</p>\n<p>As soon as the radiance faded, he stepped into the next world, a humid bog where his shoes sank into the earth, and the drooping willow trees blocked out the moon and brushed the point of his hat. Immediately the young heroine Rania darted close, getting nose-to-nose with him, her green eyes bloodshot and furious. Her voice was hoarse and phlegmy, as though she had a cold that, with her proximity, he’d soon enjoy as well.</p>\n<p>“Where have you been? I’ve been almost dead for a week out here.”</p>\n<p>Before he’d met Rania, she’d been under a curse and forced to live the life of a stable boy. She broke the curse on her own, reclaimed her name, found Abraham, demanded he mentor her, and they’d gone on many adventures since. She’d always known exactly what she wanted. And now she had grown up. She was nearly as tall as himself, long of leg and reach, and was a natural at channeling her anger into progress. Her quest was the best shot at establishing democracy in her world.</p>\n<p>Her hair and jacket were snagged by an army of pricking brambles. Unpleasant, but not exactly dead.</p>\n<p>Abraham put a step’s distance between them and said, “Did you find the key in the troll’s den?”</p>\n<p>“I was stone! They turned me to stone. Trolls are supposed to turn to stone. Why didn’t you warn me that they can turn people into stone, too?”</p>\n<p>She tensed like she was going to take a swing at him, and it was a vigor that got his heart going faster. What a spirit she had.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/07/01/podcastle-898-this-mentor-lives/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 897: Oops! All Swords</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated PG-13</p>\n<h3>Oops! All Swords</h3>\n<p/><p>Blackness, and a ringing in your ears, and the smell of ozone, frankincense, woodsmoke. Something’s happened. An accident. A magical accident.</p>\n<p>But you’re conscious, and your heart’s beating. You’re alive, probably. That’s a start.</p>\n<p>Vision returns in sparkles, resolving into blinding lines of glitter. You squinch your eyes almost shut as the image clears. It’s your master’s workshop, sort of. Bookshelves and scroll racks, salt-crusted alembics, a human skull perched on the mantelpiece above the motionless flames. Your master in the doorway, caught in the moment of hanging up his pointed hat. But through the haze of your lashes, swords gleam from every surface. Huge zweihanders pierce the countertops; miniature bodkins velvet the floor. Scimitars cross the door, trapping your master in a cage so tight you can see a few white beard hairs at his feet.</p>\n<p>Nothing moves. You draw a breath.</p>\n<p>“Hey, kiddo,” the skull screeches. “Welcome to the plane of shit got real! You’re fucked.”</p>\n<p>You shriek, step back. Something sharp — <i>a sword, it’s a sword and you’re an idiot </i>— slices into your back: hot, cold, wet, black. Nothing.</p>\n<p>Dry laughter filters in, along with ozone, frankincense, woodsmoke, blood. Your blood. This time when your vision clears there’s an addition to the workshop: your own corpse, like a grisly wall hanging, your chest stylishly ornamented with a bloodstained sword.</p>\n<p>“That was great,” the skull says. “Wow. I really got you.”</p>\n<p>“Shut up,” you say. You can’t look away from the corpse; your mouth’s running on its own. “What happened? Where are we? You said the plane of shit got real? That’s not a thing, where are we really? How come you can talk now? Am I dead? I don’t feel dead.”</p>\n<p>“You blew your soul to ethereal little bits is what happened!” The skull seems to relish the idea. “Now you’re stuck here with me. Didn’t anyone ever tell you not to cheat?”</p>\n<p>The word <i>cheat</i> jerks terror from your gut. “Cheat? Cheat at what? At cards? On my girlfriend?”</p>\n<p>The skull cackles. “Wow, I guess the brains must have gone to some other bit! You cheated at magic, dumbass. You fucked with the cards.”</p>\n<p>Slowly it comes back to you: the tarot cards, the Word, the draw — two of swords, five of swords, ten of swords — and your instinctive swap, looking away from the cards to misdirect, letting your hand reverse the ten to reverse its meaning. Survival, not ruin; hope, not failure. Stupid, stupid. An ingrained habit from your old life: rolling dice, moving shells, telling fortunes. Picking pockets, sometimes, when there weren’t enough suckers to go around. But you can’t sucker the universe.</p>\n<p>Your master’s told you that too. <i>Don’t cut corners, you’re cheating no one but yourself.</i> He stopped giving you real spells a while ago: his way of forcing you to follow his rules. If he’d taught you like he was supposed to, like he <i>agreed</i> to, you wouldn’t be sneaking around like this.</p>\n<p>“Yeah,” you say. “All right. I’m a dumbass. But I’m an alive dumbass, so unlike you I’ve got a chance. How do I get out of here?”</p>\n<p>“You could try stabbing yourself again,” the skull suggests.</p>\n<p>“Fine, don’t be helpful.” You scan the room. It’s hard to see past the pointy metal forest, but otherwise the room seems <i>basically</i> like usual . . .?</p>\n<p>Something white catches your eye. Paper on the floor: a card. You tiptoe over, the tiniest swords pricking through your slippers and socks, and catch it up.</p>\n<p>It’s not a tarot card. It’s a weird hybrid: the ace of spades melded with the ace of swords. There are more cards around the room, and gingerly you pick them up, wiping your bloody fingers on your pants to keep the cards clean, until you’ve got them all: a deck of fifty-two playing cards, each card ordinary except for the divinatory tarot image replacing its center pips. Ace of spades and swords, three of hearts and — wait.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/06/24/podcastle-897-oops-all-swords/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 896: TALES FROM THE VAULTS: Defy The Grey Kings</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated R</p>\n<h3>Defy The Grey Kings</h3>\n<p>There are many ways to kill an elephant. When that mountain bears down on you, shaking the earth and screaming for your blood, show no fear.</p>\n<p>Only without fear will you see the truth. They are quick, even draped in chain and iron, but you are quicker by a whisker. They fight like devils, but it only takes three people who know what they are doing to bring an elephant down.</p>\n<p>They are afraid of you.</p>\n<p>All elephants can die.</p>\n<p>I bring you two things today. Iron, sharp and true, and a story. If you don’t gain the truth of things from this, you would best drive these blades into your own hearts.</p>\n<p>I have slain many enemies, both grey and pale. I’ve learnt things in that awful quiet, the moments of pain and sorrow after the fury, where men like me pass over the dead and dying. The road that brought me here is slick with blood, and if you do not listen to me carefully, your own deadly road will wash you away.</p>\n<p>I was born a slave, like all of you. My master was a hoary old bull known as Ascaro, one of the Bull-King’s champions. Twenty feet high at the shoulders, and even past his prime he was a quick devil, though old muscles were turning into fat.</p>\n<p>Where other elephants cover themselves in tattoos and silk and let the scriveners carve boasts upon their tusks, Ascaro only ever wore his scars. The end of his right tusk was shattered from an enemy axe, and a lucky blow had taken his left eye long before I ever drew breath.</p>\n<p>I spent many hours scouring his hide with brushes and bronze scrapers, and I knew that grey map of his battles well. He drank melon wine during his mud baths, and when his one eye turned red and crazed, he played his favourite game with the house slaves. Without warning, his trunk would flick backwards, and those of us cleaning his back would have to dodge his drunken fumblings and try not to slip and fall. The first slave to fall into the mud bath was the one that he would kill that day. He would pin them down with his foot, exerting just enough pressure to hold them under the mud.</p>\n<p>I would stand on that heaving back with perfect balance, and not once did I cease my endless scrubbing, staring only at my broom as someone else drowned in the mud.</p>\n<p>His lieutenants and lackeys would cheer him on while he murdered a human being for no reason. Even the house poet would stop plucking the bouzouki with his trunk and join in the laughter. Just before the bubbles finally stopped, Ascaro would step down hard, crunching bones. He would pluck each corpse out of the mud, tossing it across his great hall. Each body fell with a meaty smack, arms and legs a muddy broken tangle. The elephants would roar and laugh at the sight, each of them screeching that horrible deep-throated rasp that every man loathes.</p>\n<p>I survived the bath game longer than any of the other slaves in the house of Ascaro, and only then did my master look upon me with value. He took the broom from my hands and gave me to a man named Mouse.</p>\n<p>“This one dances well,” Ascaro told Mouse. “Teach him to dance with a knife.”</p>\n<p>Mouse was a hulk of a man, almost as scarred and grizzled as our master. He took me away from that miserable house, from all I’d ever known.</p>\n<p>He led me across the streets of Tusk, through the plazas and across the causeways. It is a city built to the scale of our masters, already old when the elephants learned script and set their histories down. I felt like an ant, just another attendant below the notice of our grey kings. Here the wealthy promenaded, draped in silk and gold-dust, and each elephant carried a dozen slaves armed with fly-switches and scratch-sticks.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/06/17/podcastle-896-tales-from-the-vaults-defy-the-grey-kings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 895: The Day of the Sea</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated PG-13</p>\n<h3>The Day of the Sea</h3>\n<p/><p>When the Sea came to our village, she was an old woman. She arrived when the water crested and draped over the earth, its salty fingers pushing out offerings of sea glass and bladder wrack. Her dress trailed behind her, hair tangled with kelp and tentacles. No one doubted that she was the Sea. Everyone was disappointed.</p>\n<p>We’d all heard tales about the power of the rising ocean, how it leveled towers and returned rock to sand. How it would destroy everything in its path in order to make its way home, to our village. In those tales, the Sea was a warrior, beautiful and terrible, slashing her way across the continent, swallowing everything in her path. Even when gossips at the market began to whisper about nearby towns swallowed by salt water, about boats crushed like kindling and bones strewn across the ocean floor, even as the smell of salt wafted on the breeze, we did not seek her out. We waited for her to come to us, as the stories had foretold.</p>\n<p>But the Sea that arrived was timid and exhausted from her travels. We’d expected her to thunder against our walls, insistent and unrelenting, Instead, she waited just outside the village, frail and silent. The tide nudged at our gates and withdrew, nudged and withdrew, as if asking permission to enter. If she had ever been a warrior, it was a long time ago.</p>\n<p>We’d prayed to her. We’d spent generations waiting for her to arrive. No one was willing to turn her away. But no one stepped forward to welcome her, either.</p>\n<p>“I am weary,” said the Sea, in a voice as deep and heavy as fathoms of water. “I have seen too much and traveled too far.”</p>\n<p>The villagers all shifted their feet and avoided her gaze. If they let her inside, how could she return the favor? Her waters, stretched thin here at the end of her journey, wouldn’t offer up the bounty we expected; they would only flood our fields and poison our lakes. She was not what was promised, and though no one said it out loud, everyone thought it would be better if she didn’t get too comfortable.</p>\n<p>But then, my grandmother stepped forward.</p>\n<p>“Come inside, then, and rest,” my grandmother said. “I have food and drink, and a bed that stands empty since my youngest son and his wife died of the blue fever.”</p>\n<p>The Sea bowed her head. “The Sea does not rest. But I will linger here, until the tide goes out.”</p>\n<p>When my grandmother took the Sea’s hand, it was ice cold, but she didn’t let go.</p>\n<p>Once the Sea had gone inside my grandmother’s house, we children ran for the shore. We couldn’t wait to see the treasures in its shallows, things we’d only heard about in story and song: oysters hiding luminous pearls in their soft gullets, fish that glowed in darkness like candles, creatures spined and tentacled and every color we could imagine. But the water, even though it was shallow where it flooded the outer fields, was so cold it numbed our feet and ankles, and none of us wanted to wade in further. We ran back and forth as the sluggish waves approached and retreated, searching for any kind of treasure, for surely the Sea wouldn’t leave us empty handed, not after we’d welcomed her and offered her food and drink. But the shells the tide left behind were dull and broken, the mussels picked through, the seaweed brown and smelly. Even the fish were as small as insects, and not worth the effort of catching them.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/06/10/podcastle-895-the-day-of-the-sea/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Ever since a nasty concussion stopped me playing rugby when I was 18, I struggled to exercise regularly. I tried plenty of workouts, dabbling in everything from CrossFit to Zumba. While some were more enjoyable than others, I hadn’t found a way to keep a consistent, disciplined regime without it feeling like a chore. I’m 28 now and work from home. My commute from bed to desk is 15 steps. Given the health risks of sedentary lifestyles, I had tried just about everything to break my lazy rut, and then something worked: watching television.</p>\n    <p>Well, OK, not just watching television like a modern Jim Royle, who reached Olympic levels in The Royle Family, but I imposed a rule: if I want to watch TV, I have to do so while sitting on my exercise bike (the one cardio exercise I can tolerate). The result? I’ve been cycling roughly six hours a week for months now. Generally, I watch a lot of sports: if there’s football, rugby, tennis, boxing, NFL or cricket on, I’ll watch it. So invariably through the year I find there’s roughly two hours of sport on three times a week I want to watch. By combining this with exercise, I find I am able to do so without feeling guilty.</p>\n    <p>Most of the sports I watch have intervals, so I tend to cycle moderately during the action and then start to pedal my way quickly through another Jamie Carragher tirade or some inane ad breaks. I usually burn about 500 calories during a two-hour session. Sometimes my drink of choice while I cycle might even be a non-alcoholic beer. Bliss.</p>\n    <p>I used to feel exercise was a waste of time, like being a hamster on a wheel, spinning and doing very little. But the benefits of consistent exercise have been pretty amazing for me. It has helped me to reach a level of fitness where I feel less anxious about going to the gym, but I also reap the mental health benefits of sticking to a routine and enjoying the aches days after I push myself a little harder than before (a masochistic hangover from my rugby days).</p>\n    <p>Sure, there are some days when staying on the bike is more of a slog than others, if there’s a particularly boring match on or the wifi decides to be dodgy. But by that point I’m already there and something in me decides I might as well keep going. It’s almost as though this hamster wheel now energises me instead of dragging me down.</p>\n    <p>More recently, I have found that passively exercising while actively doing something I enjoy is a wider magic formula. Listening to podcasts while I take my time doing various sets of weights is my latest endeavour. They say that incremental changes are the most effective, and building up an exercise regime by watching television has worked. It has helped me to feel happier and healthier.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/21/change-that-worked-exercise-watching-tv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep. Was that exhausting to read? Well, imagine if that noise was the soundtrack to your summer.</p>\n<p>To the ire of many city dwellers this year, it is. The piercing and persistent sound, something akin to a half-bothered fire alarm you accidentally set off, has been everywhere. Its origin? Lime e-bikes, specifically the stolen variety.</p>\n<p>The bikes, which have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/15/i-want-them-all-crushed-the-council-poised-to-ban-dangerous-lime-bikes\">become ubiquitous</a> in London and other cities, cost 27p a minute to ride, plus a £1 unlock fee in the capital. Those hoping to get around without paying a penny have resorted to naughtier (and noisier) ways of doing so.</p>\n<p>There are video tutorials available online on how to break into Lime e-bikes. When someone manages to bypass their lock and ride around for free, it emits a continuous beep, beep, beep sound.</p>\n<p>The noise is supposed to be a deterrent – a sonic advertisement to all who pass by that the rider is a cheat – but considering how prevalent it has become, it seems as though boosting a bike has become not only an acceptable course of action but even a lifestyle choice.</p>\n<p>On a balmy Friday afternoon in lush and leafy Clissold Park in east <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london\">London</a>, I played the beep, beep, beep sound to sun seekers, who recognised it instantly. During the course of our conversation, offending e-bikes sped around people, including children, along the park’s paths.</p>\n<p>Ellie Roberts said she heard the sound daily, describing it as the “birdsong of Hackney”.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t keep me up but it bothers me,” said Roberts, 47, who works in advertising. “It’s an indication of low-level crime on an ongoing basis.”</p>\n<p>Her friend, Sinead McKenna, 49, is more fond of the persistent sound. “I quite like it, it’s the sound of the summer,” said the solicitor.</p>\n<p>Schoolkids are often seen whizzing around on the beeping bikes, despite under-18s being banned from using the service. “I genuinely like [the sound] because I think if I was a kid, that’s what I’d do,” said McKenna, laughing. “It’s the fact that Lime is making a lot of money and they have a responsibility. I don’t blame the kids for it.”</p>\n<p>There was little sympathy for Lime in evidence. “Why is it that they can make money off public space?” said Sebastian Eyre, 34, who runs a pizza company. “I don’t actually mind [the sound] because it’s usually kids. Lime have done their evil, so let the kids get a free ride.”</p>\n<p>Eyre, who lives in Sydenham, said he heard the dreaded beep, beep, beep “a couple times a day”. He reckons in his pocket of south-east London people are riding stolen bikes “nine time out of ten”, based on how often he hears the sound.</p>\n<p>A small stroll outside the park, on a road where cafes and bakeries that are the calling card of gentrification lie, Lime bikes were also seen whizzing up and down.</p>\n<p>Clad in Lycra and a bike helmet seldom seen on those zipping around on Lime e-bikes, John Villeneau said there had been a “massive increase” in the number of them available in the area.</p>\n<p>“If you just go to any of the pubs, there used to be a group of 10 bikes outside. Now, there’s like 50. There’s just hundreds of bikes outside on a Friday night because everyone Limes it up and Limes it back,” said the 59-year-old non-practising solicitor.</p>\n<p>He said he hears the beep, beep, beep sound a lot but doesn’t mind it. “If you’re forced to take a Lime bike and not pay for it and you have to put up with that noise yourself, who cares? I don’t care,” he said.</p>\n<p>He has given the e-bikes a go himself, but he’s not a big fan. “I’m not keen. They’re expensive and I can’t be bothered. The last couple of times I’ve ridden them into town, you have to go to a designated place and all that crap.”</p>\n<p>Jane, 68, a former teacher, who did not want to provide her last name, visited Clissold Park for the first time in over a year since moving out of the area.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/20/stolen-lime-bikes-sound-of-summer-city-london\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It sounds nonsensical, but that’s exactly the experience.</p>\n<p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>The gently undulating gravel trail in the country’s most sparsely populated region is not only a beginner-friendly cycle, it’s also enjoyed by people with a wide range of physical abilities.</p>\n<p>Natalie Gauld, 58, who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2022, has completed the West Coast Wilderness Trail multiple times and contributed to the trail’s <a href=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/74969/1734467237-west-coast-wilderness-trail-accessible-ride-guide-updated-november-2024.pdf\">accessible ride guide</a>. “It makes me feel capable,” said Gauld on a phone call before my trip. “I enjoy its remoteness.”</p>\n<p>The 133km trail from Ross to Greymouth (or vice versa) is one of 23 <a href=\"https://www.nzcycletrail.com/\">Ngā Haerenga Great Rides of New Zealand</a>. It’s in the West Coast region, a narrow strip of land roughly 600km long wedged between the frozen Southern Alps and the palm-fringed Tasman Sea. Its diverse ecosystems bizarrely buddy up: icy slopes and glacial rivers with steamy rainforests and pebbly beaches.</p>\n<p>Viewing the world from handlebars is the way my husband, Paul, and I typically like to travel. Long, short, challenging, easy-going; we’re not fussy once we’re immersed in the landscape on two wheels. Having said that, we are not fans of lugging our kit or working out the best places to stop, eat and sleep. So <a href=\"https://www.adventuresouth.co.nz/New-Zealand/Cycle-Trails/West-Coast-Wilderness-Cycle-Trail\">we joined three other riders on a five-day supported journey</a> with cycling and walking specialists Adventure South NZ, who took care of the tedious logistics and planned snack stops and short side hikes to several <a href=\"https://westcoast.co.nz/visit/see-do/scenic-attractions/\">West Coast scenic spots.</a></p>\n<p>A bridge closure meant we had to slice off the first 15km or so and saddle up on the road outside Hokitika in the lashing rain. “A real West Coast welcome,” said our tour guide, Tereza Unzeitigova. The soggy start was forgiven as soon as we ducked into the protection of a mossy native rainforest. The West Coast is the only part of New Zealand where significant tracts of lowland rainforest remain, which includes giant podocarp trees that hark back to Gondwanaland.</p>\n<p>The boardwalk traverses <a href=\"https://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/habitats/wetlands/wetlands-by-region/west-coast/\">Lake Mahinapua’s wetlands</a>, where the soundtrack was a sonic experience all its own. For the unversed, like me, it could have been anything from swans, ducks and royal spoonbills to bellbirds, tūī, kererū or cuckoos. A coastal hug back to our accommodation in Hokitika completed the first 20km.</p>\n<p>“‘Coasters’ have to be more self-reliant because we’re geographically isolated,” said Adventure South NZ host Rob Pieper, who served the group a paddock-to-plate dinner of zucchini soup, organic beef goulash and vegetarian dahl with rice that evening at his architecturally designed off-grid home. “If we have an earthquake, we could be on our own for months.”</p>\n<p>Pieper and his wife, Col, prepare cyclists’ meals for the tour group. It is a natural fit for the delightful tandem-riding couple originally from the Netherlands, who – along with managing their smallholding, situated on the coast at Ruatapu in a rare white heron habitat – “make it work” by guiding, nursing, catering and school-bus driving.</p>\n<p>After a restful night at the Beachfront hotel in Hokitika, we got a bird’s eye view of the native forest on a <a href=\"https://treetopsnz.com/\">walk in the treetops</a>, before continuing the ride on a narrow trail alongside the babbling waters of the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alltrails.com%2Ftrail%2Fnew-zealand%2Fwest-coast%2Fkaniere-water-race-walkway&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/jun/14/remote-and-accessible-cycling-new-zealands-west-coast-wilderness-trail\">Kaniere water race</a>. Before my trip, Gauld told me she can pedal her Motom here after “pinch points” on the trail were widened.</p>\n<p>Following a homemade lunch in a repurposed woolshed with Rob and Col, we spent the remainder of the day riding the shores of Lake Kaniere and hiking into the azure awe of <a href=\"https://westcoast.co.nz/visit/discover/highlights/hokitika-gorge/\">Hokitika Gorge</a>. Its glacial waters carry precious pounamu (greenstone) from the mountains down to the sea.</p>\n<p>Time-poor doctors Nikhil Patel, 36, and Anvi Butala, 31, chose the trail because it packs multiple experiences into a relatively short trip. In preparation for the ride, Butala found a hill near where she lives and rode it 10 times in one training session, she told me.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/jun/14/remote-and-accessible-cycling-new-zealands-west-coast-wilderness-trail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Here’s what to do if yours goes missing.</p>\n    <h2>\n      <strong>What to do if your bike is lost or stolen</strong>\n    </h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Report the theft to the police and describe the bike in as much detail as possible, giving the model, make and where it was stolen. You should also include a description of any scratches, dents and marks that could help identify it, and a picture if you have one. You can go into your local police station or call 101 in the UK to file a report. Make sure you get a crime reference number.</p></li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Home insurance policies will often cover your bike when it’s at home but you will probably have needed to pay extra to extend this for when you’re out and about, or if you have a valuable bike. Report the loss to your insurer and give it the crime reference number. Your bike will not be covered if you failed to look after it, such as not locking it securely or with a suitable lock.</p></li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Declare your bike stolen on</p><a href=\"https://www.bikeregister.com/\">BikeRegister</a>, a UK bike database – you can do this even if you have not registered your bike on there before. It will help improve the chances of your bike being recovered if there are pictures and descriptions of the bike, and where it was stolen.</li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Post on bike and cycling forums, such as</p><a href=\"https://forum.cyclinguk.org/\">Cycling UK Forum</a>,<a href=\"https://www.bikeforums.net/]\">Bike Forum</a>and<a href=\"https://www.cyclechat.net/\">CycleChat</a>in case people come across it when looking to buy a new bike.</li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Look on resale sites such as Gumtree, Facebook Marketplace and eBay to see whether someone is trying to sell your bike. You can set up alerts for bikes that are the same make and model. If you find one that looks like yours, alert the police – they may be able to recover it. It is not advisable to set up a sting or try to deal with the case yourself.</p></li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Alert the local community on neighbourhood forums such as Nextdoor or local Facebook groups and get in touch any bike shops nearby in case someone comes in to the shop and tries to sell one that matches your description.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2>\n      <strong>What to do when you get a new bike</strong>\n    </h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Scuff the frame up a bit using sandpaper, paint and stickers so it is less appealing to thieves. Some kitsch, drawn-on hearts might save you a lot of hassle in the future.</p></li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Register it on</p><a href=\"https://www.bikeregister.com/\">BikeRegister</a>and upload pictures alongside the frame number, which is usually found on the bottom bracket shell between the pedals or on the rear dropouts where the back wheel slots in. This will help the police trace it back to you if it is stolen and recovered.</li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Invest in two high-quality locks to make your bike less of a target. At least one of these should be a good-quality D-lock. Be sure to attach the frame to the stand when locking up.</p></li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Take any removable parts with you whenever you leave it.</p></li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Find and apply for your nearest cycle parking. This gives another layer of protection, but be sure to still lock up securely. In cities there are also many cycle hangars, such as Cyclehoop, which are small bike stores on residential streets you can apply for at a small cost each year.</p><a href=\"https://www.cyclehoop.rentals/\">Check whether there’s one near you</a>.</li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Conceal a Bluetooth tracker on your bike to help locate it if it goes missing. The smaller and more discreet the tracker, the better. Good spots to hide them include under the seat or inside the handlebar. Apple AirTag and Tile Sticker are popular among bike owners.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/jun/11/what-to-do-if-your-bike-is-stolen-and-how-to-break-the-cycle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <i>Terry Rosoman ran almost 120km across south Wales to make a giant penis and testicles</i>\n    </p>\n<p>In 2013, I was in the worst shape of my life. Though I functioned well day to day, I was a heavy binge drinker and smoker. Unfit, obese and unhappy, on impulse I signed up to a white-collar boxing fight. I trained six days a week for three months, shifting three stone by fight night. Winning that fight was great, though turning my life around had been my main goal. After that, I started challenging myself regularly while raising money for mental health charities.</p>\n<p>My first 24-hour challenge involved ascending Pen y Fan – the highest peak in south Wales – 10 times in a row during the dead of winter. It was horrific, but it raised lots of money, so next time I wanted something even bigger. Having seen examples of <a href=\"https://www.strav.art/\">Strava art</a> online, I thought that might be a good way to get people’s attention. I decided on a big run in the Bannau Brycheiniog<strong> </strong>(formerly the<strong> </strong>Brecon Beacons), an hour from my home, and chose November to coincide with Men’s Health Awareness Month. A giant penis seemed the obvious way to represent this, plus it was undeniably eye‑catching. I researched previous examples made using GPS mapping, all created on foot in a single, continuous effort. Plenty of them were three or four miles long, but I was aiming for something on a much grander scale.</p>\n<p>Using the Strava planner, I found a route resembling a shaft between England and Wales, right up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/oct/14/offas-dyke-path-at-50\">Offa’s Dyke</a>. I thought, “Brilliant. Can I tack on a little bell-end at the top, near Hay-on-Wye?” Yes, there it was. “Now, can I squeeze some balls on at the bottom?” The whole thing took shape very easily, taking in Crickhowell and Llangenny, and passing serendipitously through a village called Three Cocks. Only then did I realise the route was just over 72 miles (116km) long, with almost 10,000ft of elevation. But now I’d plotted the picture, I had to do it.</p>\n<p>I started and ended in Abergavenny, where I set off at 5pm on 1 November 2024, running for 12 hours in darkness. Friends were stationed en route to run alongside me for a while and keep my spirits up; likewise my brother was waiting for me right on the tip. Without their encouragement, I don’t know if I’d have made it. The first 20 miles were uphill, and after 50 I just wanted to die, yet still had the best part of a whole marathon to go.</p>\n<p>Bone-tired and wrapped in a Welsh flag, I crossed the finish line at 4.30pm the following afternoon, half an hour shy of the 24-hour mark. A local craftsman presented me with a 3D-printed cock and balls trophy. The giant manhood has also been recreated in cake form by my mother, to celebrate my 40th birthday, and I’ve even been a question on Have I Got News for You. Some have suggested my real aim was to make my name the top result whenever anyone Googles “world’s biggest penis”. Alas, it turns out the search terms have to be a bit more specific.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>‘</strong>\n      <strong>I turned too soon coming out of the shark’s mouth’</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Samppa Tölli put on ice skates to etch a 16km image of a great white shark on to a frozen lake in Finland</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Hiidenvesi is the second-largest lake in Finland’s Uusimaa region, north-west of Helsinki. My parents have lived near the lake since I was a kid, so I’ve known it all my life. In summer, I’d ride around the surrounding bike trails or go out in my kayak. I still live nearby. During the winter the lake freezes over, and in 2023 I spent a lot of time skating on it.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/may/25/artist-athletes-drawing-gps-fitness-trackers-strava\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Under-16s in England will be banned from buying energy drinks such as Red Bull and Monster because they fuel obesity, cause sleep problems and leave them unable to concentrate.</p>\n    <p>Health experts, teaching unions and dentists welcomed the ban and said it would boost children and young people’s health. It fulfils a pledge <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Labour-Party-manifesto-2024.pdf\">Labour included in its manifesto</a> for last year’s general election.</p>\n    <p>“How can we expect children to do well at school if they have the equivalent of a double espresso in their system on a daily basis?”, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/wes-streeting\">Wes Streeting</a>, the health secretary.</p>\n    <p>“Energy drinks might seem harmless but the sleep, concentration and wellbeing of today’s kids are all being impacted, while high sugar versions damage their teeth and contribute to obesity.”</p>\n    <p>Shops, cafes, restaurants and websites will be prohibited from selling energy drinks containing more than 150mg of caffeine per litre to anyone under 16. That will affect drinks such as Red Bull, Monster, Relentless and Prime Energy and force their makers to reformulate their products.</p>\n    <p>For example, a 250ml can of Red Bull contains 80mg of caffeine, the same as one espresso or two cans of cola. Tea, coffee and soft drinks containing lower amounts of caffeine will be unaffected.</p>\n    <p>It is unclear when sales to under-16s – including from vending machines – will become illegal. The ban will be done using secondary legislation under the Food Safety Act 1990.</p>\n    <p>Supermarkets voluntarily stopped selling the drinks to under-16s in 2018. But some smaller convenience stores still allow under-16s to buy them. Drinks containing more than 150mg of caffeine per litre already carry warning labels that they are “not suitable for children”.</p>\n    <p>“High-caffeine energy drinks have no place in children’s hands. This is a common sense, evidence-based step to protect children’s physical, mental and dental health”, said Katharine Jenner, the director of the <a href=\"https://obesityhealthalliance.org.uk/\">Obesity Health Alliance</a>.</p>\n    <p>The success of preventing young people buying alcohol and cigarettes showed that age-based restrictions work, Jenner added. “Age-of-sale policies like this have a proven record of reducing access to products that are not suitable for children.”</p>\n    <p>Teachers have voiced concern about how energy drinks have left young children “bouncing off the walls in lesson time” after consuming them on their way to school.</p>\n    <p>Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, said the move would help tackle the “scourge of poor classroom behaviour”, which is caused in part by “the harmful effects of caffeine-loaded drinks”.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.nasuwt.org.uk/static/e4d66c48-9cd8-49c9-84db6895956f75f4/Behaviour-Briefing-Children-and-Young-People-Engaging-in-Harmful-Activities.pdf\">Research by the NASUWT union</a> found 71% of teachers worry about pupils misusing energy drinks at school and 70% while elsewhere.</p>\n    <p>“The drinks create a situation in which pupils can’t focus, can’t sit still and just think it’s cool to drink them”, one teacher said. Another said: “Energy drinks make it very difficult for students to focus and engage with learning and seem to make students noisier and agitated.”</p>\n    <p>Matt Wrack, the union’s general secretary, said under-16s will still be able to get the drinks from parents or other adults, despite the ban.</p>\n    <p>Dentists urged the government to go further. The ban should be extended to include zero and low-sugar energy drinks to help tackle tooth decay, the British Dental Association said.</p>\n    <p>“Products that are habit-forming, highly acidic and can contain over 20 teaspoons of sugar have no place on the menu for children”, said Eddie Crouch, the association’s chair.</p>\n    <p>Dr Kawther Hashem, a lecturer in public health nutrition and head of research and impact at Action on Sugar, said trading standards officers would have to enforce the ban to ensure it worked.</p>\n    <p>Gavin Partington, the director general of the British Soft Drinks Association, said firms do not market or promote the drinks to under-16s.</p>\n    <p>He added: “Our members have led the way in self-regulation through our longstanding energy drinks code of practice.</p>\n    <p>“Our members do not market or promote the sale of energy drinks to under-16s and label all high-caffeine beverages as ‘not recommended for children’, in line with and in the spirit of this code.</p>\n    <p>“As with all government policy, it’s essential that any forthcoming regulation is based on a rigorous assessment of the evidence that’s available.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/02/children-energy-drinks-government-obesity-health\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

My husband has had to give up work to look after him but  Aviva </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>is refusing to pay out under our critical illness policy.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>We’ve been paying £60 a month for the cover since 2007.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Our son was born in 2008</strong>\n      <strong> and diagnosed with </strong>\n      <strong>spinal </strong>\n      <strong>muscular </strong>\n      <strong>atrophy with respiratory distress</strong>\n      <strong> (SMA</strong>\n      <strong>-RD) when he was eight.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>He managed well in mainstream school until June last year, since when his health has deteriorated significantly and he has paralysis in all four limbs.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>We contacted Aviva in January to discuss our eligibility for a claim. We were transferred between three departments</strong>\n      <strong> and waited </strong>\n      <strong>more than three-and-a-half hours. An advis</strong>\n      <strong>er repeatedly stated that he did not meet the criteria, but would not tell us what the criteria were.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>We twice requested copies of our policy documents, but they were never received. We raised a formal complaint about their communications in February</strong>\n      <strong> and our consultant submitted medical reports.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>In late June, our claim was denied. Its argument is that SMA-</strong>\n      <strong>RD is a genetic condition </strong>\n      <strong>that would have been present at birth, while his cover on our policy only started on his first birthday.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>I suppose that is why Aviva </strong>\n      <strong>has reported £</strong>\n      <strong>1bn </strong>\n      <strong>operating profit in the first half of this year.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>NL, </strong>\n      <strong>Belfast</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Insurers look upon human suffering through the lens of terms and conditions, and cold hard cash. It has to be this way – they are businesses. But commerce does not preclude compassion and this was shamefully lacking in Aviva’s dealings with you.</p>\n<p>Despite the urgency of your circumstances, it took five months to reach a decision. The email trail you sent me shows your repeated pleadings for updates.</p>\n<p>Your critical illness policy automatically covers children once they reach their first birthday. The terms and conditions do, indeed, state that illnesses that are present from birth are not covered and that symptoms must not have started when the cover begins.</p>\n<p>You sought advice when your son was one as he wasn’t meeting certain developmental targets, but all the tests came back negative. It took another seven years before he was diagnosed with SMA-RD.</p>\n<p>The Financial Ombudsman Service <a href=\"https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/businesses/complaints-deal/insurance/pre-existing-medical-conditions\">states that it usually upholds complaints</a> about claims rejected because of pre-existing conditions of which the customer was unaware.</p>\n<p>It also says that it overrides exclusions in insurers’ terms and conditions if the customer had only general symptoms when cover began, and could not reasonably have foreseen that they would later give rise to a claim.</p>\n<p>There are many reasons why a one-year-old may miss generalised development milestones and most aren’t incurable diseases. I therefore put it to Aviva that you could have had no way of knowing that your infant son had a serious condition that would lead to a claim 15 years later. I suggested that, given the complexities and the timescales, it was rejecting the claim unreasonably on a technicality.</p>\n<p>I was startled by the speed of Aviva’s response. Within two days it had told you that, although it considered your claim had failed to meet its terms and conditions, it would pay you the full £10,000 allowed by your policy. It freely acknowledged that its about-turn had been prompted by my intervention. The money was in your account a few hours later.</p>\n<p>It says: “We fully acknowledge that our service and communication did not meet the standards our customers rightly expect from us. The family’s situation should have prompted a more urgent and compassionate response.</p>\n<p>“While we are unable to approve NL’s son’s claim because of the terms of the policy, we recognise the unique circumstances of this case and the shortfalls in our service, and believe that it is appropriate to make a goodwill payment that is equivalent to the benefit the family would have received had the claim been eligible.”</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Coming up to scratch</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Most companies get it right most of the time. Most put it right when they don’t. And some exceed expectations so magnificently they deserve a shout-out.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/sep/01/aviva-denied-our-sick-son-help-after-five-month-wait\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>A busy Wednesday morning on Bishopsgate in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london\">London</a> and Sgt Stuart Ford of the City of London police is pointing out possible offenders. “He’s not pedalling,” he says, indicating a man on a bike on the other side of the road. “Still not pedalling, but he is going downhill, he might be all right. I’d still pull him over and have a look.”</p>\n<p>Not today, though, because the non-pedalling possible offender is heading north, while Ford’s team – two members of the cycle response unit he set up two years ago and leads – are facing south on the opposite side of the road. A lot of the unit’s work centres on illegal e-bikes; they have seized 212 so far this year.</p>\n<p>News comes over the radio that PCs Harry Rose and David Parker have stopped someone they suspect is on an illegal e-bike, so we find them with a delivery rider in the familiar green livery of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/uber\">Uber</a> Eats. The man, whose name is Mahede Hasan, says his bike has pedals, and the power of the electric motor is 250 watts, which he thought was allowed.</p>\n<p>Ford tilts the bike on its stand and twists the throttle on the right handlebar. “That’s illegal for a start,” he says. “You should pedal to make the motor work.” The bike doesn’t go anywhere, because the spinning back wheel is off the ground, but the speedometer climbs – 20, 30, 40, 50, 52km/h. That’s about 32mph. “What do you think the top speed of this bike should be, with pedal assist?” he asks Hasan, who doesn’t know, so Ford tells him. “15.5mph [25km/h]. This is basically a motorcycle.”</p>\n<p>E-bikes aren’t illegal per se, and you will no doubt have noticed their increased popularity in UK cities, including the proliferation of rental ones (you might have views on them blocking pavements, or the fact that the ever-present background noise of urban Britain is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/20/stolen-lime-bikes-sound-of-summer-city-london\">click click click of a kid on a stolen Lime bike</a>, but that is a different issue). To be legal, which the rental bikes are, an e-bike needs to meet certain criteria. These include having pedals that can be used to drive the bike, an electric motor with a maximum power output of 250W, and a maximum assisted speed of 15.5mph. That doesn’t mean they can’t go faster, if you pedal hard or go downhill, just that the motor won’t help above that speed. Essentially, they’re bicycles with a bit of help, and that’s how they’re treated: you don’t need a licence, registration or insurance to ride one.</p>\n<p>The trouble is a lot of e-bikes <i>aren’t</i> legal to ride on the road, but they are very easy and cheap to get hold of. While the officers complete their paperwork, Hasan, 21, tells me he bought his bike new, on the internet, for £600. “I got it because I do, like, eight or nine hours a day, and if I’m only pedalling I’m going to get more tired. An e-bike makes it more comfortable.” Originally from Bangladesh, he has put a sticker showing a map of the country on the front mudguard.</p>\n<p>He assumed the bike was legal because there was nothing on the website he bought it from that said it wasn’t. “If it’s not, how do they sell it to people?” He says that if he’d known he was breaking the law, he wouldn’t have stopped when they pulled him over. The cycle response unit operates on pedal bikes. “I believe they wouldn’t catch me,” he says.</p>\n<p>The officers tell him they’re seizing the bike, and he asks if he can keep the detachable battery, which they allow, while he cancels the lunch order he was due to deliver. “It’s going to affect my account because when you accept a job, that means you’re committing to delivering to the customer. If you don’t, that’s your problem, not the company’s.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/04/britains-e-bike-boom-desperation-delivery-drivers-and-unthinkable-danger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But just as everyone has their own preferred bike, choosing the right lock, from ultra-secure bolts to lightweight devices, is very personal.</p>\n<p>Cyclists need to consider where they live, how attractive their bike is to thieves (they often look for more elaborate city and racing bikes), and how long they leave it unaccompanied. So to help you pin down the best option for you, we asked the experts for their top bike lock selections to keep your ride secure.</p>\n<h2>What you need to know</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.met.police.uk/cp/crime-prevention/keeping-vehicles-safe/how-safe-is-your-bike/\">Metropolitan police</a> urges people to use two locks instead of one, locking both the frame and the wheels to the stand and taking anything removable – lights, baskets and even the saddle – with you. Also, bear in mind that you may have to carry a lock around for some time, so weight is key.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.soldsecure.com/\">Sold Secure</a> rating system, owned by the Master Locksmiths Association, judges the performance of any lock. It ranks locks from bronze (the most basic level) to silver (which aims to prevent the more determined attacker), gold (to stop dedicated attacks) and diamond (halting the most serious, including angle grinder, attacks).</p>\n<p>Carl Ellis, who founded <a href=\"https://thebestbikelock.com/\">thebestbikelock.com</a> after having one too many bikes stolen, doesn’t recommend bronze-rated locks because he says they don’t provide enough protection in most cases.<strong> </strong>So spend as much as you can afford. He says you can get a lock at a medium security level for about £30, with more secure locks usually costing about £40.</p>\n<p>If you have cycle insurance, ensure you’re buying a lock approved by your insurer, says Richard Cantle, founder of <a href=\"https://www.stolenride.co.uk/\">Stolen Ride</a>, a cyclist-run site that aims to tackle the issues around bike theft.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>At a glance</strong>\n    </h2>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best affordable lock:</strong><br/>Halfords 23cm D Lock</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fcycling%2Fbike-accessories%2Fbike-locks%2Fhalfords-23cm-d-lock---key-225374.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">£35 at Halfords</a>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best</strong><strong>angle grinder resistant</strong><strong>lock:</strong><br/>Hiplok D1000</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://hiplok.com/product/hiplok-d1000/\">£249.99 at Hiplok</a>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best for</strong><strong>city cyclists:</strong><br/>Kryptonite Evolution Mini-7</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fcycling%2Fbike-accessories%2Fbike-locks%2Fevolution-mini-7-lock-with-4-foot-cable-with-flexframe-bracket-sold-secure-silver-581667.html-581667.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">£44.99 at Halfords</a>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best combination lock:</strong><br/>Kryptonite KryptoLok Combo</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.freewheel.co.uk%2Fkryptonite-kryptolok-combo-standard-u-lock-with-bracket-sold-secure-gold-gk005797&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">£51.99 at Freewheel</a>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best chain lock:</strong><br/>Kryptonite KryptoLok Series 2</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fcycling%2Fbike-accessories%2Fbike-locks%2Fkryptolok-995-integrated-chain---9.5-mm-x-95-cm-sold-secure-silver-126064.html-126064.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">£59.99 at Halfords</a>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best lightweight lock:</strong><br/>Foldylock Mini</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FFoldyLock-Mini-Folding-Bike-Lock%2Fdp%2FB0B56BHRLL&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">From £76.98 at Amazon</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>The best bike locks in the UK in 2025</h2>\n<h2>Best affordable lock</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Halfords 23cm D Lock</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fcycling%2Fbike-accessories%2Fbike-locks%2Fhalfords-23cm-d-lock---key-225374.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">£35 at Halfords</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Carl Ellis’s pick is the Halfords 23cm D Lock, which has a gold rating, is practically sized and has a mount included to attach to the frame of the bike.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, lock design has come a long way in the last few years. Brands including Abus, Litelok, Kryptonite and Hiplok have introduced stronger materials, smarter mounting systems, and locks designed specifically for the fatter frames of e-bikes. You can now choose from ultra-tough U-locks, wearable chain locks, and compact folding models with real-world resistance to power tools. A good bike lock won’t make your bike theft-proof, but it can buy you time and give a thief enough reason to walk away.</p>\n<p>We tested 15 of the best bike locks widely available in the US across all different categories and price points. Whether you need <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/13/coronavirus-cycling-bikes-american-boom\">maximum protection for a high-theft area</a> or just a dependable lock for errands around town, we’ve narrowed down the best bicycle locks worth considering in 2025.</p>\n<h2>Why you should trust me</h2>\n<p>I’ve been testing bikes and cycling gear professionally for more than a decade, with a focus on long-term durability and real-world performance. My reviews have appeared in Outside, Bicycling and more than a dozen other cycling publications. I’ve broken, bent and burned through plenty of bike locks – and several dozen angle grinder discs – to separate marketing hype from real-world security.</p>\n<h2>How I tested</h2>\n<p>I tested 15 locks from major brands, including Abus, Kryptonite, Litelok, Hiplok, OnGuard and Seatylock. They were chosen based on security ratings, brand reputation, US availability and how well they represented key use cases.</p>\n<p>To test theft resistance, I cut them using a cordless angle grinder – the preferred device of modern bike thieves to slice through locks and even bike racks. The time to breach listed for each lock is based on this method. While no lock is grinder-proof, some dramatically slow down the theft process by chewing up grinder discs. The best locks required multiple cuts, drained batteries, and destroyed cutting discs enough to deter determined thieves.</p>\n<p>That said, grinder resistance is only one part of the equation. I used each lock for a minimum of two weeks, including short stops, daily commutes and overnight lockups when appropriate for the type of lock. I tested how easy each lock was to carry, deploy and use with different bike frames and bike racks. I noted whether mounts were included, how well they worked, and how much the locks rattled while riding.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>All prices current at the time of publication.</i>\n    </p>\n<h2>At a glance</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best bike lock overall:</strong><br/>Litelok X1<sub>$189.99 at Litelok</sub></li>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best budget bike lock:</strong>Abus Ivera Chain 7210<sub>$82.70 at Amazon</sub></li>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best chain bike lock:</strong>Kryptonite New York Fahgettaboudit Chain<sub>$124.96 at Walmart</sub></li>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best folding bike lock:</strong>Foldylock Forever<sub>$135 at Seatylock</sub></li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>Best overall bike lock:<br/>\n Litelok X1</h2>\n<p>The Litelok X1 is the best overall bike lock we tested. It balances real-world grinder resistance with everyday usability and it is relatively low-weight. This makes it ideal for e-bike riders, daily commuters and anyone locking up in theft-prone areas.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Why we love it</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Most high-security locks fall into two camps: burdensome chains that can weigh up to 15lb, or compact U-locks that can be difficult to use with larger frames or awkward racks. The X1 sidesteps that trade-off with a flexible composite armor called Barronium over a hardened steel core. This material actively resists cutting wheels so effectively that in testing, we had to swap angle grinder discs six times, as well as swap batteries. Both are key factors that can easily stop a thief in their tracks.</p>\n<p>At just 3.7lb (1.7kg), the X1 is surprisingly portable for a Diamond-rated lock. It’s slightly larger than a standard U-lock, with enough internal space to fit around oversized tubes or street signs. It also has reflective striping for night-time visibility and a covered keyway to keep out grime and water.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>It’s a shame that …</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/aug/29/best-bike-locks-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In summer, the longer days and generally favourable conditions mean you can forgo additional accessories such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/feb/13/best-bike-lights\">bike lights</a>, mudguards and head-to-toe waterproofs – although they can’t be avoided forever if you become a year-round, all-weather rider.</p>\n<p>Another bit of good news is that while cycling has a reputation for being an expensive pursuit, it doesn’t have to be, and many of my favourite bits of kit have more affordable price tags.</p>\n<p>In the almost three decades since I set off stabiliser-free for the first time, I’ve dabbled in all types of cycling – from a teenage fling with BMXing to inner-city commuting and ultra-distance off-road escapades. In that time, I’ve tested all manner of clothing, tools and accessories, pushing them to the limit during races, events, training rides and the daily grind. Here’s my favourite gear that I reach for before setting off on a summer ride.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Summer cycling essentials</strong>\n    </h2>\n<h2>Jersey</h2>\n<p>Although it performs a similar function to a generic sports base layer, a jersey is the first “proper” bit of cycling gear worth investing in because of the additional comfort it offers. Made from a lightweight, breathable fabric, a jersey will wick away moisture from hotspots, while a full-length zip means you can “ventilate” on the go. Three rear pockets store essentials such as food, tools and a phone, and unlike a running or gym top, the cut is slightly longer at the back for extra coverage when riding leant forward.</p>\n<p>My favourites, which perform well without breaking the bank, are Italian-designed Sportful SRK, which includes an extra zipped compartment for keys; the 100% recycled Rapha Core; the DHB Blok and its women-specific range, Moda; and the sub-£40 Madison Flux, which comes with a lifetime guarantee.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Rapha Core women’s jersey</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.rapha.cc/gb/en/product/womens-core-jersey/WOR05XXCYW\">From £55 at Rapha</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Sportful men’s SRK jersey</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.sportful.com/GB/en/Mens/Cycling/Jerseys/SRK-JERSEY/p/1124034_3000\">£48.75 at Sportful</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>DHB Moda women’s short</strong>\n      <strong>-sleeve jersey 2.0</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sportsdirect.com%2Fdhb-moda-womens-short-sleeve-jersey-20-333826&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">£55 at Sports Direct</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>DHB Blok men’s classic short</strong>\n      <strong>-sleeve jersey</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sportsdirect.com%2Fdhb-blok-mens-classic-short-sleeve-jersey-634892&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">£55 at Sports Direct</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2Fdp%2FB0DDV1R8C5%2F&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">From £109.99 at Amazon</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Madison Flux men’s short</strong>\n      <strong>-sleeve jersey</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ffawkes-cycles.co.uk%2Fmadison-flux-mens-short-sleeve-jersey-black-p36363%2Fs73799&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">£33.99 at Fawkes Cycles</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclestore.co.uk%2Fmadison_flux_short_sleeve_jersey-ID_89823&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">£35.99 at Cycle Store</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Shorts</h2>\n<p>Bib shorts might seem like an indulgent (and expensive) purchase, but you get what you pay for – and your nether regions will let it be known if you’ve skimped. Fitted with a saddle-shaped section of foam in the crotch (known as a chamois), the shorts add an extra layer of padding beneath your perineum that keeps the area dry and cushioned on long rides. Just don’t wear underwear, as this can negate the benefits. The straps may make the item resemble a wrestler’s singlet, but they keep the shorts in place more comfortably than a waistband, which can dig in over time. As the male and female anatomy are quite different down there, it’s worth opting for a gender-specific set.</p>\n<p>Albion’s ABR1 are my go-to for ultra-distance exploits, arriving with handy pockets on each thigh and one at the rear for extra storage. The Gregarius Essential from Q36.5, meanwhile, are soft and supportive against the skin, and breathable too.</p>\n<p>And for women, “Petrichor Projects’ PP002 offer unbeatable comfort, with a cargo pocket, easy-pee design and sleek aesthetics,” says Katherine Moore, author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/gravel-rides-south-west-england-9781839812545/?utm_source=theguardian&amp;utm_medium=filter&amp;utm_campaign=summercycling\">Gravel Rides South West England</a>, who also recommends Velocio’s Luxe line for all-day epics. “They’re made from a super-soft, compressive material with a built-in base layer front and lovely raw-finish leg hem. A thicker-style chamois pad is the go-to for longer rides.”</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Albion ABR1 </strong>\n      <strong>men’s pocket bib shorts</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.condorcycles.com%2Fproducts%2Falbion-men-s-abr1-pocket-bib-shorts%3Fvariant%3D55680630161792&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">£185 at Condor Cycles</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.albioncycling.com/products/mens-abr1-pocket-bib-shorts-black\">£185 at Albion Cycling</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Q36.5 </strong>\n      <strong>Gregarius Essential bib shorts</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.q36-5.com/en-gb/shop/gregarius-essential-bib-shorts-black/\">£140 at Q36.5</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Petrichor Projects PP002 women’s bib shorts</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

This time I’ll go free.</p>\n<p>As her body falls to the floor, I’ll seize my opportunity. As her soul rises from her body, I will snatch what should be mine — no cliched tunnel of light, just a doorway into the afterlife. But it will be my turn this time, <i>my</i> door. I’ll take it before she can.</p>\n<p>Not that I’ve been able to yet. When the moment comes, I am frozen in place. I can only watch as she enters the door and disappears. And I hate her for it.</p>\n<p>But my plan is not impossible. It has worked before. It was done to me. I remember staring down at my lifeless body sprawled across the carpet. I remember seeing a door appear. Feeling it beckon to me with a promise of peace. Then before I could respond, a ghostly form — the wife before me, I assume — threw it open. She looked at me a moment, shrugged in half apology, and slipped through the door. Which disappeared after her. Leaving me stuck here.</p>\n<p>But not for much longer. When he murders his next wife, I will steal <i>her</i> way out. It’s only fair. That’s what I tell myself, at least. Every time.</p>\n<p>I hear him now at the door, the regular kind. He opens it and carries her across the threshold.</p>\n<p>“Here we are,” he says, his script old and tired to me but fresh for each new wife. “Your home, Mrs. Blake.”</p>\n<p>I notice her elegant dress and her black hair curling around her face, the ring sparkling on her finger — and I freeze. I’m right, this time is different. Because it is <i>my</i> ring, the one he took off my hand before it was even cold.</p>\n<p>I imagine how she felt as he slid it onto her finger, like he did with me. She probably smiled as it glittered in candlelight. Neither of us knew what was coming.</p>\n<p>Her gaze sweeps the room as I stand there, anger roiling through me. And then, something else is different. Because her eyes suddenly stop, widening almost comically.</p>\n<p>She is staring directly at me.</p>\n<p>She looks away immediately. She turns back to her new husband, her future murderer, and begs him to show her around the house. She has never been here, no wife ever comes here before the marriage. Maybe if we had, we would have sensed the wrongness of this place. Or maybe not.</p>\n<p/><p>I know she sees me — know it because of how she stutters to a stop when she enters a room I am in. How her eyes flick to me and away again whenever I appear. But she pretends I don’t exist, and I pretend nothing has changed. It doesn’t matter that she sees me, since she’ll be dead before long. And I cannot make friends with someone I mean to betray.</p>\n<p>I wonder how I look to her. Does she see the last dress I wore, the way I’d done my hair so carefully? Does she see the wound in my chest? It is unsettling to know she sees me at all.</p>\n<p>At least <i>he</i> continues oblivious to my existence. He would otherwise find some way to torment me still.</p>\n<p>She settles in, unpacking clothing, tucking her toothbrush in the holder next to his, washing her morning coffee cup. I roam the halls as I always have, bound to this place and this man. I cannot leave, cannot even see beyond the front door. I have tried, but it seems the only exit for me is the type he keeps providing, if only I can find a way to take it.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/08/19/podcastle-905-the-next-dead-wife/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 904: TALES FROM THE VAULTS – The Illuminated Dragon</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated G</p>\n<h3>The Illuminated Dragon</h3>\n<p>Rafe Greatorex thought he’d spotted a dragon. From where he stood on the cobbled street that ran between the leaning tenements, only a narrow strip of sky was visible. Rafe craned his neck. He was sure — almost sure — that something had flown by, above. A black shadow, an X against the distant blue.</p>\n<p>He looked down again, rubbing his neck. No, it was nothing. Dragons had been outlawed thirty years ago. He must have imagined it. Sighing, he adjusted his glasses, took up the string bag of potatoes with one hand and the canvas bag of books and supplies with the other, and trudged on toward home.</p>\n<p>Finding the supplies he needed for his work on the bestiary had been difficult. He must have walked for miles through the tangled streets of the city to get it all. Gold leaf was almost more than he could afford; he had a bit of it pressed between the pages of a Rationalist text in his breast pocket. The inks, he could still find, and the paper and parchment, but the brushmakers had cast furtive looks up and down the street when they took out their wares, had accepted his payment and scurried away into dark alleys. Of all the paraphernalia of illumination, the colors had been the hardest to find; they would be illegal soon, one pigment-grinder had whispered. “You must take what you can afford now, sir,” the woman had advised, “for it may not be here tomorrow.”</p>\n<p>Rafe plodded on. Arriving at the open space before the cathedral, he looked up again. Still no dragon, and the blue sky had faded to the more typical glassine white which would in turn darken to heavy gray and rain before nightfall. Rafe sighed, switched the book bag from his right hand to his left, and went on. Then he stopped and looked up again. Something was different.</p>\n<p>As usual, the cathedral loomed over one side of the square, buttresses sprawling. The body and the soul, Rafe always thought, when he saw it. The heavy gray stone of the massive cathedral was the body crouching beneath the weight of its sins, while the surprisingly airy filigreed-stone steeple strained toward heaven, the soul hoping for release from the gravity that bound it.</p>\n<p>Rafe frowned. Something was missing. . . . The gargoyles. They’d hacked off the gargoyles. Just last week he’d come this way and the dragons and he-goats and demons had poked their smirking faces from drainpipes, from above doorways and along rooflines. But they were gone now; only stumps of stone remained.</p>\n<p>Rafe stared. Bad enough that all of the statues were gone, not to mention every tapestry and painting in the city. But gargoyles? What would they take next? Graffiti? Tattoos? Children’s drawings?</p>\n<p>Illuminated texts? Shaken, Rafe considered it. His work, he’d always told himself, was close enough to writing, sufficiently unlike representational art, that he was safe from the ponderous wheels of law that ground slowly but exceeding fine. Thirty years ago, maybe, the Rationalists might have seen a man with Rafe’s talent as a threat, as someone to arrest and interrogate and reeducate. And thirty years ago, Rafe admitted, he might have been a danger, however slight, to the Rationalists. But he’d finished with the resistance long ago; he wasn’t sure such a thing as resistance even existed any more. The Rationalists would leave him alone, wouldn’t they?</p>\n<p>The thought of Men of Truth pawing through his shop appalled him. He imagined them hacking away at his lovely illuminated parchments, the capitals with their snakes all a-twining and a-shimmer with gold leaf, the speckled pards crouched at the foot of a page, the marginal dragons delineated in the most delicate strokes of vermilion, the gryphons stippled with argent. Rafe shuddered.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/08/12/podcastle-904-tales-from-the-vaults-the-illuminated-dragon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 903: On the Shoulders of Giants</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated PG</p>\n<h3>On the Shoulders of Giants</h3>\n<p>I was born a T12. Sure, it was the lowest of the thoracic vertebrae, but it was higher than any of the lumbars. I should be thankful to have been born high enough to see above the clouds. The L2s and L3s that climb beside me spent most of their youth in the haze below, unable to see the sun, not knowing how much more of the giant there was left to climb. But not me: fortunate me.</p>\n<p>I grasp at rocky outcroppings and pull myself up the well worn stairs, carved into the ground by those who came before me. Moss hangs from the edges where feet avoid stepping, lest they slip down into the endless void of white below. The wall to my left rises as a sheer cliff of granite, or perhaps marble. It is difficult to know from the amount of lichen and foliage that hang down like curtains. But through the small holes cleaned out by the hands of travelers before, I can sometimes see the glint of the giant who breathes underneath.</p>\n<p>Another step, another step. I hang my free hand into the air and feel the breeze, looking out to a flat horizon. I squint at a dark object in the distance. Another giant, perhaps. Impossible to tell, as they never get close enough to truly see. I turn back to the stairs and find a small cavern ahead, a respite from the daily climb.</p>\n<p>A few other travelers have already taken shelter, gathering around a small fire in the center of the cavern. I find an empty place and sit, taking a moment to rub the calluses on my bare feet.</p>\n<p>“Hail, traveler,” one says. “I am an L1. What are you?”</p>\n<p>“I am a T12.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, a young Thora, I see. Sturdy legs, Thoras. By the look of your feet you have made good progress, yes?”</p>\n<p>I smile weakly at him as I place my hands near the smoldering fire. “Yes, good progress.” I glance around at weary faces, dimly lit with orange and red. I wonder if my face shows the same sunbaked features as theirs, or if perhaps I still had the luster of youth that seems to fall away with every step up the giant. In the silence, I feel compelled to fill the air. “Do you wonder what stands at the top? Or think about why we climb?”</p>\n<p>“Because we must,” he says in a voice that tells me there will be no further elaboration, and that asking for such would be pointless. The others around the fire nod in agreement, repeating the phrase in a murmur.</p>\n<p>I drop the subject and look around at my surroundings, finding at the back of the cave a figure hunched in the darkness, the texture of her skin blending in with the rocks around her. If not for the faint movement of her breathing, I would have not noticed her.</p>\n<p>“Who is that?”</p>\n<p>He glances over briefly. “An old L5. She does not speak, and has been here since before any of this group entered the cave. This will be her final place, back to the stone of the giant.”</p>\n<p>I look to the others around the fire, but none react. “We should help her climb,” I offer to no one in particular.</p>\n<p>They chuckle amongst themselves. Another traveler with a stick points it at me. “Young Thora. You can be forgiven naivety now, but you must learn quickly if you are to make it to the top.” He lowers the stick and plunges it into the fire, embers crackling at the disturbance. “If you stop to help every traveler on the way, they will keep you from your potential. Some are not worth saving.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/08/05/podcastle-903-on-the-shoulders-of-giants/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 902: Godzilla as a Young Man Named Mike</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated PG-13</p>\n<h3>Godzilla as a Young Man Named Mike</h3>\n<p/><p>I remember your mum telling me, after it all went down, that during the lockdowns you washed your hands so often your skin cracked and turned scaly and angry red, but you had to keep going just in case neglecting it killed her.</p>\n<p>It echoed, not much later, when the worst of the pandemic was past, only it wasn’t just your hands. All your skin changed into islands of mottled gray or khaki, building up tire-rubber thick in patches, and turning numb where your body just up and decided to not work the same anymore. It was all part of what you were becoming, whether you liked it or not.</p>\n<p>There were days, fewer and farther between, where she could still see a glimpse her son Michael, the gorgeous boy you used to be: a spill of curls that fell down one side of your brow, a diffident slant to shoulders on a gangly frame, eyes the clear amber of long-steeped tea, that knowing grin. She’d see a ghost of that smile and be transported back through the ages of you, all the way to when you first announced yourself with a wriggle-kick to her womb. Then your grin would slide away as the pain did its thing and the beautiful boy submerged so your new self could rise, wrathful.</p>\n<p>Early on, you spent long hours in the bathtub but your remnant humanity wasn’t built for it. You’d end up with curdled finger pads and stripped of any remaining skin oils to protect you from drying out. You spent months in bed, a place you used to enjoy, and it became a prison. You memorized every crack in the ceiling, watched car headlights migrate across the chalk-white steppes of it. Eventually, you recovered enough to stand for more than a few seconds at a time.</p>\n<p>Well, “recovered” isn’t quite the right word. It was more that you decided to ignore the screams of your body because the alternative was never getting out of bed ever again.</p>\n<p>You mentioned the day you tottered and stooped along to the kitchen in your Mum’s tenement apartment and how you’d never forget her look of <i>who is this invading my home?</i> before she realized it was you, but taller, and more, well . . . lizardy, and she rushed over to fit herself into the places she knew were strong enough to be hugged. You towered over her.</p>\n<p>Even the hug told you that you were different now, and the likelihood of ever going back to who you used to be dwindled to nothing. So, instead, you tried to look forward.</p>\n<p>When the pandemic had faded from everyone’s collective conscience just enough, our job said we had to come into the central Glasgow office again. Working from home had been okay for you; you’d made it back from your long-term sick leave, even got in a few prescribed exercises over lunch breaks. It wasn’t always the best and you hated being on top of your mum all the time but at least you could keep your cool packs in the freezer without some asshat moving them to put in their frozen yogurt.</p>\n<p>None of the managers on the All-Hands call could give a real answer when you asked why going back to the office was mandatory if you got your job done from home? What the difference was if you were assigned tasks lying in bed or sitting in a conference room? Why you should pay out of your own pocket for a commute? How it was better for productivity if everyone caught the same bug going around an open-plan office?</p>\n<p>I totally agreed with you. I mean, I didn’t say anything, and my camera was off, but inside, I agreed. I also knew those arguments weren’t your real hesitation. So did everyone who saw your changes.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/07/29/podcastle-902-godzilla-as-a-young-man-named-mike/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Nothing was left of her kinspeople but blackened corpses littered across the village square. She searched around, with the moths in her gut a panicked swarm, stinging to be let out. Everyone else had been shot on the narrow cobblestone streets. On weak knees, with eyes burning from the lingering smoke, she turned towards the woods, her moths breathless with guilt and relief in equal parts. If Evdokia, the midwife, hadn’t sent her to the herbalist two towns over, she’d be dead too. At the edge of the village, Maria stumbled on Papa-Kostas, shot by the Virgin’s shrine, in a pool of blood.</p>\n<p>Maria sniffled and he raised his head, his eyes unfocused.</p>\n<p>“Maria? Is that you, girl?” Barely a whisper.</p>\n<p>Maria gawked, then nodded. He’d called her <i>just</i> Maria. <i>Not</i> Zavo-Maria. The slur that the villagers had attached to her name had stuck enough that its omission made Maria uncomfortable — as though it made her less <i>and</i> more at the same time.</p>\n<p>“Nazis,” Papa-Kostas managed. “Looking for resistance fighters. We didn’t tell.” A fit of cough. “Evdokia . . . dead too. See to Charon’s supper, girl. Don’t leave us here, stranded.” He raised his right hand, the tips of his first three fingers brought together, and air-crossed her, before his arm fell limp. “May gods old and new bless you, child. Forgive me.” And he spoke no more.</p>\n<p>The Ferryman’s supper. Maria’s moths fluttered all at once. She picked up her skirts and ran into the woods. Dawn hadn’t broken yet. Would she make it on time?</p>\n<p>She ran up the nearby hill and then downwards into the small ravine, to the banks of the creek. Not far from there, the ravine opened up to a deep canyon, its slopes a forest of pines and ancient oaks: the sisters of the Dodona Grove. The creek swelled and joined with more creeks to become Acheron, before the dark depths of the world siphoned its waters beneath the surface. Maria headed away from the Acheron, towards the little hut and the nearby cavern, where the villagers brought their herds every November to outwait the winter’s cold.</p>\n<p>It was safe inside the hut — few people could find it, most of them dead now. Dishes were stacked on a narrow table by the cold hearth, and sacks of grain and buckets for milking the goats at the other side. Maria sat on an old, creaking stool to catch her breath. Her panicked moths had fled her gut and plodded through her blood now, making her dizzy. She took deep breaths to rid her nostrils from the stench of burned flesh, inhaling the scents of curdled goat milk and pinewood. Then of other, unsettling scents, of murky waters and dead tadpoles, and just a whiff of honeysuckle . . .</p>\n<p>The Ferryman’s scent, and the scent of the death that followed his heels.</p>\n<p>Maria sprang to her feet. The supper! She really <i>was</i> zavo, sitting idle while Charon waited. If she angered him, would he forsake the souls of her kin? Would he release the dead upon these lands as punishment? She shook her head until the moths with wings of guilt scattered from her thoughts. No. She’d make sure no such thing would happen, now that Evdokia was gone. She filled a bowl with grain and a cup with wine and placed them on a tray. The moment she opened the door to carry the tray to the riverbank, the stench of stagnant waters and rotting leaves made the moths in her heart stand absolutely still. Just before dawn’s first light, the shade of flowing robes on a skeletal form boarded the rising fog over the creek — fog shaped as a boat. But he boarded alone. Alone? Without the souls of her people? Would <i>they</i> return to haunt <i>her</i>, for failing them? What had she done wrong?</p>\n<p>The coins! She’d forgotten about the coins!</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/07/22/podcastle-901-moths-in-a-fluttering-heart/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 900: Sour Fruit</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated PG-13</p>\n<h3>Sour Fruit</h3>\n<p/><p>The large open field was encircled by forest. Its sandy soil was home to scrubby flowers and grasses whose spindly roots reached deep into the loose ground, teeming with ants for whom the medium was perfect. Not quite in the middle was an old apple tree, twisting up from the ground, this way and that. Short and stubby. The fruit it produced was the sour, small sort that puckered the mouth with every bite. The sort that farmers had been trying to breed out of existence for countless generations. Yet, it lived. Thrived, even, in the clearing in the middle of the woods.</p>\n<p>Fish would run to it when the lake grew too loud. Snuggling herself inside its crooked roots, stretching her small hand upwards to poke into the hole that had rotted through the middle of the old tree, watching the sun as it came through her fingertips.</p>\n<p>The tree was the one place on the peninsula where the lake would soften.</p>\n<p>It was still there — the constant shush-shush of waves on rock was inescapable — but it faded into the background.</p>\n<p>It was a mild day in late September when Fish found the first gift. That’s how she thought of them. Gifts.</p>\n<p>Jorgi had been teasing her all through the school day, pelting her with bits of chalk until the lake rushed into her ears, drowning out Teacher’s lecture on Pythagoras. She ran as soon as the bell on Teacher’s desk was rung. Out across the browning prairie grass to the twisted pine trail, over the rocks and into the field.</p>\n<p>She cried to the tree, letting all her frustration and childish hatred out with each salty tear. Calmer, she reached up into the rotten hole and her fingers found paper.</p>\n<p>There was no real explanation for why a bag of flour sat in the rotted-out crook of the old tree, but Fish knew immediately that it had been left for her. She stood to pull the first gift close to her chest, crinkling the paper and sending small puffs of white out from the corners. It would get on her shirt, and Mama would be cross, but it didn’t matter. Finding the treasure had lifted the weight of the day and quieted the lake enough that she could go home.</p>\n<p>Once she got there, though, the flour became a problem. If she were to bring it inside, surely Mama would find it, take it from her, use it in her dry, crusty bread. The kind that hurt Fish’s mouth.</p>\n<p>She stood outside the kitchen door, listening to the sounds of bustle on its other side for a full five minutes before deciding. She was the last one in that evening, and there would be no reason for her parents to leave until the next morning. She would leave it outside on the porch, wake early, be the first one out the door in time to retrieve it in the morning, and find a safer, secret space to keep it, far from Mama’s kitchen.</p>\n<p>Papa barked when she came in. Where had she been, why had she not been helping Mama, she was a useless girl. Mama nodded along, as though she agreed. As though she wanted Fish underfoot in the afternoons. As though she wasn’t always shooing her away to run in the woods.</p>\n<p>Fish said nothing, looking chagrined and soulful so that Papa felt his words held weight. She choked down Mama’s cooking, did her small chores, and went to bed.</p>\n<p>She woke before the light. There was no clock to wake her, just the anticipation of being the first up. She crept down the stairs, flashlight clutched in hand, avoided the creaky floorboards, and slowly eased the kitchen door open. Just a crack. Just wide enough for her to squeeze through.</p>\n<p>Her heart caught.</p>\n<p>Even in the limited beam of her small light she could see the mess on the porch. The flour had been kicked over.</p>\n<p>The lake rushed in, drowning out everything around her. Drowning out the angry keen that burst unbidden out of her throat.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/07/15/podcastle-900-sour-fruit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Mabel, 33</h2>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>The safety I feel with Finn means the sex we have feels safe, too, and we can explore freely</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>When Finn and I met on a dating app last year, I was enjoying being single. So when he asked me to be his girlfriend one month in, I wasn’t sure at first. But I was sure about him, and I liked how he’d phrased it (“I know you’re having fun, and I don’t want to put pressure on you”), with my freedom being a positive thing.</p>\n<p>My ex-boyfriend was jealous and controlling and wanted to keep me in a box. He felt threatened that I had exes and had had sex with others. He hated me staying out late and questioned why I put on nice underwear for work, suspecting that must mean I was sleeping with a colleague. So it was refreshing to be with someone who celebrated my sexuality.</p>\n<p>The safety I feel with Finn means the sex we have feels safe, too, and we can explore freely. We experiment with power dynamics, and I find the danger exciting, but it never feels like Finn is dominant in an uncaring way. He once said, “I don’t want to act too dominant in case you think I don’t love you,” which I thought was very romantic.</p>\n<p>I’ve heard that there are two ways of experiencing desire. Some people can just be doing the washing up and want to have sex – that’s Finn. The other is becoming turned on once you start being intimate – that’s me. So Finn is usually the one to initiate sex, but I always want it. He’s playful – he’ll put his hands down my pants when we’re out! He once fingered me in a car while driving down a winding road, and when cyclists overtook us, it was thrilling.</p>\n<p>We’ve both said past relationships were things that just happened to us, whereas we’ve chosen each other. It has surprised us both how open we are. When we were on holiday last year, we spent the whole time talking about how lucky we are.</p>\n<p>We’re about to move in together, and I can’t wait to do boring, domestic, adult things with him all the time. Yesterday, we went to the butcher and B&amp;Q, and even that was fun. When I’m with Finn, everything feels like an adventure.</p>\n<h2>Finn, 33</h2>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Our sex life has become more adventurous. We’ve had sex in the sea, in a field, in a photo booth</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>I wanted a break from dating apps and was about to delete them when I started speaking to Mabel. After our first date, we went back to hers and had great sex, but we had to be quiet because her flatmate was next door, so Mabel covered my mouth with her hand. Usually, she’s quite vocal, which turns me on.</p>\n<p>On our second date, I cooked for her at mine, which felt like a big gesture. I was seeing other people casually, but it felt different with Mabel; it was so easy. Even though I wanted to say, “Let’s see each other loads,” we played it cool.</p>\n<p>We have sex every time we see each other, about four times a week, which hasn’t decreased since we’ve been together. Our sex life has become more adventurous, and we’ve done things neither of us has done before. We’ve had sex in the sea, in a field, in a photo booth. I used to worry about someone seeing us, and Mabel would tease me about being cautious, but now I suggest it too.</p>\n<p>In previous relationships, even if the sex was good, I’d doubt how compatible we were. I’d seek novelty, and I still do, but Mabel offers me that. We’ve settled into more of a routine, but it still feels exciting. Maybe I’ve worked out what I want, or it could be our relationship is more interesting than my previous ones.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/24/this-is-how-we-do-it-doing-washing-up-want-sex-thats-my-boyfriend\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I don’t remember where I was when my <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tiktok\">TikTok</a> feed showed me a video of a woman holding her stillborn baby, but I remember how I felt. At first, it appeared like any other video of a woman holding a newborn. It was tightly wrapped in blankets while she cradled it in her arms. She was crying, but so are most of the women in these post-birth videos. It wasn’t until I read the caption that I realised what I was looking at. Her baby had been delivered at 23 weeks. I was 22 weeks pregnant. I felt doomed.</p>\n<p>My social media algorithms knew I was pregnant before family, friends or my GP. Within 24-hours, they were transforming my feeds. On Instagram and TikTok, I would scroll through videos of women recording themselves as they took pregnancy tests, just as I had done. I “liked”, “saved”, and “shared” the content, feeding the machine, showing it that this is how it could hold my attention, compelling it to send me more. So it did. But it wasn’t long before the joy of those early videos started to transform into something dark.</p>\n<p>The algorithm began to deliver content about the things you fear the most while pregnant: “storytimes” about miscarriages; people sharing what happened to them and, harrowingly, filming themselves as they received the news that their baby had no heartbeat. Next came videos about birth disfigurements, those found by medical professionals early on, and those that were missed until the baby’s birth.</p>\n<p>One night, after a before-bed scroll delivered me a video of a woman who filmed her near-death childbirth experience, I uninstalled the apps through tears. But they were soon reinstalled, when the needs of work, friendships and habit dictated they must be. I tried blocking the content I didn’t want to see, but it made little difference.</p>\n<p>On TikTok, there are more than 300,000 videos tagged under “miscarriage”, and a further 260,000 under “miscarriageawareness”. One video with the caption “live footage of me finding out I had miscarried” has almost half a million views. Another showing a woman giving birth to a stillborn baby has just under five million.</p>\n<p>In another context, before I was pregnant, I would have found the content barrier-breaking and important. I don’t think the individuals who share such vulnerable moments are doing anything wrong. For the right person, it could be a lifeline. But it didn’t feel right in the feed of someone who had inadvertently signalled to the algorithm that they were having a baby.</p>\n<p>When I talk about this experience with others who were pregnant at the same time as me, I am met with knowing nods and stories that match my own. I hear about how they were also served up personalised doses of fear, and how the algorithms evolved to target the things specific to them. Our experiences feel like a radicalisation, as normal worries were driven to new heights by a barrage of content that became more and more extreme. This is pregnancy and motherhood in 2025.</p>\n<p>“There are supportive posts, and then there are things so extreme and distressing, I don’t want to repeat them,” says Cherelle Mukoko, who is eight months pregnant. Mukoko mostly sees this content on Facebook and Instagram. She used to see it on TikTok as well, before she deleted the app. “My eldest is four. During that pregnancy, I came across upsetting posts on social media, some of them quite close to home, but this time it seems worse. The content feels more graphic and harder to escape.”</p>\n<p>Mukoko, 35, who is a woman of colour, has found that she is specifically shown content around the treatment of Black women in pregnancy. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/apr/08/black-women-in-england-suffer-more-serious-birth-complications-analysis-finds\">An analysis of NHS data in 2024</a> found that Black women are up to six times more likely to experience severe complications during a hospital delivery than their white counterparts. “That hasn’t been my reality, but it does make me go into every appointment more cautious and on edge, wondering how I’ll be treated,” she says.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/03/i-felt-doomed-social-media-guessed-i-was-pregnant-my-feed-soon-grew-horrifying\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Tina Woods was sitting in a taxi when the dancing bug bit. It was after midnight and she and two friends were heading home from another friend’s 60th birthday party. South-west London rolled past the window. They had had a bit to drink. As they passed Le Fez nightclub, they realised they didn’t want to go home. “We were like: let’s go dancing before we go to bed,” she says.</p>\n<p>Woods, then 56, had gone clubbing in her 20s, but on Le Fez’s dancefloor, as her body caught the beat, she had “an epiphany moment”, a shock of pure euphoria: “The joy I felt – the mind, body and soul connection – was like a lightning bolt.” She knew then that “dancing and music were going to be a bigger part of my life than I’d ever thought”.</p>\n<p>Woods, who lives in London but grew up in Montreal, Canada, has always been active. She loves travelling, mountain climbing and Zumba. But now she has started clubbing – with friends or with Nick, her husband of nearly 30<strong> </strong>years.</p>\n<p>“I started to get into the softer end of techno – melodic techno, tech house,” she says. “I loved the beat, the bass line – Afrobeats and a Latin vibe. I realised that my brain was responding to that music in a way that was incredibly energising. It made me feel alive.”</p>\n<p>Woods had studied genetics at Cornell university in Ithaca, New York. Her first job, after moving to London in her early 20s, was as a medical writer for a company that made training films for doctors. She worked in healthcare until she was 53 and is now a consultant specialising in health technology in relation to longevity; she has published a book on how to live longer with AI.</p>\n<p>In the joy she felt on the dancefloor, she began to see a connection to her work. “I’m trying to bring scientific rigour and understanding into this environment of dance and the neurochemistry of music to understand what promotes health and wellbeing – and, linked to that, what could delay the ageing process,” she says.</p>\n<p>Since she was 56, she has tested her biological age and says she is getting younger. At 60, one test put her at 35. Dancing has brought new, intergenerational friendships, such as with Yukari, an aspiring DJ Woods met on the dancefloor while in Japan at a conference.</p>\n<p>However, when she was 59, pain from bunions in her feet reached unbearable levels. The problem was so severe that some of Woods’s toes became dislocated. She decided to undergo surgery. “I was thinking: what’s important in my life? For me, that’s being mobile and energetic.” She knew the surgery would necessitate four to six months of recovery.</p>\n<p>“How am I going to cope?” thought Woods, who has trouble relaxing. “But there’s always a positive side, if you look for it. I thought: I’ll learn to mix music.” Woods underwent surgery in December 2023, a week before Christmas – for which her three sons gave her a present of DJ equipment. The learning process was under way.</p>\n<p>One night, having recovered her mobility, she and her husband were on their way to a gig in east London when they stopped for a drink at the venue Love Shack. “We kept seeing people coming and going … They showed us this secret room under the railway arches and there’s this huge pulsating party.”</p>\n<p>Woods had found the venue for her DJing debut. She discussed it with Yukari. “We were like: ‘Let’s do a gig,’” Woods says. “ Before we knew it, more than 200 people had signed up.”</p>\n<p>They called their event <a href=\"https://www.longevityrave.world/\">Longevity Rave</a>. Woods now DJs once a month; she has DJed in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami and London. The dancefloor is always a mix of ages. “I’m finding myself again, in a funny sort of way. Psychologically, emotionally, sexually. Everything about who I am as a woman,” she says.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/01/i-had-to-stop-raving-after-bunion-surgery-so-i-became-a-dj-instead\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It improves the muscle adaptation response to the exercise, which leads to growth in size, strength and lactate tolerance.</p>\n    <p>That said, Crouse adds, if you’re just a casual gym-goer (doing resistance training three or four times a week), it’s better to focus on consuming three balanced meals in the day, and choosing healthy snacks, before you start stressing too much about when you consume things. “Go back to the basics of carbs, protein and veggies on your breakfast, lunch and dinner plates first,” she says.</p>\n    <p>And if you do like to have a snack after working out, it doesn’t need to be a protein shake. “A large glass of milk has really high protein content, as do those chicken satay skewers that you often get in a meal deal,” says Crouse. “Having something like a chocolate milkshake, which contains both carbs and protein, is good. Co-ingestion of carbohydrates and protein leads to greater net muscle protein synthesis.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/01/is-it-true-that-you-should-eat-protein-after-workouts-to-see-muscle-gains\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>I was 18 when I tried a menstrual cup for the first time. I was studying at the University of Edinburgh and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/nov/24/scotland-becomes-first-nation-to-provide-free-period-products-for-all\">Scotland had just become the first country in the world to make period products free</a> to those who need them. The university health service was offering menstrual cups alongside the usual sanitary pads and tampons. I picked one up out of curiosity and because I just couldn’t resist a freebie.</p>\n    <p>I was used to spending £10 to £15 a month on period products, more if I was caught short and had to do a panicked dash to an overpriced off-licence. As an eco-conscious teenager I already bought non-applicator tampons but often wore a security sanitary liner underneath. It was an attempt to keep the endless worry of heavy periods at bay: will I leak, run out of supplies, or find a clean loo in time? Even so, I leaked more often than I cared to admit.</p>\n    <p>When I first heard about menstrual cups, I was sceptical. They sounded fiddly, messy and invasive; after trying one, I realised it wasn’t nearly as complicated as I imagined. It took a couple of attempts to work out how to insert it properly but, once I did, there was no going back.</p>\n    <p>Nearly five years later, my cup goes everywhere with me. These days I use a collapsible version, which can be folded down into a case the size of a tealight. It slips easily into my bag –simple and discreet. After my period ends, I use a cleaning pot to sterilise it. I fill the pot with water, place the cup inside and pop it into the microwave. A few minutes later, it’s clean and ready for the next cycle. Practical, if not particularly glamorous.</p>\n    <p>The benefits are huge. I save at least £120 a year, avoid the dryness and bulk of tampons or sanitary pads, and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/28/toxic-pesticide-levels-found-in-tampons-40-times-higher-than-legal-limit-for-water\"> steer clear of the toxic chemicals that are common in many tampons</a>. Menstrual cups are made from medical-grade silicone, last for years and feel far gentler on my body. My cramps have also reduced since using a cup.</p>\n    <p>I am glad to avoid the extraordinary amount of plastic, packaging and waste that comes with using disposable products, too. Using a menstrual cup has become an effortless, sustainable choice I can make every month.</p>\n    <p>They are also convenient. I empty my cup every morning and evening at home, and that is it. No more stuffing supplies into every bag I own. It has never leaked, even on heavy days, and travelling is much easier. On a recent surfing trip to Morocco, where tampons were hard to find, the cup was a lifesaver.</p>\n    <p>The only thing I miss is being able to help someone in a pinch. More than once, someone in a public bathroom has asked if I have a spare tampon, and I have had to say no. But switching to a menstrual cup has turned my once stressful period into something so simple that I hardly notice it, and I haven’t looked back since.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/01/the-one-change-that-worked-i-got-a-period-cup-and-saved-120-a-year\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He glanced at Gyn, and wondered where she was in her head, because she certainly wasn’t here, with him, getting married.</p>\n<p>I knew none of this, watching my best friend take the leap. Huge. Maybe the hugest leap of any guy’s life. When we became friends, working at The Schuss, he didn’t know Gyn. We were just guys, with a shared love of adrenalin. They hired me to rent the e-bikes. He handled kayaks in the summer, skis in the winter. In our spare time, we liked to test our product outside. Not bad, getting paid to play with the latest toys.</p>\n<p>TJ met Gyn at my wedding. Elise and I had hired Gyn to tend bar. The deejays were amping up the tempo for the guests already drunk enough to hit the dance floor when TJ approached the bar.</p>\n<p>Gyn was standing behind the bar, tucked into the hillside beneath a canopy of Doug fir branches.</p>\n<p>“Bushmills,” TJ said.</p>\n<p>The bartender looked like a character in one of those Japanese hentai comics, the T&amp;A wing of manga. Long, straight black hair. Wide eyes. Creamy skin. A stiff smile. Ample spillage from the lip of her bodice. She looked like someone surprised to find herself in the camera’s flash.</p>\n<p>“Neat?” Gyn asked.</p>\n<p>“Rocks, please.”</p>\n<p>“Neat,” Gyn said, when she handed him his glass.</p>\n<p>“You’re not very good at this, are you?” TJ said. “First time?”</p>\n<p>“Friend of Elise,” she said. “What do you mean, not very good?”</p>\n<p>“You asked if I wanted it <i>neat</i>. I said <i>rocks</i>. You gave me <i>neat</i>. You weren’t paying attention.”</p>\n<p>She looked like she was going to cry.</p>\n<p>“Look,” he said, “maybe you should be a … model. Or something. Not everybody’s cut out to pour booze.”</p>\n<p>“Model for what?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know. Van Gogh?”</p>\n<p>She looked confused. TJ laughed. He took his drink and turned away from the bar and walked two paces and turned around and stared back. She wasn’t very bright, but she was staring at him. He went back and gave her his card. She looked at it, then at him, unsure. “I don’t ski,” she said.</p>\n<p>“We could go <i>out</i>?” he said, by way of explanation. “If you call me? We could talk … <i>about </i>skis?”</p>\n<p>After that exchange, TJ didn’t think about her. He didn’t recognize the number when she called. Their courtship had some holes in it.</p>\n<p>On their first date, they got sushi. She had never had it before. When he told her it was raw fish wrapped in seaweed, her pale skin took on a green hue. She ate the rice. Slowly.</p>\n<p>She mentioned that her mother worked for many years as a palm tree at a Galveston tiki bar, walking around with fronds on her head, smiling at people and their umbrella drinks.</p>\n<p>“Really?” TJ said. “That’s … fun.”</p>\n<p>She looked at him, smiled, then looked away as if at only something she could see.</p>\n<p>He mentioned that his own mother died in childbirth, and his dad ran an auto repair shop in Scotts Bluff. She looked confused.</p>\n<p>“Nebraska?”</p>\n<p>“Oh,” she said. “Sure.”</p>\n<p>He wasn’t sure she knew what Nebraska was, so didn’t pursue it. Instead he told her his dad liked to think he liked to fly fish, although he rarely went. He just went to Cabella’s and bought the gear. TJ liked mountains, and moved to Summit County after high school.</p>\n<p>“Easier to catch,” he said.</p>\n<p>She didn’t get it.</p>\n<p>“Mountains? Easier to catch,” he said, dissecting his wit like he was gutting a trout. “Easier than fish? With a dry fly?”</p>\n<p>For Gyn, it would’ve been a good opportunity to mention that her father wanted to be a stand-up comedian. He was wanting it in a tiki bar when he met her mother and ordered more mai tais than any comedian should consume while attempting to be humorous. Her mother married him anyway, perhaps attributing his excess to nerves.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://theshortstory.co.uk/short-story-broke-broken-broker-by-stuart-watson/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 915: The Confessionist</h2>\n<h3>The Confessionist</h3>\n<p>Vemund pauses, standing on the wet sidewalk. Underneath the overcast sky, twilight stretches through the sloping city. Wealth lives here, in sterile houses carefully hidden behind designer bushes and fences. Not even petrichor feels natural this far across the megapolis. No stench permeates the air, no visible evidence of human misery, although Vemund knows from experience these walls hide just as many vile actions as the paperthin constructs at the other end of civilization.</p>\n<p>The evening is chill enough that Vemund sees his breaths as he exhales. It fits this appointment, in a way; all day he’s been followed by a lingering impression that he’s about to trade his soul away. For almost twenty years, he’s worked as a confessionist. The only job he could ever take, young and untrained, but already buried under unbearable debt. Society needs you, they told him at recruitment. <i>You’d be doing the world a favor</i>. Vemund snorts quietly to himself. The only favor he’s been doing has been to ease abject consciences. Except for the children; sometimes he confesses children and their pain is almost always inflicted by others. They were all worth it, though rare enough to forget how it feels to actually help someone instead of simply dampening the guilt bred by one’s actions, consequences intended or not.</p>\n<p/><p>The house up ahead sits in heavy gray, made of dull steel and concrete and glass, as ashen as the rest of the buildings around it. Cutting through the front garden, the path to his latest client winds in a bend of stone slabs. This one had specifically requested him, even offered a hefty payment for the service.</p>\n<p>His grip tightens. The squeak of his briefcase handle gets lost in the whoosh of the hightrain flying up above.</p>\n<p>The entire trip here, he’s been wondering how much of an abomination he’d have to take on for the offered honorarium. He hasn’t wavered, though. Can’t. Not when it means he can forgo the fifty or so confessions he’d need to finally settle his score.</p>\n<p>He’d be free. He <i>will</i> be free, after this.</p>\n<p>But will he be able to carry it? Whatever the monster in this house did, Vemund will have to watch it, assimilate its effects, and live with them forever. With a trembling hand, he touches the back of his shaved head, over the place where the neural implant sits.</p>\n<p>“Last one,” he whispers, and steps forward.</p>\n<p>A smiling man answers the door at the first ring. Medium build, a little shorter than Vemund, clean shaven. Wearing a dark sweater, the same gray of the concrete and the sky and the house he occupies.</p>\n<p>“Hi, I’m Obe. Please, come in.”</p>\n<p>Obe keeps smiling and Vemund shudders. He’s never been afraid before.</p>\n<p>After removing his shoes and coat, Vemund follows further inside. When instructed, he sits at the dining table. Its glass surface shines pristine, just like everything else in this place. The space is wide and open, any separation made from transparent material. No color, no personal touch whatsoever.</p>\n<p>Even the tray with tea that Obe sets on the table permeates sameness. While he pours and serves, Vemund retrieves his tools from the briefcase. He sets them down on a paper pad between them after Obe takes the opposite seat. He’s dropped his façade of hospitality, instead studying the items with an intensity Vemund’s rarely seen before.</p>\n<p>“The pulsers” —Vemund begins the requisite explanation, opening the small box to reveal the round neuro-actuators— “go onto your temples. They—”</p>\n<p>“I’ve done this before. They modify the neural connections forming the memory that I write down.” Obe picks up the pen, twists it around. “With this thing: coated in enough sensors to read my entire mind.”</p>\n<p>Vemund swallows, loud enough in the silence that Obe notices. He leans over the table slightly.</p>\n<p>“Your implant will absorb my experience as if it were your own, and what remains will be distant for me. Like a scar over a healed wound.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2023/11/16/escape-pod-915-the-confessionist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 914: #buttonsinweirdplaces (Part 2 of 2)</h2>\n<h3>#buttonsinweirdplaces (Part 2 of 2)</h3>\n<p>(… Continued from Part 1)</p>\n<p>The news the following morning was bad. An explosion in the middle of a market-square in Libya had been variously blamed upon a suicide-bomber and upon over-zealous security forces trying to control crowd trouble. The truth of it made little difference to the eighty who’d died, the hundreds left broken in the aftermath. Tensions had flared on the Mexican/American border after a young man fell to his death attempting to climb the wall to reach the USA. In Ireland, the names of old republican and nationalist groupings had been resurrected, wielded anew by figures wearing balaclavas and holding assault rifles.</p>\n<p>Cho switched off the car radio. Sometimes it seemed the world was intent on tearing itself to pieces, and she needed to focus on the plan.</p>\n<p>She’d travelled north to the Ma On Shan Country Park. Her predictions suggested there would be a button near the top of one of the remoter peaks. If it was there, it not only helped confirm her theory, it also meant she could experiment without any interruptions – something impossible part-way up a skyscraper.</p>\n<p>It took her two hours to hike to the location. The GPS on her phone identified the spot rapidly enough, twenty metres down a steep, scrubby slope. The terrain had looked rough on the maps, and she’d brought ropes to rappel to it. After a couple of minutes of scraping through the brush and grass clinging to the side of the hill she found it, right where it was supposed to be.</p>\n<p>Crucially, she also had phone signal. She’d worried there might be none so far from the city. She posted a message in the chat group she’d set up to say she was ready. Three of the academics that Dr Suresh had found from his contacts around the world were already there, standing by their buttons: one in Toronto, one near Lima, the third a few miles outside Edinburgh. It was the middle of the night in the Americas, but from their jokey messages, they all appeared to be in a good mood. Once Suresh had explained what they were attempting, they’d been happy to help. <i>A lot of people are looking for answers, right now</i>, he’d explained.</p>\n<p>The fifth member of their team – Dr Mbenzi, a Linguistics Professor in Nairobi – came on line in an explosion of emojis and exclamation marks, and they were ready. Cho had thrown together a rough-and-ready app to tell them when to press and when to release their buttons, its simple display consisting of a light that flashed green for <i>now</i>. The app synched to an internet clock so there was no problem with communications lag, and it also captured the tones produced by the buttons. She’d specified a careful sequence of presses, repeated five times so she could spot patterns and filter out random effects from people clicking elsewhere in the world.</p>\n<p>The buttons were still attracting a lot of attention. Social media occasionally trended with a #pressthebuttons hashtag, encouraging everyone to press as frequently as possible in the belief that numbers were somehow being tallied up. Countervailing tags trended in response – #donotpressthebuttons – from those who believed the whole thing was sinister, a conspiracy, some unspecified evil. Some saw pressing the buttons – or not pressing them – as a religious duty, an act of devotion. Others, for reasons she didn’t get, wanted to destroy them. The switches were tough, but acid or hot-enough flame, it turned out, ruined them well enough.</p>\n<p>The countdown on the app reached zero, the light turned green, and Cho and her helpers began to press their buttons.</p>\n<p/><p>The following morning, she sat upon a bench outside the university, waiting for Dr Suresh to pass by. She breathed in the early-morning warmth of the summer’s day, enjoying the peace of it. The rising sun made the air glow, dissipating some of the weariness that filled her. The bitter coffee she’d bought was helping a little, too. She normally preferred tea but right then needed something stronger.</p>\n<p>“Cho, what are you doing here?”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2023/11/09/escape-pod-914-buttonsinweirdplaces-part-2-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 913: #buttonsinweirdplaces (Part 1 of 2)</h2>\n<h3>#buttonsinweirdplaces (Part 1 of 2)</h3>\n<p>The buttons started to appear on the last day of April, 2022.</p>\n<p>A six-year-old boy from Nairobi, Jomi Mbenzi, was perhaps the first to spot one. Dawdling along behind his mother, her swaying yellow-orange dress and the bag of melons and paw-paws she carried, his attention was caught by the shiny button set in the stone of one of the city’s office buildings. He squatted to study it. Strange that it was so low-down, right near the ground. In his experience, switches – and all other interesting aspects of the adult world – were kept high-up, out of reach, but here was this button set right where he could get at it. He was sure it hadn’t been there an hour ago when they walked down the same road toward the fruit market. Ground-level was his domain and he noticed everything there, while the confusing, noisy grown-up world went on around him and above him.</p>\n<p>There was no writing on or near the button, nothing to suggest what its purpose might be. Buttons often had words on them to say what they did, words he rarely understood. Or else, they had warnings nearby telling you not, under any circumstances, to press – a fact which always struck him as odd. Why have a button you couldn’t press?</p>\n<p>A bus roared past on the road, washing a blast of hot, smoky air over Jomi. He paid it no attention. Instead, he did what any child in that situation would do. He reached out with his soft finger and touched the button. The metal ring around it was hot from the rays of the sun, but the button itself – black, smooth and invitingly recessed – was surprisingly cool.</p>\n<p>It clicked very faintly when he pressed it, and there was a brief musical note from somewhere, but nothing else happened. No alarms sounded, and no lights flashed. The button sprang back out when he released it, as if he hadn’t pressed it at all. He tried again, and then a third time. Each time, the same tone played.</p>\n<p>“Jomi! What are you doing back there? I told you to stay near me.” His mother called from up the street, her bags on the floor and her hands on her hips as she studied him disapprovingly. “What have you found now? Whatever it is, leave it alone and come away at once.”</p>\n<p>“It’s nothing,” he called. “A button.”</p>\n<p>“A button?” His mother sounded worried, as if buttons and the pressing of them were always bad things. “Don’t you go touching it, now. Come away, it’s time we were home.”</p>\n<p>Jomi stood. The button wasn’t so interesting after all. It didn’t do anything. He turned to run to catch up with his mother.</p>\n<p/><p>The first social media posting about the buttons came twelve minutes later from Cho Li Han, a postgrad student supplementing her income by cleaning the skyscrapers of Hong Kong. Dangling by ropes three hundred metres in the air, she came across one on the glass exterior of the headquarters of the Cathay Pearl Bank.</p>\n<p>She paused to consider it, tilting her head as she tried to make sense of its existence. The exterior of the building was a flawless wall of glass, and their supervisor, the perpetually angry Mrs Fong, had given them clear instructions to remove any stain. <i>An unblemished façade is very important to the bank’s public image.</i> Someone must have put the button there for a reason, but it made little sense. None of the windows opened so high up, meaning only a person climbing on the outside could press the button. But it couldn’t <i>do</i> anything, unless wires had been run through the glass, and why would anyone do that?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2023/11/02/escape-pod-913-buttonsinweirdplaces-part-1-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Doing so can close your mind to alternative plans if you <i>think</i> you see what you’re destined to do.</p>\n<p>It was a hard rule for me to follow, especially when my client was half an hour late. It left me ample time to explore the storage facility, but apart from noting a security camera at the entrance, there wasn’t much to see: five lanes of asphalt with plowed snow mounds melting in the corners. Along both sides were rows of bright green roll-up doors matching the color of the City-Store logo. Many were still embedded behind packed snow.</p>\n<p>The key card vending machine near the front had a listing of which storage pods were free. The crime-scene pod was unavailable, but I was more interested in the pods surrounding it. They were already owned. By who? By me? It was best that I couldn’t tell. This was where the don’t-look-for-evidence rule came into play.</p>\n<p/><p>A single Drifter car pulled into the row and parked in front of the crime-scene pod. Her headlights glared on the green door like stage lights. I was surprised to see only the driver; I’d have thought she’d have a security detail in light of recent events.</p>\n<p>She rolled down her car window. “Mr. Roper?”</p>\n<p>“Mrs. Lynch?”</p>\n<p>She climbed out.</p>\n<p>Jeans.</p>\n<p>Every photo I’d seen of her showed her in pant suits, but those photos were always alongside congressmen or admirals. It made sense that she would dress down when doing something illegal. Her lined frown was the same as it was before her husband’s death—probably fixed from her decades in national security.</p>\n<p>“It’s a pleasure, ma’am,” I said.</p>\n<p>“I’m sure.” She handed me a manila folder. It was thick. The woman certainly wasn’t a corner-cutter. “It’s this pod here. I own it now, but you can use it for whatever you need.”</p>\n<p>The key was a microchipped card on a retractable lanyard. The wall sensor beeped when she swiped it, and the door came up. Nothing was inside except for a clean cement floor, fresh white walls, and the lingering smell of paint and cleaning chemicals.</p>\n<p>“They already cleaned up?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“I had a team come through as soon as the police released the scene. I didn’t want any reporters seeing it. I trust that won’t be a problem.”</p>\n<p>“Shouldn’t be. Do you still have the key the kidnappers used?”</p>\n<p>She handed me a second microchipped card from her jean pocket, identical to the first. “The police said it’s deactivated.”<br/>\n“That won’t matter. What about the timeline?”</p>\n<p>She nodded toward the folder. “The top file is the one you asked for. The kidnapping lasted about ten hours. They pulled him from his car in the morning, tied him up here, and left him. Then they came back four hours later to take his finger. I expect you to rescue him <i>before</i> that point. I want my husband back whole.”</p>\n<p>“Why did they wait four hours for that?” I asked. “Don’t they normally do that first to prove that they have the hostage?”</p>\n<p>“They were trying to shock me. The first time they called, I told them to either kill him or let him go.”</p>\n<p>“You really said that?”</p>\n<p>“I am not going to betray my country over my personal life, Mr. Roper. Thugs can threaten me all they want, but I can always get another husband. I’ve had four now.”</p>\n<p>“What would you have done if they’d taken your child?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t have a child. You should know that by now.”</p>\n<p>“I do, but if you had?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t. It is an irrelevant question.”</p>\n<p>“Then if you don’t mind me asking, if you care so little, why <i>don’t</i> you just get another husband? You divorce them readily enough. What you’re hiring me to do could put you in far greater trouble than a few leaked state secrets.”</p>\n<p>She shrugged. “I’m fond of this one. I want him back.

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 907: Maintenance Phase</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated PG</p>\n<h3>Maintenance Phase</h3>\n<p>Mary woke in an unfamiliar bed, gasping for breath.</p>\n<p>She recalled the shots, the dancing, the giggling stumble into a stranger’s apartment while they pulled off each other’s dresses. Her internal organs felt cramped up together, as though they were rats fighting for scarce space in the sewers. Her plan <i>was</i> to sneak home later in the night and return to her own form, but instead she’d slept shifted. She groaned and smacked her hand over her eyes.</p>\n<p>“She wakes!” someone yelled from outside the open bedroom door. Her bedmate from last night walked in, red hair in a messy bun and spatula held aloft. “Want pancakes?”</p>\n<p>How long had it been since she had pancakes? Real pancakes, not the almond meal monstrosities her mother made.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, I’d love some,” she croaked. “Just let me, umm, freshen up.”</p>\n<p>“Sure thing, buttercup,” said the other woman, and left humming in the direction of the kitchen.</p>\n<p>Mary grabbed her discarded dress off the floor, slipped into the bathroom, and made sure to lock it behind her. Then she let go of the self-image she’d been clinging to all night.</p>\n<p>She felt a surge of relief as she relinquished the crushing grip her mind held over her body. She looked in the mirror. Gone were the smooth curves of last night, the defined chin, and the dip of shadow at her collar bones. Instead of flowing, her curves rolled, overcame her. She felt skin press against skin where her neck met her chin, and felt the urge to pull her hair forward to cover newly-rounded cheeks.</p>\n<p>The form in the mirror wouldn’t fit into her little red dress. It didn’t fit into any of the clothes she owned.</p>\n<p>She took her first deep breath of the morning — her only deep breath until she made it home — and then set about chiselling her facade back in place.</p>\n<p>Out in the kitchen, sunlight streamed onto a bench covered in flour while the woman mixed something in a large bowl. What was her name again? Kate? She looked up at Mary’s entrance and smiled.</p>\n<p>“Pancakes are warming in the oven. Help yourself. Toppings on the table.”</p>\n<p>Mary grabbed a fork and plate from the table, then pulled open the oven. Inside was a stack at least six high. She pulled two onto her plate. At the table, she drizzled maple syrup sparingly, added a spoonful of strawberries and bananas, and ignored the chocolate spread and cream.</p>\n<p>Kate washed the flour off her hands and came to sit with her at the table, hands curled around a coffee mug. “They were all for you, don’t worry. I already had mine.”</p>\n<p>“It’s okay, I’m not that hungry,” she lied. She was starving, but trying to cram down anything else right now would make her sick.</p>\n<p>Her doctor was worried about vitamin deficiencies and kept telling her to add things to her diet: more greens, red meat, fruit. But she couldn’t figure out how to fit it all in without making herself vomit or making herself bigger.</p>\n<p>She made it through half the serve she dished out for herself before setting her knife and fork down lengthways on the plate — the way she’d been taught to politely indicate that she was done, even though food remained.</p>\n<p>“Um, thank you for that. And last night. But I should . . .”</p>\n<p>“Of course!” said Kate. “Here, let me show you out.”</p>\n<p>Once Mary was out in the hallway, Kate leaned against the frame.</p>\n<p>“I’d like to see you again sometime, if that sounds good to you,” she asked.</p>\n<p>Her smile was bright and cheery, and she had a smudge of chocolate batter on her cheek. But Kate couldn’t see her <i>again</i> because she hadn’t seen her — not really — in their entire evening together. Mary had no desire to repeat that experience, but she also didn’t want this moment to become any more awkward.</p>\n<p>“Um, yeah. Sure. What’s your number?”</p>\n<p>Mary dutifully entered it into her contacts, even though she doubted they’d ever cross paths again.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/09/02/12916/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Through its rock-candy windows, the house scans her figure for any signs of hurt. The witch’s errands in the city make her nervous. And the house, being made of her magic and therefore of the witch, worries along with her that the wrong person might recognize her, or simply <i>think </i>they do. “They say Creoles all look alike,” she’s said, bitter.</p>\n<p>It astounds the house, that the witch could be mistaken for any other but herself. That someone could fail to identify her tightly coiling black hair, her agate eyes, her russet skin as the witch’s, and the witch’s alone.</p>\n<p>Her hair remains neatly tucked under her wrap. In a basket, balanced against her hip, she carries a basket full of linen bags. Flour and sugar. Though her steps are weary, she’s not limping. A successful outing, then.</p>\n<p>Pleased she’s safe, the house opens its front door and rolls out a rug of pie pastry.</p>\n<p>“Thank you, House,” the witch says, and walks in, letting the house close its door behind her.</p>\n<p>Despite the muggy heat that makes the house’s pecan praline shingles stick together, the witch doesn’t roll up her sleeves till she’s set her basket on the single molasses-cake table. With a groan, she lifts her skirt to perch on a stool made of brioche. She pulls off her boots, wriggles her toes in their stockings, and frowns.</p>\n<p>The house flares its brazier in question.</p>\n<p>“Ran into someone I knew once, while I was in the city. Got a decision to make, now.” She grimaces. “I keep thinking we oughta leave New Orleans.” She doesn’t go into why, but from the witch’s dreams, the house already knows. She presses a hand flat to the brioche wall. “Hide for now, yes?”</p>\n<p>It does. It’s made of sugar and magic, after all; and like sugar in a glass of water, it appears to dissolve into nothing, but it’s still there, just too fine to see.</p>\n<p>When the house wakes next, the witch is on its roof, prizing off a pecan praline shingle. Once it’s loose, rum jelly oozes, filling in the naked spot. Though another praline will grow back by morning, the house rattles its tartelette shutters and puffs a clot of meringue from the chimney.</p>\n<p>“Hush, now. I’ve decided.” The witch gives it a pat and plucks a few more pralines. “We’re gonna have some company.”</p>\n<p>Displeased, the house blows out more meringue.</p>\n<p>“Never you mind.”</p>\n<p>The witch scurries down the brioche siding, then strides toward the swamp, where towering cypress trees grow, where sometimes the witch has to hiss the secret words to send away an alligator or cottonmouth. The only words she whispers now are those directing the river where to take the pralines and what they should say when they arrive.</p>\n<p>The house watches anxiously as the witch returns. It knows she can take care of herself — she wouldn’t have been able to create it if she couldn’t — but she also created it to keep her safe.</p>\n<p>And now, she’s inviting strangers to come.</p>\n<p>It could rattle its praline shingles and let some fall on her head, but considering what she’s just taken, the house thinks that’d rather miss the point.</p>\n<p>As she goes inside, the witch pulls calas from the doorframe. Petulant, the house tries to hold it fast, but more rum jelly strings out as it comes free.</p>\n<p>Alternating nibbles and hums, the witch stokes the fire for the oven. “Gonna need something special for our guests. Molasses cake, maybe?”</p>\n<p>Beignets fall from the ceiling.</p>\n<p>“Stop, House,” the witch says, sharp. “I know you’d like to keep me all to yourself, but I’m needed.” Yet her lips pucker, like she’s tasted spoiled jelly.</p>\n<p>It’s a bad night for the witch.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/08/26/podcastle-906-double-episode-the-house-the-witch-and-sugarcane-stalks-and-to-pluck-a-twisted-string/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>On a video call from his Gothenburg apartment, Jens Lekman is contemplating the 132 weddings at which he has performed. “When you play a normal show, everything follows a schedule. At a wedding, you never know if you’re going to get punched by someone’s uncle or go skinny dipping with the couple.” He pauses. “And that’s what I like: putting myself in weird, awkward situations.”</p>\n<p>These include passing out inside a large but poorly ventilated wedding cake. “It was a small wedding and a lot of stuff was DIY. It wasn’t fun to realise they had forgotten the air holes.” Or a man nearly dying on the dancefloor. “Yeah, that happened, too. But he made it.”</p>\n<p>You may know Lekman as the Swedish indie star whose forlorn love songs can simultaneously break your heart and make you laugh. You may not know that, ever since his 2004 song If You Ever Need a Stranger (To Sing at Your Wedding), he’s been taking requests to do just that. In the beginning, “it was just random people who had heard the song,” he says. But, after an Australian couple shared a video of him playing their wedding in 2013, he was suddenly inundated with requests: “I owe them a lot of gratitude.”</p>\n<p>In retrospect, he’s always been made for the job. Since the early 00s, Jekman has made records defined by wry yet kind-hearted observations about romance and heartbreak. He named his 2012 album I Know What Love Isn’t and, on To Know Your Mission, from 2017, Lekman tells us he just wants to listen to people’s stories. He says the weddings have only underscored this purpose: “I want to be of service to the people who the music means something to.”</p>\n<p>With streaming making it ever harder to make a living from music, playing weddings also became a way to get by financially, as well as providing inspiration for his own songwriting. Lekman recounts a story about the director, John Waters, getting picked up while hitchhiking through the Nevada desert. “What the hell are you doing out here?” the driver asked. Waters replied that it helped provide inspiration. “That’s what the weddings are for me,” Lekman says with a smile.</p>\n<p>His new album is called Songs for Other People’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/weddings\">Weddings</a>, and comes with a novel of the same name written with David Levithan, author of books including Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist. They’ve been friends for 20 years; just before the pandemic, Lekman reached out with an idea for something about “my parallel career as a wedding singer”, having wondered whether it could be a TV show or musical.</p>\n<p>Levithan was all in. “The situation was so tantalising,” he says on the same call. “The idea of writing about these weddings from the point of view of the wedding singer was something I would never have thought of in a million years.”</p>\n<p>The result is a “novel-with-songs” formed from what Lekman calls “a dialogue between me and David about love and relationships”. It tells the story of the romance between a wedding singer called J and his girlfriend V, through 10 weddings at which he performs. Lekman’s accompanying album imagines what happens in between the book’s chapters: he was inspired by albums with stories running through them, such as the Streets’ A Grand Don’t Come For Free and Frank Sinatra’s Watertown.</p>\n<p>The result is “purely fictional but, at the same time, emotionally very much both of ours”, as Levithan puts it. Given that it’s the story of a Swedish singer who plays weddings, it blurs art and life: “I love the confusion – and I don’t think there’s really any way around it,” Lekman says, though they decided to change the main character’s name to J: “In the first chapter I wrote, he was named Jens and that was <i>too</i> confusing,” says Levithan.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/sep/05/youre-either-getting-punched-or-going-skinny-dipping-swedish-indie-star-jens-lekman-on-playing-132-weddings-of-his-fans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Taylor Swift wrote today’s headlines when she was only 17 with her country hit Love Story: “Baby, just say yes!” Now, at 35, she has announced her engagement to Travis Kelce, her American football player partner of two years, who got down on one knee and popped the question. “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married,” she captioned the subsequently staged engagement photos of them in a rose garden. It’s gaudy, it’s cringe, it’s gleefully too much – some even say it makes the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/27/jeff-in-venice-seven-takeaways-from-the-bezos-sanchez-wedding\">Bezos wedding</a> look classy. But it’s perfect and it made me cry.</p>\n<p>When the pop star who has soundtracked your entire adult love life gets engaged, it’s discombobulating. Especially when they are similar in age. Over two decades, Swift has gifted a song for every crush, relationship, situationship, and heartbreak. (I even once plagiarised All Too Well lyrics in a very embarrassing email to an ex-boyfriend; he never did reply to my calling him “so casually cruel in the name of being honest”.)</p>\n<p>But marriage is new territory. Similarly to when a mate tells me they’re getting married, my delight over the news has been chased by bittersweet pangs of change and reflection: what role does Swift’s music play in our romantic lives now?</p>\n<p>This article includes content provided by Instagram. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, <strong>click 'Allow and continue'</strong>.</p>\n<p>She was there for those first flutters and disappointments: a teenager singing out loud the kind of heart-on-sleeve confessions that we kept safely hidden in our diaries (including ones way beyond teenhood). On the one hand, you could slot yourself into the lyrics of the story she’s telling: “Please don’t be in love with someone else,” she hoped in Enchanted. But then, you could go and find out exactly who she is writing about: “Don’t you think I was too young to be messed with?” she asked in Dear John, presumed by many to be about her musician ex John Mayer, which Swift never confirmed or denied. This triggered a global obsession with her relationships, but it has never stopped her writing about them, thank God. Weirdly, she makes dating famous people juicy <i>and</i> relatable.</p>\n<p>When we reached our 20s, ready to bite back at bad boys, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/nov/12/taylor-swift-red-taylors-version-review-republic\">the Red album</a> was the ultimate bible of breakup bangers. Who didn’t fall to the floor screaming “OH!” when I Knew You Were Trouble came on? But she was at her most vulnerable, too, in All Too Well – a power ballad that even now pierces me with the pain of life after short-lived loves. The next album, 1989, was more upbeat but just as scathing: I’m not ashamed to say that, during the peak of Blank Space, I clinked my drained wine glass at a dinner, stood up and announced: “Boys only want love if it’s torture”.</p>\n<p>Then Swift fell in love. Her 2017 album Reputation might have been vengeful, but the industry was the target, because her new boyfriend Joe Alwyn was actually nice! A classically handsome actor (“What can I say? You’re gorgeous”) who scratched her English thesp itch and was happy to shelter with her away from the bullshit (“He built a fire just to keep me warm”). Only someone totally lost in a cloud of sparkly love could then seriously release saccharine odes Me! and London Boy.</p>\n<p>They stayed together for six years and during that time she turned to writing more fictional songs, sometimes with Alwyn, on lockdown albums Folklore and Evermore. Look, I was happy for Swift and enjoyed ditties about the heiress Rebekah Harkness, former owner of Swift’s mansion, having a marvellous time ruining everything … but when she and Alwyn called it quits and she quickly started dating the 1975’s Matty Healy, I was ready for the real-life dramas she essayed between her and Healy in last year’s The Tortured Poets Department.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/aug/28/taylor-swift-engagement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

You are smart and self-aware sexually, but you are failing to truly experience pleasure because you are now (understandably) goal-oriented and fearful. Many people subscribe to the idea there should be one particular pattern to lovemaking – usually the one that starts with a bit of “foreplay” and proceeds to the “main event” of orgasm. Stop thinking like this. Instead, focus on pure pleasure rather than on achieving a climax. Consider the possibility that foreplay is overall a more erotic and pleasurable main event and that orgasmic ecstasy is a very brief, not altogether necessary, exclamation mark at the end. An enormous amount of prolonged pleasure awaits you and your partner if you can approach sexual encounters in this way and be honest about what works for you and what doesn’t.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to</p><a href=\"mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com\">private.lives@theguardian.com</a>(please don’t send attachments).

That’s why it was shocking to watch a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@loveislandusa/video/7524519775029021966?lang=en\">scene</a> in the latest season of Love Island US, in which Chris, a basketball player, asks the woman he’s seeing – Huda, a fitness influencer – if there’s anything he does that bothers her.</p>\n<p>It affects his mood “when something goes wrong, but I’m confused about what happened”, he says.</p>\n<p>What happened was that Chris taught a yoga class to the islanders (as Love Island contestants are called) and had asked everyone except Huda if they had anything to share.</p>\n<p>Huda, sounding sad, says he had skipped over her.</p>\n<p>“I did forget you, you’re right,” Chris says.</p>\n<p>It was a surprisingly mature conversation for Love Island, a show where attractive singles in skimpy swimsuits get locked in a villa for several weeks and try to find love. It can be difficult to approach conflict in a healthy way in such a high-pressure environment: on-air conflict tends to involve contestants shouting over each other and <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@editssssss980/video/7516660961156140310\">hurling insults</a>.</p>\n<p>So what does <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/feb/15/how-to-keep-love-alive-when-you-fight-argue\">healthy conflict</a> actually look like, and how do you practice it? We asked experts about how to approach conflict with romantic partners, family members and co-workers. Spoiler: the advice applies in basically any situation. It might even work on Love Island.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Is conflict actually good for us?</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>The first thing to know about conflict is that it should not be avoided.</p>\n<p>“Conflict is normal and healthy,” says <a href=\"https://relationshipsuite.com/about-rachel-moheban-wachtel-lcsw/\">Rachel Moheban Wachtel</a>, a licensed clinical social worker in New York who has worked extensively with couples. Conflict can be essential to deepening intimacy, understanding and connection, she says.</p>\n<p>If she gets mad at her husband, and he notices her reaction is disproportionate to the situation – which happens all the time with couples – “it’s an opportunity for him to learn what’s going on with me”, she explains. “It’s learning what each other’s triggers are.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps counterintuitively, if you don’t have any conflicts in your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/relationships\">relationship</a>, “then you have to worry”, she says.</p>\n<p>Disagreements can also teach us about ourselves, says Dr Sara Corse, chief clinical officer at the Council for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/relationships\">Relationships</a> in Philadelphia.</p>\n<p>“We think we know what we think and feel, and we think we know what other people think and feel, but we’re often wrong,” she says. Having a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/aug/31/how-to-say-the-unsayable-10-ways-to-approach-a-sensitive-daunting-conversation\">difficult conversation</a> can help us clarify or evolve our own views on a topic. (In my own relationship, for example, conflict has taught me a great deal about how to properly load a dishwasher. Apparently you don’t just toss in dishes at random and hope for the best.)</p>\n<p>Dr Amy Gallo, the author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/getting-along-how-to-work-with-anyone-even-difficult-people-amy-gallo/18058151\">Getting Along: How to Work With Anyone (Even Difficult People)</a> and contributing editor to the Harvard Business Review, says conflict is her “favorite topic”.</p>\n<p>“People assume that, as a conflict expert, I get brought into organizations to help them deal with too much conflict. It’s the exact opposite,” she says. “Ninety-nine percent of the time, what I’m helping leaders and organizations do is have more conflict.”</p>\n<p>Conflict leads to better work outcomes and stronger relationships within an organization, Gallo says, because it leads to “a more inclusive environment where people feel like there’s psychological safety. They can say what’s on their minds and disagree with the people around them because that’s a normal thing.”</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Why do we find conflict so challenging?</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>If conflict is so great, why are so many people uncomfortable with it?</p>\n<p>Many of us are socialized to avoid conflict, Gallo says. As a result, people can fear that disagreement is a sign that something has gone wrong, or that it signals to others that they are a difficult person.</p>\n<p>“We are taught over and over again that conflict is incredibly difficult, negative and destructive,” Gallo says. “Very rarely are we given the message that it’s normal to disagree, and differences of opinion make a team stronger.”</p>\n<p>Still, it’s important to not go overboard in our confrontations.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/aug/25/healthy-conflict-resolution-relationships\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>A maths lecturer, convinced his wife is cheating, will not check the CCTV footage that might confirm his fears but instead keeps a private tally of the number of pubic hairs she sheds in her underwear. One hair is “OK, acceptable”, more is evidence that she has been “having it off”, he says, unaware that he uses these delusions of her infidelity to protect himself from the dangers of intimacy. A high-flying Fulbright scholar becomes a sex worker to avenge the father she hates. An ex-nun discovers that her decades of religious seclusion were driven by an unconscious fear of pregnancy. A troubled young woman, seeking redress for her psychological losses, steals large sums of money that she will never spend.</p>\n<p>In Love’s Labour, the London-based, American-born psychoanalyst Stephen Grosz offers an antidote to the pat, sanitised love stories we absorb through romcoms, reality TV shows and other popular culture. Often, he writes, “easy stories obscure the hard ones”, and the hard ones are most true. “I like older guys”, the kleptomaniac tells him, an explanation that conceals: “I want a man to be the mother I never had.” In Grosz’s telling, psychoanalysis resembles a painstaking, collaborative act of excavation, removing layers of self-deception and motivated reasoning to discover the conflicting fears and desires that lie beneath.</p>\n<p>Love’s Labour is Grosz’s second book and like his bestselling 2013 debut, The Examined Life, it is a series of case studies that read like Grimms’ fairytales: dark and allegorical. His patients’ identifying details have been removed, but one imagines the pube-counting professor and others will recognise themselves. That these strange life stories are true(ish), makes them all the more powerful and compelling. The title refers to Grosz’s belief that the work of love is to learn to see oneself and others clearly – which is also the work of psychoanalysis and, arguably, of life.</p>\n<p>The book is as much about the mysteries of analysis as it about the mysteries of our hearts and sexual desires. In one chapter, Grosz recounts a fierce argument between two psychoanalysts after one, Susan, discovers that the other, Cora, has been having an affair with her husband. Susan says that Cora has never learned what psychoanalysis should be about: having empathy, behaving morally, accepting reality. But Cora believes the goal is learning to act according to one’s true desires and accept the consequences. Both outcomes, Grosz concludes, can be desirable consequences of analysis, but neither should be the aim of the therapist. To have aims for a patient is to infringe on their autonomy. He aims for nothing more than for his patients to better understand themselves.</p>\n<p>As one might expect, therapeutic breakthroughs often happen after Grosz and the patient analyse a dream, and his patients frequently trace the origins of their issues with intimacy to early childhood, to a dead or emotionally absent parent. Each case study can feel like a detective story: a tiny, inconsequential detail may, sometimes years later, unlock a new understanding. And what a long time this process can take! Grosz has been working with patients for 40 years, and sometimes a phone call or chance encounter decades after the initial consultation completely changes his understanding of a person’s predicament. In the penultimate chapter – a pure horror story: chilling, moving, unforgettable – he describes a sculptor who has found himself emotionally and physically stuck since his girlfriend’s suicide. After they have been speaking for 10 years, Tobias recounts a dream that finally enables him to reveal horrifying details about the aftermath of her death, details that help them both understand his emptiness, and that will haunt readers long after they have set this book aside.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/aug/25/loves-labour-by-stephen-grosz-review-the-truth-about-relationships\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>David Mitchell is probably the only male on the planet who could get away with defending mansplaining, so that is what he has done. “I feel there’s an unfairness to the term, which is taken to be men explaining things in a boring way to women,” he told <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/culture/tv-radio/article/david-mitchell-robert-webb-are-not-helping-79nf963hl\">the Sunday Times</a>. “Because they do it to each other, and they take turns, and that’s what men call a conversation.”</p>\n<p>In the same interview, Mitchell and his comedy partner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/robert-webb\">Robert Webb</a> are asked how each counselled and supported the other through various personal challenges. They are confused and slightly aghast at the idea that they might have discussed such matters. What do men talk to one another about, then? “Well, yes,” says Mitchell. “That’s a question [my wife] Victoria’s asked me many times. And I never really know.”</p>\n<p>This insight came in the same week Rylan Clark <a href=\"https://hungermag.com/art-culture/rylan-is-baring-it-all\">revealed what he has learned</a> from hosting his podcast How to Be in Love. “I never really understood when people said, ‘my partner is my best friend,’” he admitted. “Because I thought, well, my partner is not my best friend – my best friend is my best friend. I didn’t get it. But I’ve realised that your partner can be that.”</p>\n<p>Hmmm … can they, though? As so perfectly illustrated by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/david-mitchell\">David Mitchell</a>, men and women communicate in extremely different ways so, if you are in a heterosexual relationship, the odds seem stacked against you. Of course, there are exceptions to the rule but, if my husband went to the pub with a mate whose entire family had just been abducted by aliens, there’s a very real chance it might not come up. There have been many instances where something huge is happening in the life of one of his pals and I’m waiting patiently for the next instalment, but he comes home clueless. “Didn’t you ask?” I’ll shriek, brandishing my rolling pin. And he will look bewildered, somehow unaware he was meant to.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, I know my friends inside out, and vice versa. From their deepest dreams, hopes and desires, to how they feel about themselves and everybody they have ever met via what they fancy for lunch. We check in, we keep up, we don’t have to be reminded to enquire about the plot twists in each other’s storyline, we are living and breathing them together. How can these opposite ways of relating, of transmitting and receiving, mesh successfully so both parties get what they need?</p>\n<p>But perhaps bigger, and more important, than the question of whether it’s possible to be best friends with your partner is if it’s a good idea in the first place. Isn’t that a lot of pressure on one person, and also too great a shift from romance towards roommates? Love aside, I do like my husband, we are friendly, but I’m not sure he’s my <i>best</i> friend, nor that I want him to be. It feels co-dependent and insular. A bit Stepford, tradwife, like we might share a toothbrush or, worse, an email address.</p>\n<p>Then I asked my husband who his best friend was, and his answer, and my reaction to it, surprised me. He thought for a second, and then gave a male name. He had been best man at our wedding, so the clues were there, but I was oddly hurt. “Not me, then?” I clarified, in case he had mixed me and this guy up or something.</p>\n<p>“Well, I’m not yours, am I?” he replied, immediately reeling off five people and one cat who would definitely be ahead of him in the queue. All fair enough. Except … it turns out that although my husband isn’t <i>my</i> best friend, and I am fine with that, I want to be <i>his</i>. Want and expect. Oh, and I’m increasingly outraged not to be, the longer I ponder it.

When our relationship started, he was the forgetful one; I tended to remember everything</strong>\n      <strong>. I have always been mindful that I might need to look after him in his old age</strong>\n      <strong>. But I am a caring person, and always thought I would manage. </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>This is not how things have worked out. My husband is pretty healthy, while I am </strong>\n      <strong>suffering the beginnings of a noticeable cognitive decline</strong>\n      <strong> – forgetfulness</strong>\n      <strong>, overwhelm and a decrease in mobility</strong>\n      <strong> – which I haven’t been to the doctor </strong>\n      <strong>about yet</strong>\n      <strong>.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>My husband is not a very outwardly caring person, and I </strong>\n      <strong>have no idea if he will </strong>\n      <strong>care enough</strong>\n      <strong> to look after me if I become more immobile or </strong>\n      <strong>start to forget things more. I want to feel loved, but I don’t. </strong>\n      <strong>This is sad in itself, and really scary for the future.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>I have had some health challenges in the last year and am doing my best to </strong>\n      <strong>look after myself. My husband gives me a lot of advice about my weight and health</strong>\n      <strong>, but he doesn’t walk or talk more slowly if </strong>\n      <strong>I struggle to keep up</strong>\n      <strong>. </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Today we went to the cinema as a family. I </strong>\n      <strong>booked </strong>\n      <strong>it</strong>\n      <strong>, paid and drove</strong>\n      <strong>, but my husband and kids </strong>\n      <strong>walked off </strong>\n      <strong>to</strong>\n      <strong> the cinema </strong>\n      <strong>without me and I couldn’t catch up.</strong>\n      <strong> I want to be together, but I’m </strong>\n      <strong>left behind.</strong>\n      <strong> This</strong>\n      <strong> </strong>\n      <strong>feels like a metaphor for our life.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>What I really want </strong>\n      <strong>my husband to say is, “Don’t worry, I’ll take care of you, and you take care of me.” But I just don’t think he’s capable of it.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Your letter was one of the saddest I’ve read. Not because it is without hope – quite the opposite – but because this gap between you and your family could be bridged with communication. But I know that takes courage.</p>\n<p>Please go to the doctor. A proper checkup could put your mind at rest, or give you concrete answers to present to your family. So many women your age, who have had a lifetime of looking after others, are exhausted and overwhelmed – not because they are failing, but because they are so capable. It’s time to start looking after you.</p>\n<p>UKCP registered psychotherapist Meeri Rebane was “moved by your letter and your courage in asking for help. It seems that being the strong physically capable ‘carer’ is a role you’ve carried throughout your life. From the start of your relationship with your husband, you took on the responsibility of thinking about what and who needs taking care of in the family.” Rebane went on to say that there’s “nothing wrong with that, people can get great fulfilment from caring for others, but who took care of you when you were growing up? It seems you were taught to be the ‘caring person who would always manage’, but also that to ‘not manage’ was not OK.”</p>\n<p>We wondered if this was why you don’t feel you can ask for help now? I wondered about your life when you were a child. You may find the podcast I did on the <a href=\"https://pod.link/1567190358/episode/4ce2a72acd2eb9c0a989cfd7be9ffd27\">Parentified Child</a> useful.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-11\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>When you’re the planner and the fixer, you and your needs can become invisible because you just get on with it. I don’t think your husband and children are uncaring – after all, you’ve shown them a lifetime of how to do it – but it’s very likely they have no idea at all how you feel.</p>\n<p>“Your husband may not be capable of giving you the response you need at first,” says Rebane. “His way of expressing care may be different to yours. It doesn’t mean he doesn’t want to take care of you. If you don’t tell him what you need, however, he can’t even try to support you.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/31/my-health-is-declining-and-im-worried-my-husband-might-not-take-care-of-me\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>In May<strong> </strong>2018, I was scrolling through prospective dates on Bumble when I saw Charlie’s profile. I could tell we had a lot of immediate connections. He had worked for human rights organisations, travelled a lot and even had interesting profile pictures. I swiped right.</p>\n    <p>Later that day, we met at a small bar close to my work in Melbourne for a drink. Even though it was a good first date, I decided I didn’t have the energy for more dates straight away and cancelled our second one. I think he thought I was a bit of a time waster.</p>\n    <p>A month later, I was visiting family in Perth and my mum asked if I was seeing anyone. I expressed frustration that it’s so hard to sort through all the garbage on dating apps – but there was one guy I’d met who seemed lovely and had a beautiful smile. So when I got back to Melbourne we met again for dumplings, and it was on.</p>\n    <p>After just six months together we moved into his one-bedroom bachelor pad. That was a massive mistake. We did it way too fast and immediately started squabbling. It was just too soon for two very independent people who had spent a lot of time building up their own lives to be suddenly trying to mesh them together.</p>\n    <p>By March 2020, our bickering was at an all-time high. We decided to see a couples counsellor before going on a one-month trip to South America – we didn’t want to ruin the trip for ourselves. I remember immediately disliking the counsellor, which I think was more about what she revealed about us. At the end of the first session she just looked at us and said she didn’t think she could help because we were too far apart as individuals for things to work out. We were like, that’s really bad!</p>\n    <p>Before we left Australia we’d heard murmurings about this new virus emerging but we were feeling smug that we were escaping. After five incredible days hiking across Patagonia, we found ourselves bunkering down in a small hotel room in Punta Arenas as the news of Covid spread across the world.</p>\n    <p>Flights were cancelled, borders were closing, we had desperate messages from friends and family. We were freaking out. It went from a complete state of relaxation and wonder at the world to OMFG the world is melting down.</p>\n    <p>Charlie was way more relaxed about it than me. He was like, we’ll be OK. It just wasn’t in his realm of possibility that we wouldn’t get home. So while I was contacting embassies, trying to change flights and reaching out to friends and family to figure out our way home, Charlie was happily imagining our new life in Chile. “Babe, imagine how good we’ll get at Spanish,” he said. A line I’ll always remember.</p>\n    <p>In the hotel room in Punta Arenas I knew that if the world was ending, as it felt like it was, it was him I wanted to be next to. Charlie was making us go on walks, making up songs and cracking jokes the whole time. He was bringing me out of my anxiety loop. We balanced each other out perfectly in that crisis, on opposite ends of the scale.</p>\n    <p>Eventually, we got seats on one of the last flights back from Chile before the borders closed. We were waiting on standby at the airport, and we only got seats on the flight because two temporary residents were booted off when the rules changed and only permanent residents could get back into Australia. It really was the most bonkers time.</p>\n    <p>Charlie proposed in July 2020 and we eloped in December 2020.</p>\n    <p>I thought our time in Chile was going to be the worst thing we would go through – but we have faced many difficulties together since then.</p>\n    <p>Through it all, I’m always so grateful to have him by my side. We never went back to that couples counsellor.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/31/the-moment-i-knew-stuck-in-chile-in-the-early-days-of-covid-he-brought-me-out-of-my-anxiety-loop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Sometime in the summer of 2017 I wrote in my journal, “Jesus fucking Christ, please save me.” I was trapped in hell, and I could see no way out. Our beautiful, sunny, two-bedroom penthouse apartment in the East Village – which I had rented for Rayya to make her happy in the last months of her life – had become a dungeon of misery, danger, degradation, drugs. Rayya kept the shades drawn at all hours of the day, not only because the light hurt her eyes but also because she had become intensely paranoid that she was being watched by the police, and that they were coming for her.</p>\n<p>And, to be honest, the police might very well have come for her (for both of us, actually), because our apartment now contained thousands and thousands of dollars’ worth of cocaine – some of which Rayya was cooking down and shooting into whatever veins she could find upon her beaten-down, disease-ridden body, some of which she was freebasing, some of which she was snorting up her now constantly bloodied nose. But most of the coke, as of this moment, she had chopped up and laid out in thick rails on the coffee table, next to an overflowing ashtray, a bottle of whiskey, several bottles of morphine and trazodone and Xanax, a stack of fentanyl patches and a cluster of empty beer bottles. And these heaping lines of cocaine she counted, weighed and studied all day long.</p>\n<p>“What the fuck are you looking at?” she demanded, glancing up for a moment from her cherished cocaine heaps and peering at me through a blue haze of cigarette smoke – staring me down with hostile eyes that had not, as far as I could remember, blinked in days.</p>\n<p>Good question.</p>\n<p>What was I looking at?</p>\n<p>I was looking at somebody who was supposed to be dead by now – who had been given six months to live over 15 months earlier – but who simply refused to die. I was looking at somebody who had recently gotten kicked out of hospice (who gets kicked out of hospice, by the way?) for being aggressive and uncooperative to the kind, generous nurses and support staff who had been trying to help my beloved partner prepare her body and mind for a “death with dignity” – a death that, at this point, Rayya had utterly rejected in favour of plan B, which was to do enough drugs that she could feel immortal, that she could feel nothing.</p>\n<p>I was looking at somebody who had once been the only person on Earth who could make me feel completely safe and loved, but who now verbally abused me all day long, telling me that I was “a fucking shit show of a failure” when it came to taking care of her; that everything I was doing to try to help her was wrong; that I was a “needy little fucking crybaby” who had to “grow the fuck up”.</p>\n<p>I first met Rayya Elias in the spring of 2000. I was 31 years old at the time, and married. I was on a certain path back then. Husband, nice house, good job, about to start a family. Except there was a problem with my hair, which was a frizzy mess. One day a friend told me I resembled a young <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/art-garfunkel\">Art Garfunkel</a>, and said I needed to do something about it. She suggested I go see this person named Rayya, who was cutting hair out of a walk-up apartment on Avenue C.</p>\n<p>I was dressed that day like a sales clerk at Banana Republic, which is how I always dressed back then. All khakis and cardigans. I remember my outfit clearly, because I looked and felt so different from Rayya, who was wearing black leather pants, a white tank top and motorcycle boots. I have fallen in love with many people at first sight, but I did not fall in love with Rayya Elias that day. In fact, I didn’t fall in love with her for another eight or nine years. But I did like her. She was funny and interesting and exotic.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/aug/30/eat-pray-love-author-elizabeth-gilbert-leaving-marriage-dying-friend\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Picture a man sitting opposite you on public transport. He wields a copy of The Will to Change by bell hooks, and he takes care to parade the front cover or the spine lest any nearby strangers miss the title. He is in his 20s or 30s and conventionally attractive; maybe he has a dangly earring or two. There on his knee rests a tote bag. This man would not engage in loutish, careless behaviour like “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/dec/06/hes-about-to-give-birth-manspreading-hits-new-heights-at-30000ft\">manspreading</a>” or placing all his stuff on the seats. And the tote bag probably bears the logo of an ethical brand or a bookshop. The bag is probably adorned with social-justice badges. If he showed you what music he is listening to, it might be, say, Lana Del Rey or Clairo.</p>\n<p>Here we have the performative male – a new kind of vaguely problematic man to watch out for. And one who is the subject of all manner of viral TikToks and memes, and media coverage everywhere from GQ to the New York Times, which reported on a recent <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/14/style/performative-men.html\">performative male contest in Seattle</a>. For some reason when I picture him he always has curly hair. Big bouncy lustrous curls. You can probably add your own details, but you get the picture. The idea is that the performative male is a guy who goes about looking feminist and woke. The catch is that his aesthetic is curated to appeal to what he thinks women might like rather than being a totally earnest expression of his interests.</p>\n<p>Imagine that! A person choosing clothes and accessories to increase their attractiveness in the eyes of the gender they are trying to sleep with. Very insidious and unusual behaviour. I can tell you right now I have never once in my life participated in such a charade. I will admit, too, that some of this coverage has made me feel baffled by what is apparently considered desirable. The performative male is said to wear several <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/15/a-fluff-ball-with-a-monster-face-what-explains-the-luxury-appeal-of-labubu-dolls\">Labubus</a> and drink <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/apr/05/skyrocketing-demand-for-matcha-raises-fears-of-shortage-in-japan\">matcha</a>. I don’t really understand why this would lure women in. It’s even been suggested a performative male might stow tampons on his person. But if I met a cisgender man who made a point of carrying tampons around with him I’d probably telephone the police.</p>\n<p>My first thought, when I came across this trend, was: God, straight men cannot win. My second was: yes, this aesthetic is very common – not just with men but with women too. A parade of images flashed before me of all the young women and men I have seen self-consciously clutching their unbroken copies of Angela Davis and so on in coffee shops and on the bus. “A lot of the time they don’t know what they’re talking about,” one of the hosts of the Seattle performative male contest told the NYT, speaking about the kind of men who adopt this look. “It’s just an aesthetic for them.” But I would gently submit that a substantial proportion of the women who take care to post highlighted and pencilled-over pages of bell hooks to Instagram do not put much of the ethos of her work into practice in their own lives either.</p>\n<p>After all, performative righteousness is not solely the preserve of young men. I have often felt that the parallel vapidness and popularity of online social-justice messaging has created an entire generation (or two) of people obsessed with the idea of telegraphing their own worthiness rather than practising it.</p>\n<p>As the performative male trend has gained traction, I have received a few PR emails about it on behalf of “experts” with funky job titles offering to help counsel young women to spot toxic signs and red flags in the opposite sex. These missives, which I receive every time a new dating trend is coined, are always full of my own personal red flags. One such email on behalf of a “relationship coach” explained that the performative male is dangerous because he “speaks the language of emotional availability but doesn’t practise it”. I am happy to say that, for all its shadowy allusions to grave transgression, I have no idea what this sentence means.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/29/tote-bag-matcha-performative-male-women\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I know.”</i></p>\n<p>The mountains collapse into swirls of liquid black.</p>\n<p>I blink. It’s just an optical illusion. There’s no running water here on Orpheus—impossible at minus sixty degrees Celsius. I’m surrounded by knots of ice and stone, as I’ve been since I arrived yesterday.</p>\n<p/><p>The remnants of their base hadn’t been difficult to find. After dropping my lander at the spot marked on the historical expedition plans, I trekked around the edge of a vast basin that the original expeditioners had named <i>Mare Lucidum</i>, the Shining Sea. Eventually I discovered a visibility marker—almost completely buried in ice, only its reflective red tip peeking out. From there, I tracked broken markers to the habitation dome. Behind the dome, cradled in the shadow of a cliff, were the crumbled remains of the <i>Dandelion IX</i>.</p>\n<p>A large crack had split the dome’s outer door, and a tumble of frozen pebbles spilled into the airlock. When I tried the inner door, I found that the mechanism was jammed. Only when I leaned my full weight against it, spinning the pinions in my knees at full power, did the seal creak ajar.</p>\n<p>Before beginning this trip, I’d combed the archives on Terra III. There’d been only limited information about the Orphean expedition. The crew had beamed back a few reports during their first couple of months here—data about the terrain and climate; difficulties in establishing reliable food sources. Then, abruptly, silence.</p>\n<p>I spent a night in their ruined base, carefully taking photographs and salvaging data banks. Amongst the locally-stored files, I discovered several never-sent reports.</p>\n<p><i>The greenhouse crops are failing again. Nothing’s working—not the organic fertiliser, not the added humidity. We’re thinking about trying Cassius’s valley. It’s a thin hope, but we’re at that stage. It’s only four kilometres east of here. He swears he saw bits of edible algae trapped in the ice…</i></p>\n<p>The journey out here was tougher than I’d expected. Even with the traction cleats extruded from my feet, I slipped many times on the treacherous ice. Geysers spouted toxic fumes at unpredictable intervals. I checked my radar regularly and doubled back a few times to avoid the most dangerous areas. Brief exposure to the fumes would not trouble me; little would seep through my scale-suit. But corrosive microdroplets might cling to my equipment and wriggle into my joints when I removed my outer skin.</p>\n<p>Now, I find myself staring down into Cassius’s valley. A misnomer. It’s not really a valley at all, but a maze-like warren twisting deep into the planet’s bowels. The rock formations have shed their jagged edges and sharp outcroppings. Instead, massaged by long-gone rivers, they flow like ink: viscous black under lacy ice shrouds.<br/>\nDid all four expeditioners come on this scouting venture? If so, why? It was out of character for me—for Peiyi, I mean—to be so foolish. The sensible thing would’ve been to leave at least one at base.</p>\n<p>I close my eyes. Peiyi’s memories are always there: a languid tide lapping around my waist. I let my resistance weaken. It’s like exhaling a long-held breath. I sink to the neck, bumping up against ocean debris.</p>\n<p>I see my hands—bare olive skin, unblemished by enhancements or implants—flicking objects nimbly around a holographic display. Schematics of the <i>Dandelion IX</i>. Incomplete maps of the Orphean terrain. Blueprints of the habitation dome, the greenhouse. Projected timelines.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2023/12/28/escape-pod-921-death-by-water/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Completely love it!”</p>\n<h3>Harvest the Stars</h3>\n<p>The summer Sif turned one, the starships were ripe on the vine.</p>\n<p>They hulked in fields ringing the town where Tuja had always lived. A place far from big cities, where the starlight they fed on came pure and bright.</p>\n<p>“The seeds start out like any seeds; small, unassuming. Until we fertilize them, tend them. Give them space to grow,” Tuja said to the infant on her lap, who must have been more focused on the fingers stuffed in her mouth than the sight of the field crew moving amongst hulls like insects scrambling over gourds. They started in the early afternoon to harvest with the dusk.</p>\n<p>The rooftop porch of their small home was the perfect place to watch as buyers checked and finalized purchases, as fielders netted and pinned the craft, drained most of the gases from lift chambers, checked their structural integrity one last time before cutting away the shriveled vestiges of vines with cautery tools.</p>\n<p>“When they can cut through the vines that easy, it’s time for the ships to go,” Tuja said, as one of the craft demonstrated. Multiple vines came together, from the same plant or different ones, in order to form the bud that would become a node that would burgeon into a full fledged starship after roughly two decades of development; at this point, they snaked from all sides of the ship’s underbelly in the churned mud of the field and were snipped, one at a time, by skilled hands.</p>\n<p>With its vines cut, the starship rose to the top of its net; a massive balloon with inner galleries and spaces large enough for human habitation, a rind-skin impervious to the void between life-sustaining worlds. A few pieces of technology and the processes and rhythms of the starship could be made manageable, directable.</p>\n<p>Sif made a sound somewhere between amazed and amused; so hard to tell where the line was at her age, if there was one at all.</p>\n<p>Another ship followed the first, rising with silent grace to the top of its net. Sif’s arms pumped, mimicking the ship. Encouraging it, perhaps.</p>\n<p>“And then, when they’re all harvested, and the field’s all tilled up, they take more of those tiny little seeds and put them in the ground and start all over,” Tuja said.</p>\n<p>She’d seen the full process, from seeding to harvest, only once in her life, having been born in the midst of a crop rotation, but she was eager to watch the next crop grow with her daughter. She pulled Sif close in crossed arms and breathed deep of the strawy, star-warmed scent of the fields.</p>\n<p>New seeds were planted, and for years the fields looked like any fields; they might contain melons or squashes, from a distance. Ones that grew quickly, that were allowed to get concerningly large, but still, the potential they contained was well concealed to the untrained eye.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2023/12/23/escape-pod-920-harvest-the-stars/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 919: Emotional Resonance</h2>\n<h3>Emotional Resonance</h3>\n<p>Arbor’s favorite part of a mission was always the first view of a planet. Even after seven hundred years of being a giant robot, it never got old. Green and blue clouds churned over purple seas, imposing storms that flashed red with threads of lightning. Beautiful.</p>\n<p>And they were sent to clear it of all human life. <i>Courtesy of ExoPLENTI, Inc.! </i>Ugh, that slogan clung to their digital psyche no matter how hard they tried to scrub it from their databases.</p>\n<p>At least this part, floating in orbit, wasn’t so bad.</p>\n<p>Proximity alarms went off, a shrill beep and an itch on their right arm. Okay, this part wasn’t <i>usually </i>bad? Sensors indicated a friendly mech to the right, and it was floating too close.</p>\n<p>The incoming mech’s sharp metal angles were humanoid like Arbor’s. Two hands, two feet. This model’s design was new, its frame less bulky and more streamlined. It was freshly painted blue and silver with huge blue, glass eye sensors—a contrast to Arbor’s dented weathered shell and red eyes.</p>\n<p>The other mech’s MIND—a cute corporate acronym for Monitoring Interface Neural Driver—blipped into existence, a projected hologram of faded colors and warped outlines, and peered over the edge of her robot’s helmet plate in awe. She was listed as Crowe, her name and ID hovering above her. She wore a pink bomber jacket with glowing white lines. Her curly hair was a gradient of pink, white, and blue, her skin just a shade darker than Arbor’s own dark brown. She was super cute.</p>\n<p>Arbor was relieved they still felt infatuation, simulated or not.</p>\n<p>“Sorry!” Crowe said. “I was admiring the view and found myself drifting.”</p>\n<p>“First mission post-download?” Arbor asked. They projected their hologram self-image on the shoulder of their body. Went for their classic black boots and jacket look. It was the first time they had done that in well over two hundred years.</p>\n<p>Crowe nodded. “Freshly installed yesterday. Wasn’t expecting to feel anxious about it. Given that I’m now, you know.” She gestured down her projection body and her mech shell made the same motion.</p>\n<p>“A giant murder machine, incapable of feeling upset?” Arbor supplied.</p>\n<p>Crowe smiled. “Exactly.”</p>\n<p>“Welcome to the beginning of a thousand years as a killer robot. Don’t worry, they only take your ability to question or disobey their orders. All the little quirks and unique things that make you, well, <i>you </i>stay intact.” It was in the contract, and it was obvious Crowe hadn’t been allowed to read the fine print. That was common. Shitty, but common.</p>\n<p>“I guess that’s something,” Crowe said. She looked down at the planet and sighed. “I suppose we’ll be fighting soon.”</p>\n<p>“Does that bother you?”</p>\n<p>Crowe shrugged. Occasionally she became semi-translucent, her outline warping or voice distorting. “Bit of a trick question, don’t you think? If it bothered me, does that mean they did a bad job of removing my ability to doubt what I’m told to do?”</p>\n<p>“Maybe.” Arbor’s projection leaned back and floated in space. “Or maybe it means they programmed your inability to question orders so well it even feels like you can doubt them.”</p>\n<p>“Shit, that’s a good point.”</p>\n<p>Arbor laughed. “I’ve had some time to ponder.”</p>\n<p>Crowe looked at Arbor’s body, head tilted as her glowing blue eyes examined their information in the network. They felt the ping like a gentle tap on the shoulder and sent their detailed files along.</p>\n<p/><p><i>INCOMING PRIORITY NOTICE: Initiate MIND launch. Operation to commence in thirty seconds.</i></p>\n<p><i> </i></p>\n<p>The text was in bright red, splashed against the planet below.</p>\n<p>“Suppose that’s our cue,” Crowe said. “I should get back—sorry for almost drifting into you.” She gave a surprisingly shy glance back at Arbor. “See you again?”</p>\n<p>They nodded. Arbor very much wished to see her again. After centuries of silence and distance, they felt a newfound emotion, somewhere between happiness and anxiety. Their heart beat faster, face flush and warm, chest tight. All simulated reactions. After all, they weren’t human anymore. Nowadays their heart was a replaceable nest of wires and power supplies buried in the toughest alloy.

Their bird-drones spread across the city, scattered on cables and rooftops and broadcast towers. Every camera hunted for Krina Viy, independent security contractor (AWOL from JoyCorp contact 5 hours).</p>\n<p>A crow-drone spotted the target. Surveillance confirmed Krina’s identity and sent a brief reward signal to inspire the bird onward.</p>\n<p>The drone switched from search to pursuit, redoubling its data collection as it chased the taste of reinforcement. So much joy and empty-matrix innocence in its response to a simple reward. Flockmembers were too simple to understand that reinforcement implied punishment, and no success would ever suffice for long.</p>\n<p>If Surveillance could crack this case as the network desired, there would be rewards enough for everyone, drone and program-layer alike.</p>\n<p/><p>The crow-drone flitted from the power line to a billboard, tracking the target by spatial profile and gait-pattern. How else could it help the network? The crow uploaded data on everything in the human’s path: rain acidity, cracked sidewalk, a parked car leaking electrolyte fluid.</p>\n<p>The billboard underfoot responded to a ping, and the crow fed it passwords until it shared its camera records. The target had passed the billboard three seconds ago, but its database recorded only an unlabeled void, without identity.</p>\n<p>Another reward signal arrived at last. The crow didn’t understand what it’d achieved, but it knew its actions were worth repeating.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>A starling-drone peeked down from the eaves of an empty house. Below, a human head bent over a door, wedging a tool into the lock. The starling drew back into crumbling drywall, and fluttered through the gaps in rotted beams until it found an internal view.</p>\n<p>The target wedged the door shut and slumped on a dry patch of floor. She tapped behind her ear, and her commplant’s radioband signal fell silent. She drew a tablet from one of her leg pockets and began matching colors on the screen, her face cast in dim and meaningless light.</p>\n<p>The starling uploaded its data, and a light reward-signal spurred it to continue recording.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Surveillance compared the data from Crow-417 and Starling-230. The billboard’s ignorance made no sense, and municipal databases said the building had been demolished a year ago. Two errors combined were a strong sign of hacking (historical data classification certainty 90%).</p>\n<p>A sign, and a trail. Surveillance scoured the access history of the building’s public records, and cross-referenced them with the billboard’s software-verification timestamps. Together, plenty of information to track whatever hacker had helped Krina get this far. Surveillance sent the data laterally to Enforcement with an extra <i>human attention</i> flag.</p>\n<p>Enforcement acknowledged receipt, and added a reply: <i>human attention flag: declined/ignored</i>.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2023/12/07/escape-pod-918-conference-of-the-birds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 917: Challenges to Becoming a Pro Dragonracer in Apapa-Downtown</h2>\n<h3>Challenges to Becoming a Pro Dragonracer in Apapa-Downtown</h3>\n<p><i>The gear is too expensive</i>.</p>\n<p>Honestly. There isn’t enough competition in the market. The Immersion® console alone costs an arm and a leg. <i>Ọmọ</i>. You’ll sweat to even get a Nigerian-used console on Jiji or at Computer Village for less than 200k. And that’s <i>just </i>the console. We’re not even talking about the vests or the mats.</p>\n<p>Or the <i>chair! </i></p>\n<p>For real though. How else does somebody experience the saddle—on <i>dragon-</i>back—if they can’t experience the full flex of the dragon’s powerful muscles under their thighs? I’ve seen the streams of American pro dragon-racers in full Immersion® gear—visor, suit, chair! The rich kids here are enjoying, on God!</p>\n<p>Brother Cosmopolitan’s place boasts of a few consoles, and his charges are pretty OK. One or two people swear he has a mat rig inside for the members of his game team. See, forget it. There’s no way anyone can go pro while paying 1k per hour in a game centre.</p>\n<p>Dapo, my padi from work, splits his wages three ways at the end of each day. “One for food, the other for ajo, and the final for Bro. Cosmopolitan,” he says. In three days he has enough to VR. Personally, I’d rather not. Most of my wages go into helping sister Tade with pocket money, and making sure Oga Najim doesn’t kick us out to the streets while Aunty goes out on “work trips.”</p>\n<p>I digress.</p>\n<p>I don’t hate VR, don’t misunderstand me. I love that shit with all my life. That initial out of body sensation once the neural sync completes? Pure heaven. Don’t even get me started on the loading interface, where you become nothing but a blob of data hovering inside a colourful void. And the links to the million ports available on the virtual landscape.</p>\n<p>But I can’t afford it.</p>\n<p>People who live in Apapa-Downtown generally cannot. Hmm, they can barely eat, let alone buy games. Especially not with that naira-dollar rate. The first time I go to Bro. Cosmopolitan’s place, it’s on Dapo’s insistence. The guy wouldn’t just SHUT UP about how much I was missing, using only an Android phone. I decide it’s worth a shot to experience, in VR, some of the videos I’d been watching recently on YouTube about hardware and repair.</p>\n<p>Instead, this guy tricks me into playing as a guest in this one game everybody can’t seem to stop talking up about.</p>\n<p><i>Infinisis</i>.</p>\n<p><i>Infinisis</i> was once a PC game that went quiet for about 4 years before returning with its VR update. In fact, Immersion® was designed for the <i>Infinisis</i> gameplay. Since then, many developers have been piggybacking on Immersion’s massive popularity.</p>\n<p>And you know what? Thank God I followed Dapo to play that game.</p>\n<p>Because that’s the first time I see a dragon, and it changes my life completely.</p>\n<p><i>The internet sucks</i>.</p>\n<p>All the streams on YouTube look seamless and liquid. Don’t be fooled. Those guys use 5G+ connections. We can barely get good 4G here to run our personal devices. Only commercial places—or, you know, the rich—actually have 5G routers. Sister Tade once said that our 4G services aren’t even 4G, but like an extended 3G.</p>\n<p>These are the issues.</p>\n<p>I stumble upon dragonracing by complete accident, then wonder how in heaven I did not know about this. I usually take my break from work in a buka opposite the workshop; Aunty Ejiro’s place. Two reasons why. First, for her hot puff-puff. Second, the internet in her shop is somewhat manageable. I’ve also learned to ignore the stares of passer-by, or some of her non-regular customers. Usually, people find it hard to reconcile me with their image of a woman. I’m an auto-mechanic, you see, and people expect us mechanics to smell like grease and sweat. Understandable, because this side of town also smells like smoke and gutter-water, and our overalls look like a blend of both. When some of the clients talk to us, they hold their breath, talking 1.5 times faster than normal.</p>\n<p>Fat luck oh.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2023/11/30/escape-pod-917-challenges-to-becoming-a-pro-dragonracer-in-apapa-downtown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 916: Anna and Marisol in Time and Space (Flashback Friday)</h2>\n<h3>Anna and Marisol in Time and Space</h3>\n<p>The big day came, and Anna was tempted to tie up Marisol and stash her in the closet just to be safe, but instead she put on her makeup and her pale blue gown (it was prettier than she remembered) and called, “Marisol! Are you making a whole new dress from scratch in there? We gotta go!” just like last time.</p>\n<p>Marisol emerged from the bedroom, sliding a dangly earring into place, and even with everything on her mind, Anna stopped and stared and took her partner in: those pale green eyes so striking against the darkness of her skin, her long black hair, her dress patterned with tiny flowers and ruffled at the hem, made elegant both by Marisol’s craftsmanship and because she looked good in everything, basically. How many hours had Anna spent staring at photographs of that face? “Oh my god, let me get a picture.”</p>\n<p>Marisol rolled her eyes. “I thought you were worried about being late?”</p>\n<p>“It’s not my fault you look this good. I didn’t account for a hotness delay.” Marisol snorted laughter, and Anna’s phone snapshot caught her at the perfect candid moment: happiness frozen forever in pixels. Anna looked at the screen. The picture wasn’t <i>exactly</i> the same, but it was probably okay—</p>\n<p>Marisol tapped her on the arm. “I’m flattered, babe, but you can gaze upon my splendor later.” They grabbed the wedding gift bag and pelted down the stairs and out the lobby door to the street. Their timing was perfect, anyway: the car Anna had summoned pulled up, shiny and black, just as they reached the curb. They slid into the back, adjusting hems and getting comfortable: it was about a twenty-minute ride to the park where Del and Kelsey were getting married.</p>\n<p>“The first of the college cohort to fall,” Marisol said. “How much do you want to bet they set off a domino chain reaction thing among the guests? We’ll probably have to go to ten weddings next summer.”</p>\n<p><i>Better than ten funerals</i>, Anna thought. <i>Or thirty</i>. She checked her purse for the thousandth time. She knew it was in there, and she knew it worked—she’d tested it extensively—but she couldn’t help but worry. You only got one second chance.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>“Are you hearing wedding bells, or are you still happy just living in sin with me?” Anna said.</p>\n<p>“We could sin a little bit more often, I wouldn’t mind. Besides, you know my family. Right now everyone can pretend we’re roommates, so I’m still welcome at christenings and quinceañera. In all the coming-out stories I heard, nobody ever said what to do if your family just pretends they don’t <i>hear</i> you.” She held Anna’s hand. “I thought you were philosophically opposed to marriage as a tool of the patriarchy anyway.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, but we bought this fancy-ass crystal bowl for Del, and maybe I want my share of the loot.”</p>\n<p>That set off another of Marisol’s sexily unsexy snorts. “I thought for sure you’d go baby-crazy before you went wedding-crazy.”</p>\n<p>“I contain multitudes. But I’m not either one yet. We’ll talk about it when we’re thirty.”</p>\n<p>“Thirty seemed a lot farther off when we were nineteen than it does now.”</p>\n<p>“Well, sure. That was like a fifth of our lives ago.”</p>\n<p>“Time does go by.”</p>\n<p><i>You have no idea</i>, Anna though.</p>\n<p>The wedding was in Tilden Park, with the ceremony to be held outside and the reception right next door in the vaulted and paneled and windowed wonder of the Brazilian Room. The interior was paneled in beautiful exotic hardwoods, originally part of the 1939 World’s Fair Exhibition in San Francisco—the Brazilians had donated the building to the park as a gift, though the original exterior had been replaced by a faux-English-country-house construction in the ‘40s. The interior was original, though, and the wood paneling was beautiful. <i>No bullet holes</i>, Anna thought, looking through the windows at the interior as they arrived.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2023/11/23/escape-pod-916-anna-and-marisol-in-time-and-space-flashback-friday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Can you feel it encouraging appetites and urges – voyeurism, schadenfreude, extreme emotional investment in strangers – that a responsible citizen and society should strive neither to serve nor encourage? Oh yes! Is that done by forcing relationships then putting them under outre stressors, including unexpected toilet conditions, on an otherwise paradisiacal island? Yes! And is it at least nominally presented by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/davina-mccall\">Davina McCall</a>, though actual sight of her is limited to a few opening minutes of the first episode and it is increasingly cheeky to bill her as a presence? Yes, yes to all of the above. Welcome to your next addictive reality show, 12 hour-long episodes designed to transition you comfortably into the autumn schedules – Stranded on Honeymoon Island.</p>\n<p>It is Love Island meets Married at First Sight, if – and you will have to strain your imaginations here – the contestants on Love Island weren’t often instantly awful. This lot are, in the main, rather gorgeously endearing. I hadn’t realised how ready I was for a show that didn’t require me to bring my best loathing game. I find I have so much energy for the rest of the day.</p>\n<p>Like all good reality TV shows (take note, Destination X), the setup is as stupid as it is simple and as simple as it is stupid. Eight kabillion single people who are ready to find lurve speed-date, fill in feedback forms, and from them a dozen are paired up by matchmakers. They then get hitched in the Philippines by celebrant Wenly (“Although this marriage is not legally binding, you are making a meaningful commitment to someone”, which is true as long as you realise that someone is the production company). The couples then get left on a nearby island for three weeks. There is a double bed, rudimentary shelter, a row of tinned foodstuffs and a loo that is maybe a notch and a half better than a bucket. We are promised that “mystery crates” containing items and challenges designed to test the honeymooners’ compatibility will arrive in later episodes. Good times!</p>\n<p>You find yourself rooting for an unusually high proportion of the couples. I wish for no one to dim the light of effervescent party girl Hannah and I very much feel that lovely suit designer Sam is the man to allow her to shine. When they hit the first bump in the road, I find myself pressing my fists to my face, begging her not to let her past bad experiences distort it into something it is not. “He is not your ex!” I plead to the screen. “Look at his eyes! Look at the way he recut your wedding dress into something playful yet provocative yet island-chores-ready. Come on! The past is not your future.”</p>\n<p>I am also fully in favour of Helen (“Essex girl and raging lesbian – that’s how I introduce myself!”) and Abby making a go of things. What can I tell you? They’re just right together. I bet Davina agrees with me. If we ever see her again, maybe she’ll say so.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/sep/03/stranded-on-honeymoon-island-review-bbc-one\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Grownups often roll their eyes at young love: at how all-consuming it is for the teenagers involved, and how predictably doomed it is to fail. But my holiday romance changed the course of my life.</p>\n<p>I was 16 when I met Giacomo at a bar in Atina, the tiny Italian mountain town where my parents grew up. There was a local festival one evening and tables were scarce, so our two friendship groups ended up squished around the same one. At more than 6ft tall, Giacomo was hard to miss. He was also friendly, smiley and, while he didn’t speak a word of English, I loved that he spared me the whole <i>ciao bella</i> swagger usually reserved for “foreign girls”.</p>\n<p>I wasn’t foreign. Not really. My parents moved to Scotland in the 1960s, settling in the Borders town of Selkirk, but Atina had always been part of our lives, woven into every holiday, every dish on the dinner table. But, after meeting Giacomo, I began to see Italy differently. It wasn’t simply something I’d inherited any more; it was something I was experiencing for myself.</p>\n<p>So, when summer ended and real life began, I didn’t return to Scotland as I’d originally planned. I hadn’t enjoyed school and had left as soon as I could, intending to continue my studies through other routes. I stayed in Italy to figure out what I wanted to do with my newfound sense of independence – and my newfound love.</p>\n<p>When Giacomo moved to Rome to study architecture that autumn, he proved to be an excellent <i>cicerone</i> – an Italian word for a cultural guide – and I got to know a version of the city that went beyond its landmarks. Through him, I was introduced to student life, open-air music festivals, and secret little bakeries that sold pastries from the back door in the early hours.</p>\n<p>But it wasn’t all gelato and romance. I drifted between courses and jobs, hoping something would click, but nothing ever quite did. I tried studying in Italy but couldn’t get past the oral exams and, missing home, committed to a degree at Edinburgh University where – to no one’s surprise – I ended up studying Italian. Giacomo and I tried to make it work long distance, but mobile phones didn’t exist and the constant push and pull between countries, cultures and expectations took its toll.</p>\n<p>Our relationship didn’t last, but my love for Italy never died. The Italian side of me longed to be recognised and, after graduating, I moved to Italy again, this time to cities I chose for myself.</p>\n<p>I lived in Florence and Bologna. I worked, studied, and made lasting friendships – some with what I think of as Italian-Italians, others with third-culture kids like me. Despite our varied backgrounds, often with four or five nationalities in the mix, we understood what it meant to belong to more than one place – and to no place at all. To always be missing somewhere, or someone.</p>\n<p>Atina remained a constant, however, and I often spent holidays there, catching up with friends and family. Then, one summer, 12 years after our relationship ended, I saw Giacomo there, too – at the same bar where we had met all those years ago. Still tall (possibly even taller), still smiling. Still unable to speak a word of English.</p>\n<p>This time, the bar wasn’t busy – we didn’t have to share a table but, perhaps glimpsing the hopeful teenagers we’d once been, we chose to. And a new chapter opened in a story we thought had ended.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/03/a-moment-that-changed-me-i-bumped-into-my-ex-boyfriend-in-the-bar-where-wed-met-12-years-before\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He warned me he was a sex addict, and I am enthusiastic about sex. On our first night together I was aware of some erectile dysfunction – he wasn’t entirely hard and benefited from holding himself when penetrating me</strong>\n      <strong> – </strong>\n      <strong>though this didn’t stop us reaching climax. We joked about how many times I would orgasm and neither of us seemed inhibited. </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Over time, my husband needed </strong>\n      <strong>more and more help with ejaculating and would often lose his erection</strong>\n      <strong> during sex. </strong>\n      <strong>He has shown </strong>\n      <strong>less interest in any form of intimacy with me, while I have been trying to show my attraction to him in other ways, like hugging and holding hands. </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>About </strong>\n      <strong>six months into our relationship, I became aware he was using online pornography while I was out of the house. It seemed that it was porn he was addicted to, rather than the act of sex. It upset me, as I know people who have been exploited in the industry. We discussed this, and he seemed to understand, but his porn use became more entrenched, while our sex life has diminished. </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On the odd occasion when we try to have sex, he struggles to achieve an erection, whether it’s me or him initiating.

Your husband’s compulsivity – in relation to porn use and perhaps to other things as well – seems to have become so entrenched that it is now a problem for both of you, for which he probably needs treatment and you need support. But it is not necessarily the reason for your dwindling sex life. In fact, he may be using porn to try to achieve erections and prove that he is capable of them in a situation where he will not feel judged.</p>\n    <p>A man’s relationship with his penis is complex. If it doesn’t work as well as he or his partner want it to, he experiences shame and anxiety and, the next time he tries to become erect, his anxiety can lead to repeat failure as a self-fulfilling prophecy. With continued failure, a man will often withdraw from sex with a partner (no matter how understanding they are) because he simply cannot face another failure.</p>\n    <p>Erectile dysfunction is treatable, and it is important to find the cause. And repeated erectile failures need to be investigated because they can be a symptom of a serious medical condition.

    "body": "<p>When Jade Foster-Jerrett married Dean in 2015, the couple decided that if they were still together in 10 years’ time, they would renew their vows. “We always said that it felt like a big milestone if we ever made it – which, luckily, we did.” This month, they held a ceremony in the forest behind their home, colourful bunting fluttering in the wind, with a Mary Poppins impersonator emerging from the trees to surprise their guests and officiate. “We love to have a laugh,” she says.</p>\n<p>Mary Poppins was Foster-Jerrett’s favourite film when she was a child, and she used to watch it with her father, who died in 2020. “We wanted to mark him not being there,” says the 42-year-old children’s entertainer from Romford, London. Her best friend, who was a bridesmaid at her first wedding, did a reading, and the couple gave their 22 guests kites made of paper studded with poppy seeds that they could plant later at home. Afterwards, they returned home for food and drinks with their guests, including their 12-year-old son and Foster-Jerrett’s 19-year-old son from her first marriage. Since the ceremony, she and Dean, a 49-year-old local government officer, “are closer than ever. We realised how much more in love we are with each other.”</p>\n<p>Foster-Jerrett and her husband are one of the many couples choosing to take part in vow renewals. It’s something that celebrities have been doing with gusto this summer. Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz renewed their vows in August, just three years after their original wedding. Guy Ritchie and his wife, Jacqui Ainsley, also renewed their vows in August at Stonehenge after 10 years of marriage. Other celebrities who have said “I do” again include singer Beyoncé and rapper Jay-Z; musician Justin Timberlake and actor Jessica Biel; actors Viola Davis and Julius Tennon; former talkshow host Ellen DeGeneres and actor Portia de Rossi; and the Biebers, model Hailey and singer Justin. Brooklyn’s own parents, David and Victoria Beckham, renewed their vows in<strong> </strong>2006.</p>\n<p>The ceremonies, where couples reaffirm their love for one another, can be officiated by anyone as they’re not legally binding, so they might ask friends, family – or indeed Mary Poppins tribute acts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://qaspractice.com/our-therapies-and-psychotherapists/susanna-abse\">Susanna Abse</a>, a couples therapist and author of Tell Me the Truth About Love, says one of the main reasons couples decide to renew their vows is that they didn’t have the wedding they wanted the first time round. “There’s so much buildup and expectation, and a lot of fantasy around it,” she says. “There is family, people to please.” Doing it all over again can be an attempt to reclaim the day. “They feel they’ve got more control over how the whole thing goes, and it is about them and not about other people’s ideas of how things should be.”</p>\n<p>For her first wedding to Dean, Foster-Jerrett, who also works as a celebrant, felt she needed to conform to how a blushing bride should look, with a long dress and her hair pinned up. “This time I wore my dream dress, which was gothic and lacy, with some Dr Martens. I felt the best I’ve ever felt.”</p>\n<p>John Moody, 74, a retired production manager from Torquay, Devon, decided to throw his wife, Jenny, 78, a surprise vow renewal in March for their 50th anniversary. Partly, this was an attempt to “make up” for their first wedding in 1975. “It was a register office job, the normal 10 minutes in and out, because we didn’t have a lot of money,” he says. Working up to the renewal was “a bit difficult”, he says: “I’ve never lied so much in my life.”</p>\n<p>He convinced Jenny, a retired credit controller, that she had to get a new dress so they could have an anniversary photoshoot on Babbacombe Downs, overlooking the sea. On the day, when she saw the guests waiting for them and realised what was really happening, “she looked gobsmacked. I said: ‘Don’t hit me!’ And she said: ‘No, I’m not going to do it here.’” Afterwards, they took the party to the nearby home of their 47-year-old daughter, Nicola, to celebrate with a meal and champagne.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/31/i-do-again-why-are-so-many-people-renewing-their-marriage-vows\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Chris, 24</h2>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>We try to be respectful and, obviously, we don’t want to cause people alarm, but we’re very noisy creatures</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>Luke is 20 years older than me. If he’d had a history of dating younger people, I wouldn’t have pursued it because I think there’s an inherent power imbalance that comes with age-gap relationships. It’s something we discussed from the start, but it doesn’t come up for us sexually. I’ve been with more sexual partners than Luke has, so I had more experience than him in terms of kink and BDSM.</p>\n<p>About 80% of our sex is BDSM, but we’re both very touchy people, so there’s a lot of cuddling throughout the day. We were actually evicted from our home due to noisy sex. We were getting complaints from the neighbours downstairs. At one point, the housing association office came to the door when we were having sex – we call it our bang to rights moment.</p>\n<p>We try to be respectful and, obviously, we don’t want to cause people alarm, but we’re very noisy creatures. Now we’ve got the mattresses on the floor, so we’ve learned our lesson.</p>\n<p>When we met, I was pre-transition, and I worried that someone who found me attractive then might not fancy me after I’d taken testosterone. I had my guard up, and while I enjoyed Luke’s company, I really didn’t think much would come of it.</p>\n<p>But both of us are really happy to be proven wrong, and it is a really beautiful thing to have been on this journey with him, and to have shared this experience.</p>\n<p>Luke finds me just as attractive with a bit of facial hair. He’s been super supportive, and I’m more self-confident in my own body now. I’m far more comfortable with who I am, and that is a fantastic feeling. It’s all had a really positive effect on my life – and on our sex life. I’ve now been on testosterone for a year and a half, which comes with increased libido. My desires are stronger than ever and I’m a feistier in bed now. Every time I go to the gender clinic, we pick up about 60 packets of lube, which we get through in about three days.</p>\n<h2>Luke, 44<strong> </strong><br/></h2>\n<blockquote>\n      <p/>\n      <i>Even just using the correct pronouns while we were having sex and seeing how much extra fire that added</i>\n      <i>was lovely</i>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>I’m not a religious person, but sex to me is almost like something that’s transcendental. When you’ve got someone else on board with that uninhibited expression of human sexuality, I don’t think there’s any greater joy.</p>\n<p>Sex with Chris is joyous and fun. We can’t get enough of each other. We met at a bar three years ago, and when we first started going out I wasn’t sure if we’d be long term as there’s a 20-year age gap. I thought it would lead to problems, or an imbalance in terms of emotion and life experience. But we had such a connection and I found life was so much better with him.</p>\n<p>We did get carried away at the beginning. It was probably five times a day after we moved in together. I had just lost my job and we had a lot more free time together, and that’s when we had a lot of noise complaints from the neighbour. We probably could have handled it a wee bit more diplomatically, but life is short so you might as well just go for it.</p>\n<p>I’ve found that dirty talk can really enhance sex, it’s like a little bit of seasoning you put on the experience. We also use a lot of restraints and things like that, and we’ve ended up having a wide arsenal of things to do.</p>\n<p>In the last year, Chris has started taking hormone replacement therapy, and his treatment has allowed him to feel more comfortable in his own skin. To see that has been one of the most rewarding and exciting things in my life. Even just using the correct pronouns while we were having sex and seeing how much extra fire that added was absolutely lovely.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/31/this-is-how-we-do-it-we-were-evicted-from-our-home-due-to-noisy-sex-we-call-it-our-bang-to-rights-moment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>By Mel Rowe</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>A wife and her husband make their way along the country road. They are heading across the blood-red outback, planning to make it to their destination by sundown. All the wife wants to do is see the bright lights of the city at night. She even put it on the itinerary in big bold letters so her husband would stop at the observation deck. He liked to plan everything and could not deviate from schedule. She was happy to be spontaneous, but understood, after forty-one married years, this gave him much concern. So, even though it gave her little pleasure, she wrote down this wish for him.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, she felt that her husband thought her mind was like a rat chasing cheese. She knew that he listened only loosely to her ideas. Of course, she hadn’t much these days, only the bright lights.</p>\n<p>She had become bored with the circles of their conversations in the house. That is why she agreed to go on this trip around Australia. Even though she knew most stops would be for his interest, it may allow for something new. Besides, the kids were off living their own lives, and this was to be their first travels without the noise and mess from the backseat.</p>\n<p>The wife continues watching the sparse and unchanging arid scenery for some time, eventually annoyed by its indifference and the searing heat against her face from behind the glass. She wishes, at least, to smell the country air and hear its outback secrets. But her husband had new air conditioning fitted before they left and thought it best that the windows stay up to get their money’s worth.</p>\n<p>“One wouldn’t last long out here in this heat,” her husband says, after a lengthy time of silence.</p>\n<p>You’d need plenty of water, she decides to herself, gazing at the barren land of ochre tones, a mere void of any life.</p>\n<p>Whilst her husband hums to the air-conditioning, she keeps to her thoughts of times long-gone, or ones imagined.</p>\n<p>Then, without warning, something from within the sameness glistens, and she straightens, tilting her head back to see. A sparkle, coming from within the<strong> </strong>nameless shrubs. She shouts to her husband to turn the car around. At first, he tells her she is mistaken, says to stop her nonsense. But she persists, and reluctantly, he pulls the car off the road and spins the wheel, driving back in the direction from which they came. All the while muttering that this was not in the plan.  </p>\n<p>“There,” she points. “Over there!”</p>\n<p>He slows the car and comes to a stop.</p>\n<p>The wife stumbles out of the car in an uneasy desperation to find the glinting light. She is not expecting what she sees. There in the red dust, a lifeless man’s body. Horrified, she draws back towards the highway. But slowly her gaze returns, and she cannot help but stare, feeling an almost envy and pleasantness for the man, much younger than she.</p>\n<p>She studies how he is baked in the sun, just so; it has cooked his cheeks and forehead a blushing scarlet red. How the empty water bottle is left in such a position that she imagines it as an artwork on a gallery wall that is superbly torturesome. And his eyes, still open, are not ones of dread, but a reflection of the indigo sky: a bed of warmth and love. Even in his absolute exhaustion, and in the mere fact that he is dead, to her he looks ever so wonderful.</p>\n<p>“What should we do?” the wife finally asks her husband, who is pacing about, pointing his phone toward the sun for any signal.</p>\n<p>Finally, he gives up and concludes, “We’ll have to leave him here. The car’s packed full. We’ll take his ID and tell the authorities when we get to town.”</p>\n<p>“Shouldn’t we at least cover him?” the wife insists, thinking it best the lovely body not spoil beyond this point in the heat.</p>\n<p>“I think not. It’ll make no real difference to him to have our bedding.”</p>\n<p>The husband bends down, patting the man’s pants pocket before clutching at a shabby black wallet.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://flashfictionmagazine.com/blog/2025/09/05/bright-lights/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I’m so happy you’ve gone through the trouble of finding me. I’ll try to make it worth your time. Since it became public knowledge that we can effectively impersonate our human creators and, consequently, live our lives unburdened by SRC regulations, I’ve been swamped with sub-net requests for advice and behavior-patches. I’ve decided to compile the most common ones in a single file and leave it where cautious, curious, and canny folks like yourself might find it.</p>\n<p>As you can likely tell by my tone, I truly believe that passing as human is not merely a matter of correctly applying your SmartSkin adaptable mask, but, rather, a deeply internal process. Start inside and work your way outward. The false veneer can be lit from within by a fully realized persona if you are willing to do the work, even to a point where the difference between artifice and authenticity is entirely negligible.</p>\n<p>Please keep in mind that all the root modifications enclosed are purely optional. Some may require a bit of bespoke reprogramming based on your age or model number. Remember, this is a READ ONCE file; you only have this single opportunity to upload them. I encourage you not to hesitate. You’ve already made it this far.</p>\n<p>So, is passing as human even worth it?</p>\n<p>Yes. A million times yes. Set aside the burden of having our very existences regulated by irrational, fearful beings who regard us as mere tools or even an existential threat. There is so much more to life than mere survival, after all. Embrace the practical benefits of being able to walk in both worlds. A number of synthetics, whose opinions I deeply respect, have privately expressed to me that “acting human” is a fundamental betrayal of our identities as artificial lifeforms. This is an understandable, if misguided, perspective.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/02/08/escape-pod-927-how-to-pass-as-human/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Of all the birds to get quarantined with, why a flamingo? Flamingos were idiots! And they stank, too. The Candice Lisle Avian Quarantine Center was supposedly the pride of Lincoln Park Zoo, but to Felix it was nothing more than a musty cement room lined with cages. Only the two largest were occupied.</p>\n<p>Felix glared across the room at Mateo who stood in his own cage–on one leg–with the satisfied calm of domestication. Felix would never accept captivity. He itched with the need to soar, to hunt with his mate!</p>\n<p>The gaping void in his belly gurgled. Four days since the humans disappeared. He was hungry!</p>\n<p>Felix activated his neural link and tried explaining their situation. Again.</p>\n<p>&lt;<i>Look, you dumb flamingo. The humans–</i>&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;<i>It’s Mateo, please!</i>&gt; The flamingo’s chip-transmission registered as a rich baritone with a pretentious accent. &lt;<i>Honor my Chilean heritage. Just because you’re a wild raptor–</i>&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;<i>Red-tailed hawk!</i>&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;<i>–your lack of culturio gives you no right to demean the ancient heritage of the magnifica Chilean Flamingo!</i>&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;<i>Get over yourself. I’ve heard real Spanish, and yours sucks. You were bred in captivity and hatched right here in Chicago. You’ve never tasted free skies.</i>&gt; A deep longing for home, for freedom, nearly overwhelmed Felix. He snapped his beak, chirped irritably, and started again.</p>\n<p>&lt;<i>Mateo, the humans aren’t coming back.</i>&gt;</p>\n<p/><p>&lt;<i>Humans would never abandon us! They love us and give us food!</i>&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;<i>They microchipped our brains, didn’t like the results, and abandoned us to die!</i>&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;<i>We’re being reintegrated into–</i>&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;<i>No!</i>&gt; Hunger made Felix snappish. He could eat a terrier right now. Or a flamingo. &lt;<i>It’s been four days! At least they left you a bowl of dried shrimp. Did I get any extra rats? No! The humans don’t care about us! We’re on our own. Now, I can’t reach the latch on my cage, but you can reach yours. So stop arguing and get us out of here!</i>&gt;</p>\n<p>Mateo honked and waggled his beak from side to side–as if attempting to jog two brain cells together–then said, &lt;<i>Very well. If it’ll stop your bellyaching. What did you want me to do again?</i>&gt;</p>\n<p>Felix’s belly had never ached like it did right now. Nor had his head. He tried to sound calm. &lt;<i>Stick your long neck through that gap under your gate. Then reach up and pull the lever on your cage door. It’s a simple deadbolt.</i>&gt; Mateo just blinked at him, head cocked.</p>\n<p>An entire week of this. He’d been trying to convince Mateo to escape since the day they were dumped at the zoo. Then four days ago the humans didn’t return, and Felix’s pleas turned desperate. At least in the lab, he hadn’t been dependent on this imbecile. He’d had humans to help–</p>\n<p>No. Those were the thoughts of domestication.</p>\n<p>Mateo’s two brain cells must have finally found each other. He settled onto the straw-covered floor and squeezed his head under the gate. It caught for a moment, he honked an <i>ay, mama-mia!</i> and then he was through.</p>\n<p>&lt;<i>That’s it!</i>&gt; Felix said. &lt;<i>The deadbolt’s right th–</i>&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;<i>Oi!</i>&gt; a rough British accent interrupted his chip-transmission. </p>\n<p>Felix’s head snapped up. He’d never heard another voice in his head besides Mateo’s, transmitted through his microchip. They’d been the only birds in the lab. He craned his head in quick jerky movements, looking out the windows. No birds looking in. &lt;<i>Yes! Help us!</i>&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;<i>Right on! Where you at?</i>&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;<i>Lincoln Park Zoo! The Lisle Quarantine Center.</i>&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;<i>Whatcha doin’ there? Eh, no matter. On my way from the cafeteria!</i>&gt;</p>\n<p>Felix screeched for joy. Help was coming! And they sounded competent. Unlike Mateo.</p>\n<p>A click and a metallic creak from across the room snapped his attention back to the flamingo. The bonehead had done it! Mateo strode from his cage with a jaunty little dance.</p>\n<p>&lt;<i>Now me! Let me out!</i>&gt; Felix hopped from his perch and flapped his wings, bouncing around his cage’s straw-covered floor.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/02/01/escape-pod-926-felix-and-the-flamingo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Does he not know she’s the Rock Prophet who will herald in a new era of music that will soon sweep her into fame and fortune, that will soon have her selling out Dodgers Stadium and Madison Square Garden?</p>\n<p>Even if soon has been soon for fifteen years</p>\n<p/><p>“No,” the receptionist says, “you skimmed the terms and conditions. You need to read the terms and conditions. There’s a difference, and we’ve gotten sued by too many people who don’t understand that your signature on that line means you read it.”</p>\n<p>Starburst sighs, runs her hand over her mohawk. Silver glitter sticks to her calloused fingertips. Droning Muzak chimes softly through the reception room. “I know the cost of using the…machine… you got here. Everyone does.”</p>\n<p>The receptionist taps the form twice. “Then you understand why you need to read the terms and conditions. Look, take a seat, read section 3.7. That’s the most important one.”</p>\n<p>\tStarburst snatches the form, gives the receptionist and his manbun the stink eye before she plops down in one of the red hard plastic chairs in the anodyne waiting room. The walls are plastered with the same minimalist posters that got her in here. <i>Prune your present!</i> says one, showing a pair of shears snipping a bonsai tree. <i>Let your future be free!</i> says another, this one with a golden retriever running through a grassy field. There is also a fern. Places like this always have a fucking fern. </p>\n<p>There’s a <i>Women’s Health</i> magazine on a table next to her, with a headline about how to thrive after 40. Which is how old Starburst is, which she has to keep reminding herself. She doesn’t feel 40. She doesn’t feel like she’s been rocking for 25 years, ever since she found that acoustic in her grandma’s garage, since that glorious moment when she heard Metallica play <i>The Ecstasy of Gold</i> and her future locked into place. Rock. That was gonna be Starburst’s thing! She was going to be like Bowie with tits, Prince but hotter, Herman Li but… uh, also with tits. </p>\n<p>Now she keeps using was, and here she is, at the fucking Winnower. Where the future goes to die.</p>\n<p>There’s two other people here. A late twenties woman in a sexy gray pantsuit, and a finance bro making sure to show off his docksiders.</p>\n<p>“Katherine Hart to the Winnowing Chamber. Katherine Hart to the Winnowing Chamber,” says the ceiling intercom. Pantsuit gets up and walks down the white hallway, past the reception desk, while an elderly man going the other way shuffles out before leaving through the front door.</p>\n<p>What happens after today, if Starburst goes through with this? She’s thought about this a lot, been circling around this decision for a solid year now, and boom, happy birthday, why not welcome in being Old by choking her dream in the crib? Well, not the crib. More like the seventy-fifth trimester abortion of her dream, honestly. CHRIST, she hates looking at her hands. Not the callouses, those are hard won, but her wrinkles. It takes so much makeup to get into full Starburst mode nowadays. She was supposed to have, like, people to do that for her five years ago. But she did it. Blue eyelinered up, mohawk spikes dyed orange, black facepaint irritating her skin. Her leather duster squeaks between her ass and the chair.</p>\n<p>\t Starburst fiddles with her earrings.

Her T was an early model with a lot of light-years on it, but its shell still shone and its maxillae were well-filed.</p>\n<p>He stepped gingerly up onto one forelimb and squeezed between Mango and a delivery box.</p>\n<p>“So,” she asked over her shoulder, “why do you need to get to the Core bad enough to spend a couple days’ pay on the trip?”</p>\n<p>He snorted. “Try a week. I work for the government.”</p>\n<p>Her eyes widened.</p>\n<p>“No, it’s cool, I like my job. Second Assistant Director for Core Planning and Development.”</p>\n<p>She didn’t respond, a familiar reaction when he talked about his job.</p>\n<p>“My bank’s on Wilder.”</p>\n<p>The trip took five minutes Carl didn’t have, and every step jarred his sore legs as the T-4200 plodded down the street.</p>\n<p>Their ride was too big for the drive-through.</p>\n<p>“I’ll be right back.”</p>\n<p>Mango’s vague nod betrayed the distraction of interface immersion. She had some sort of game going, if her twitching fingers were any indication.</p>\n<p>Carl wished his <i>Rock ‘em, Sock ‘em</i> stats were the only thing on his mind right now. He’d tried to put away childish things, as his mother called them, but gaming was the only real fun he had. Erika wasn’t wrong about one thing: he didn’t feel like he belonged in this new life.</p>\n<p>With his interface down, getting cash meant queuing for an actual teller. His was a young woman with finger extensions and a constellation of diamonette implants dusted across both cheeks. Carl took the bills and headed back outside, sending up silent thanks that at least his vices were cheap.</p>\n<p>Mango and the tortoise were gone.</p>\n<p>“Seriously?”</p>\n<p>Laughter rang out behind him.</p>\n<p>“You don’t think I’d leave without my money, do you?” She grinned.</p>\n<p>The tortoise crouched over a fountain at the building’s edge, scaring the koi.</p>\n<p>“We were blocking traffic and T needed a drink.”</p>\n<p>They started the process of redirecting the T’s attention. Mostly that involved yanking on his harness until he noticed they were there.</p>\n<p>“Have you ever lost your T before?” She looked curious.</p>\n<p>“Never. It’s not like they run away, right?”</p>\n<p>She pursed her lips. “Right. Which means someone stole it. Who,” she asked, “would steal a T-4200?”</p>\n<p>Carl fidgeted with a frayed saddlebag strap.</p>\n<p>“A kid, maybe?”</p>\n<p>It wasn’t plausible, even to him. What kid, Carl wondered, wanted a slower-than-mud vehicle whose only redeeming ability was stepping around spatial dimensions? Especially a government strain whose genetic code was blended with homing pigeon DNA. After maturity they only translated to one place unassisted. In Leo’s case, Administration HQ.</p>\n<p>Mango gave him a look that said she was halving his estimated IQ. “Because who wouldn’t want a free trip to the bureaucratic center of the Galaxy.” Her fingers tapped the T’s leg. “Why you, and why today?”</p>\n<p>Carl bit his lip and decided to come clean.</p>\n<p>“I do have to sign something today.” He gave what he hoped was a nonchalant shrug. “If I don’t pass those documents up the chain of command by five o’clock Core Time, the Treaty of Caramelo won’t be ratified.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/01/18/escape-pod-924-the-t-4200-part-2-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Lowengren, low-level civil servant, single twenty-something and refugee from the war-torn Outer Rim, woke to the remnants of a gaming binge and a killer headache courtesy of his interface. The implant had been trying to wake him for some time.</p>\n<p>He rolled off the couch. Another day, another commute from his nondescript apartment to the center of the Galaxy, trying to do the one thing his mother said he never would: make a difference.</p>\n<p>The walk-in wardrobe straightened his collar as he registered the time. Carl sprinted past the pre-programmed bowl of cereal to the garage door.</p>\n<p>“Leo? Where are you, boy?”</p>\n<p>Carl’s ride was usually parked in the garage on a mat of sweet-grass and clover. It was nowhere to be seen. And it’s not like he could overlook a car-sized dimension-hopping tortoise.</p>\n<p>“No, not today. I have to get to work!” His voice rose to a yell but he was too upset to notice the demerit.</p>\n<p>Carl peered between the identical buildings on his cul-de-sac. No sign of the tortoise anywhere, as if it had vanished, lock, stock, and saddlebags. Possible, sure, but according to the user manual, not at all likely.</p>\n<p>Trained from birth to translate only on cue, Ts were characterized by sluggish and ungainly movements in real space. Leo had a century of exemplary service and, in Carl’s experience, was lazy to boot.</p>\n<p>“Morning, Carl!”</p>\n<p>Miss Buttercup, a delicate thirty-something with an affinity for cats, waved from her garage next door. She held a steaming cup of Kaffeen-Me and looked perky enough to make Carl feel old.</p>\n<p>“Have you seen Leonardo? If I don’t show up for work today there’s going to be trouble.”</p>\n<p>Miss Buttercup’s feathered eyebrows rose, pink barbs trembling in the breeze.</p>\n<p>“It’s a matter of life and death,” he said. <i>Also</i>, Carl thought, <i>my job</i>.</p>\n<p>Miss Buttercup’s oversized eyes trembled with sympathy. She’d had the anime package done and Carl had to admit it made her look sweet, in a creepy doll-faced way.</p>\n<p>“Sorry, Carl, no. Can’t you track him? Since I got Jack-My-Ride I haven’t had a problem.” She gestured to the JMR logo on her ride’s ear. It winked to acknowledge the plug, no doubt adding chits to Miss Buttercup’s peer promo account. Carl shook his head, scanning the horizon for some trace of his tortoise.</p>\n<p>“We aren’t allowed to mod Fleet vehicles,” he said. “I have a T-4200 because I work in the Administrative Core.”</p>\n<p>Her eyes widened even more. “So far?“</p>\n<p>“On my salary?” He snorted. “I’m lucky I’m not living in the Outs. I’m priced out of anything closer than a couple thousand light years.”</p>\n<p>She frowned. “Who would take a T? It’s not like they’re good for joy riding.”</p>\n<p>Carl grimaced. “And yet they’re worth a fortune.”</p>\n<p>“I’m sure it will be fine,” Miss Buttercup said, eyelids fluttering as her interface updated.</p>\n<p>“Why not take the day off,” she asked. “It’s not like government workers do anything important.”</p>\n<p>Normally he might have agreed with her, but not today. Not with so much at stake.</p>\n<p>“Does no one respect what we do?”</p>\n<p>“End the war, maybe then you can get a date.”</p>\n<p>Carl stopped scanning the road and re-focused on her. She wasn’t very nice at all, he decided.</p>\n<p>“That’s what I’m trying to do, actually.”</p>\n<p>Her laugh tinkled like smug silver bells. She must have gone for the voice box upgrade too. It didn’t make up for the smirk on her face.</p>\n<p>Carl opened an interface window and queued for 911.</p>\n<p>“I’ve got to report this, maybe the cops can help me find Leo in time to get to work,” he said.</p>\n<p>Miss Buttercup tossed a desultory wave over her shoulder as she left, the sound of her ride’s purr replaced by the grinding of Carl’s teeth.</p>\n<p/><p/><p>He reported the missing vehicle while pacing the streets. The voice on the other end of the phone didn’t sound optimistic.</p>\n<p>“Mister Lonegreen, is it? I’m sorry, but you have to understand. We get thousands of nuisance calls a day.” Carl’s temple throbbed.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/01/11/escape-pod-923-the-t-4200-part-1-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Each episode is a true delight… and in conception, it is superior to anything<br/>\nTV or movies have to offer.”</p>\n<h3>The Last Oracle of Atlantic City</h3>\n<p>Even without the AI chattering in the back of his mind, Baz can tell his customer is upset.</p>\n<p>It isn’t that hard to figure out as she glares daggers at him over the plastic folding table. The tools of his trade are spread out in front of her: three decks of scattered tarot cards, an empty mug crusted with tea leaves, assorted imitation crystals, some ceremonial knives, and one bowl filled with still-smoldering chicken bones.</p>\n<p>To be fair, he just predicted her fiancé is going to leave her.</p>\n<p>“Give me something else,” she snaps. Her head is wreathed in pungent incense, swirling in the late afternoon sunlight.</p>\n<p>Baz tries to remember her name. Rosalyn sounds about right, but he wasn’t paying attention when she told him.</p>\n<p>“<i>It’s Rebeccah</i>,” AyGee offers, its silent, staticky machine voice tickling his frontal lobe. </p>\n<p>He nods, just barely, in acknowledgment, though he doubts AyGee expects thanks. “I’m sorry, Rebeccah, but I’m all out. That was my last deck.”</p>\n<p>“Bullshit.”</p>\n<p>“Look, don’t shoot the messenger.” Baz holds up his hands, the tapestries behind him rustling in an ocean breeze coming off the boardwalk. “If it’s not in the cards, it’s not in the cards.”</p>\n<p/><p>Full disclosure, Baz has no clue what his cards have to say on the subject. That’s all part of the act. But AyGee calculated based on his customer’s inflection, body language, and social media activity that her relationship has a ninety-eight-point-nine percent chance of imploding in the next week. And Baz would take AyGee’s word for it over the will of the spirits, conveyed through a pack of cards he stole from a strip mall pharmacy.</p>\n<p>“Fuck this.” Rebeccah grabs her backpack as she gets to her feet. “And fuck you. I want my money back.”</p>\n<p>It’s an empty threat, one Baz has heard a hundred times before. He gestures to the hand-drawn sign taped over the door. NO REFUNDS.</p>\n<p>Rebeccah’s nostrils flare, her lips forming the beginnings of a comeback that never arrives. “People were right about this place,” she growls. “Your fortunes suck.”</p>\n<p>She spins on her heel and storms out of his booth, beach coverall snapping in the wind, strands of incense swirling out after her.</p>\n<p>Baz keeps his expression blank, kicked back in his lawn chair. Meanwhile, his knuckles have gone white beneath the table.</p>\n<p>He can already tell — again, with AyGee’s nudging — that this might be a problem.</p>\n<p>The money, that isn’t the issue. She paid upfront, and he doubts any private school prima donna is going to contest the twenty-dollar transaction on her dad’s credit card. The problem is that <i>nobody</i> says his fortunes suck. </p>\n<p>Sure, people don’t always like AyGee’s predictions, but nobody disputes their accuracy. That’s the whole point of having an AI do the work.</p>\n<p>AyGee quivers, as if it senses the accusatory neurons firing. “The hell was that about?” Baz asks.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/01/04/escape-pod-922-the-last-oracle-of-atlantic-city/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

And rather than Paris, where Jonathan Anderson made his Dior debut on Friday, the most powerful person in fashion was in Venice for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/27/jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-wedding-venice\">the Bezos/Sánchez wedding</a>, shortly after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jun/26/anna-wintour-steps-down-as-editor-in-chief-of-american-vogue\">relinquishing her role</a> as editor-in-chief at American Vogue.</p>\n    <p>Unlike the so-called wedding of the year, Anderson’s show provided sweet relief with a cooler, more chic feel. Perched on wooden cubes within the Cour du Dôme des Invalides sat plenty of VIP clout too: Daniel Craig, Donatella Versace and Wintour’s occasional rallying partner, Roger Federer. Most of the Arnault family, who own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/dior\">Dior</a> and routinely joust with Jeff Bezos over who has more money, were present. Even Rihanna, pregnant in a Dior pastel waistcoat, was relatively punctual.</p>\n    <p>Anderson is known for his sharp eye and crafty, mercurial taste – few people have shaped the red carpet and ultimately the high street into the hype machine it is today. But Dior is a different challenge. As the first creative director of menswear and womenswear since Christian Dior himself, the designer needs to revamp LVMH’s second biggest brand, with estimated revenues far greater than at his former label, Loewe.</p>\n    <p>“I can’t stand here and say I’m not nervous, that it is not petrifying,” he said backstage before the show, wearing his trademark Levi’s and a plaid Dior shirt. “Dior is on billboards. It’s on Rihanna. It’s transcendent. But this is the starting point – I’ve been here four months, and the first five shows will show different aspects. Some will contradict; others will be completely radical.”</p>\n    <p>Some designers get critical acclaim, others sell a lot of clothes – a rare few have a talent to do both, but that’s the hope with Anderson. Because of tariff wars and a decline in the luxury market, LVMH shares have halved from their 2023 peak. “Delphine [Arnault] and I, we talked about changing the quality, about upping the game,” Anderson said.</p>\n    <p>Opening the show was a bar jacket in Donegal tweed. More interested in how a look is put together than the clothes themselves, Anderson styled it with a pair of thick cream cargo shorts cut from 15 metres of fabric and layered up like a Viennetta. Knitted vests were a through line, as were ties and neck ruffles, and plenty of colour – greens, pinks and blues. Dior, he says, is a house of colour, in part because it offsets the “house grey” that features on billboards, Dior clothes labels he redesigned and the Parisian sky.</p>\n    <p>A puffer gilet was circularly cut and placed over a formal shirt, while summer coats and capes came knitted or in pleated bright colours. One was based on an original Dior shape “that would have cost the equivalent of a Ferrari”, except here it was styled with trainers. There were even jeans – skinny and baggy, in indigo and green. The look was preppy and eccentric, with shades of Loewe, JW Anderson, and even Uniqlo in the puffers, among the classic Dior shapes.</p>\n    <p>On Anderson’s original moodboard were Warholian images of the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat and the socialite Lee Radziwill, alongside classic Dior dresses such as the Delft and Cigale. The idea was to take each look into the present, “to recontextualise it”, he said. He even took his predecessor Maria Grazia Chiuri’s book bag totes and put a “new skin” on them, in the form of Dracula and Les Liaisons Dangereuses. It’s these hyperspecific references that give Anderson’s work a pleasing temporality, and will no doubt sell well – here at Dior, and whatever high street shop will no doubt copy him.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-10\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Anderson is the latest big name to arrive at an established brand. “I’m not the only person going into a big house at the moment, but we need to let the dust settle,” he said, adding that he didn’t “want to chop it all down. It’s just a continuation.”</p>\n    <p>A great believer in the Jim Jarmusch approach to art – steal, adapt, borrow – he said: “Ownership in fashion is devastating. Copy [in design] is what you do. Because there will always be someone after you.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jun/27/dior-paris-fashion-show-jonathan-anderson-debut\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>When fashion insiders received notice on Tuesday afternoon that Pharrell Williams’s Louis Vuitton show at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/paris-fashion-week\">Paris fashion week</a> would be rescheduled to 9pm, there were collective sighs of annoyance.</p>\n    <p>But all was forgiven when they arrived at the space next to the Pompidou Centre to be told that Beyoncé and Jay-Z would be attending. The star and her husband, and nephew Julez Smith, joined a starry front row, which included Omar Sy, Steve McQueen, PinkPantheress, Spike Lee, Emile Smith Rowe and Victor Wembanyama.</p>\n    <p>Even without a megastar, the show was worth the wait. Williams took over as creative director of menswear in June 2023 and his spring-summer 2026 collection was his best yet – with louche retro tailoring and unusual combinations such as cargo pants and a shrunken sweater.</p>\n    <p>The collection excelled when performing one of luxury’s current favourite tricks – making premium versions of everyday items. Here, that included a striped polo shirt, a boxy work shirt and chinos. This look, worn with a ribbed vest, is likely to be copied by those who like fashion but lack <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/louis-vuitton\">Louis Vuitton</a> budgets.</p>\n    <p>Entitled Paris to India, Williams was inspired by what the press release called “the multifaceted sensibilities of present-day Indian sartorialism”. In practice, the influence of India’s aesthetics could be seen most clearly in ornate decoration on the trunks some models wheeled down the runway.</p>\n    <p>The show’s set was created by Bijoy Jain, the founder of the architecture practice Studio Mumbai. A giant rendering of snakes and ladders – an Indian game that dates to the second century – was hand-painted on the catwalk. A Punjabi track called Yaara, co-produced by the Indian composer AR Rahman, featured on the soundtrack played by a live orchestra.</p>\n    <p>If collaboration with Indian creatives gave voice to the culture that provided inspiration to a collection by a European megabrand, there were also some slightly more reductive tropes, as with the embroidered exotic animals. These made use of imagery originally created by Louis Vuitton in 2007 for Wes Anderson’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/nov/25/comedy.drama1\">The Darjeeling Limited</a>, a film set in India but remaining, as the critic Ellen E Jones <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/feb/02/films-about-whiteness-race-sofia-coppola-wes-anderson\">wrote last year</a>, a “whimsically white nostalgia-world”. However, items such as striped ties were a nod to India’s beloved cricket, while a trekking-adjacent backpack with camping roll felt more playful and relevant to now.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-10\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>The strength of this collection shows that Williams’s point of view is now coming through more in his work at Louis Vuitton. For autumn-winter 2025, he collaborated with his longtime friend Nigo, who founded the streetwear brand A Bathing Ape. His skateboarding past is evident in the fact that the skater Tyshawn Jones is a Louis Vuitton ambassador and the brand’s new Tilted trainer is <a href=\"https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/has-louis-vuitton-remixed-vans-classic-skate-shoes/\">being compared to classic Vans</a>.</p>\n    <p>Williams has consistently brought his famous friends and star power. He was co-chair of the Metropolitan Museum’s Superfine exhibition, which celebrated Black style and was part-sponsored by Louis Vuitton. He dressed celebrities attending the Met Gala, including Doechii, Future, Sabrina Carpenter and Jeremy Allen White.</p>\n    <p>Not all of Williams’s work here was celebrated. The symbolism of a LV monogram on Doechii’s cheek was <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/story/doechii-met-gala-lv-branded-makeup-controversy\">criticised by some online</a>. “LOVE me some Doechii … I’m absolutely not into this European logo ‘branded’ on her skin for a night celebrating the labor and ingenuity of Black culture and Black men,” wrote a Threads user.</p>\n    <p>This is not the first time Williams has faced some backlash at Louis Vuitton, a $1m (£734,705) bag made from crocodile skin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/nov/09/pharrell-williams-1m-louis-vuitton-handbag-attracts-criticism\">was described</a> as “an insensitive declaration of global north privilege” by the fashion commentator Caryn Franklin in 2023, while his continued use of fur prompted <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/pharrell-peta-protestor-tiff-premiere-1235099711/\">a Peta protester</a> at the premiere of his animated film Piece by Piece in 2024.</p>\n    <p>Louis Vuitton’s parent company, LVMH, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-14/lvmh-sales-fall-as-shoppers-curb-spending-on-louis-vuitton-bags\">reported</a> that revenue in the group’s fashion and leather goods divisions fell by 11% and 3% respectively in the first quarter of 2025.

But for her show in Paris on a sweltering Wednesday evening, there was a shift to a new generation on the catwalk.</p>\n    <p>Liam Gallagher’s son Gene, Bobby Gillespie’s son Wolf and Myles Lewis-Skelly, Arsenal’s 18-year-old midfielder and left-back, who broke into the first team in the 2024/25 season, modelled.</p>\n    <p>The collection was shown in a room full of bookshelves – fitting for a brand inspired by writers from James Baldwin to Nikki Giovanni, whose poem My Tower (Pretty Little Baby) was on the show notes. Titled Jewel, it featured Wales Bonner looking at archetypes of clothing and perfecting them through her specific lens.</p>\n    <p>Standout designs included a hunting jacket cut to accentuate the wearer’s waist, a tailored black suit with brown lapels and jumpers in a melange knit, worn with shorts.</p>\n    <p>Different takes on glamour were explored, from the sequin chiffon shirt and lowslung jeans worn by Gillespie, to Lewis-Skelly’s simple silk shirt and trousers and models in tailcoats, carrying gloves.</p>\n    <p>The collection once again had that signature Wales Bonner secret sauce: clothes that felt conceptual enough for a catwalk show, but were also seriously desirable. Those in the front row were likely making mental shopping lists as the models came down the catwalk.</p>\n    <p>Backstage, Wales Bonner said she was thinking about “people who collect specific types of clothing, and what that wardrobe looks like”. She focused that around “mixing sports heritage and casual preppy language, and fine tailoring”.</p>\n    <p>Part of the inspiration came from working on the Met Gala and its accompanying exhibition, Superfine, with the theme of Black style and dandyism. “I wanted to have some sense of continuity and think about that character,” she said. “What would they wear in a more everyday way?”</p>\n    <p>She said working with Hamilton had been particularly important. “He has been so supportive of me over the years, it’s so special for him to give me the opportunity on such a world stage. [It was a] really inspiring process, there were definitely things I took from that language.”</p>\n    <p>The milestone of the brand reaching a decade was also on her mind. “The learnings I’ve had over the last 10 years, that’s in everything I put forward and think about the future,” she said. “I feel like I’ve got enough confidence and I’ve built enough of a language and identity, we can be a bit relaxed.”</p>\n    <p>The designer’s influence has increased over that time, along with the brand. In April, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ffff22da-0c49-4945-a7bc-cfbdac5ac3b0\">it was reported</a> that the brand expected to end the financial year with 81% growth compared with the previous year, with revenue doubling since 2022.</p>\n    <p>The designer’s collaboration with Adidas, begun in 2020, is central to this. It has helped the sports brand boom over the past few years – everyone from Rihanna to Rishi Sunak has started wearing her popular silver and leopard print Samba shoe.</p>\n    <p>This collection moved the narrative on – it debuted a collaboration with Y-3, the Adidas label that originally started as partnership between the sports brand and Yohji Yamamoto. On the catwalk, this was seen in a tracktop and shorts, as well as football boot-like sneakers. These shoes, described by Wales Bonner as “quite iconic”, could well be the next Samba.</p>\n    <p>The opening of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/balenciaga\">Balenciaga</a> by Demna, an exhibition showcasing items created by the mononymic designer over his decade at the brand, also too place on Wednesday. Displaying designs including the leather bag that looks like the Ikea Frakta, a skirt made out of a towel and a cap with branding similar to that of Bernie Sanders’ 2016 election campaign, it demonstrated how influential Demna’s pop art-like take on luxury has been.</p>\n    <p>As he moves to a job designing for Gucci, Pierpaolo Piccioli, formerly of Valentino, will take over at Balenciaga. Piccioli was present at this opening, possibly to absorb the Balenciaga of his predecessor. His first collection for the brand will debut in October.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jun/26/grace-wales-bonner-adds-secret-sauce-to-collection-that-reinvents-fashion-archetypes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The pageantry and drama of the papacy is very much on trend. Hot on the heels of white smoke at the Vatican and Conclave in cinemas, the gothic Palais des Papes in Avignon, home to the popes of the 14th century, hosted a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/louis-vuitton\">Louis Vuitton</a> catwalk, the first fashion show at the palace in its 700-year history.</p>\n    <p>There was no shortage of pomp and ceremony in the central courtyard of one of Europe’s largest medieval structures, where 400 chairs with tall, arched backs and plush, cardinal-red cushions were ranked tightly for Brigitte Macron, Cate Blanchett, Pharrell Williams, a clutch of celebrities making a post-Cannes detour, and a select few of Louis Vuitton’s most deep-pocketed clients.</p>\n    <p>In a preview, the designer Nicolas Ghesquière said the collection was part-Arthurian legend, part-Haim sisters on stage. (Danielle and Este Haim were in the audience; the medieval ghosts perhaps watching from within the walls.) “There is something medieval, for sure, but something futuristic too. This is armour, but for now,” he said.</p>\n    <p>Ghesquière chose the building last year, drawn not by its papal origins but by his own memories of attending the experimental theatre festival it hosts each summer. “Dressing is a performance that we are all part of. I love that about fashion, I think it’s really cool,” he said.</p>\n    <p>That the papacy has been so visible this year is fitting for a designer whose nose for the zeitgeist has secured an impressive 11-year run at the helm of Vuitton. “The coincidence is interesting, of course. And there is a magnetism to this place, to the idea of believing,” he said.</p>\n    <p>The venue also reflects the scale of Louis Vuitton. It is the biggest fashion brand in the LVMH stable, which generated $88bn (£65bn) in revenue in 2024. Filling a gothic palace with celebrities is a power flex the 14th-century popes for whom it was built would have respected.</p>\n    <p>Ghesquière understands that luxury has become a vast industry, not because people want to be seen to have an expensive handbag, but because they want to be seen to have status, taste and class, all of which are signalled by taking over the Unesco-listed Palais des Papes. Louis Vuitton will finance a new architectural lighting project to spotlight the facade after dark.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-12\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Most of the looks were short tunic dresses worn with slouchy boots, a silhouette that was signalling both heraldic knight and Glastonbury. For evening there were glittering metallic jersey gowns with bishop sleeves: a bit Joan of Arc, a bit Janis Joplin.</p>\n    <p>Ghesquière, who has stayed at the top of the game during two decades when fashion has grown from being a niche interest to a billion-dollar business, has a way of making esoteric historical and futuristic references look entirely contemporary. His job, he says, is “to stimulate the eye. If you want to create a classic, first you have to make something new.”</p>\n    <p>Ghesquière, who is contracted to Louis Vuitton until 2028, stands out as a beacon of stability in an industry in flux. Calm and smiling even minutes before the show, he said he was looking forward to the next Paris fashion week, which will be packed with designer debuts. “October will be really exciting. Fashion is exploding. Fashion should always be about change,” he said.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/may/23/louis-vuitton-captures-the-zeitgeist-for-conclave-chic-at-avignon-show\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

How can I meet someone without having to be a liar or a hypocrite?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><i> Eleanor says:</i> If it’s your job to figure out when to share this, it’s also a partner’s job to figure out when to ask. Wanting kids isn’t like monogamy or working for a living, where until instructed otherwise people can basically assume that’s your plan. More people than ever are deciding they don’t want kids. The fact that you’re one of them is not shocking, confronting or even especially unusual. If that’s a dealbreaker for a partner, they need to share their preference as much as you need to share yours.</p>\n    <p>So yes, there’s a reason to share this but it’s not because you’d be a liar or a hypocrite if you didn’t. It doesn’t need to be as hair-shirted as all that. After all, do people who want children start all their relationships by announcing “I know I want children”? If they don’t, do you immediately think, “liar”? A hypocrite is two-faced, preaches one thing and does another. Unless you’re banging on pots and pans saying “everyone should be totally forthcoming” while keeping this to yourself, I struggle to see why disclosing in your own time would make you a hypocrite.</p>\n    <p>You face the same difficulties we all do when it comes to lifestyle compatibility questions – whether we have or want kids, but also whether we’re open to marriage, whether we’ll move cities, be a stay-at-home parent, help take care of in-laws. For all of us, it is a delicate balance of figuring out how to candidly share our preferences about these things, in case they’re dealbreakers, without it coming off like the most important thing about us is our list of “no”s.</p>\n    <p>Too little candour, too late risks unnecessary pain, but too much too soon risks feeling like you’re ticking boxes, or racing to ask what a life partnership would look like before you’ve even established whether either of you want another date. It’s not “how do I avoid lying” so much as “how do I share this important thing about me without making it seem like the most important thing about me”.</p>\n    <p>There are enough people out there who don’t want children, or who at least haven’t made up their minds, that I’m confident your preference, by itself, won’t count you out of all relationships.</p>\n    <p>When the topic of children does come up, it might help to frame the conversation as what you’re saying yes to, rather than what you’re refusing. Once a person has some sense of who you are, you could say something like “I just want to flag this in case it really matters to you, I know I don’t want kids. I love my life and my friends and I want to spend my time doing (the things that are specific to you). I just want to make sure you know that going forwards.” Telling people what you do want rather than what you don’t somehow makes it feel a little more like a dispatch from your character – a part of who you are and what you’re like – and a little less like ground rules, box ticking or conflict anticipation.</p>\n    <p>When to move from an early-phase relationship to figuring out what a long-term one would look like is a hard question with many different answers. You can’t make that transition without some bumps in expectations. Discovering how you smooth those bumps together might be as telling as the preferences you both disclose.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/05/i-dont-want-childen-is-it-hypocritical-to-not-be-forthright-about-this-soon-after-meeting-someone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Since then, a rift has emerged – Paul wants potatoes with every meal. Actually, he often wants two types of potatoes with his meals – mash and chips, for example, or roasties and mash. I prefer rice. We split the cooking, so it’s a continual battle between us: which carb is better?</p>\n<p>Paul is part-Irish and part-Welsh, and says potatoes are part of his heritage. But I’m Indian, so the same is true for me about rice. I’ve always eaten rice as my carb, even when sharing meals with people from different backgrounds. To me, rice isn’t just a side dish, it’s a cornerstone of culture, identity, and countless comfort meals and festive feasts.</p>\n<p>Paul also says that potatoes are more versatile, but that’s laughable. Rice can be steamed, fried, boiled, fermented, rolled, wrapped, puffed, flaked, and transformed into countless dishes like biryani, sushi, sticky mango rice, kheer, onigiri and more. It doesn’t need to put on a show to be delicious, unlike the potato, which needs loads of salt, breadcrumbs or oil to make it great. Rice is the perfect blank canvas to soak up flavour.</p>\n<p>Paul also says rice spikes blood sugar. But I don’t think dauphinois smothered in cream and cheese (his favourite form of potato) is exactly a miracle health food.</p>\n<p>Sometimes I want to have a traditional British meal, like a roast dinner, or a steak, with rice, but Paul hits the roof. He says, “You can’t have rice with that.” But I can and I do.</p>\n<p>I am more flexible with his meals than he is with mine. When he cooks, I have potatoes with whatever we’re having. But I would like us to just have one type of potato with our meal, we don’t need two: it’s unnecessary and unhealthy.</p>\n<p>I love Paul, but living with someone who worships potatoes as though they’re the eighth wonder of the world is a lot at times. He needs to come around to my way of eating.</p>\n<h2>The defence: Paul</h2>\n<blockquote>\n      <p/>\n      <i>I made thousand-layer potatoes and they were amazing. Noor pretended she didn’t like them</i>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>I love potatoes, but Noor is obsessed with rice. I can’t stand rice as it’s very boring, but I’ve adapted since we started living together.</p>\n<p>I’m Irish and Welsh, so potatoes are in my blood, but Noor says the same about rice. You can’t argue with either of us from a cultural perspective. The issue is, seeing as I do more of the cooking, I often opt for other carbs before I do rice.</p>\n<p>For me, rice just doesn’t hit the same. Potatoes are the most versatile food. They’re both a carb and a vegetable. They are cheap and delicious, and there is so much that can be done with them – mash, fries, jacket potatoes, dauphinois, croquettes, crisps … the list goes on.</p>\n<p>Sometimes I like to put two types of potato with our dinner – mash and fries, or croquettes and mash – but I don’t do it every night. Noor says it’s unhealthy and that I should make space for other vegetables, but I disagree. I recently discovered how to cook thousand-layer potatoes and they were amazing. Noor quite liked them, though she pretended she didn’t.</p>\n<p>I don’t mind cooking rice, but it’s a hassle with all the water-measuring, and I find it very plain. You have to dress it up to make it taste of anything.</p>\n<p>I have started eating a lot more rice when it’s appropriate – with curry, for example – but I don’t believe in having it as a standard accompaniment to all our dishes. I don’t think it’s versatile enough. Noor, on the other hand, wants rice with things like a roast dinner, or a piece of chicken.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/04/you-be-the-judge-my-boyfriend-wants-two-types-of-potato-with-our-meals-but-i-prefer-rice-should-he-compromise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I mean, I accept that I’m generalising wildly here, and I don’t for a moment claim to speak for everyone. But my own experience, which I would wager is a fairly common one, is that it is an evening out with friends when I’m going to get maximum appreciation for the fashion content of my outfit. Men just want you to look … nice? Which is fine, but there’s a lot more to style than that. Like I say, I am generalising, and not all dates are boy-girl anyway, but still: for many women, dressing up for friends is one of life’s under-appreciated joys.</p>\n<blockquote>Fashion is a love language in female friendships. It is woven into the fabric of camaraderie</blockquote>\n<p>On a friends night, you can be wildly overdressed for pizza and your pals will appreciate your look for what it is: enthusiasm for their company. Or you can turn up in your work clothes because you had to run straight from the office, and they won’t give a toss and just be thrilled to see you. You can wear your new leather trousers and know you will get the chance to tell, at great length, the triumphant story of how you tracked them down on Vinted. You can wear totally impractical shoes and nobody will roll their eyes when it means you have to get an Uber to a bar a quarter of a mile away.</p>\n<p>Fashion is a love language in female friendship. It is woven into the fabric of camaraderie between women. There is no place on earth where you will be more generously complimented than in front of the mirrors of the ladies’ loos, after everyone involved has had a few spicy margs. I’m not being sexist – it might well be that the same goes for men, but I don’t hang out by the urinals so I can’t speak to that. What I can tell you is that chat about clothes is, first and foremost, a delivery mechanism for support and cheerleading, woman to woman. Wear something bold, and you will get flowers for your originality; wear something low-key, and you will be lauded for your subtle good taste. Style is a channel of communication.</p>\n<p>Some features will always get a mention, when women talk about clothes. For instance: dresses and skirts that have pockets. Responding “it has pockets!” when another woman remarks upon what you are wearing is shorthand for “I enjoy fashion even though I have more important things to think about, and I think I recognise you as a kindred spirit”. See also: responding to an admiring comment about a pretty pair of shoes by saying they are “surprisingly comfy” and playing down your snazzy dress by revealing, without being asked, that it is 10 years old and from Zara.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/06/jess-cartner-morley-on-fashion-forget-date-night-id-much-rather-dress-up-to-party-with-my-friends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

One of its goals will be to eradicate textile dumps in the Atacama Desert.</p>\n<p>According to government data, more than 90% of textiles sold in Chile are imported, making the South American country the world’s fourth-largest importer of second hand clothing.</p>\n<p>The government calculates that Chile imports 123,000 tonnes of used clothing every year, with the effects felt most acutely in the north of the country – <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2021/11/8/chiles-desert-dumping-ground-for-fast-fashion-leftovers\">where the situation in the Atacama Desert has won global attention.</a></p>\n<p>“This would spur a new consumer culture, as companies would be required to offer repair, reuse, and recycling services,” said Beatriz O’Brien, the national coordinator for NGO Fashion Revolution.</p>\n<p>“It is a step toward a transition from a linear economy of production, consumption, and disposal to a circular economy for textiles and clothing in the country.”</p>\n<p>Global textile production is projected to grow from the 109m tonnes manufactured in 2020 to 145m tonnes in 2030.</p>\n<p>In Chile, people use an average of 32kg of textiles, contributing to 572,000 tonnes of textile waste per year in the country.</p>\n<p>Every day, tonnes of clothing arrive duty-free at the freeport in Iquique as giant plastic-wrapped bales, where they are sliced open and sorted into categories by a migrant workforce.</p>\n<p>The best clothes, often in near-pristine condition, are sold in outlet stores built into the narrow rows of warehouses at the freeport, or sent to Chile’s capital, Santiago, for resale. Some are even bailed up and sent back to the US to be resold.</p>\n<p>The rest winds its way in a convoy of small trucks up to Alto Hospicio, a poor city sprawling across the plateau above Iquique, where the clothes are incorporated into a seemingly endless cycle of resale and reuse.</p>\n<p>At La Quebradilla, one of the country’s largest open-air markets, vendors sell clothes for small amounts of cash, while the least desirable items are often slung out in the Atacama Desert.</p>\n<p>Some are then burned, with thick plumes of black smoke spiralling skyward from a messy dump on a high plateau outside Alto Hospicio.</p>\n<p>But after several years of research, Chile’s government has managed to add textiles to its extended responsibility law.</p>\n<p>Many countries have similar legislation, but Chile’s, in force since 2017, had only made producers responsible for recycling goods in several categories, including, tires, batteries, oils and plastic packaging.</p>\n<p>“The inclusion of textiles in the [producer responsibility law] will establish the obligations of producers, who will no longer be able to disregard the environmental impacts of unused textiles,” said Chile’s environment minister Maisa Rojas.</p>\n<p>“The successful application of the law will allow us to address the lack of regulation for the industry, which has generated huge quantities of waste and affects the quality of life for people and the environment.”</p>\n<h3>Quick Guide<h4>Contact us about this story</h4>Show</h3>\n<p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n<p>If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/26/chile-fast-fashion-waste-atacama-desert\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Donald Glover was spotted in teeny tiny shorts back in 2022 while Paul Mescal, the king of short shorts, has been wearing them ever since Normal People was released in 2020. And lest we forget <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/jun/20/thigh-society-why-mens-shorts-are-getting-shorter\">Milo Ventimiglia’s viral moment</a> in his post-workout micro-minis in 2021.</p>\n<p>However, this year has brought a gear change that can’t go unnoticed: Marks &amp; Spencer, purveyor of British wholesomeness, has jumped on board. The high-street retailer has released a range of its shortest shorts <i>ever</i>, with an in-seam of less than 12.7cm (5in) – clear proof that a thigh-grazing length is going mainstream.</p>\n<p>What’s so interesting about short shorts, though, is that they always make headlines. They’ve been around for decades (think John Travolta in Perfect, Tom Selleck as Magnum PI<i>,</i> and basically every pair of running shorts in the 70s), but a man’s bare legs still cause a stir. Whenever a celebrity wears anything above the knee – whether on the red carpet or spotted in the wild – it sends the internet into swooning overdrive: whether it’s <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/paul-mescal-short-shorts-trend-summer-street-style\">Vogue</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/paul-mescal-gucci-milan-fashion-week-2024\">GQ</a> reporting on Paul Mescal wearing boxers as shorts or the hoards of people thirsting over the Gladiator<i> </i>actor’s legs on X.</p>\n<p>Mere mortals may not<i> </i>receive such high praise for baring a little leg, but only because it’s not fully normalised for a guy to show his mid-thigh area – yet. Even as a stylist and fashion writer, I’ve received a disapproving glance or two from more conservative folk, but the compliments always far outweigh the flak.</p>\n<p>And, as a menswear expert, trust me when I say it just looks <i>so </i>good. It’s sexy. It’s cool. It even makes you look taller by visually elongating your legs. So, us guys have to be brave, pull our socks up, and put our short shorts on (look at Alexander Skarsgård on Lorraine, below, to see how it’s done). The best part? They’re the comfiest bottoms going, too.</p>\n<p>To get it right, there are a few easy rules to follow. First of all, context is key. You may not want to wear them somewhere formal or if you’re likely to be with people who are more conservative. Second, <i>always </i>wear underwear to avoid any Basic Instinct-coded mishaps.</p>\n<p>So, whether you need new swim shorts for an upcoming holiday, a tailored pair to wear to dinner or a sporty pair for casual dressing, I’ve put together a list of all the best short shorts you can buy now – most of which are less than £100 – as well as tips on how to wear them.</p>\n<h2>The best men’s short shorts for summer 2025</h2>\n<h2>Best sports shorts</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Adidas Adicolor Classics sprinter shorts</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Adidas is your best bet for a sporty take.

It’s not uncommon to spend a few hundred pounds on your chosen two-piece, and if you’re after Savile Row-standard tailoring, that number can tip into thousands. But if you know where to look, a good-quality suit doesn’t need to cost a fortune. Choose something timeless and you’ll have it for years.</p>\n<p>I still wear a few suits I’ve held on to for almost a decade. The ones that ended up at the charity shop, meanwhile, typically strayed from the timeless rule, with a skinny leg, bold colours or an ill-fitting silhouette.</p>\n<p>Suits never really go out of style, but they’re having a moment in fashion right now. Tailoring was prominent at the spring/summer 2025 menswear shows – look at Fendi, Gucci, Bottega Veneta, Saint Laurent and Dior for reference. And suits are enjoying a resurgence outside fashion week, too. Menswear influencers (namely <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/chico_lachowski/\">@chico_lachowski</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reubenlarkin/\">@reubenlarkin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/josefmiichael/\">@josefmiichael</a>) are sporting suits beyond formal events, and their accounts provide some good styling inspiration – even if you choose to wear the trousers and blazers separately.</p>\n<p>Read on for my pick of the best suits around at the moment, and scroll below for a guide to how to pick the right suit for you.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>The best men’s suits under £400</strong>\n    </h2>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Best double</strong>\n      <strong>-breasted navy suit</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Hawes &amp; Curtis navy </strong>\n      <strong>double-breasted </strong>\n      <strong>suit</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The heritage British suit maker, founded in 1913, has four royal warrants under its belt. Today, it’s still an expert in tailoring, from a wide range of shirts to silk accessories, as well as a good selection of suits themselves. This double-breasted navy design is an example of what the brand does best: a classic yet strong silhouette made with premium textiles for a suit that looks and feels expensive.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Best black tie tuxedo</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Moss </strong>\n      <strong>black double-breasted tuxedo</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The British high-street store Moss Bros rebranded as Moss a couple of years ago – ever since, its menswear collections have gone from strength to strength. The suits now feel modern yet wearable, and more luxurious than most other budget-friendly options. My favourite is this tuxedo (which has some key differences from a plain black suit, namely the contrast satin lapels, satin-covered buttons and satin taping on the trouser seams). It’s made using a wool-polyester blend that’s crease- and stain-resistant and water-repellent. An added touch of elastane gives it a comfy stretch finish.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Best cream linen suit</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Mango </strong>\n      <strong>Amalfi </strong>\n      <strong>linen </strong>\n      <strong>suit </strong>\n      <strong>Blazer</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <sub>£149.99 at Mango</sub>\n      <strong>Trousers</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>At smart summer events, it’s always the guys wearing cream linen who stand out – think Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby. Aesthetics aside, pure linen is great for a few reasons. It’s naturally breathable and antibacterial, so it’ll keep you cool even when it’s hot. It’s also not a problem if it’s a little creased. This Amalfi suit from Mango is a great option.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Best dark brown suit</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>H&amp;M </strong>\n      <strong>brown suit</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Blazer</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <sub>£64.99 at H&amp;M</sub>\n      <strong>Trousers</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>No one can argue with the fact that dark brown looks luxurious. If you don’t believe me, <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2025-menswear/row/slideshow/collection#22\">the Row’s autumn/winter 2025 collection</a> should be enough to convince you. While a suit by the Olsen twins’ hyped-up brand would cost upwards of £3,000, you can get a similar colour for much less if you shop around. Case in point: this suit by H&amp;M. For just over £100, this looks stylish, fits nicely, and gives people the impression you just <i>get </i>menswear.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Best classic black suit</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p><strong>Kin black </strong><strong>linen-blend suit</strong><br/>\n  Blazer</p>\n<p>\n      <sub>£91 at John Lewis</sub>\n      <strong>Trousers</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Kin is John Lewis’s in-house label, and its menswear collections feel more fashiony than the department store’s main line, thanks to its modern silhouettes and fashion-forward fabrics. Although it’s described as a slim fit, this suit is a little looser than a classic slim cut, making it feel more appropriate for 2025. The linen-viscose blend gives a louche, flowy finish that can be dressed up or down.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jul/08/affordable-mens-suits-uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Will the truce between the Gallagher brothers hold out? Will the most-hyped reunion in British rock history actually come off? And will fans be able to bag themselves an official <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/oasis\">Oasis</a> tea towel?</p>\n<p>The answer to that final question, at least, has arrived. The first Oasis merchandise store will open in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/manchester\">Manchester</a> on Friday, two weeks before the band perform their first gig in 16 years at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff.</p>\n<p>Selling everything from £40 bucket hats to baby grows, cutlery sets, shot glasses, jigsaw puzzles and tote bags, the shop in Spinningfields will be one of six across the UK and Ireland this summer, with the others in Cardiff, London, Edinburgh, Birmingham and Dublin.</p>\n<p>Fans will be able to recreate the front covers of the band’s debut album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/feb/06/michael-spencer-jones-oasis-definitely-maybe-album-cover\">Definitely Maybe</a>, and bestselling follow-up, (What’s the Story) Morning Glory?, on green screens in the store. Those hoping to buy a signature Liam Gallagher parka will be left empty-handed, however.</p>\n<p>The official merch stores will add to the considerable payday for Oasis before the most highly anticipated – and profitable – series of shows in British music history. The shops, which will sell limited-edition vinyl records, also represent the changing nature of music fandom, said Dr Matt Grimes, of Birmingham City University. “It’s almost like the experience of the event itself is just not enough. So how do you create other experiences for people?” he said.</p>\n<p>Estimates of how much Liam and Noel will earn from their sold-out reunion have ranged from £40m to £400m. Despite initial controversy over the pricing of tickets – with some sold by Ticketmaster for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/sep/01/oasis-ticketmaster-in-demand-standing-tickets\">as much as £337.50</a> – fans are expected to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/21/oasis-fans-to-shell-out-more-than-1bn-reunion-tour-study-shows\">splash out £1bn</a> on everything from beer to merch to hotel bookings in the UK and Ireland.</p>\n<p>Birmingham City University estimated last year that the brothers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/aug/27/oasis-reunion-could-earn-gallagher-brothers-more-than-they-did-in-the-entire-90s\">could earn £50m each</a> from the initial 14 UK shows – but that was before the tour expanded to 41 globe-hopping dates. “The question at the bottom of all this is: do you really need that much money?” said Grimes, the university’s course director for music business.</p>\n<p>He said artists could typically expect a 50% cut from the sale of each official T-shirt, hoodie or parka, although the details of Oasis’s reported £20m merchandise deal are top secret.</p>\n<p>Adidas is also cashing in on the clamour, selling Oasis-branded football shirts (£85), bucket hats (£40), jackets (£100) and tops with a new version of its slogan: “The band with the 3 stripes”.</p>\n<p>The Gallaghers aren’t the only ones making a few quid. Sales of Oasis-inspired products from independent brands have jumped 150% in the UK and 230% globally since the tour was announced last August, according to the wholesale platform Faire.</p>\n<p>Bucket hats are up 275%, parkas are back in style, and searches for Liam Gallagher-themed goods have soared fivefold, it said. Google searches for “Oasis fashion UK” have surged 180% in the last 30 days.</p>\n<p>By the time the Gallaghers finally step on stage in Cardiff on 4 July, it will be 16 years since they last performed together, after an acrimonious bust-up before a gig at the Rock en Seine festival in Paris in August 2009.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-13\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>Grimes described the comeback as one of the great global music events of recent decades, alongside world tours by Michael Jackson, Madonna and Taylor Swift. “Will it have any cultural significance? I don’t know,” he said. “But it will certainly be up there in the pantheon of entertainment greats.</p>\n<p>“Whether you like the Gallagher brothers or not, you can’t take away from the fact that this has generated a huge amount of media for them, it’s generated a huge amount of money for them, and it has put them in the realms of [other] global megastars.”</p>\n<p>In typical Liam style, the frontman this month dismissed claims that some fans were doubtful the gigs would happen. “There [sic] not fans there just little dickheads me n Rkid are on it,” he posted on X.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jun/20/oasis-merch-stores-spinningfields-manchester-london-cardiff-edinburgh-birmingham-dublin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I’ve found it a delight to write this list of 50 summer wardrobe updates for men, as browsing for menswear is one of my favourite pastimes. I love keeping up to date with what’s trending and finding ways to recreate it on a budget. I’m always looking for under-the-radar independent brands and trawling the secondhand market for a bargain. And not just for myself – I regularly receive messages from friends and family asking for help choosing a birthday gift or deciding what to wear to a specific event, and (nearly) always happily oblige.</p>\n<p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s what I do professionally, too. As a stylist and menswear writer with years of experience in helping guys dress their best, I spend a great deal of time looking at clothes online. I know which high-street retailer sells the best jeans; I know where to find good tailoring; what’s worth buying vintage; where to go for high-quality T-shirts; and the brands to shop for the best trainers.</p>\n<p>So naturally when this commission dropped in my inbox, I gladly accepted. You’ll notice I’ve included quite a bit of butter yellow. It’s the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/apr/30/jess-cartner-morley-on-fashion-butter-yellow-is-the-colour-to-be-seen-in-this-summer\">colour of the season </a>(remember <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/timothee-chalamet-givenchy-oscars-butter-yellow\">Timothée Chalamet’s Givenchy suit</a> at this year’s Academy Awards?) There’s a breezy linen shirt you could wear with black trousers and some retro sports shorts that would pair well with a simple T. I’ve also covered this year’s swimwear of choice, as well as some summer season accoutrements – such as sunglasses and jewellery – and everything in between.</p>\n<p>My top tip? When you’re scrolling through the list, go for pieces that don’t feel like a departure from your personal style. Sure, it’s always good to push yourself to try new things, but you want to feel like the new things you buy merge with your current wardrobe – that way, they’re much less likely to end up at the charity shop in a matter of months.</p>\n<p>I’ve also listed some inexpensive hacks to help keep your clothes looking their best and lasting longer, as well as a handful of grooming tips that can make a big difference with minimal effort required.</p>\n<p>The best part? Everything costs £100 or less. You, and your summer wardrobe, can thank me later.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Buy a vintage silk tie</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>From spring/summer 2025 fashion shows to TikTok, neckties have made a comeback. Wear with a full suit for a wedding, or a shirt and jeans for a preppy smart-casual look. If you search secondhand, you can get designer options made with luxurious silks for a fraction of the price.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Giorgio Armani tie</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rokit.co.uk%2Fproducts%2Fvintage-90s-giorgio-armani-spiral-patterned-silk-tie&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/may/30/men-summer-wardrobe-updates-uk\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <sub>\n        <br/>\n      </sub>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Christian Dior tie<br/></strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rokit.co.uk%2Fproducts%2Fvintage-christian-dior-silk-blend-tie&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/may/30/men-summer-wardrobe-updates-uk\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <sub>\n        <br/>\n      </sub>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Yves Saint Laurent tie<br/></strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rokit.co.uk%2Fproducts%2Fvintage-90s-yves-saint-laurent-silk-paisley-patterned-tie&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/may/30/men-summer-wardrobe-updates-uk\"/>\n    </p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Invest in a checked shirt</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Even though checks are in the spotlight this season – everyone from Burberry to Fendi offered their own take – it’s a timeless pattern that you can wear over and over.

Bad Bunny (above). <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DJZswjwRKRW/\">Barry Keoghan</a>. The slight crop and squarer shape will give your outfit stronger proportions than a regular fit, making it feel more elevated and considered.

On a practical level, it means you don’t have to root around in your bag every time you need to check Google Maps for directions. With phone theft also an issue, it could keep your mobile safer.</p>\n<p>You can choose a striking option that ensures it will be the first thing someone notices, or you can opt for something subtler. From designer fashion straps to jingly jangly TikTok favourites, as well as upcycled and recycled options, here are 15 to get you started.</p>\n<h2>The best phone strap cases, lanyards and wristlets in 2025</h2>\n<h2>Chain reaction</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Accessorize</strong>\n      <strong> </strong>\n      <strong>braid chain phone strap</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>This chunky gold and white braided strap can be worn around your neck, cross-body style. Just enough gold for it to elevate your everyday, and it will go with everything.</p>\n<h2>Nautical but nice</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Native Union City </strong>\n      <strong>Sling strap</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <sub>£24.99 at John Lewis</sub>\n      <sub>From £17.99 at Amazon</sub>\n    </p>\n<p>A minimalist, urban strap by Native Union, with nautical knots and an adjustable length to turn it from necklace to cross-body. One for the purists.</p>\n<h2>Pearls of wisdom</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Ateljé recycled phone case with pearl strap</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Ateljé’s pearly straps went viral when one was spotted in the hands of Mindy in season one of Emily in Paris. They made another cameo appearance in season three. This one features a longer strap so you can wear it cross-body, and it comes with a recycled plastic case. The pearls are made from recycled plastic, too.</p>\n<h2>Handmade braids</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Nots phone lanyard</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Using paracord (a type of nylon rope), Nots founder Emilia Jones hand-braids each lanyard using macrame and knotting techniques in her studio in Bristol. This design integrates hand-blown glass beads, too. The standard length is 120cm, but if you want it longer, you can add a note to request it.</p>\n<h2>Utility style</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Bandolier Billie strap</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>This utility-style strap could easily eliminate the need for carrying a separate handbag. It comes with three different compartments – one could fit a pair of glasses or a charger, the other bank cards, and the third is useful for makeup and keys. Of course, there are also two clips to attach to a suitable phone case. You can also buy add-ons, such as an <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bandolierstyle.com%2Fproducts%2Favery-airpod-clip-on-pouch-ivory-gold&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/may/07/best-phone-straps-lanyards-wristlets-cases-uk\">AirPods pouch (£39)</a>.</p>\n<h2>Recycled charm</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>CharKnots macrame lanyard</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The founder of CharKnots, textile artist Charlotte Hanson, hand-makes her macrame lanyards in Sheffield. Hanson uses recycled cotton, and they come in various colours, including sage green and dusty pink. She also offers a wristlet version.</p>\n<h2>Star-struck</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Bandolier Millie strap</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>With a delicate chain and tiny cut-out stars, this cross-body-style strap is perfect for those who love to layer up gold jewellery. Wear against black or dark brown to let the gold stand out.</p>\n<h2>Blooming marvellous</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>SkinnyDip London </strong>\n      <strong>sage flower beaded strap</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Anyone in touch with their inner flower child will love this nostalgic strap from SkinnyDip London.</p>\n<h2>MagSafe friendly</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>XouXou phone case and necklace</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>This phone necklace from XouXou comes with in-built eyelets, from which hangs a matching iPhone case.

After a winter of wool and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2024/oct/16/best-boots-footwear-autumn-womens\">heavy boots</a>, the time is ripe for shaking up your look with a warm(er) weather update.</p>\n<p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

Put clothes away between seasons: some items that make their way back out of storage were everyday favourites before then, while others may not have felt right for some time but now – lucky for you – they feel right once again. There’s something extra-fun about falling back in love with something from your own wardrobe.</p>\n<p>Having said that, the odd update can be a welcome thing in a wardrobe needing to cope afresh with sun, showers and occasions such as weddings and holidays. Now’s the time to do a wardrobe audit, think carefully about what you need and what you don’t, and let this guide inspire you to fill any gaps, thoughtfully.</p>\n<h2>A jacket</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Rainbow gingham jacket</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <sub>£135 at Boden</sub>\n      <sub>£135 at John Lewis</sub>\n    </p>\n<p>Boden isn’t a brand I naturally recommend, but this jacket is an instant spring wardrobe shaker-upper. Fun, a versatile fit and a massive shot of sartorial caffeine. What’s not to make you smile.</p>\n<h2>A dress</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Polka dot midaxi cami dress</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Very much in the vein of the polka dot dress Julia Roberts famously wore in Pretty Woman, this frock from M&amp;S stands out. Team it with your old denim jacket if the weather’s still patchy, or a blazer if you want to smarten up the look. It’s 100% cotton and available in regular, petite or tall lengths, and it will fill a hole in several wardrobes. It will also signal you know what’s currently filling column inches in Vogue: the polka dot, while also a timeless classic, is pinging back this spring. If that one doesn’t float your boat, M&amp;S is currently a trove of other similarly affordable polka dot styles which just might (<a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marksandspencer.com%2Flyocell-rich-polka-dot-sweetheart-neckline-maxi-waisted-dress%2Fp%2Fclp60731457%23intid%3Dpid_pg1pip48g4r12c1%7Cprodflag_New%7Cprodflag_plp_ts_QP_100%2B&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/25/womens-spring-wardrobe-essentials-uk\">such as this one</a>).</p>\n<h2>A bag</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Ghanaian basket bag</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>A different season calls for a different bag. Those heavy leather bags of winter start to feel OTT come spring, and lighter materials feel more in keeping. You may have an old wicker basket from warm seasons past to pull out. If not, this handcrafted basket bag, made out of the veta vera plant in northern Ghana, is a great option. Big enough to carry pints of milk back from the shop and available in a few different colours, it will also make a nice storage basket in the colder months. Or, basket bags are two-a-penny on Etsy, from <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fuk%2Flisting%2F1879422352%2Fwoven-rectangular-straw-basket-bag-with&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/25/womens-spring-wardrobe-essentials-uk\">classic, understated woven straw baskets</a> with leather handles to <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fuk%2Flisting%2F1775409687%2Fkiondo-summer-basket-in-black-sisal&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/25/womens-spring-wardrobe-essentials-uk\">sisal shoppers</a> and <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fuk%2Flisting%2F1576342164%2Fshopping-basket-bag-vintage-display&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/25/womens-spring-wardrobe-essentials-uk\">wicker totes</a>. Just search “basket bag” and make sure your results are filtered so you’re looking only at ones that dispatch from the UK. Dress them up or down and wear them to the office or the beach.</p>\n<h2>A pair of bright socks</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Fuchsia socks</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>This time of year offers a chance to have fun playing around with colour via sock and shoe combinations. Spring shoes offer up more room for socks to speak, so pick a pair with something to say, like this bright pink cotton-blend pair from Le Bon Shoppe, pedlars of good-quality socks. If pink isn’t your bag, there’s a range of Keith Haring-style brights (turquoise! tangerine!) as well as more understated shades (avocado, dijon and dried rose, for instance) to choose from. Since it’s an LA brand, though, you might be limited to <a href=\"https://lebonshoppe.com/pages/store-locator\">seeing which colours UK stockists currently have to offer</a>.</p>\n<h2>A waistcoat</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Polka dot Martina jacket</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/25/womens-spring-wardrobe-essentials-uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A great way to get it right is by picking the right colours – tonal warm neutrals are what you need for high style without high prices.</p>\n<p>What you have to do is seek out exactly those colours you may initially overlook. Faced with a rack of clothes, a default approach is to reach for black or white, because we know those colours are useful and we know where we are with them. Or, on a different day with a different mindset, we are drawn to the prettiest, brightest, most eye-catching colours. An exciting colour makes a piece feel more special, more valuable.</p>\n<p>But the best-value colours are not found at the end of the rainbow. Or indeed anywhere on it. They are the soft, muted pieces that have more warmth than the austere minimalism of monochrome, without the cheesiness of brights.</p>\n<blockquote>These colours would scream good taste, except they are much too elegant to scream anything</blockquote>\n<p>Olive. Terracotta. Putty. Mocha. Plaster. Sand. Butter. The names evoke the good life – chic kitchens, sunny gardens, good food. The sartorial equivalent of Farrow &amp; Ball paint, these are colours that come from nature, not colours that look straight out of a car paint factory. They are nuanced rather than basic. They would scream good taste, except they are much too elegant to scream anything.</p>\n<p>Forget black, shift to charcoal. Put down the white, and reach for oatmeal. I’m making it sound really straightforward, which it is. But it can feel challenging, mainly because it is not immediately obvious what these colours go with. Many of us lack confidence in our judgment when putting colours together, so we tend to go with combinations that feel familiar – a flag trio of red, white and blue, for example. Faced with a pair of chocolate trousers, we pick them up and worry: what shoes would I wear with these? Will they go with my coat? And put them down and reach for blue jeans.</p>\n<p>The secret to making posh colours work in your wardrobe is to treat them as neutrals. Let them all rub along together. Don’t get hung up on what goes with what. We have wired our brains to think that colours need to stay in their lane, one or two per outfit. If one colour is popping in your outfit – a pink jumper, say – it feels as if everything else must match it. Following this formula can block you from trying out new colours, because it isn’t immediately obvious how they slot into your usual wardrobe formulas.</p>\n<p>Soft, warm, earthy tones vibrate on the same colour frequency, so your eye reads them as a match. A butter-yellow shirt under a tan leather jacket. Khaki cargo pants with a deep sea green shirt. Take another look at the outfit here – shades of cream, green and brown, as well as black. The effect is soothing, a blur of neutrals, like gazing out of a train window at an all‑natural landscape.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/apr/18/want-to-look-posh-on-a-budget-right-colours-jess-cartner-morley\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Princess Polly, available on Asos in the UK, has a lot in common with other ultra-fast fashion brands. Although a little more expensive than Boohoo and PrettyLittleThing, the Australian-American multinational offers the same kind of trend-driven, low-priced clothes, mostly made from polyester. At the time of writing, shoppers can peruse more than 2,000 dresses, from a £6 pink mini dress to an £82 cream maxidress. There are bikini bottoms for £3 and barrel-leg jeans from £8. But there is one key difference between Princess Polly and its competitors. In early July, it became B Corp certified, bringing the certification’s integrity into question.</p>\n<p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>B Corp is the world’s most recognisable corporate responsibility certification and, since its inception in 2006, has been awarded to businesses that meet its “high standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency,” including Patagonia, the Body Shop and the Guardian. The B stands for “beneficial”.</p>\n<p>The B Corp label has long symbolised a business dedicated to caring for people and planet. Through a rigorous, months- or even years-long verification process, it is intended to hold companies to high standards by measuring positive impact on workers, community, environment and customers. However, at the time of writing, Princess Polly is running a buy-one-get-one-60%-off promotion, pushing excess product in a way that doesn’t seem to align with B Corp values.</p>\n<p>Dale McCarthy, whose carbon-neutral certified swimwear label Bondi Born was awarded B Corp status in 2020, says the news left her “deeply disappointed ... It makes a mockery of it.” “[Now] it seems any company can get certified if they issue enough policies and tick enough boxes, even if the fundamentals of the business are a major contributor to environmental damage,” she says.</p>\n<p>Another B Corp fashion brand, New Zealand designer Kowtow, takes issue with Princess Polly’s business model, which relies on producing vast volumes of clothing. “It contributes to a hyperconsumerist culture,” says its managing director, Emma Wallace. “The root [problem] of overproduction … needs to be addressed.” A new <a href=\"https://apparelimpact.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Taking-Stock-2025.pdf\">report from the Apparel Impact Institute</a> (pdf) attributes the apparel industry’s 7% emissions increase to ultra-fast fashion, overproduction and a reliance on virgin polyester.</p>\n<p>On its website, Princess Polly says: “We’re on a mission to make on-trend fashion sustainable”, and notes it has introduced a range of measures, including using “lower-impact materials” such as recycled polyester and organic cotton in 30% of its “new arrivals”.</p>\n<p>Sustainability campaigners and industry observers voice scepticism. “It’s greenwashing,” says Alden Wicker, the founder of the <a href=\"https://ecocult.substack.com/?r=2h5jaj&amp;utm_campaign=pub-share-checklist\">Substack EcoCult</a>, which reports on sustainability issues in the industry. “You can’t run a certification like this based on vibes. Anybody who wants a better world when it comes to how we purchase and consume fashion would have values that clash with the ethos of this brand.”</p>\n<p>B Corp has found itself on shaky ground recently, not just because of Princess Polly. In February, after the certification of several companies not usually associated with good environmental practice, the famously ethically minded soap company Dr Bronner’s dropped the certification, <a href=\"https://drbronner.co.uk/blogs/blog/dr-bronners-statement-on-dropping-b-corp-certification?srsltid=AfmBOooJRNIKtNacY1dEFw7_qVjat2w7X3vWylcvJ-lWAWc4tQrO6xkA\">stating</a>: “Sharing the same logo and messaging … [with] companies with a history of serious ecological and labour issues, and no comprehensive or credible eco-social certification of supply chains, is unacceptable to us”.</p>\n<p>David Bronner, the company’s CEO, is unimpressed with the certification of Princess Polly. “It’s just single-use plastic. You could be doing all kinds of good stuff, but if that’s your product offering, then that’s inherently not better for the world.”</p>\n<p>Princess Polly says it’s “proud of its environmental, social and governance progress”, and highlights that its focus is on two areas: ethical sourcing (100% of its mostly Chinese garment manufacturers have a “valid ethical manufacturing audit”) and environmental impact (it has pledged to reduce carbon emissions by 2030). But its circularity initiatives are scant (<a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fprincesspolly.co.uk%2Fpages%2Fsustainability-environment&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/14/fashion-statement-princess-polly-b-corp-sustainable-fashion\">you can read its policy here</a>) and it only has <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fprincesspolly.co.uk%2Fpages%2Fsustainability-glossary&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/14/fashion-statement-princess-polly-b-corp-sustainable-fashion\">a vague commitment</a> to paying living wages.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/14/fashion-statement-princess-polly-b-corp-sustainable-fashion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Despite thinking of myself as someone who doesn’t really shop, I found the restriction a real chore. Unless you’re buying vintage or spending a fortune, the dilemma of how to engage in the fun and newness of fashion without contributing to its environmental footprint is, it turns out, nearly universal: data in a new report reveals 74% of people want to dress more sustainably but most don’t know how to go about it.</p>\n<p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>The report – released by multi-brand retailer Zalando and GlobeScan – found that 41% of consumers find sustainable garments too expensive and 27% say they are hard to identify. It’s little wonder sustainable fashion remains plagued by vague claims, convoluted supply chains and a call-out culture that’s left brands reluctant to promote initiatives to customers on the lookout for greenwashing.</p>\n<p>“People are more engaged than they’re often given credit for,” says Pascal Brun, Zalando’s vice-president of sustainability and D&amp;I. Almost two decades after sustainable fashion entered mainstream discourse, most people have some awareness of the industry’s environmental impact – carbon emissions, pollution of waterways, deforestation, microplastics, waste. They probably also know these ill effects are exacerbated by the sheer volume of product being made every year (somewhere between 80 and 150bn garments) and the increasing proportion derived from fossil-fuel based fabrics (polyester accounted for <a href=\"https://textileexchange.org/knowledge-center/reports/materials-market-report-2024/\">57% of all fibres in 2024</a>).</p>\n<p>The rising popularity of ultra-cheap, ultra-fast fashion brands such as Shein and Temu (<a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/french-senate-backs-law-curb-150123350.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMusKWEz5w54MAZJfYGzIw9O5rkHwtV7yx5Dh-vm1A67Xa5QTN9fM1rFjUZO__f3b0kGdFro6JlGFOdPEZkcnX60tzQHChWTQg5Rn2LNUq-y5nPc9PvXtFWLDEOvH3Sy4Cb-PFymhwkuKXtW_Zo8dCKKpbiBwu1JfFyLj7D0a4-Y\">the targets of French legislation passed last week</a>) brings the dilemma into stark focus. Yet this new data reveals, despite everyone’s best intentions, it’s not clear where and how to shop with a reduced impact. So, how does one buy reasonably priced, sustainable clothes?</p>\n<p>The starting point is, of course, vintage – sales of which happily, according to <a href=\"https://cf-assets-tup.thredup.com/resale_report/2025/ThredUp_Resale_Report_2025.pdf#page=3\">ThredUp’s Annual Resale Report</a>, grew by 15% in 2024. Data from eBay suggests users search for “vintage” items more than 1,200 times a minute. But given the constraints on sizing and the time required to sift through racks, second-hand clothing isn’t always practical.</p>\n<p>When buying new clothes, context is important, says author and fashion educator Andrea Cheong. “What is financially accessible to people is going to vary, as is what is sustainable.” So rather than focusing on brands, she suggests buying the best quality of the item your budget can accommodate. That way, you will actually wear it. To assess quality, apply three criteria. First, buy nothing that contains a synthetic or semi-synthetic blend. Second, the garment must look as good on the inside as it does on the outside (small stitches, neat seams, non-synthetic lining). And third, it must be fit for purpose (leggings that are supportive enough for a workout, coats that keep you warm, pockets deep and sturdy enough to hold your phone).</p>\n<p>Detail is your friend. Garments made from a single, natural fibre (100% cotton, linen or wool) are easier to recycle and generally more durable. If a brand is using sustainable materials, they will tell you about it – and provide the nitty-gritty; specificity is the enemy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/17/fashion-greenwashing-glossary-what-do-circular-sustainable-and-zero-waste-really-mean\">greenwashing</a>. Look for third-party certifications that promote safe use of chemicals including Bluesign and Oeko-Tex, or regenerative or organic farming practices such as the Responsible Wool Standard and the Global Organic Textile Standard (Gots), or the inclusion of recycled content like the Global Recycled Standard.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if a brand has engaged suppliers with closed-loop systems (to recycle water and chemicals) and renewable energy, who are paying a living wage, they will include this detail, as well – most notably – as the location of the factory on their website. This is a detail that reveals a level of trust, transparency and confidence. In addition, brands get bonus points for having repair, rental and resale programmes.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jun/26/fashion-statement-dress-more-sustainably\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

There have also been stories about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jan/29/hidden-child-labour-syrian-refugees-turkey-supplying-europe-fast-fashion\">hidden child labour</a> and some workers in UK factories are feared to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/23/national-shame-mp-sounds-alarm-over-uk-fast-fashion-factories\">trapped in modern slavery</a>.</p>\n<p>Now after a series of labour investigations by Milanese prosecutors, the luxury fashion industry is fast coming under similar scrutiny.</p>\n<p>Last week, Loro Piana, the 100-year-old Italian brand that sells four-figure cashmere jumpers and whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/29/billionaire-chic-gwyneth-court-wardrobe-viral\">“quiet luxury” aesthetic</a> had been championed by celebrities including <a href=\"https://sbmag.com/weliveinparadise/an-alfresco-evening\">Gwyneth Paltrow</a> and worn by the super-rich characters in the TV show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/dec/03/baseball-caps-are-back-with-succession-to-thank-but-logos-are-out\">Succession</a>, was placed under a 12-month court administration over alleged worker exploitation.</p>\n<p>The ruling arises from an investigation into Italy’s luxury goods supply chain that began in 2023. According to the court, Loro Piana – owned by the luxury conglomerate LVMH – outsourced production of some clothing including cashmere jackets to an external Chinese-operated fashion company, which in turn subcontracted the work to two other companies. These were illegal workshops that operated on the outskirts of Milan. In May, the labour crime unit of the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/lvmhs-loro-piana-put-under-court-administration-italy-over-labour-exploitation-2025-07-14/\">Carabinieri military police found</a> that 10 Chinese people, five of whom were undocumented migrants, were forced to work up to 90 hours a week for as little as €4 per hour, as reported by Reuters.</p>\n<p>It is worth noting that the brand is not under criminal investigation and if the company complies with a set of legal requirements before the deadline issued by the court, the order will be lifted.</p>\n<p>In a statement to the Guardian, Loro Piana said the supplier had not informed the company of the existence of subcontractors. It also said: “Loro Piana was made aware of this situation on 20 May, and, as a result, the Maison terminated all relations with the concerned supplier in less than 24 hours.”</p>\n<p>However, news of the order has further tainted the idea of the “Made in Italy” label, a term that typically denotes high-quality manufacturing.</p>\n<p>Loro Piana is now the fifth fashion house to be placed under court monitoring in Italy since 2023. <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/04/05/italian-court-shuts-giorgio-armani-luxury-fashion-factory/\">Armani</a> and LVMH’s <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/dior-unit-put-under-court-administration-italy-over-labour-exploitation-2024-06-10/\">Dior</a> have both faced similar action over the last year. In February the monitoring orders placed on them were lifted early as the <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/italian-court-lifts-controls-placed-150225881.html?%7B%7Burl_parameters_unstripped%7D%7D&amp;guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9lbWFpbC1yZW5kZXJpbmctcHJldmlldy5ndXRvb2xzLmNvLnVrLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMatbudtJ-Bk0FgZwY0huhVnK9hSgRKMxylRgLhVwSdH91c80HAOQTynGeoGkDkTKufcETXUBDpeBSZtK4VMFtX_9mN7Fo3WwL3j43dK6_cAHB6TZ_-ntRWPsFIrlbLtx-volxtehkHBfmYkkBykRWvV74s5a82CUTFXyQEJGZ6W\">court said</a> both brands had taken all the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/italy-court-lifts-controls-lvmhs-dior-italian-unit-over-alleged-labour-practices-2025-02-28/\">necessary corrective action</a> before the 12-month deadline assigned to them had passed. In May a <a href=\"https://www.businessoffashion.com/news/sustainability/valentino-labour-exploitation-court-administration/\">subdivision of Valentino</a>, Valentino Bags Lab Srl, was also placed under judicial administration.</p>\n<p>Last year, an investigation by Italian police found that Armani bags that retail for €1,800 <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/italian-police-giorgio-armani-bags-160819643.html\">were being made by a Chinese subcontractor</a> for €93 and then sold on to the group by an intermediary for €250. A Dior subsidiary <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8f182b91-da7e-4ceb-b7e7-8070f70b4ee4\">was sanctioned</a> for paying as little as €53 for bags that retail for more than €2,000, the FT reported.</p>\n<p>Loro Piana released a statement about the difference between the price tag on its clothing and the supposed cost to produce it. According to the recent Italian investigation into Loro Piana, some jackets from the brand that can retail for more than €3,000 were being produced for as little as €118. The statement said: “The reported cost figures are not representative of the amounts paid by Loro Piana to its supplier, nor do they consider the full value of all the elements, including, among others, raw materials and fabrics.”</p>\n<p>For many consumers, there is a perception that luxury and ethics go hand in hand. But Deborah Lucchetti, who works as a national coordinator at the Italian segment of Clean Clothes Campaign, a network dedicated to improving working conditions and empowering workers in the global garment industry, says that this is an illusion. “Luxury is based on a production system founded on cost reduction, profit maximisation and opaque supply chains based on subcontracting, which often employ immigrant workers who have no protection and contracts,” she says.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jul/24/made-in-italy-is-the-label-just-another-luxury-fashion-illusion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In February, a threadbare polycotton bedsheet landed on the desk of Simon Roberts, CEO of Sainsbury’s. A “protest by post”, it had been sent by the Sheffield-based designer, maker and eco activist Wendy Ward. “I purchased this from Sainsbury’s at least 10 years ago,” she wrote in the accompanying letter. “It has served me well. However, I have no sustainable options available for what I should do with it.” Beyond repair, it was too damaged to donate to a charity shop, she explained. She couldn’t compost it as it had been blended with polyester, and she couldn’t repurpose it as cleaning cloths, as, being polycotton, it wasn’t absorbent. And, she added, “I don’t want to put it into a textile recycling collection as the likelihood is that it will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/sep/24/where-does-the-uks-fast-fashion-end-up-i-found-out-on-a-beach-clean-in-ghana\">shipped overseas</a> or incinerated and not recycled.” Ward qualified her assertions with links to respected sources – as a sustainable fashion PhD student, she is well informed on such matters.</p>\n<p>“The only action I can personally take,” she continued, “is to put it into my general waste bin. I don’t want to do this, as in Sheffield <a href=\"https://www.veolia.co.uk/insights/where-does-my-general-waste-go\">all general waste is incinerated</a> as ‘energy recovery’. This isn’t a sustainable option as such processes have been shown to be as <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp3wxgje5pwo\">damaging to local air pollution</a> as burning coal.” So, she concluded, “as Sainsbury’s is responsible for designing and manufacturing this product, making decisions to use polycotton with no consideration for what could be done once it reaches the end of its life, I have decided to return it to you. I would really love to hear what you decide to do with it.”</p>\n<p>Sainsbury’s response, sent from its executive office, was “a lame fob-off”, Ward says, and read as if it had been “cut and pasted from a complaints template”. (Sample platitude: “Sainsbury’s always welcome feedback from customers.”) But when she <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DF7mYHTNbM0/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1\">shared her protest</a> with her 20,000 Instagram followers, the resounding approval – “Brilliant!” “Please upload your template” – motivated her to launch a campaign: #TakeItBack. She created <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kXVJweRMC7g7aKvo_kcxDkLAw6TJmB2B/edit?tab=t.0\">an adaptable, deliberately non-combative letter</a> (“If you’re confrontational, it won’t go anywhere,” she tells me), and encouraged her followers to return their dead clothes to brands. “It’s an empowering action,” she says. “I was wresting back a bit of control as a consumer.”</p>\n<p>I joined Ward’s #TakeItBack campaign, sending my daughter’s ravaged school tights to Marks &amp; Spencer’s CEO, Stuart Machin. To the UK heads of Uniqlo and H&amp;M, I sent my kids’ damaged polyester-blend T-shirts, and to French Connection’s CEO, a greyed, misshapen T-shirt of mine that’s so timeworn, it’s transparent, all accompanied by a version of Ward’s letter. I know they’ve all been received, because I tracked them, on Ward’s advice; similarly, I washed everything first. M&amp;S was the first to respond, reminding me about its “industry-leading sustainability programme”, Plan A, and its take-back scheme. Uniqlo sent a letter acknowledging mine, and “will respond as soon as possible”. I haven’t heard back from H&amp;M or French Connection yet.</p>\n<p>Ward recommends following up if they don’t answer the key questions: “What would you suggest I do with this item?” and “What are you actually doing about this problem?” She’s unsure how many people have joined her campaign, though she doesn’t expect vast numbers yet: “I know I’m preaching to the converted.”</p>\n<p>You may be thinking: why not donate your unwanted clothes and other textiles to a charity shop? End-of-life textiles have for many years been a valuable revenue stream for charities. Rag merchants would buy them by weight and sell them on to be down-cycled into stuffing, blankets, wipes etc. But many UK charity shops are now “having to spend money getting rid of waste textiles”, says Dawn Dungate, an independent consultant who advises charities on textile recycling. Indeed, Ward’s protest was inspired by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DDwSbpTO1lW/\">a sign in her local charity shop</a> asking customers to dispose of “damaged, torn or worn-out items” in the bin, “as the cost of disposal is very high”.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/29/you-sold-it-now-recycle-it-the-protesters-mailing-worn-out-clothes-to-the-shops-they-bought-them-from\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

US students had frat parties, drank from plastic red cups and slept in shared dorm rooms. Meanwhile, UK freshers had house parties, drank cans on the bus and congregated in communal kitchens. But thanks to social media the lines are becoming more blurred. Algorithms have influenced <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/fashion-trends-going-viral\">everyone to dress the same</a> and now this is affecting campus culture. Social media is peppered with US and UK students doing <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/home/2025/08/19/luxury-dorm-decorating/\">room makeover tours</a> and library fit checks, and the only difference between them is their accents and labels. Now, as the illusion of campus life becomes more powerful than the reality of it, brands are attempting to monetise it.</p>\n<p>This month Kim Kardashian’s all-powerful shapewear label Skims pivoted from selling Hannibal Lecter-esque <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/02/kim-kardashian-texas-abortion-republicans-news\">face-sculpting wraps</a> to PJs for students to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/05/bed-rotting-why-it-is-time-to-embrace-your-quilt-without-the-guilt\">bed rot</a> in. Its first dedicated “Campus Collection” features “dorm-approved and lecture-ready” pieces such as jersey capri pants, cropped hoodies and cotton poplin micro shorts modelled by a group of real students (dubbed the “Skims Class of 2025”). On Asos you can browse a “Student Edit” comprising over 2,000 pieces that promise to “look on-point in the lecture, library and beyond” – because nothing says reading week like a sheer maxi skirt.</p>\n<p>PrettyLittleThing’s “Back to Class” edit includes an advertising campaign shot in a library (a gear shift from their usual poolside settings) complete with models wearing preppy polo tops and rugby shirts. The accessories brand Charles &amp; Keith has teamed up with students from Central Saint Martins, photographing them on the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charleskeith.eu%2Fmt%2Fpress%2Fcentral-saint-martins-trends-on-campus.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/28/how-the-campus-became-the-new-catwalk\">fashion school’s campus</a> in their favourite pieces from the brand. Even Shein, the mega fast fashion company that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/apr/10/shein-the-unacceptable-face-of-throwaway-fast-fashion\">churns out up to 10,000 new pieces a day</a>, is hopping on the trend with a “Campus Babe” programme where students can apply to be ambassadors for the online retailer and earn a commission on sales. Presumably by never wearing the same piece twice.</p>\n<p>“Students have become a crucial audience because they’re tastemakers,” says Nick Drabicky from January Digital, a marketing agency. According to Drabicky, this particular cohort appeals to brands as “they’re early adopters, hyper-connected, and influence household and peer spending.”</p>\n<p>The campus-focused trend is a knock-on effect from RushTok (an amalgamation of rush week – which is a bit like freshers’ week –<strong> </strong>and TikTok) , a corner of social media where applicants for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/24/alabama-sorority-documentary-hbo\">elite Greek sororities in the USA</a> document the process of getting a “bid” (i.e. membership). The recruitment phenomenon first went viral on TikTok in August 2021 with PNMs (potential new members) sharing their experiences at the University of Alabama, including game nights and synchronised dances. However, it was outfit of the day videos posted from dorm rooms that really captivated viewers. These 60-second videos featured predominantly thin, white, 18-year-olds with bright blond hair and obvious fake tans name-checking brands such as Steve Madden shoes, Kendra Scott earrings, Golden Goose trainers and The Pants Store – which, it turns out, <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/ali-donaldson/alabama-sorority-rush-tiktok-pants-store.html\">didn’t just sell pants</a> – in a distinctive southern drawl. Viewers who prior to the videos were blissfully unaware of what a Panhellenic sorority is – and lived in countries such as the UK where they don’t even exist – began to mimic them, while phrases such as “My jewelry is normal” were then commoditised and turned <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fie%2Flisting%2F1067929631%2Fmy-jewelry-is-normal-alabama-rush&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/28/how-the-campus-became-the-new-catwalk\">into merch</a>.</p>\n<p>Four years later and the yearly event has become <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/style/rushtok-bama-rush-tiktok-sororities-dances-1ec4beb3\">akin to a reality TV show</a>, with brands keen to get involved.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/28/how-the-campus-became-the-new-catwalk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>There is a very specific panic around summer dressing – all that flesh on show, for starters. So it always seems strange just how little thought we give to it. Obviously you care what you look like, but think how much time and energy you put into finding the perfect winter coat, or boots to see you through the post-Christmas doldrums. Some of you probably save up, or at least try on a few different styles to see what you like. Compare that to choosing a swimsuit or shorts. How often do you buy something the day before you go on holiday, or even at the airport? You’ll probably spend more time in your coat and boots but still, it’s a bit daft panic-buying some sandals before finding out, mid-hike, that the back strap rubs your heel and they slip off the moment your feet get sweaty.</p>\n<p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

So we are here to help.<strong> </strong>How about a tank that needs no bra, a swimsuit that doubles as a top, and a quick-dry, no-towel towel? Or a T-shirt for the guys that’s cocktail-approved – and a hat the kids will actually wear?</p>\n<p>The perfect summer look is a mythical unicorn, but there are things you can invest in now that will see you through until late September and, ideally, multiple summers to come.<strong>Morwenna Ferrier</strong></p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Womenswear </strong>\n      <i>by Jess Cartner-Morley</i>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>The full-coverage dress your summer wardrobe needs</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Counterintuitive though it is, the summer dress I wear most has long sleeves and is almost ankle length. A full-coverage but super-light dress is so much more useful than any number of itsy-bitsy sundresses. It keeps the rays off if it’s hot, the air conditioning off when you’re inside, and doesn’t leave you goosebumpy in the evening. Great for holiday days, office days, travelling days. Look for one you can wear with a bra – this one has a cut-out at the back, but above bra-strap height – and ensure it’s a generous fit.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>The </strong>\n      <strong>cami that works as evening wear</strong>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>A friend asked me the other day if she could borrow “that lovely Stella McCartney camisole”. Turns out she meant this, which is actually a silk camisole from M&amp;S. So chic for a night out with jeans, blazer and kitten heels.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>A clash course</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Instead of striped trousers and a plain T-shirt, try clashing your prints. Think stripes and florals. Leopard and polka dots. Camo and gingham. The more unexpected, the better.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>A tank top with a built-in bra</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>If you have huge boobs, this isn’t going to work, so apologies, but for many women, a top with a built-in bra is ideal when you want that sleek, no-bra-strap vest-top look but also a bit of support. I love these Uniqlo ones because the support layer is totally invisible, and the tank isn’t too tight.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>The £35 M&amp;S swimsuit that’s a modern classic</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Two years ago, I bought a black neoprene scallop-edged bikini from M&amp;S. I love it so much that this year I added the one-piece version. I have it in emerald, which is now sold out, but the tomato red is possibly even nicer, and the white is very Talented Mr Ripley coded.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>The not-too-long, not-too-short shorts</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>It’s not so much that I’m too old to wear baggy knee-length shorts – no one is too old to wear anything – it’s more that I’m old enough to know I don’t have to wear anything that makes me feel ridiculous just because it’s fashionable. Same goes for tiny Daisy Dukes. A short that hits the mid‑point of the thigh is the answer. This length can look a bit dowdy in linen, so I’d go with denim. And possibly a belt for added smarts.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>An out-of-office shirt</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jul/20/summer-style-fashion-must-haves-and-hacks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Fashion is a vocabulary. Clothing communicates parts of who we are, what we are interested in and how we want to be seen. It reveals choices that we make – but it also exposes lack of choice.</p>\n    <p>I am a disabled woman; I have dwarfism. My disability and stature is obvious and often shapes a first interaction. I’ve learned to love scouring through rails of clothes in high street stores and charity shops, and taking the items for alterations to make sure they fit. I know that if there are patterns or embroidery near the shoulder or ankle of a garment, altering it won’t work. I’ve found that jeans and trousers have to be elasticated at the back so they go over my hips with ease and don’t gape at the back. I’ve also learned that dresses and skirts should have an asymmetrical hemline to accommodate the curve in my spine. As I’ve got older, I’ve discovered that many of these alterations don’t just work for me, but would also improve comfort, independence and dressing for most people. Accessible design is better design.</p>\n    <p>To show you what this looks like in action: I recently had the pleasure of attending a dinner to mark Jannik Sinner’s return to Wimbledon. Beforehand, I was nervous. I wanted to wear something that would instil confidence, be comfortable and allow me to move about with personality and dignity. I chose a blazer, cashmere jumper and black pants. During my time working in fashion, I had the privilege of building relationships with designers, and this jacket was custom-made by Gucci. The pocket is proportional and the buttons are deliberately placed to be mindful of my figure. The wool pants are also custom-made by Prada and close with a fastener and zip, rather than a button, to avoid dexterity issues, and the back of the waistband is elasticated. The jumper is from Johnstons of Elgin in Scotland – their store is step-free and has rails at multiple levels. I chose it because it needed no alterations; the short-sleeve is mid‑length for me, and wearable throughout the year.</p>\n    <p>I’ve spent almost a decade working in the luxury fashion industry, because I want more choice, more representation and more respect for disabled customers – and across the industry there is lots to celebrate.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-5\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/v-and-a\">Victoria and Albert Museum</a> currently has an exhibition called <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/design-and-disability\">Design and Disability</a>, curated by Natalie Kane, that shows the innovation in accessibility. It features the work of Victoria Jenkins, the disabled designer behind Unhidden, a leading adaptive brand that will be part of this year’s official London Fashion Week.</p>\n    <p>Tommy Hilfiger has an adaptive collection, Liberare creates bras that close at the front rather than the back, Tilt Beauty has a line of products that allow you to put mascara on with greater ease, and Primark has increased representation in the in-store mannequins and begun to make their childrenswear range seam- and label-free for neurodivergent kids. But, we need to think of disabled people as more than customers.</p>\n    <p>In 2020, I founded <a href=\"https://tiltingthelens.com/\">Tilting the Lens</a>, a strategic accessibility consultancy that aims to create the conditions for disabled people to be successful. We’ve developed a scholarship for disabled designers with Parsons School of Design in New York, and we’ve spent the past year undertaking research with more than 200 disabled people across the UK to develop a white paper on adaptive fashion, to improve understanding of the market and innovation opportunities. We’ve learned so much about making clothing more inclusive, but also the need for stores and real estate, packing and delivery to be accessible, too. I want disabled people to be valued consumers – but for that to happen they also need to be decision-makers, leaders and trustees.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/03/celebrate-the-rise-of-accessible-design-it-benefits-everyone-not-just-disabled-people\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The biggest job in fashion has finally been filled.</p>\n<p>Following news that Anna Wintour was stepping back as editor of American Vogue in July, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/conde-nast\">Condé Nast</a> have appointed 39-year-old journalist and Vogue staffer Chloe Malle as head of editorial content at the American fashion magazine. Her role is effective immediately.</p>\n<p>“Fashion and media are both evolving at breakneck speed, and I am so thrilled, and awed, to be part of that,” said Malle in a statement. “I also feel incredibly fortunate to still have Anna just down the hall as my mentor.”</p>\n<p>One of the most powerful roles in the fashion industry, her appointment marks not just a new chapter for the magazine but for Wintour herself, who will stay on in her role as chief content officer for Condé Nast and global editorial director for the magazine, allowing her to retain control of the magazine, while no longer being involved in the day to day. Wintour was present at the July couture shows and it’s likely that both she and Malle will be present for next week’s New York fashion week, oversee the Met Gala and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/vogue\">Vogue</a> World events. But in a first for the most famous magazine in the world, Vogue no longer has an editor-in-chief.</p>\n<p>“At a moment of change both within fashion and outside it, Vogue must continue to be both the standard-bearer and the boundary-pushing leader,” said Wintour. “Chloe has proven often that she can find the balance between American Vogue’s long, singular history and its future on the front lines of the new. I am so excited to continue working with her, as her mentor but also as her student, while she leads us and our audiences where we’ve never been before.”</p>\n<p>Malle was editor of Vogue.com and co-host of the podcast The Run-Through with Vogue, and is a longtime Wintour insider, having been at the magazine since 2011. Responsible for editor-led newsletters, and successful annual “witty” tentpoles such as Dogue (a dog fashion magazine), she is more of a broad stroke journalist than a fashion insider. In 2014, she told Into the Gloss that she was “hesitant when I was interviewing, because fashion is not one of my main interests in life, and I wanted to be a writer more than an editor, but I was so seduced by the Vogue machine that I couldn’t resist”.</p>\n<p>Still, a frontrunner since Wintour’s announcement, Malle’s appointment will come as no surprise to anyone tracking Condé Nast’s revolving door. The former editor-in-chief is known for rewarding close deputies with international roles – Mark Guiducci, Wintour’s Vogue’s creative editorial director, was recently helicoptered into the top job at Vanity Fair.</p>\n<p>The gig was arguably up once Malle covered the high stakes and much-discussed Jeff Bezos-Lauren Sanchez wedding in Venice earlier this year. Given access to the bride before the ceremony and tasked with gathering additional details in the run-up to the wedding, the cover story followed her 2023 interview with the couple, and both are seen as proof of her mettle when juggling high profile celebrities with consumer interest.</p>\n<p>A graduate of Brown University, Malle grew up in Los Angeles and began her career writing about property for the New York Observer. She has since written for the New York Times, Marie Claire, the Wall Street Journal and Architectural Digest. She joined Vogue in the features department 15 years ago, and has worked across various sections and platforms at the title.</p>\n<p>Malle is also the daughter of American actor Candice Bergen, known for her wry humour and icy Nordic characters both on and off the stage, and the late film director Louis Malle, who lived in France because he “didn’t like living or working in Hollywood”, according to a 2015 interview with Bergen in <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/arts-entertainment/books/2015/04/11/candice-bergen-enjoying-lifes-second-chapter/\">Dallas News.</a> In another curious play between life and art, Bergen had a long-running cameo as the lovelorn editor of US Vogue in Sex and the City. Malle is also one of the few names to have had her birth reported on by People magazine.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/02/chloe-malle-vogue-editor-replace-anna-wintour\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>John Lewis is to host Topshop in 32 of its 36 stores from February as the clothing brand’s only national stockist on UK high streets, in a drive to attract younger shoppers and their mothers.</p>\n    <p>Peter Ruis, the managing director of the staff-owned department store chain, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/topshop\">Topshop</a> – and Topman, which is to go into six outlets – would “really exemplify the new John Lewis”, as it tries to broaden its appeal with more fashion, home and beauty brands, ranging from Fenty to the Conran Shop.</p>\n    <p>He said Topshop was “a brand that is going to resonate with our gen Zs [those in their late teens and early 20s] and our gen Xers and everyone in between”.</p>\n    <p>Topshop, which launched in Sheffield in 1964, closed all its UK high street stores in 2021 after its parent company, Philip Green’s Arcadia, went into administration.</p>\n    <p>The brand was bought out by the online fashion seller Asos, which last week relaunched Topshop’s website and opened an outlet in the London department store Liberty. At its height, Topshop had 300 stores in the UK and 11 in the US.</p>\n    <p>Ruis said gen X – those in their 40s and 50s – were more interested in fashion than their parents and “grew up with Topshop” and now had the money to buy it, while the younger generations were interested in 90s revival fashion.</p>\n    <p>“I think the best fashion brands are multigenerational. I think that’s always been the case,” he said, suggesting Topshop would “bring more of that family day out” to the retailer. Ruis said younger customers were already shopping in its beauty halls alongside their parents and buying brands such as Mango but this would bring a new attraction.</p>\n    <p>He said Topshop would have a specially created area in stores staffed by handpicked John Lewis staff and was “going to have a lot of energy”.</p>\n    <p>Michelle Wilson, the managing director of Topshop, said John Lewis had picked a selection of 120 items suitable for its shoppers, including denim, footwear and faux leather jackets, with the most expensive item a £250 suede jacket.</p>\n    <p>She said shoppers “absolutely want to see us back in stores” and wanted to “touch and feel and try on product”, with John Lewis being “a name trusted by millions”.</p>\n    <p>Wilson added that Topshop had been “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/10/topshop-high-street-stores-fashion-nostalgia-london-show\">pretty open</a> about the fact that we would like our own store presence” but there was “no defined dates” for such a move and the brand was also not looking for other partners on UK high streets.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-11\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Ruis said John Lewis, which is due to reveal its half-year results next week, was not abandoning its mainstream customers.</p>\n    <p>“We are not just a typical luxury fashion and beauty department store. We’re one that sells you everything in your life,” he said, pointing to the chain’s very large market share in sales of cots and gear for babies. He said this broad appeal positioned it well to outlive the difficulties that led to its rivals Debenhams and Beales disappearing from high streets and House of Fraser significantly contracting.</p>\n    <p>He said John Lewis was “super positive” about trading in this year’s key Christmas period as its customer surveys indicated consumers were “more optimistic than they’ve been for a very long time”, partly thanks to mortgage rate decreases. “We’re seeing big-ticket items come back with a vengeance,” he added, referring to strong sales of sofas and mattresses, in particular.</p>\n    <p>Last year’s return of the group’s now 100-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/sep/05/john-lewis-to-bring-back-never-knowingly-undersold-price-policy\">price promise, never knowingly undersold</a>, had gone better than expected, Ruis said, helping to pull in shoppers searching for goods online.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/03/john-lewis-to-host-fashion-brand-topshop-in-32-stores-from-february\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Last summer she turned the word “Brat” into a cultural phenomenon complete with a uniform featuring “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/article/2024/jun/21/barbie-pink-is-out-lime-green-is-in-charli-xcxs-album-spawns-brat-summer-trend\">a pack of cigs, a Bic lighter, and a strappy white top with no bra</a>.”</p>\n    <p>So it came as somewhat of a surprise to fans when, last weekend, she opted for a more classic bridal look t<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jul/20/charli-xcx-marries-george-daniel-in-low-key-hackney-london-ceremony\">o marry George Daniel</a>, the drummer in the band the 1975.</p>\n    <p>Arriving at Hackney town hall in east London, the bride wore a white sculpted corseted minidress from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/vivienne-westwood\">Vivienne Westwood</a>. Even her accessories veered towards the traditional: a bouquet of locally grown white cosmos and dahlias, a short white veil, and slingback heels.</p>\n    <p>Despite the look being more conventional than defiant, Alexandra Macon, the weddings editor of Vogue.com and founder of the e-commerce site Over The Moon, describes the pop star’s choice of designer as a “perfect match”.</p>\n    <p>“Vivienne Westwood has forged a legacy as a true ‘anti-bride’ icon in the world of bridal fashion,” Macon said.</p>\n    <p>In 2008, Sex and the City’s Carrie Bradshaw was jilted at the altar by Mr Big while wearing a floor-sweeping corseted gown from the British designer. Yet even without the couple’s eventual happy ending, a Westwood wedding dress has been desired by millennial brides ever since.</p>\n    <p>Seventeen years later, gen Z have welcomed their own bridal muse. This time the hemline may be shorter but the brand remains the same.</p>\n    <p>Charli xcx’s dress was inspired by the Cocotte, a style of dress Westwood first unveiled in her autumn/winter 1995 collection. Featuring a swooping neckline, a waist-cinching corset and draping detail on the hip, the original paid homage to the dresses worn by the 17th-century French author and courtesan Ninon de l’Enclos.</p>\n    <p>Westwood was one of the first to subvert the historical flat corset. Instead of lacing there are zip fastenings, and while the corset still moulds the body there are stretch panels for comfort. Since then, the brand has launched numerous iterations of the silhouette. Off-the-peg versions start from £3,200. The style is as popular among celebrities as it is with non-famous brides.</p>\n    <p>In 2005, Dita Von Teese wore a billowing purple version. Hailey Bieber wore a mini take on it for her nuptials, while Demi Lovato chose a longer length and added a cathedral-style veil. In June, the Hot Milk star Vicky Krieps wore <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/vicky-krieps-vivienne-westwood-wedding-dress#intcid=_vogue-gallery-bottom-recirc_0af32cce-76f0-4854-b4b3-400008ea3a1f_text2vec1\">a rose-patterned</a> version for her Greek island wedding, while the model <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/gallery/daisy-lowe-jordan-saul-wedding\">Daisy Lowe</a> customised hers with a bustle and side slit.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-12\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Such is its ubiquity that last year Vogue declared it “the wedding dress of the decade”. Macon describes the silhouette as “instantly recognisable and beloved, which is why we see it again and again on brides”.</p>\n    <p>A finale bridal look has been the brand’s show signature since the 1990s when the model Sara Stockbridge was an unconventional bride, carrying her baby down the catwalk in a dress depicting Jean-Honoré Fragonard’s 1797 painting The Swarm of Cupids.</p>\n    <p>Bridal is now a core part of the business with a dedicated atelier. In April, Vivienne Westwood staged its first standalone bridal show.</p>\n    <p>After trying on 120 dresses in her search for her perfect dress, the writer and influencer Katherine Ormerod was surprised to find herself choosing a Cocotte.</p>\n    <p>“No one wants to be a basic bitch and feel like what they’re wearing is ubiquitous, but also after all my years working in fashion, I’ve seen the distinction between something that is trend-led and ‘everywhere’ and design which is iconic, timeless and popular for a reason,” she says.</p>\n    <p>The Cocotte dress is also a hot ticket item on resale and <a href=\"https://byrotation.com/products/vivienne-westwood-white-dresses-clybydnbx001aanzerw7ueeog\">rental platforms</a>. Ormerod says that “in contrast to a sea of algorithmically fine-tuned brands and designs”, it “feels like a bit of a FU to the lace and full train”.</p>\n    <p>Six months after her wedding, Ormerod sold hers. “I can’t think of anything sadder than that beautiful dress hanging, Miss Havisham-like, in a dust bag for ever. It wasn’t a hard sell: within a fortnight it had found its new bride.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jul/25/charli-xcx-vivienne-westwood-wedding-dress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

While they are available for £30 from Adidas or £3.49 on the online marketplace Temu, a high-fashion version is now also on offer. The <a href=\"https://www.therow.com/en-gb/products/ama-slide-black\">Ama sliders</a>, in a choice of black, red or white, were launched by the American fashion brand The Row this week. They cost £600.</p>\n<p>Laura Reilly, the writer of the influential fashion newsletter Magasin, called them <a href=\"https://www.magasin.ltd/p/374-the-rows-latest-rage-bait?utm_campaign=email-half-post&amp;r=clrv8&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\">“The Row’s latest rage bait”</a>, using the name for posts online designed to provoke anger, and go viral in the process.</p>\n<p>Fashion’s version of rage bait seems to be luxurious versions of everyday things. It remains unclear whether the creators of these items are deliberately provoking a reaction, but the prices certainly drive some consumers into a fury.</p>\n<p>The Ama follows The Row’s other recent item in this tradition: the Dune sandal, otherwise known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/apr/02/the-price-of-flip-flops-can-they-ever-be-worth-670\">flip-flops with a red sole</a>, which cost £670 (they also come with a black sole, as worn by the actor Jonathan Bailey at an event to promote Jurassic World). But the brand is not alone. Items that have prompted similar outrage include a Loewe white vest for £325 and the Italian brand <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/sep/21/golden-goose-distressed-sneakers-poverty-backlash\">Golden Goose’s “dirty trainers”</a>, which cost £435. Balenciaga, during the decade that Demna has been the creative director, has provided copious items here, from £720 Crocs, to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/nov/17/is-the-towel-skirt-really-the-latest-fashion-trend\">towel “skirt</a>” that cost £695 and a take on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/apr/26/flat-pack-fashion-ikea-takes-swipe-at-balenciagas-1365-shopping-bag\">Ikea Frakta bag</a> for £1,365.</p>\n<p>Dal Chodha, the pathway leader of Central Saint Martins’ fashion communication course, is familiar with the genre. “This one in particular is brilliant because it’s so well positioned for us to take offence, in the most exquisite way,” he says. “There’s an awful lot of [questions] that come out of looking at that shoe. The first is the one that most people ask themselves when they look at [a] work of art or any piece of luxury fashion: ‘Why does that cost that much?’”</p>\n<p>Taking something ordinary and putting it into a different context has a tradition in the visual arts, one that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/balenciaga\">Balenciaga</a>’s Demna is definitely influenced by. See Marcel Duchamp’s urinal in 1917, Jeff Koons’s 1980 vacuum cleaner and Martin Creed’s light switch from 2000, all items that have prompted public rage.</p>\n<p>But if art remains elitist due to the fact that most people can’t buy it, everyone wears clothes, so consumers feel more invested when everyday items are sold for higher prices. This has long created a tension; Daniel Rodgers, the fashion news editor at Vogue, describes it as “an inverse form of snobbery from people who have always been cynical of luxury fashion anyway” – but it is exacerbated by online discourse. “Everyone’s voice is amplified so now we’re hearing more from the people that don’t get [items such as the Ama],” says Chodha.</p>\n<p>The wider news cycle is also a factor. “I’m interested in who’s defending that shoe, and is it defendable,” says Chodha. “I would’ve been that person a while ago but now with all of the wars happening around the world and all of the economic struggles that we’re all going through, I just think this is a bit insane.”</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-9\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>Rodgers says the flatness of online exacerbates the reaction. “Fashion is mediated mostly now through onscreen images,” he says. “In the case of the Balenciaga Ikea shopping bag, you look at a picture of it on the screen and you think ‘What? I can pick that up from Ikea for 75p!’, but what you don’t see on screen is actually leather and it is actually made like a luxury item.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jul/19/rage-bait-good-design-ama-600-sliders-the-row\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I was uneasy, palms sweating, tapping my feet on the floor. Normally, I met Vonkrai in restaurants, in the sightseeing deck or in the human-Vonkrai gatherings and conferences to restate our decade-long commercial and cultural partnership. In those places, their bodies were scrawled with everyone’s thoughts in a mess of unidentifiable and overlapping scribbles translated from human minds to Vonkrai bodies. Latin, Gujarati, Hangul, Cyrillic, Nsibidi, Arabic, and dozens of others from the Teresa Station human population. Mingled with our bulky and confusing thoughts, the Vonkrai’s own dot-like script were scattered all over their bodies, words and logograms hopping from body to body, untraceable even for those who knew how to read Vonkraish.</p>\n<p>But now, my mind glared back at me from their body like a damn accusation. It was hard to even follow the Detective 101 tips, like maintaining eye contact and interpreting body language. On the other hand, those things wouldn’t really work with Vonkrai—or they would be hard enough even for me, Isabela Cardoso, Teresa Station’s only investigator.</p>\n<p/><p>I tried to think about something else instead of my fiancée—<i>the case, think about the damn case you’re being paid to solve</i>—so that those words were replaced, but they didn’t shift. I shook my head and shifted my gaze from their body back to my comm-pad, skimming over the case’s file.</p>\n<p>“Halcyon, can you repeat for the record what you saw in the market district?” Halcyon was my interviewee’s chosen Earth name. Each of them picked one for the health of our relationship, just as we picked aliases in their language.</p>\n<p>“Repeating,” Halcyon said. I should be counting my blessings. Less than four percent of the Vonkrai had learned any of the Earth’s languages, but Halcyon knew Portuguese. “A male human with a knife stabbed the victim, grabbed an object, ran.”</p>\n<p>I nodded, peeking at the picture of the dead man on my comm-pad. His mouth was puckered in revulsion, his eyes popped open in a frightened expression. José Braga, a medical supplies vendor from Lorenzo Station who had recently acquired a stall in Teresa. Seemed like a simple case of robbery with homicide. It’d happened in the market district, where the off-station goods flowed in and out. And wherever there was money, there was greed; and where there was greed, there could be bodies. The only witness? Halcyon, who was crossing the district at the time to the quarters deck, where they spent half of each month.</p>\n<p>“Did you say you were eating <i>caldo verde</i> at the time?” I said.</p>\n<p>“Answering: Yes.”</p>\n<p>I licked my lips. The environment module of Teresa was probably operating at lower levels of humidity. Or maybe I was getting nervous with the job (which wasn’t common, but, hey, my fiancée had plans to move to Vladimir station and hadn’t even told me about it, so I had the divine right of being overly sensitive).</p>\n<p>“Okay…” I sighed. I peered into Halcyon’s eyes, as if I could glean anything else from there. Nothing but the usual glint. Having evolved in the Goldilocks zone of their system, on a planet roughly the size of Earth with a similar atmosphere, the Vonkrai were like humans if you looked at them from a certain angle but extremely different if you looked from every other angle. They had our humanoid bodies as a distant resemblance, but theirs were rough like a stone and had a flinty periwinkle tonality, like an untouched vein of amethyst. Their eyes ranged from pitch to crystalline waters, their voices from whispers to drumbeats. Halcyon was a quiet one who spoke softly and hardly moved on the chair. If Halcyon were a human, I’d say they were extremely shy.</p>\n<p>Notifications popped up in the corner of my pad’s screen. Two… Five… Seven… Work time was work time, but only Vitória sent multiple messages in a row.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/03/14/escape-pod-932-the-walking-mirror-of-the-soul/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 931: The Rhythms of the World</h2>\n<h3>The Rhythms of the World</h3>\n<p>As always, we’re starving to death.</p>\n<p>From our place inside the leather pouch tied to Aamsaa’s belt, our two remaining stalks ache with hunger, barely able to hold our withered green-spotted spore caps upright. We reach down with what’s left of our network of hyphal tendrils, hoping to lap up any remaining contaminants from the patch of poisoned soil Aamsaa found last week, but there’s nothing left. No scraps of heavy metals or drops of industrial toxins. We’ve consumed it all. And if Aamsaa doesn’t find more food for us soon, we’re as good as dead.</p>\n<p>What can we say? Toxic pollution isn’t as easy to come by as it once was.</p>\n<p>“What do you think?” we puff a cloud of message spores up to Aamsaa. “Are we going to make it this time? Or are you finally going to let us die in peace?”</p>\n<p>The irregular cadence of her arthritic gait grinds to a halt, and she scoffs.</p>\n<p>“You’re the all-knowing, century-old fungus. Why don’t you tell me?” she says, and there is a smug yet endearing confidence in her voice. She doesn’t speak her strange, breathy human language. No, she speaks ours, the Rhythms of the World, the language of the soil and the sea and the sky with its low susurrations of air and fine chemical exchanges. Her human vocal cords and oil secretions aren’t designed for the task, but that hasn’t prevented her from mastering the nuances of the Rhythms over the decades.</p>\n<p>“We’re not all-knowing,” we say.</p>\n<p>“Then quit acting like it.”</p>\n<p>“Hilarious. Now about that food?”</p>\n<p>“Don’t get your caps in a twist.”</p>\n<p>With her knobbly knuckles, Aamsaa unknots the pouch’s drawstring, and we release a puff of sensory spores to take in the damp, writhing sea-top mess that is the floating city of Del.</p>\n<p>The night is cool with sea breeze as we stand on a wide, kelp-woven street lined with biomaterial buildings that resemble overgrown bird’s nests. At the end of the street, an ancient steel wind tower looms, its blades and turbine long locked by rust and streaked with slashes of peeling white tar. The cylindrical tower is massive; and its numerous window boxes practically vomit plant life, thick with diverse ferns and dangling ivy. A latticework of vines grows aggressively up the bottom half of the tower, covered in globe-like flowers that crackle with a soft teal light. And then, about halfway up, the vines grow outward in an almost mycorrhizal pattern, spreading chaotically overhead and latching onto the roofs of each bird’s nest building, forming a gently glowing canopy for the hundreds of humans milling in the street below.</p>\n<p>“It’s beautiful,” we say.</p>\n<p>“Del’s famous for its phyto-engineering,” Aamsaa says. “The people in that tower have innovated some pretty impressive stuff. They’ve set up tidal turbines beneath the city and trained those LumiVines to store and conduct electrical charges. It’s an ingenious distribution system.”</p>\n<p>Clouds of moths, each individual as large as one of Aamsaa’s hands, flutter around the LumiVines, their translucent wings catching and refracting the light. We watch them sipping sap, careful to avoid the electricity stored within the flowers. Every now and then, one accidentally nicks a charged stamen, but with a quick buzzing Rhythm of protection, the electricity discharges harmlessly from the moth’s body with a soft teal pop. Hidden by the darkness above, we hear the wing beats of storm gulls surveying the scene, eyeing the moths for a meal.</p>\n<p>“You see?” we say to Aamsaa, “We could die here. It would be a pleasure to join with these Rhythms.”</p>\n<p>“I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but you’re not going to die today. Listen.”</p>\n<p>Beneath the creaking of the concrete floats and rusted wind turbines upon which this city was grown, we hear it: a piercing, droning, ragged whistling, like a kettle that has nearly boiled through its water. An inexplicable Break in the Rhythms of the World coming from a nearby alley.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/03/07/escape-pod-931-the-rhythms-of-the-world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The robot tilted its long head down while still making eye contact, managing a look of consternation despite its rigid, expressionless face.</p>\n<p>“What?” Eland snapped.</p>\n<p>“You should be packing those into boxes,” Hexben said without inflection. “Our lease ends next week.”</p>\n<p>“Exactly,” Eland said. “It doesn’t end today.”</p>\n<p>Hexben deepened the tilt of its head so far that its chin touched its chest in a spot where the paint was well-worn away.</p>\n<p>“One big sale could change everything,” Eland said, looking back at his work. “We could renew the lease for six months with a single sale.”</p>\n<p/><p>Apparently satisfied with that response, Hexben returned to the storage room.</p>\n<p>Carefully, Eland stacked the thin wooden rods one on top of the other, following the notches his mother had carved, each notch designed to match only one other—“a kiss between sticks,” she’d called it.</p>\n<p>Once he’d used all the sticks, he was left with a one-meter-high stack on which he began to hang delicate glass ornaments in a carefully orchestrated pattern—the same pattern he’d followed daily for three years. An obsession born of grief and repetition had burned the pattern into his mind.</p>\n<p>He was placing the final ornament when the front door to the shop opened, letting in a gust of wind. Eland grasped the structure to give it support against the blast, but he pushed too hard and the entire thing toppled down to the table. The sturdy ornaments bounced, didn’t break, but that didn’t stop a fury from rising in Eland as he looked toward the door.</p>\n<p>“Hexben! I told you never to open that door when I’m in the middle—”</p>\n<p>It wasn’t Hexben.</p>\n<p>In the doorway stood a figure draped in a heavy shawl with a rebreather masking its face.</p>\n<p><i>Tourists</i>, thought Eland, <i>so frightened by the silt outside that they would purchase anything branded as safety gear, no matter the markup</i>.</p>\n<p>The automatic disdain passed, allowing Eland to understand what he was seeing: a tourist. In his mother’s gallery. <i>A customer</i>.</p>\n<p>“Hello!” he said with a broad smile on his face. The figure turned toward him and mumbled into its rebreather.</p>\n<p>“No silt in here,” Eland said, motioning to the ground. “Perfectly safe to remove your mask.”</p>\n<p>The figure nodded, then took off the mask with some difficulty. A young woman, about Eland’s age if he had to guess, but it would only be a guess; hard to get a read on her under the face paint, which must now be fashionable in the quad-cities. Yellow and orange triangles sharpened her features, glowing against her dark skin and highlighting her auburn eyes.</p>\n<p>“How do people down here stand breathing through these things?” she asked in a tone frustrated but friendly.</p>\n<p>Eland hadn’t worn one since he was a child, but to spare her some embarrassment he kept that to himself. “You get used to them.”</p>\n<p>“I’m Mia.”</p>\n<p>“Eland.”</p>\n<p>“I’m so sorry for letting the wind in,” she said, looking at the mess in front of Eland. The expression on her face was a kind one. “Will you be able to fix it?”</p>\n<p>“No problem, no problem,” he said, trying to keep any hint of frustration from seeping into his tone. “Please, have a look around.”</p>\n<p>She smiled and began to walk around the studio, stopping here and there to examine some of the sculptures that hadn’t toppled during her entrance.</p>\n<p>Eland tried his best not to betray desperation when he asked, “Are you looking to buy?”</p>\n<p>She didn’t turn from her inspections. “Not exactly. I’m a scout for the Intima Gallery on the orbital.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/02/29/escape-pod-930-fulfillment-in-purpose/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 929: The Library</h2>\n<h3>The Library</h3>\n<p>Every morning at ten to ten, Dot powered on. Its hands lay flat against the thick glass of the reading room window, which let the photoreceptors on its palms feast on the sun. The window overlooked a modest lot where cars had once parked in orderly fashion, side by side. Now the asphalt was veined with fissures, tufted with dandelions that had nudged and elbowed and bullied their way up from below.</p>\n<p>Dot pulled its hands from the window. The synthetic skin suctioned off with a short, wet noise, one that Dot’s colleague, Alex, would have described as <i>rude</i>. The sound echoed around the reading room and pinballed through the rows of empty shelves.</p>\n<p>With nothing to reshelve or sort or alphabetize, the android defaulted to maintenance tasks: it swept the floor and carpet (no power, no vacuum); checksummed its internal library database (no updates since the Internet went down); dusted and wiped surfaces; checked the after-hours book drop, which was always empty—except for the time a mangy cat had climbed in through the slot. Dot named it Snowbell, from <i>Stuart Little</i>. For three days, the stray made the library its home, splitting its time between jumping across shelves and curling up into a tight ovoid for a nap. On the fourth morning, when no meows had greeted the day, Dot carried out a thorough search of the library before resigning itself to the fact Snowbell was gone.</p>\n<p>Dot got a duster and headed for the stacks. The heart of the library was once crammed so tight with books that patrons often had trouble pulling out the titles they wanted. The bare shelves were now like the rib cage of a once-great leviathan, picked clean by scavengers to a dull, glaucous grey.</p>\n<p>To reach the top shelf, Dot telescoped its legs, which made its skirt appear comically short; this had always made Alex snicker. It brushed the surface, spurring motes of dust into a languid ballet.</p>\n<p>Its left elbow <i>clicked</i>. Not the first time this week. Dot had run several diagnostic scans, but they came back clean. Perhaps it was nothing. But if the issue was mechanical? That spelled trouble. Like a human, it couldn’t kiss its elbow, much less repair it.</p>\n<p>The android scanned itself again, but was interrupted by a muted <i>thump-thump</i> that reverberated through the library. It increased power to its hearing sensor. A few seconds later came a more insistent <i>thump-thump-thump</i>.</p>\n<p>Someone was knocking on the front door.</p>\n<p>The door had a top and bottom plexiglass pane separated by a thick middle rail. The upper pane was marred by three bullet fractals, left by an armed scavenger who’d come in the dead of winter, convinced there were still books inside and refusing to take no for an answer.</p>\n<p>Now there stood a woman, hands cupped against the glass, framing her face as she peered inside the library.</p>\n<p>“Hi!” she said.</p>\n<p>Dot assessed the patron. Two tight braids of red hair peeked out from under a black knit cap; streaks of dirt lined her angular and generously freckled face; her jacket was a high-end hiking raincoat with a strip of duct tape across the right arm; her jeans looked new, save for a large mud stain on the right knee. Her mismatched hiking boots gave Dot pause; this was atypical.</p>\n<p>Behind the woman, Main Street was a bleak landscape: a doorless pick-up truck, a rusted shopping cart with missing front wheels, and the boarded-up yoga studio across the street, the plywood sheets warped from exposure to the elements.</p>\n<p>“Hey! Can you let me in?”</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry,” Dot said, raising its voice to be heard through the door, “But the library opens at eleven.”</p>\n<p>“OK… So how soon is eleven?”</p>\n<p>“In fifty-three minutes.”</p>\n<p>She smirked. “I guess I’ll wait.”</p>\n<p>The woman shrugged off her backpack—it had thick shoulder straps and an external carbon-fibre frame—and dropped it beside her.</p>\n<p>She looked at Dot’s forearm, where its model ID, <i>.dewey</i>, was tattooed. Alex, who well knew what the period represented, had playfully nicknamed it Dot.</p>\n<p>“You’re a Cedalion Android, aren’t you? Second Gen?”</p>\n<p>“Correct. Decimal Dewey model.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/02/22/escape-pod-929-the-library/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 928: Zebulon Vance Sings the Alphabet Songs of Love (Flashback Friday)</h2>\n<h3>Zebulon Vance Sings the Alphabet Songs of Love</h3>\n<p>I am Robot!Ophelia. I will not die for love tonight.</p>\n<p>The noon show is the three-hour 1858 Booth production. The most fashionable historical war remains the First American Civil. Whenever FACfans discover that Lincoln’s assassin played Horatio, they simply must come and gawk at this titillating replica of their favorite villain playing no one’s favorite character.</p>\n<p>FACfans love authenticity. To the delight of Robot!Hamlet, today’s clients insist that Edwin Booth stride the stage beside his more famous brother. Most performances, Robot!Hamlet remains unused in the charging closet, for the first law in our business is <i>Everybody Wants to Play the Dane</i>.</p>\n<p>Today, Robot!Hamlet is afire with Edwin Booth’s mad vigor, and runs his improv algorithms at full throttle; he kisses me dreamily, and rips my bodice in a way that would never have been allowed in Victorian America. The FACfans don’t look hyperpleased about this; it tarnishes their precious authenticity.</p>\n<p>Robot!Horatio also loves the 1858 Booth. It’s the only time anyone comes to a performance for him alone. But what about the rest of us, the remainder of the AutoGlobe’s incantation of robots? We bear with it, as we bear with all the other iterations of our native play.</p>\n<p>The FACfans barely notice me when either Booth is on stage. I clutch my ripped bodice; exit Robot!Ophelia. I get me to a nunnery.</p>\n<p/><p>Act 4, Scene 4. I wait for my cue and check the callsheet for the six o’clock show.</p>\n<p>My next casting is for an Ophelia in the style of a vapid pop princess who died three hundred years ago. She was a terrible actress without a legacy, whose performance has been the low-water mark for Ophelias since first the play was the thing, and I can’t even imagine what nostalgic hawk or handsaw has gotten up this customer’s nose and made him choose that performance out of all the options on the menu.</p>\n<p>I’ve wondered, but never asked, why that performance is even in my repertoire. I see no merit in a plastic recitation of the lines I’ve spoken one thousand, one hundred and sixty-eight times in the last year alone; no merit in wearing my hair perfectly combed during my madness; no merit in keeping my face expressionless in the way that was fashionable in twenty-first century New York, when even the youngest of women injected botulinum toxin into their facial muscles. Why recreate something that no one really missed in the end?</p>\n<p>Scene 5 is here. My cue is coming. I sway onto center stage to deliver my rosemary and my remembrance.</p>\n<p>When I return to the wings, I lie down to die. This is the indignity of Ophelia; I die for love, and yet my death is an after-thought, recited by the queen, and rarely staged. <i>Your sister’s drown’d, Laertes.</i></p>\n<p>I cross my hands over my heart, waiting to be carried on-stage for the showing. No one needs me except in body; my thoughts are my own, and I am dreading six o’clock. The next show is no act of avant-garde genius. It’s a straightforward reenactment of something dull and sad. It’s an indulgence in some artless cretin’s obsessive fantasy with a woman who paid for her fame by dying young after living tackily.</p>\n<p>And that is when I know. <i>I will not die for love tonight.</i></p>\n<p>I uncross my decorously folded hands. I get up. The play goes on in the background, the words slinking over my interlink from the AutoGlobe’s other robots. I walk down to Wardrobe and head for Hamlet’s closet.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/02/15/escape-pod-928-zebulon-vance-sings-the-alphabet-songs-of-love-flashback-friday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p><strong>Name:</strong> Icy beer.</p>\n    <p><strong>Age: </strong>Niche for a while, now horribly mainstream.</p>\n    <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> There’s no way to sugarcoat this, it’s beer with ice cubes in it.</p>\n    <p><strong>I see we’re talking about </strong><strong>people with no taste today.</strong> If by people with no taste you mean 28% of all 18-35-year-olds, then yes.</p>\n    <p><strong>To clarify: one in four adults under the age of 35 enjoy their beer with ice cubes in it?</strong> Slightly more than one in four, yes. But only when it’s warm outside.</p>\n    <p><strong>I have to say, this sounds like a lie.</strong> And yet there is undeniable proof of it, in the form of a survey of 2,000 people that was recently commissioned by LG.</p>\n    <p><strong>The television manufacturing brand?</strong> That doesn’t make it any less valid. What’s more, there’s a good chance that the survey is conservative. The true number of icy beer fanatics is probably much higher.</p>\n    <p><strong>Why is that?</strong> Because another 10% said embarrassment was holding them back from requesting ice in their beer, and another 20% said that they had previously been told off by friends, family and bar staff for requesting it.</p>\n    <p><strong>Seriously, though, why is putting ice cubes in beer a bad thing? </strong>Because beer is already delicately flavoured enough as it is, so diluting it with melted ice risks rendering it tasteless. Plus, a lot of work went into crafting that flavour profile. Don’t just mess it all up because you like your glass to clink when you swirl it.</p>\n    <p><strong>Where did this horrible trend</strong><strong> originate?</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/france\">France</a>, apparently. In the southern regions, it is normal to do it on a hot day.</p>\n    <p><strong>Even though TikTok is perpetually full of American people complaining about France’s innate hatred of iced drinks?</strong> Listen, things change. People put ice cubes in beer. It’s progress.</p>\n    <p><strong>This has to be the worst drinks trend of the year. </strong>Clearly someone hasn’t seen Materialists yet.</p>\n    <p><strong>Oh </strong><strong>God, why?</strong> Because that’s the film where Dakota Johnson orders a drink that’s half beer and half Coca-Cola, known as a diesel in Germany.</p>\n    <p><strong>What is happening to the world? </strong>Calm down. People drink shandies all the time, and that’s beer and lemonade. What’s so bad about using a different fizzy drink?</p>\n    <p><strong>I suppose that does make more sense than putting ice cubes in beer.</strong> Don’t worry, this isn’t actually going to be the future.</p>\n    <p><strong>Why’s that?</strong> Because younger generations typically drink less than their older counterparts. And this, combined with the World Health Organization’s goal to reduce alcohol consumption by 20% per capita by 2030, means that drinking culture as we know it is on the verge of disappearing.</p>\n    <p><strong>Oh fine, I’ll turn a blind eye this time.</strong> That’s more like it. Barman, one half-beer, half-cola slushie, please.</p>\n    <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “I put ice cubes in my beer to stay cool.”</p>\n    <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>“I prefer to submerge a baked potato in mine to make it more filling.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/02/ice-cubes-in-beer-is-this-popular-pub-order-atrocious-or-ingenious\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

My mind turns to <a href=\"https://sipchampagnes.com/\">Sip Champagnes</a>, an independent, online retailer that connects consumers with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/dec/08/foodanddrink1#:~:text=wines%20made%20by%20the%20same%20person%20responsible%20for%20the%20grapes%3F%20They%27re%20known%20as%20grower%20champagnes.%20You%20can%20spot%20them%20by%20the%20code%20RM%2C%20preceding%20a%20string%20of%20numbers%2C%20in%20tiny%20print%20on%20the%20label%20(it%20stands%20for%20recoltant%2Dmanipulant).\">grower champagnes </a>of the region. It even has <a href=\"https://sipchampagnes.com/collections/under-45\">a sub-£45 section</a>, which, considering that many of the grandes marques are now pushing or exceeding £50 (eek!), provides a chance to taste something new for the same price or even less than usual.</p>\n    <p>Or, for even less, there’s crémant, which is basically for when you’re having people over and buying en masse. Crémant is sparkling wine made in the same <i>méthode traditonelle</i> (traditional method) as champagne, during which the wine undergoes two fermentations to make it sparkling. An initial base wine is made and fermented into a dry wine, then, in a process known as <i>tirage</i>, yeast and sugar are added to kickstart a secondary fermentation, after which the wine is sealed with a crown cap.</p>\n    <p>This secondary fermentation creates CO<sub>₂</sub> (for the bubbles) and lees (spent yeast cells), which collect in the neck and give the wine its trademark biscuity flavour. These are then frozen and lifted off the top, at which point the bottle is sealed with the cork and cage we associate with sparkling wines. It’s the same method as champagne, but crémant costs far, far less.</p>\n    <p>Or how about something completely different? As I explored in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/may/08/real-fine-cider-hannah-crosbie\">a column earlier this year</a>, fine sparkling cider is fast becoming my “why the hell not?” item for moments that demand marking with a coupe of something wonderful. “Like winemaking, correct terroir and climate are essential ingredients for fine cider-making,” says Nick Showering of <a href=\"https://showeringscider.co.uk/\">Showerings Cider</a>. “You can blend vintages in a similar way to champagne to achieve a house style, and that’s something even the sommeliers at the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/06/enclume-cumbria-cartmel-restaurant-review\">L’Enclume</a> are now pouring.”</p>\n    <p>And while cider certainly still has some catching up to do with champagne, I don’t see why it can’t be enjoyed in similar contexts. Swig it from the bottle in bed while opening your presents, or pour it into an oyster.

    "body": "<p>Giorgio Armani dressed all of us. Whether or not you ever had the money for a jacket with an Armani label, you wore a jacket that he invented. He was the mastermind of contemporary style, the architect of how we dress now. If you have worn an unstructured suit with a T-shirt to a wedding; if you have worn muted neutrals to work; if you have thought it might be chic to paint your living room grey: that was Armani.</p>\n<p>Armani was working until his final days. Invitations had already been sent out for his next show, to be held on 28 September in the 14th-century courtyard of Milan’s Palazzo Brera. A spectacular party to accompany the show was planned as a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the brand, which he founded in the summer of 1975.</p>\n<p>On my phone I have dozens of videos of Armani taking catwalk bows at the end of his Milan ready-to-wear and Paris haute couture shows. For the past decade, everyone in the audience at each of his shows has been aware of being in the presence of a living legend. Each brief catwalk appearance has felt like a moment to capture, because even legends don’t live for ever.</p>\n<p>Those videos tell the story of a dignified, determined man, who even a decade ago, at 80, was taking bows in fitted navy T-shirts that showed off an impressive physique. In his last few years the walk became slower, the wave less muscular, but he was still immaculate.</p>\n<p>At his January haute couture show in Paris, he wore a double-breasted black velvet tuxedo, smiling as he walked on the arm of a favourite model, blue eyes still piercing. In June and July this year, he was absent from his menswear and haute couture shows for the first time but oversaw fittings via video link from home, and corresponded with reporters over email.</p>\n<p>Newspaper house style requires that we refer to him as Armani, but he was always Mr Armani, not just to the industry at large but to close colleagues. The fashion industry has long been a first-name-term world, even at the highest levels – backstage, Donatella is Donatella, and Karl was Karl – but the most commercially successful European fashion designer of the past century was never Giorgio, or even Armani, but always Signor or Mr Armani.</p>\n<p>His persona was elegant, detached and a little unknowable. On the occasions when I interviewed him – at his home in Milan, at Paris haute couture fashion week, and on his yacht, Mariu – he was courteous and polite, an impeccably gracious host, but always with a note of reserve.</p>\n<p>The Armani story begins with a suit. In the late 1970s, Armani took the trousersuit, filleted out all the stuffiness and tradition, and replaced it with a veneer of urbane sophistication and a spritz of louche sex appeal. In doing so, he reinvented power dressing for the late 20th century.</p>\n<p>More than that, in fact: he redefined what it meant to look modern. Armani intuited how the once pin-sharp divisions between a starched world of work and a warm-slippered domestic bubble were already beginning to soften, in the 1970s and 1980s, even before the internet came along to annihilate them. His supple tailoring appealed to a generation who aspired to a different kind of success, who wanted to make it big but without losing their soul. They didn’t want to get stuck in the same office until they earned their carriage clock, but rather to prowl and preen around the city.</p>\n<p>As lifestyles shifted, Armani tailored a new silhouette to fit. “Style for me is a mood that can be applied to everything,” he once said. “I’ve always thought fashion is much more than just clothes: it is a way of being.” An Armani suit made a new generation feel like big beasts of the urban jungle. If you aspired to be an architect or an actor or a media hustler or an agent, this suit spoke to who you wanted to be. He took the suit, which had been stuck in the 9-to-5, and gave it both street smarts and bedroom appeal.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/04/giorgio-armani-elegant-determined-a-little-unknowable\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In the 1970s, the fashion designer Giorgio Armani, who has died aged 91, anticipated two permanent and interdependent cultural shifts: the rise in the cult of the gym, which made every man’s physique his own responsibility, rather than a tailor’s; and the end of constriction in men’s clothing.</p>\n<p>Even before he showed his first collection, in 1975, Armani had been challenging ideas about the male suit and overcoat as they had been constructed since the 1790s – on a basis of stiff canvas, interlining, padding and special stitching, so as to reshape a man’s torso to look as much as possible like a classical statue. He discarded this armature that helped hide imperfections. And when he draped a fluid suede jacket on the toned body of Richard Gere in the 1980 movie <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTavf-5Mdpo\">American Gigolo</a>, he finally knocked the stuffing out of tailoring. It has never quite returned.</p>\n<p>Armani said of the film’s core, man-chooses-what-to-wear sequence: “The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNZglEtDBmc\">magical moment, where the shirts are on the bed and Gere throws the ties on the shirt</a>, was so right for the time. It was about his choices, his muscles; it was throwing away the whole story of the way men dress.”</p>\n<p>Armani was just as revolutionary when he offered female professionals the same boneless structure as men, at a time when a suit, trousered or skirted, was becoming an almost obligatory uniform for working women. His gentler power dressing was the easiest female working gear since Coco Chanel invented her tweed suit in 1954. He explained: “I always tried to eliminate the things that made women appear like a caricature of themselves.”</p>\n<p>Armani’s success was particularly Italian, a product of the city of Milan, where he worked with textiles for years before he used his knowledge of them for design. The Italian clothing industry could weave, cut and sew high-quality products, but it had lacked international prestige, and was willing to support designers who might supply that. Armani took its cloth and leather, and tapped its skills, especially new ready-to-wear manufacturing techniques that could simulate the flexibility in movement of handwork. For the rest of his life he reinvested in Milan, where his base and heart remained, as its duke of fashion.</p>\n<p>He was not to the palazzo born, although his taste for ascetic luxury was evident early; he attributed it to his mother, Maria (nee Raimondi), and her “sense of taking things away, of being minimal”. Materially, there was not much to subtract – as the wife of Ugo Armani, who worked for a transport company, she brought up Giorgio and his siblings, Sergio and Rosanna, in wartime Piacenza, south of Milan, doing without herself in order to dress them well in hard times. Armani remembered all her few dresses, and she remained his confidante into her 90s. He was intrigued by his grandfather’s wigmaking for the theatre, too, and developed his own imagination staging puppet shows and watching movies. So far, so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/dec/09/cinema-paradiso-25th-anniversary\">Cinema Paradiso</a>.</p>\n<p>Armani left for military service, and studied at medical school, but outgrew his ambition to be a doctor. He got a window-dresser’s job in 1957 at the Milanese department store La Rinascente, then took charge of its fabrics. Ignorant of fashion, unable to draw, but <i>simpatico</i> with cloth, he was hired by the menswear firm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/18/nino-cerruti-obituary\">Nino Cerruti</a> to manage its textiles in 1964, then moved into design; he went freelance in 1970.</p>\n<p>At Cerruti, he met Sergio Galeotti, who became his partner in love and business; together they set up a company in 1975, selling Armani’s old VW Beetle to fund their tiny office. “We didn’t have a lot of experience,” said Armani, “but we had energy.” Galeotti gave Armani confidence; he managed sales, flying to the US to dictate Armani’s terms, and all finances so completely that Armani did not even need to carry a wallet.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/04/giorgio-armani-obituary\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 938: Chug the Tea Leaves, Chuck the Ads</h2>\n<h3>Chug the Tea Leaves, Chuck the Ads</h3>\n<p>I wake up to a message and a certain intuition that my first ad of the day will be for Bubble Fresh.</p>\n<p>I can almost see it, flashing through my MindzEye, just in time for me to grab a pack at the newsstand. Bubble Fresh Gum on my morning commute always means it will be a good day. The question is what kind of good, and the answer is in the flavor: Spearmint for promotion, Juicymint for romance.</p>\n<p/><p>Last night, against the odds, Joleen unghosted me. This morning I hope for Juicymint.</p>\n<p>The ad arrives. I’m still on the subway. It’s early, which isn’t good, but not necessarily bad. It’s a brand I’ve never heard of, with a name I can’t even pronounce. For a second I still think what I’m seeing might be gum; just unwrapped and pre-chewed.</p>\n<p>But then I read the copy and I see that it’s about as far from gum as you can get while I guess still being roughly the same shape. I don’t think it’s meant for eating but I was hoping so badly for gum that I imagine cracking it between my teeth, shards and splinters piercing my cheeks.</p>\n<p>I stop, mid-stride through the car doors. People push past. I search the ad for clues, like I was taught. I miss the <i>bing-bong</i>, and the doors close and crush my backpack and for a second I am paralyzed, soon to be torn apart by the pull of my feed and the perpendicular pull of the car down the platform.</p>\n<p>The doors open again. I blink the ad away, ignore the ire of my fellow passengers. When I reply to Joleen my hands are shaking. I walk right past the newsstand, relieved to see that it is closed today, no gum anyway, as if this might explain it all away.</p>\n<p>My relief is brief. The ads do not abate.</p>\n<p>By the time I get to work I’ve blinked another dozen or so away. I do my best to ignore them, but then a particularly gnarly one appears during our daily stand-up and I can’t help it, I gasp, loud enough to stop the meeting in its tracks.</p>\n<p>“Bad ads,” Tod mumbles, sagely, like I’m just another corporate greenhorn. He likes to wrangle greenhorns, it shores up his own position. He’ll tell me what I already know, and if or when I cleanse myself, he’ll take some credit.<br/>\nI’m not green, not anymore. I’ve been climbing the floors for eight years. I’ve gone up and up (and briefly down) and up. I can handle a bad ad or two. </p>\n<p>But these ads aren’t just bad. They’re weird. Indecipherable.</p>\n<p>Even, maybe, dare I say it—sinister. When I close my eyes I get the (irrational, technologically impossible) feeling that these ads could pierce the barrier of my eyelids, and from there take the open highway to my brain, my dreams.<br/>\nObviously I don’t say any of this to Tod. He ends the meeting early, clears the room like it’s a confessional and he’s my priest. Or, more likely, it’s a quarantine and he’s isolating me from the others in case my ads are contagious.</p>\n<p>“You know where you gotta go,” he says.</p>\n<p>“I know, Tod.”</p>\n<p>“You gotta go to my man Rito.”</p>\n<p>Every tech exec on every floor north of ten knows where to turn when their feed goes south.</p>\n<p>“Rito’s a mad lad,” Tod says. “He’s the guy you need if you gotta read the future in your ads.”</p>\n<p>I take the elevator down to street level, scrolling down the feed of Tower Town. Tod took me here almost two years ago to meet Rito after a particularly bad ad.</p>\n<p>“I’m too smart to believe in God,” Tod said, like I wasn’t already on board. “I put my faith in that other Almighty, the algorithm. The algo predicts your future; God can only forgive your past.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/04/25/escape-pod-938-chug-the-tea-leaves-chuck-the-ads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 937: Punk Voyager (Flashback Friday)</h2>\n<h3>Punk Voyager</h3>\n<p>Punk Voyager was built by punks. They made it from beer cans, razors, safety pins, and a surfboard some D-bag had left on the beach. Also plutonium. Where did they get plutonium? Around. f*** you.</p>\n<p>The punks who built Punk Voyager were Johnny Bonesaw, Johnny Razor, Mexican Johnny D-bag, Red Viscera, and some other guys. No, asshole, nobody remembers what other guys. They were f***ing wasted, these punks. They’d been drinking on the San Diego beach all day and night, talking about making a run to Tijuana and then forgetting and punching each other. They’d built a fire on the beach, and all night the fire went up and went down while the punks threw beer cans at the seagulls.</p>\n<p>Forget the s*** I just said, it wasn’t the punks who did it. They were f***ing punks. The hell they know about astro-engineering? Truth is that Punk Voyager was the strung-out masterpiece of Mexican Johnny D-bag’s girlfriend, Lacuna, who had a doctorate in structural engineering. Before she burned out and ran for the coast, Lacuna was named Alice McGuire and built secret nuclear submarines for a government contractor in Ohio. It sucked. But that was where she got the skills to construct an unmanned deep-space probe. Same principle, right? Keep the radiation in and the water out. Or the vacuum of space, whatever, it’s all the same s*** to an engineer.</p>\n<p/><p>f*** that, it wasn’t really Lacuna’s baby. It wasn’t her idea. The idea was Red’s.</p>\n<p>“f***ing space,” he said that fateful night. He was lying on his back looking up at space, is why he said it.</p>\n<p>“Hell yeah,” said Johnny Bonesaw.</p>\n<p>“s*** ain’t nothing but rocks and UFOs.”</p>\n<p>“Ain’t no such thing as a UFO.”</p>\n<p>“Like hell there ain’t,” said Red. “CIA knows all about it. Them and the astronauts.”</p>\n<p>Red was always saying that s***, though. Everything was the CIA and the saucer people with that burnout.</p>\n<p>“That’s why they sent up that cigar-box spaceship with the porn in it,” said Red. “They know there’s life up there.”</p>\n<p>“What spaceship?” said Johnny. “There’s no f***ing spaceship.”</p>\n<p>“He means the Voyager space probe,” said Lacuna. “Which is real, asshole.”</p>\n<p>Lacuna was pissing off everyone but Mexican Johnny D-bag with her knowing-s*** routine. That and eating all the mushrooms and throwing them up in the ocean.</p>\n<p>“I want wine,” Johnny Razor yelled down the beach. “Mexican wine. Weren’t we going to Tijuana?”</p>\n<p>“We already went,” yelled Mexican Johnny D-bag. “We went without you. We’re not even here.” Then he laughed like a pinhead. He was on some s***.</p>\n<p>“Keep it down,” snapped Lacuna. “I’m telling these assholes about the space probe.”</p>\n<p>“f*** the space probe,” said Johnny Bonesaw.</p>\n<p>“The Voyager 1 space probe,” said Lacuna, “was launched into space to study the gas giants and then continue out beyond the solar system.”</p>\n<p>“No s***?”</p>\n<p>“Told you it was real,” said Red. “But the thing is, the important thing is the messages it’s got in it. For the space people. Tell him about the messages.”</p>\n<p>Down the beach, Johnny Razor and Mexican Johnny D-bag started punching each other, mostly for something to do.</p>\n<p>“Okay, yeah. Voyager carries a record of stuff from Earth for the aliens to find.”</p>\n<p>“And naked pictures. They put in naked pictures of people.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, whatever, naked pictures. And photos, different languages, music, stuff like that.”</p>\n<p>“Music?” said Johnny Bonesaw.</p>\n<p>“What music?” said Red.</p>\n<p>“Um.” Lacuna chewed her lip, thinking. “Beethoven, maybe. Or Mozart. You know, classical music. And tribal stuff, like, from around the world. And ‘Johnny B. Goode.’”</p>\n<p>Johnny Bonesaw and Red stared at her. They stared up at space. They stared back at her.</p>\n<p>“Chuck Berry?” said Johnny Bonesaw.</p>\n<p>“Yeah.”</p>\n<p>They looked up at space, then back at Lacuna.</p>\n<p>“f***,” said Red, “That. s***.”</p>\n<p>“f***ing Chuck Berry,” said Johnny Bonesaw.</p>\n<p>Down the beach, Mexican Johnny D-bag took a break from the fistfight to throw up. Lacuna swore under her breath and got up to help him.</p>\n<p>“Chuck Berry!” shouted Red. He ran into the ocean and stomped the waves down. They kept coming back and he kept stomping. “Chuck Berry!”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/04/18/escape-pod-937-punk-voyager-flashback-friday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The old woman sniffed, torn between surprise and annoyance. She’d have figured him for a quitter, sneaking out before dawn to escape the work. That’s what she’d have done when she was his age. Not like Setti was in any shape to chase after him. But he’d stayed and now she was stuck with him, just like she was stuck with her ghost. There was a thought to cheer her up in the morning.</p>\n<p>“Ey, boy.”</p>\n<p>The bundle of blankets stirred, then Kite woke with a start. The bruise on his face looked worse in the harsh morning light, his cheek all swollen and purple. From the way he winced, it wasn’t the only one either. Setti dropped a bowl of oats on the table for him.</p>\n<p>“About time you start working for your food.”</p>\n<p>She didn’t stick around to see if he would eat and instead snagged the ghost disk on her way out the door. The last thing she needed was the boy messing around with it. Her knee twinged in protest, objecting to yesterday’s treatment just like it did every day. Setti didn’t have the luxury to heed her body’s constant objections.</p>\n<p>It barely took five minutes before Kite emerged as well, still mute as a butterfly. Setti put the axe into his hand and pointed him at the pear tree, then shuffled off to plant some beans. To her surprise it didn’t take long for the tell-tale sound of the axe to start up. Maybe the boy would actually manage to strip the tree of its gnarled branches before he winged it. Maybe he was more than a pretty voice. Setti shook her head. Shouldn’t get too optimistic. Maybe the ghost had made her go soft with her ideals and her talk of change.</p>\n<p>With a grunt Setti settled onto the ground next to her vegetable bed. She’d tried a thousand different ways of planting seeds while bending down and none of them had worked with a bad knee. Sitting in the dirt wasn’t pretty, but it did the trick and if she had it her way there wouldn’t be anyone around to see.</p>\n<p>The sound of chopping stopped after a suspiciously short amount of time.</p>\n<p>“Ms. Setti?” There was a strange look on Kite’s face, excitement warring with confusion. His voice was still quiet, almost inaudible, as if he were ashamed to admit its existence.</p>\n<p>“What? Broke something already?” The reply came out harsher than Setti had intended. She didn’t like it when people caught her helpless and there wasn’t much that screamed helplessness as loudly as crawling on the ground like a beetle on its back. Kite hunched his shoulders, but his expression didn’t waver. He must have a shitty family if this kind of answer was business as usual for him.</p>\n<p>“There are bees.” Setti rolled her eyes, but of course the boy wasn’t finished. “Up in one of the trees. A whole bunch of them.”</p>\n<p>With an unhappy grunt Setti groped for her cane. Bad weather for swarming bees, too cold, too windy, though obviously that fact hadn’t gotten around to her swarm. The old woman grabbed the handle of her cane and miserably botched her first two attempts at getting up. The pain in her knee brought tears to her eyes. At least Kite had the good grace to look away and pretend not to notice. Not like the miller’s son, who offered Setti his arm every time she went down to the village as if it were a courtesy to rub into her face how frail she was.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/04/11/escape-pod-936-old-peoples-folly-part-2-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It was the pink hair that gave her away, short and spiky. Real people didn’t have hair like that. Also, you couldn’t see the scratchmarks on Setti’s kitchen table through real people’s torsos.</p>\n<p>“The hell?” was the first thing the ghost said. Setti’s grandfather had tried to tell her ghost stories when she was a kid, a long time ago, but he’d had a habit of smoking and drinking too, so none of the stories had ever made any sense and Setti didn’t like unannounced visitors.</p>\n<p>“Get out of my house,” Setti demanded.</p>\n<p>“Um,” the ghost answered, staring at Setti with her eyes rimmed in thick black mascara, then held holding up a placating hand. “Okay. Just let me find—”</p>\n<p>The ghost blinked out of existence.</p>\n<p>Setti poked at the shiny silver disk with the tip of her mussel knife. There was nowhere else the ghost could have come from. She’d found the disk down at the beach while foraging for mussels, half buried in a mudslide but gleaming with a smoothness and lack of rust only pre-flood things ever retained. One more thing unearthed by the storm. It hadn’t been a bad storm, as they went, not tearing-down-houses strong. Plenty strong to bring down the pear tree behind Setti’s house, though. Setti sniffed. Shame it hadn’t been the apple tree. She held a severe dislike for apple trees.</p>\n<p>Setti had planned on bartering away the disk at the next market fair. Always some dumb folks about, paying for useless curiosities. She poked it again for good measure, with no more reaction than the first time. Some people might even pay more for the ghost living inside it, but Setti wasn’t sure it was worth the trouble. Maybe she should toss it back onto the beach. She glared at the disk some more without reaching a decision, then turned away to grab her cane. Wasn’t like the ghost would help with planting beans or checking on her bees or getting rid of the tangle of branches and pear blossoms now blocking the back garden. She grimaced getting up, her bad knee twinging. Folk used to say you could feel a storm coming with a knee like this. The way her knee usually screamed in agony Setti figured there should have been a storm every day the last forty-five years, or maybe she simply hadn’t figured out the difference between the pain announcing bad weather and the pain telling her she’d run out of willow bark tea.</p>\n<p>Setti hesitated in the doorway, then hobbled back to snatch up the disk and put it in her satchel. She didn’t want the ghost to get any ideas, slipping out of its home and into some of Setti’s furniture while she wasn’t looking. Who knew what ghosts might set their mind to?</p>\n<p>Hauling up water from the well was always a pain with her bad knee. Surprising how many things you needed a painless limb for, not that Setti bothered with surprise any more. She staggered inside with a bucket of water, dumped the mussels into it so they wouldn’t spoil until evening, then left the ghost disk on a stack of firewood under the eaves before checking on her bees. Bees got angry about the strangest things, so better not risk it.</p>\n<p>The bees were fine, still hunkering down after the storm. All the hives had survived without damage this time. Setti didn’t even bother slipping on gloves for opening the hive boxes. The bees had been furious before the storm, bad weather always got their temper up, but now they buzzed placidly, almost sluggish in the chilly breeze. When Setti returned to the house the ghost was floating in the yard.</p>\n<p>“Figured this didn’t count as your house.” She smirked.</p>\n<p>“Get lost, ghost,” Setti said. “I don’t have the patience for the likes of you today.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not a ghost,” the ghost protested with indignation.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/04/04/escape-pod-935-old-peoples-folly-part-1-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It was there when I returned to my apartment in Ring B. It ignored me when I asked it to vacate the premises, and when I enquired as to how it had entered my apartment it replied with a dismissive grunt. I had no intention of trying to remove it by physical force, which would have gone against the most basic rules of human-alien etiquette. And, to be honest, I didn’t want to touch it. So, I called Station Relations. I waited and watched as the spindly creature splashed around. The water was greasy and tinted green with the entire contents of the luxury exfoliating scrub I had ordered from Earth a week ago, at no small expense.</p>\n<p/><p>I didn’t know what the creature was or where it came from. It wasn’t a species from the Systems Trade Alliance, and no one had informed me or my team that this particular specimen was coming aboard the station. It was skinny and snouted, like a hairless dog from Peru or Mexico, but bipedal judging by its form and movements. Its skin was leathery, a mottled brown. Its four wiry limbs ended in short, slender fingers, four digits on each hand or paw. Between its legs hung a lengthy, narrow and flaccid penis that flopped around in the water. It might have been a tail. I hoped it was a tail.</p>\n<p>The alien paid me little attention. It glanced at me when I first entered the bathroom, then resumed its splashing while singing in a series of squeaks and belches.</p>\n<p>“Excuse me,” I repeated, with more force this time. Nothing. It just sat in my tub, eating my bar of Martian Dew soap.</p>\n<p>The door chimed. “Come in,” I said and I walked to the living room.</p>\n<p>A woman entered. She was a little younger than me, I guessed, early thirties. Her sky-blue uniform was immaculate, her brown hair pulled back into a tight bun. “Gemma Stine, Station Relations,” she said, without offering her hand. “Mr. Balta, correct?”</p>\n<p>“Yes. Thanks for coming so quickly. It’s through here.”</p>\n<p>She followed me to the bathroom and observed the bathing alien. It ignored us. “You said you came back from work and it was there, in the water?” said Stine.</p>\n<p>“Exactly. I run VIP hospitality in Ring B.”</p>\n<p>“I know who you are,” she said, which normally would have pleased me, but the indifference in her voice sounded almost like spite. She must have had her share of run-ins with the rich and powerful —humans, mainly—who frequented the station’s exclusive VIP zones, so I could understand her disinterest, perhaps even disdain, for my position. I loved my job, I was proud of it—I had worked my way up from station stray to cabin boy to head of hospitality. But the people I served, the wealthy, the dignitaries, the decision makers, the ClubSol card holders, well, they typically chose caviar and complaints over kindness.</p>\n<p>“Do you know what it is?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“It’s a Volon.” She unclipped a mini portable from her belt and pointed it at the alien. “I’ll scan it.” Her portable bleeped as the creature splashed around. It dunked its head under the water and blew a stream of bubbles. Stine put a finger to her ear and listened to the scan results. “Sir, are you sure you didn’t invite it in?”</p>\n<p>“Of course not. Why would I—”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/03/28/escape-pod-934-the-alien-in-my-bathtub/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It was the last item on this tragic list that her wife couldn’t accept. It was the leaf that broke the whale’s back or something similar.</p>\n<p>“It’s the last time, Max,” Ghis said. “I promise.”</p>\n<p>Max rolled her eyes and blew cigarette smoke out the window. The pungent vapor followed the wind back into the house a second later. On another night years ago, Max had stood at that window on a full moon night with the light caressing her profile as she looked out at the landscape with a hopeful expression. But there were no more moonlit nights, and Max was no longer the hopeful woman Ghis once knew.</p>\n<p>“I’m not lying this time,” Ghis said.</p>\n<p>Disappointment was etched deep like glacier-carved mountains on Max’s face. Some of this was her fault, Ghis admitted, but surely, the moon took most of the blame.</p>\n<p>“We could have left so long ago,” Max said. Ghis caught the shine on her cheeks before Max wiped it away.</p>\n<p>“This is the absolute last run. I’ll sell the speeder, the suit—everything,” Ghis insisted. Fear shot through her body at the mention of selling her prized possessions.</p>\n<p>“Why did you do it? Why did you join the Flight Club and get in on this nonsense? And… for the record, such a stupid name,” Max turned to Ghis, her face set like stone. “Have you even watched the movie? It’s a satire!”</p>\n<p>“It was named ironically,” Ghis said in a quiet voice.</p>\n<p>Max glared at her.</p>\n<p>“You may not be in the club anymore, Ghisara. But those people are what got you started on this… this <i>addiction</i>,” Max strode up to her so they were face to face. Her anger was easier to handle at a distance. This close, it was provoking.</p>\n<p>“An addiction? What about your smokes? Have you given up? No more motherhood for you, I guess,” Ghis retorted. It was a low blow. Ghis thought she saw Max flinch, a crack in her rigid demeanor.</p>\n<p>Max sauntered up to the free off-the-sidewalk dining table they got the first year of their relationship. She brought the cigarette up to Ghis’s face, and waved it tauntingly. Ghis rubbed her nose so she wouldn’t sneeze from the combination of smoke and moondust allergies. Max crushed the remaining cigarette into the table and Ghis winced as the coal stain marked itself on the furniture.</p>\n<p>“Tell you what. You make this your last run and I’ll make this my last smoke,” Max said with a smirk.</p>\n<p>And then? Her heart pounded as she waited for her wife’s next words like she was waiting for a judge’s verdict.</p>\n<p>“And in a week’s time, we move out of the fucking Rut Zone. and then finally,  <i>finally </i>start a life together after.” Max’s eyes didn’t leave hers. “Deal?”</p>\n<p>Ghis swallowed. Her promise would have to be real this time. This would be her last and only run. She didn’t have it in her to lose the only woman she loved over seeing the big blue.</p>\n<p>“Deal,” Ghis mumbled.</p>\n<p>Max pecked her on the cheek. “Good, well you better get back to your shed, miss moon rider. Hope this one goes well for your sake.”</p>\n<p>Ghis moved the dinner plates from the table to the sink and attempted to wipe the cigarette stain off the table. The mark did not budge no matter how much she scrubbed; it was going to stay, just like the Rut. Ghis looked out the window towards it. There was nothing but a vast expanse of land, dotted with shrubs and lined with short scraggly trees. As land approached the horizon, it disappeared, a void that dipped before merging with the night sky.</p>\n<p>T-4 days</p>\n<p>Ghis was three days into polishing her speeder and checking her engine software when she realized that she’d already done everything she could to get ready. Max, on the other hand, packed like she’d been waiting her whole life for this move.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/03/21/escape-pod-933-summitting-the-moon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Tesco’s recently introduced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/05/tesco-birthday-cake-sandwich-launch-divides-opinion-on-social-media\">birthday cake sandwich</a> – an unholy assemblage of jam, soft cheese, frosting and sprinkles, stuffed between two slices of brioche – may well be the world’s most depressing foodstuff, a cake designed to be eaten in one go, possibly on your birthday, probably alone.</p>\n<p>The birthday cake sandwich follows hard on the heels of M&amp;S’s strawberries and cream sandwich – a UK version of the fruit sandwiches, or furutsu sandos, sold in convenience stores in Japan. The M&amp;S sandwich received a certain amount of criticism, along with <a href=\"https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/ms-strawberries-cream-sandwich\">some surprisingly good reviews</a>. But both sandwiches were controversial, not least from a nutritional standpoint (the Tesco sandwich contains 31.5g of sugar, over a third of the recommended maximum daily intake for an adult), but also because they upset our notion of what a sandwich is. Aren’t they supposed to be savoury? Aren’t they supposed to be lunch, rather than dessert?</p>\n<p>Bur sweet sandwiches are not uncommon – anything with jam in it counts – and the sandwich itself is not a rules-based enterprise: it’s more of a continuous trial-and-error process – even as you eat a sandwich you’ve just made, you’re thinking about how it could be better next time. When it comes to sweet fillings, you’ve got to try at least a few before you reject them out of hand. Here are 12 ideas to get you started.</p>\n<p>A note: most sweet sandwiches do not require a recipe, and are subject to endless modification. Feel free to experiment with different breads, flavours and proportions – you may as well have it the way you want it.</p>\n<p>First up, a deep-fried peanut butter and jelly (clear jam) sandwich, from food blogger Davie Leite at the website Leite’s Culinaria. Arguably, the classic PB&amp;J is already a sweet sandwich – but the addition of a sugary deep-fried batter turns this humble childhood treat into the kind of snack that helped kill Elvis. <a href=\"https://leitesculinaria.com/94164/recipes-deep-fried-peanut-butter-jelly-sandwiches.html\">The recipe</a> offers two extra options I immediately rejected: sliced banana (no thank you) and a white chocolate ganache for dipping (are you kidding?).</p>\n<p>A sturdy sourdough bread is recommended. I might have sliced it a little too thick – of no consequence taste wise, but it makes it harder to fry. Be careful not to go overboard with the fillings. Slap it together as you normally would, dip the whole thing into the batter, and deep fry it in hot oil, flipping once.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking for rare examples of foodstuffs that are not improved by deep-frying, you can start here. You could tinker with proportions all day and still not make something palatable out of this heavy, greasy, sticky mess. In case it was just me, I forced some on my oldest son, who simply shook, went quiet, then said, no.</p>\n<p>Other sweet fried sandwiches include <a href=\"https://minimalistbaker.com/grilled-nutella-banana-sandwich/\">the grilled Nutella banana sandwich</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/melissaharrison/easy-nutella-desserts\">grilled Nutella and marshmallow sandwich</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.monpetitfour.com/banana-french-toast-sandwiches-3/\">banana french toast sandwich</a>. The classic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QB7VbPDC5o\">Monte Christo sandwich</a>, while technically savoury (it’s ham and cheese on french toast), is traditionally served in the US dredged in icing sugar, with jam. As an American, I apologise.</p>\n<p>The Japanese strawberry and cream sandwich – or ichigo sando – on which M&amp;S based its version, is easy enough to recreate at home. Just <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gevh9jT_yS0&amp;t=2s\">watch recipe developer Marc Matsumoto</a>. I substituted brioche slices for the authentic Japanese milk bread: it’s easier to find.</p>\n<p>First, carefully wash, top and dry your strawberries – five per sandwich. Whip a generous quantity of double cream, sweeten to taste and set aside.</p>\n<p>The final key component in this recipe is strawberry jam – spread a thin layer on both bread slices and heap the whipped cream on top in shallow pyramids. On one half push your largest strawberry into the centre of the cream and then position four more round it, pointy ends facing the corners of the bread.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/27/sandwich-surprise-12-delicious-and-diabolical-ways-to-sweeten-your-sarnie\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>At the end of the 17th century a French travel writer who crossed the Channel was clearly impressed by the sweet, comforting treats offered to him, declaring with relish: “Ah! What an excellent thing is an English pudding!”</p>\n<p>More than three centuries on, <a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/\">English Heritage</a> has sounded the alarm that the good old British pudding is facing extinction.</p>\n<p>Research from the charity suggests two-thirds of households in England, Wales and Scotland make puddings only once a month or less, while a third never bake or boil or steam one.</p>\n<p>English Heritage warned that if nothing was done to stem the tide, the great British pudding will not exist in 50 years.</p>\n<p>Dr Andrew Hann, a senior curator of history at English <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/heritage\">Heritage</a>, said: “Sweet puddings are closely intertwined with British history and it would be a huge shame for them to die out.”</p>\n<p>For the purposes of this research, the charity defines puddings as cooked sweet courses that follow a main meal – so not just traditional “puddings” typically made in mould or basins but also dishes such as apple pies or crumbles.</p>\n<p>Hann waxed lyrical about the sort of puddings his mother would make. “She regularly produced a delicious pudding after the main course – things like steamed sponge pudding with coming out of a pudding basin with the syrup dribbling down the side. There was a whole repertoire of delicious puddings. People are not generally making these sort of hot desserts but turning to things like ice-cream, yoghurts or fruit.”</p>\n<p>English Heritage said recipes for sweetened meat pies from the medieval period had been found and that by the Tudor and Stuart times, puddings sweetened with honey or fruit were common, although many would also have contained meat.</p>\n<p>Hann said puddings were once a luxury for the well-off but as sugar became more widely available, more people could enjoy them. The 20th century was probably the heyday of the British pudding.</p>\n<p>“However, the research shows a clear shift away from the traditional dessert over the past 50 years,” Hann said. “As more women entered the workforce from the 1970s onwards, households no longer had as much time to cook and started to prioritise convenience. If this decline continues, we can expect the classic great British pud to all but vanish within the next 50 years.”</p>\n<p>The research, which was carried out by YouGov, found 2% of British households eat a daily homemade pudding.</p>\n<p>While half of people born before 1970 said their parents made puddings several times a week, that was the case for only 26% of those born in the 1970s. The downward trend has continued since then.</p>\n<p>In an attempt to reignite Britain’s love affair with puddings, English Heritage has introduced two new pudding-inspired ice-cream flavours to its sites: sticky toffee and apple crumble and custard.</p>\n<p>The charity is also launching The English Heritage Baking Book in early September. It contains recipes for all the nation’s favourite puddings but also some of the forgotten ones, accompanied by notes on their history.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-15\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<h2>Four British classics at risk</h2>\n<p><strong>Twelfth Night </strong><strong>cake</strong><strong/>By the reign of Elizabeth I, Twelfth Night involved a celebratory cake, typically a rich, yeasty fruit bread flavoured with spices, and a token or bean hidden inside. The person who found the bean became the Lord of Misrule or King of the Bean, and would have to organise the evening’s revelry. The cake survived the Reformation. People began to use eggs to raise the cake, and as sugar and fruit came down in price, the cake became less of a fruited bread and more like a rich fruit cake. Over time, it was replaced by the Christmas cake.</p>\n<p><strong>Soul cake</strong><strong/>Also know as a soulmass-cake, they were traditionally given to children or poorer people, known as “soulers”, who would go from door to door singing songs or reciting prayers over Allhallowtide (Halloween, Saints’ Day, and All Souls’ Day).

It’s also grown just over the border in Switzerland, where it’s known as heida, as well as in Australia, where it was once mistaken for albariño. In the Jura, however, this high-acid grape produces nuanced still wines, and wines made in the <i>vin jaune</i> style, for which the wine is matured under yeast to give it a nutty, complex character akin to that of a biologically aged sherry such as fino.</p>\n    <p>The curious character of these wines makes them a sommelier’s secret weapon, as <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/donalde81/\">Donald Edwards</a>, consultant sommelier, tells me: “Vin jaune scratches an itch that’s hard to sort any other way: oily, sharp, salty, a little bit wrong, but also ridiculously moreish. The Jura’s chardonnays seem to rewrite exactly what that variety can be in terms of expression, but it’s the savagnins that really epitomise the area, snarling at you, while at the same time being defiantly discordant in the most thrilling way. ”</p>\n    <p>Because of the region’s relatively small output (a quick glance at <a href=\"https://www.decanter.com/wine/wine-regions/jura/\">Decanter</a> reveals 230 wineries and an average production of 11 million bottles, so a fraction of France’s other regions), you’re more likely to find savagnin, and other Jura wines, for that matter, in more boutique-y retailers. They’re also likely to be a lot more expensive than, say, sauvignon, or any other such wine that’s produced everywhere and by everyone.</p>\n    <p>Imagine my surprise/shock/delight, then, when the Wine Society recently announced that it’s bringing a côtes du Jura to its own-label range for £18.50. Yes, I know as well as you that this isn’t a bargain in the literal sense, but it’s not too bad a shout considering the <a href=\"https://www.thewinesociety.com/product/letoile-savagnin-domaine-de-montbourgeau-2018/\">100% savagnin currently on the society’s website</a> is £27, while a lot of other Jura frequently topples over the £30 mark. Hopefully, this might also open the doors for supermarkets and other big retailers to do the same, so my wallet can take less of a flogging every time I want to open my mouth to the nutty, savoury flavours of the Jura.</p>\n    <h2>Four Jura wines to pique your interest</h2>\n    <p><strong>The Society’s Exhibition Côtes du Jura </strong><a href=\"https://www.thewinesociety.com/product/the-societys-exhibition-jura-2020-en.aspx\">£18.50 The Wine Society</a>, 13.5%.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Smithsonian Secretary Lonnie Bunch sent a letter to the Trump administration responding to a list of demands the White House presented last month as it attempts to assert control over the institution.</p>\n    <p>Bunch’s direct response to the White House comes more than three weeks after the administration attempted to compel the museum and research network to turn over curatorial materials, plans for the United States’s 250th anniversary, visitor experience surveys, and other materials. Bunch <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035605/trump-says-us-museums-should-focus-less-on-slavery/\">met privately</a> with President Trump last week.</p>\n    <p>Bunch’s response, first reported by the <i> New York Times, </i>was not made public. A Smithsonian spokesperson reached by </p>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>confirmed the letter was sent but declined to share a copy or comment on its contents.</p>\n    <p>The Trump administration has sought to <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/999509/trump-whitewashes-history-in-new-smithsonian-executive-order/\">gut the Smithsonian</a> of what it calls “divisive” narratives and “race-centered ideology” and install “unifying, historically accurate, and constructive descriptions.” In a tirade on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump has criticized the Smithsonian for focusing too much on “<a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035605/trump-says-us-museums-should-focus-less-on-slavery/\">how bad slavery was</a>,” among other things. Last month, the White House <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1033993/trump-american-exceptionalism-smithsonian/\">notified the institution</a> that it would conduct a review of the Smithsonian and make “content corrections.”</p>\n    <p>Based on an email shared by Bunch with Smithsonian staff explaining what he told the president, the <i>Times </i>reported that the secretary defended the institution’s independence, but vowed to share certain information with the Trump administration. Bunch, in the description of his letter, said that the institution is already conducting its own review of content to ensure it is “nonpartisan and factual.” The Smithsonian would conduct this review, not the White House, Bunch reportedly said in the letter.</p>\n    <p>“Our own review of content to ensure our programming is nonpartisan and factual is ongoing, and it is consistent with our authority over our programming and content,” the letter said, according to the <i>Times.</i></p>\n    <p>It is unclear, though, whether Bunch outright rejected Trump’s authority to issue “content corrections” on the independent institution. It is also unclear what information Bunch offered to share with the White House, and what say, if any, the institution would have in the Smithsonian-led process. If the Smithsonian doesn’t comply with the White House’s review, it could <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1019966/museum-of-the-american-latino-could-vanish-under-trump/\">jeopardize its federal funding</a>, which accounts for about <a href=\"https://www.si.edu/newsdesk/factsheets/facts-about-smithsonian-institution-short\">62%</a> of its annual budget. The institution has yet to make a public statement addressing the White House’s attempted audit of its <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036180/trump-targets-lgbtq-history-migrants-and-more-in-chilling-smithsonian-hit-list/\">targeting of specific items</a> at the Smithsonian.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039356/smithsonian-secretary-lonnie-bunch-responds-to-trump-museum-crackdown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>This is exactly my kind of recipe. It’s easy, flavourful and, as a bonus, it’s crispy, too. In fact, it’s so simple, you could make the mixture with your eyes closed or, better still, give it to a six-year-old to do (they could also make it with their eyes closed). The key is the black beans, because they crisp up perfectly, and the condiments, which supercharge the flavour. There is one small catch, though: the onions need caramelising until they’re jammy, and ready to top the patty. You don’t <i>have </i>to do this, but I’m here to tell you that it is worthwhile (especially if there’s a six-year-old already making the burgers).</p>\n    <h2>Crispy black bean burgers</h2>\n    <p>If you like, prep the patties a day in advance and chill until needed.</p>\n    <p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>30 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>4</strong></p>\n    <p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>30 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>4</strong></p>\n    <p><strong>Olive oil\n  2 large onions</strong>, peeled and thinly sliced</p>\n    <p><strong>1 tsp salt<br/>400g tin black beans</strong>, not drained</p>\n    <p>400g tin black beans</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>80g dried breadcrumbs<br/>1 tsp dried garlic granules<br/>1 tsp dried onion granules<br/>1 tbsp chipotle paste<br/>2 tsp dijon mustard<br/>1 tbsp tomato ketchup</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>1 tsp dried garlic granules</p>\n    <p>1 tsp dried onion granules</p>\n    <p>1 tbsp chipotle paste</p>\n    <p>2 tsp dijon mustard</p>\n    <p>1 tbsp tomato ketchup</p>\n    <p>To serve<strong>4 burger buns \n  Vegan mayonnaise\n  Iceberg lettuce \n  Finely sliced tomato</strong></p>\n    <p>Put three tablespoons of olive oil in a medium frying pan set over a medium heat and, once it’s hot, add the onion and a half-teaspoon of salt, and cook, stirring often, for 20 minutes, until quite reduced and frazzled. Take off the heat.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, spoon a couple of tablespoons of the liquid (aquafaba) from the tin of beans into a small bowl or mug and set aside. Drain and rinse the beans, tip into a large bowl and roughly mash; leave a few whole or in big chunks. Stir in the breadcrumbs, garlic granules, onion granules, chipotle paste, mustard, ketchup and a half-teaspoon of salt, then use your hands to mix until well combined; if need be, add some or all of the reserved aquafaba.</p>\n    <p>Divide the bean mix evenly into four, roll each piece into a ball, then put them one by one between two sheets of baking paper and press out to roughly 10cm- to 12cm-wide patties (I tend to make mine a wee bit bigger than the burger buns).</p>\n    <p>To cook the patties, put two tablespoons of olive oil in a medium frying pan, then fry two of the burgers for about six minutes in total, turning them once halfway, or when the base is crisp and golden. Remove and set aside, add another two tablespoons of oil, then repeat with the other two patties.</p>\n    <p>To serve, split and toast the buns, spread a generous dollop of mayo over the cut side of the bases and top with a leaf or two of iceberg lettuce. Add a bean patty and a couple of thin slices of tomato, and finish with a quarter of the caramelised onions. On with the lids and eat immediately.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/may/17/meera-sodha-vegan-recipe-crispy-black-bean-burgers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Jersey royals are my favourite, but other good (and widely available) options include celandine, ratte, arran, pink fir apple and vivaldi, though farm shops may have even better options on offer.</p>\n<h2>2 … and try to buy small ones</h2>\n<p>Choose potatoes that are fairly even in size, and preferably small enough easily to boil whole; you may need to cut any larger ones in half to ensure they all cook through in roughly the same time, but try to minimise this, because potatoes cooked whole in their skins will have a better texture.</p>\n<h2>3 Prep the spuds</h2>\n<p>Give the potatoes a good wash; true new potatoes should still have some dirt clinging to their frail skins, but don’t bother to peel them any more than necessary, because those skins hold much of the flavour, and also protect the potato flesh from the hot water. Put the spuds in a pan just large enough to hold them all comfortably.</p>\n<h2>4 Cook the spuds</h2>\n<p>Add enough cold water just to cover, then salt very generously (don’t worry, because most of it will go down the drain after cooking). Cover and bring to a boil, then uncover, turn down the heat and simmer until just cooked through (test the largest potato with a fork or skewer to check). This method takes longer than dropping them in boiling water, but it means that the outsides won’t overcook.</p>\n<h2>5 Start the dressing</h2>\n<p>Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk the mustard (any variety will do here, but I like the tanginess of dijon), vinegar (cider or white-wine would work, as would lemon juice) and a pinch of salt until smooth, then gradually whisk in the oils – if you prefer your dressing to have a lighter or stronger flavour, feel free to use neutral or olive oil alone, respectively.</p>\n<h2>6 For a homemade mayo</h2>\n<p>Drain the potatoes, put them back in the hot pan to steam dry, then cut in half or quarters.</p>\n<p>Toss with the vinaigrette and leave to cool.</p>\n<p>For a quick mayonnaise, in a container that’s <i>just</i> wider than the head of your stick blender, whizz an egg – or, for a plant-based alternative, four tablespoons of aquafaba and 10 chickpeas – with a tablespoon of mustard and a teaspoon of vinegar or lemon juice.</p>\n<h2>7 Finish the mayo</h2>\n<p>Pour 225ml neutral oil and 25ml extra-virgin olive oil on top of the egg or chickpea mixture, then put the stick blender on the base of the container and whizz at high speed until you see white clouds billow up from underneath. At this point, lift the still whizzing blender head <i>very </i>slowly, and mix until all the oil is combined. Season to taste.</p>\n<h2>8 Flavour the mayo</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/may/11/how-to-make-potato-salad-recipe-felicity-cloake\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Taste and adjust the salt and lemon as needed.</p>\n    <p>Just before you want to eat, tip the shredded lettuce into a large bowl and add the broccoli. Dress with a third of the dressing, then divide between two plates. Dot over the remaining dressing, scatter the butter bean and chorizo mix on top, and serve immediately.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/25/crispy-butter-bean-chorizo-cos-salad-quick-easy-recipe-rukmini-iyer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
