    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Before boarding a plane, I tend to opt for bland and uncontroversial food—namely, a very beige sandwich, bagel, or wrap that runs minimal risk of unsettling my stomach mid-flight. Such fare is not hard to come by at New York’s airports, home to many nondescript food purveyors selling shrink-wrapped carbs.</p>\n    <p>Delicious? Not necessarily. Expensive? Shockingly so. But for sheer utility, they curb my airport-induced hunger.</p>\n    <p>On a recent trip to Copenhagen—despite my aforementioned preflight dining habits—I found myself at the airport hunched over a fire-engine red table devoid of chairs, eating a fully loaded hot dog before noon. Dubious as I was of the concept of an airport hot dog, I was reassured by two things: my Danish boyfriend’s enthusiastic endorsement of <a href=\"https://www.cph.dk/en/shopping-dining/dining/steffs-place/steffs-place-terminal-3\">Steff’s Place</a> and the airy, clean vibe of the airport. This was not a place I worried about ingesting a never-before-seen bacterial strain, something I can’t say about my local airports.</p>\n    <p>The plush but not overwhelmingly bready bun hugged a skinny red-tinted sausage, an inch or so longer than the bun on either end. As I sunk my teeth into the dog, I was greeted to a pleasantly snappy bite, but the real showstopper was the small mountain of toppings. Think translucent, thinly sliced pickles, onions both raw and fried, ketchup, and Danish remoulade, a tangy, mustardy, slightly sweet mayo-based sauce. I inhaled it in roughly two bites. I found myself contentedly full, ideal conditions for a comfortable nap on the plane. The hot dog was not only delicious, but one of the most memorable meals of my trip.</p>\n    <p>Copenhagen is dotted with hot dog stands, most of them charmingly named after their respective owner: Jette’s Pølser (sausages, in English), Allan’s Pølser, John’s Hotdog Deli, and so forth. According to my source on the ground (my boyfriend), it’s not uncommon to pay a visit to a hot dog stand after going out drinking in Copenhagen, or for a cheap, no-frills snack in transit in the middle of the day.</p>\n    <p>They’ve been cherished and recognizable fixtures of the country since the 1920s. According to a <a href=\"https://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/eat-drink/legendary-tale-hotdogs-denmark\">brief history</a> of the Danish hotdog on Visit Copenhagen’s website, sausage stands began to materialize on Denmark’s streets shortly after the First World War, in the likeness of similar vendors in neighboring Germany, Sweden, and Norway. The most classic version, rød pølse, is a pork sausage fragranced with warm spices like nutmeg and coriander, dyed red with carmine to achieve its distinctive crimson hue. “Regardless of assembly most hotdog vendors will offer similar variations on the basic hotdog format,” writes Visit Copenhagen. Some stands offer vegan or more “gourmet” riffs, like a black hot dog topped with gold leaf that once featured as a monthly special at John’s Hotdog Deli, per <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2022/04/21/danish-hot-dogs-copenhagen/\">The Washington Post</a>.</p>\n    <p>Of course, the city has much more to offer on the culinary front than its street sausages. You may be familiar with Copenhagen’s dining scene via <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/noma-restaurant-closing\">Noma</a>, the perennially lauded fine dining restaurant (which may or may not be <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/noma-restaurant-closing\">shuttering</a> in the near future?) that pioneered New Nordic cuisine. Copenhagen’s pastries and coffee, too, are widely regarded as some of the finest in the world—inspired to bring back a bag of grounds for my parents from <a href=\"https://www.prologcoffee.com/\">Prolog Coffee</a> in the meatpacking district on a prior trip, I was overwhelmed by a vast and nuanced selection of beans sourced judiciously from around the world and roasted locally in nearby Refshaleøen.</p>\n    <p>But there’s something uniquely accessible, satisfying, comforting, and consistent about a Danish hot dog, an affordable foil to an otherwise very expensive dining city. Most will set you back just about 30 Danish kroner, or roughly $5. “Shouldn’t be more, and definitely shouldn’t be less,” says my boyfriend. It’s as reliably delightful as it is egalitarian.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/the-best-meal-i-had-in-copenhagen-was-an-airport-hot-dog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Read on for the pantry products our editors swear by, and how we use them to escape the dreaded dinner rut.</p>\n<h2>Our top picks</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>You won't believe it's not takeout</strong>:<a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/2MivCay8tNdgaQiP3WKHCXDHamNgbGrgqAuuWnNAFxdUfdS2szPt7xssTYdpizHF9BTuJpSWfmLdkHxu7bQKxXbZUQcWrhEcEkacsV3aYYgJqjTvNfdgGSB7CkL9M1bcuACHEsRQTdaHc6sjCJrKDzmSJFCTriMazNqCYYJT4scLXLYzh1CEWqrFrBJdPCWVZvYLxpxFAMPvAhcQztGP3yAgU8rFcXEDyb2DmAxcrfttDFdup6JvTuctDED5jodRSBoyoo2WMgWZNsFyG8Cwk49mZ2dLRNhKfoP2Pk3SJuKEWyUDKDNbdfSkwrw8S9ZRAvV8yvut2owbyUbaV95QWNPdouZznNn4ujv85B3TevSs7gpf3GsMAaAm8kMNwjUutrW\">Maesri Green Curry Paste</a></li>\n      <li><strong>For a fast chili or loaded quesadilla</strong>:<a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/9t8kf9Usx7ZykJ1tbWM8zXPimjBFspLgk8suMDLDaXLdJiKGLZUZvs2SLHdvYJgWm51RsXyPNTvST42qX5tMxGH3UQpiywAhzgQ7LB7i2FzJRMd34QVr5fDwLAgKw58gJnzcqd5sq8LWytSyiNrnYRWLsQXu2WmsBNsueKtgvMwDBbqjVzjCMhRNaWuH9EfHYNHuujxNaWado9SAFyr9ZGsqsA7SAcwWVEWQfednELYyfqXqd8azVeDNjnUcHYfWua2m1J6pM5DSUTU4n6ZmKwVVgcmgNi9TGEnmEMwZtQPPTXnoQBCxzeSeKS4F7evqYbAdQK4BujtF5ProCm9YrnZpSXq8Lt4iFv3wAT2nVAHHK4Dqj4JaKj2jr92t33UqHnVnFPCW\">HeyDay Canning Co.

It’s the best store-bought one I’ve tried, and my secret to easy weeknight fridge cleanout dinners. I was introduced to it when I developed a recipe for <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/green-curry-coconut-cod\">Green Curry Coconut Cod</a> and have been hooked ever since. Chock full of fresh green chilis, lemongrass, kaffir lime, ginger, and spices, it’s one of the only curry pastes I’ve found that’s complex, balanced, and <i>actually</i> spicy.</p>\n<p>Since the cod only uses about half a can, I’ll save the other half in my fridge for the next time I need to scrounge together something nourishing for dinner. I saute the paste in a skillet with some oil and alliums if I have them, then add in coconut milk (which I try to keep on hand), whatever veggies I find in the depths of my fridge (usually a head of cabbage), and some sort of protein (like the fish fillets I often stash in my freezer). I serve the curry over rice and bam—dinner is ready in a matter of 15 minutes.</p>\n<h2>Heyday Canning Co. Canned Beans</h2>\n<p>There is one ingredient in my pantry that I keep stocked three or four items deep, and that’s the canned beans from Heyday Canning Co. These preseasoned beans are swimming in sauces built from intensely flavorful ingredients like lemongrass, galangal, guajillo chile peppers, kimchi (yes, actual kimchi), and gochujang. They’re bold, layered, and taste like someone already did all the hard work of seasoning dinner for you.</p>\n<p>My go-to is the Coconut Curry Chickpeas, a Malaysian-inspired curry with ginger, galangal, lemongrass, and Makrut lime. I warm it up with frozen cauliflower and peas, then spoon it over rice or garlic naan if I have some in the freezer. I also find myself constantly buying tortillas and shredded cheese so I can make quesadillas with Heyday’s Enchilada Black Beans or use them as a shortcut base for a weeknight chili. —<a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/contributor/olivia-tarantino\">Olivia Tarantino</a>, senior commerce editor</p>\n<h2>Red Boat Vietnamese Lemongrass Curry</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/time-saving-pantry-products\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>When Rami Metal walks through the scores of booths at the Armory Show, he looks not only for attention-grabbing paintings but also those that would make great puzzles.</p>\n<p>“I try to find things that are more detailed and have more variance of color,” he said. “If you have 1,000 pieces and 200 of them are pieces of sky, it’s not fun. You’ll get through 80 percent of the puzzle and say, ‘Ugh, the sky.’”</p>\n<p>Museum gift shops have sold puzzle sets of Impressionist and abstract masterworks for years, but there have been few options on the market featuring works by living artists who haven’t yet had their MoMA retrospective.</p>\n<p>That’s starting to change. A handful of independent jigsaw companies, including Metal’s <a href=\"https://hellokinstler.com/\">Kinstler Puzzles</a> and <a href=\"https://www.apostrophepuzzles.com/\">Apostrophe Puzzles</a>, have been licensing the work of painters virtually unknown outside the art world for their brainteasers. </p>\n<p>Apostrophe founder Mandi Masden was inspired to launch her Brooklyn-based puzzle company in 2019 after she came across a portrait by artist Charly Palmer that was outside her budget. Her friend gave her a custom puzzle of the artwork instead, prompting her to think about how puzzles could make contemporary art more accessible to the public.</p>\n<p>“I was really into puzzles as a kid, and I knew a lot of us had memories of them from our childhoods, but the industry itself felt stuck in the past,” Masden said. “I wanted to make puzzles that focused on celebrating the talent, creativity, and perspective of artists of color, while catering to a segment of the market largely ignored by the industry.”</p>\n<p>Metal, also a passionate puzzler, found himself fitting together tiny cardboard pieces of Pieter Bruegel’s “The Tower of Babel” (c. 1563) and Hieronymus Bosch’s “The Garden of Earthly Delights” (c. 1490–1510) for hours at a time well into adulthood. It was while he gallery-hopped in Chelsea and breezed through art fairs that he realized that the worlds of art puzzles and contemporary art rarely overlapped, and became inspired to combine them.</p>\n<p>Pitching the idea of producing puzzles out of contemporary art to galleries and artists before he actually launched his business was harder. But Washington-based artist Andrea Joyce Heimer liked the concept, and licensed a rendition of her 2019 painting, “In The Summer We Started Drinking During The Hot Of The Day And By Night Time We Were Monsters.” He launched Kinstler in 2021 with two additional puzzles by artists Simone Johnson and Rusudan Khizanishvili.</p>\n<p>This month, Kinstler is releasing a new puzzle of Korean artist Ken Gun Min’s 2023 painting “Stranger by the Lake (Bare Ass Creek),” an homage to a nude sunbathing spot in Los Angeles that was destroyed in a 2009 fire. Min, too, has loved playing with puzzles since he was a child. He was fascinated by the fact that individual fragments didn’t make visual sense until he fitted them together. Now he sees comparisons between the visual riddles and his current practice.</p>\n<p>“There’s a mix of abstraction and spontaneity — gestural brushstrokes, layers of pigment meeting embroidery — but when you step back, they come together to form a story,” Min said.</p>\n<p>For Masden, a good puzzle starts with a compelling image that tells a story and has a strong point of view. She also loves discovering nuances of brushwork and the layers of depth in a mixed media piece.</p>\n<p>“There’s something really poetic about the image that emerges from 1,000 tiny pieces of someone’s curiosity and exploration, and I love being surprised by where that journey takes me,” she said.</p>\n<p>Both Kinstler and Apostrophe have recruited a diverse stable of artists who earn a commission for every purchase, and their games are available for purchase in museums and bookstores across the country. The latter also donates a portion of each sale to a nonprofit organization working to expand arts education for communities of color.</p>\n<p>Lately, Metal has been drawn to work with subtle shifting color gradients and lots of visual activity. Umar Rashid’s “Battle of Malibu” (2020) portrays a fictitious uprising of Los Angeles-area Indigenous tribes against a European imperial force.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037461/the-rise-of-contemporary-art-puzzles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The cause of death was Parkinson’s disease, per the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/05/us/joseph-mcneil-dead.html\"> New York Times</a>’ Bernard Mokam.</p>\n<p>To honor McNeil, North Carolina Governor Josh Stein <a href=\"https://www.doa.nc.gov/news/press-releases/2025/09/08/lowering-us-and-nc-flags-half-staff-honor-civil-rights-activist-major-general-joseph-mcneil\">ordered</a> all state facilities to lower their United States and North Carolina flags to half-staff on September 13, the day funeral services will be held in Wilmington.</p>\n<p>“Joseph A. McNeil’s legacy is a testament to the power of courage and conviction,” says Joseph McNeil Jr., one of McNeil’s children, in a statement shared with <a href=\"https://www.wspa.com/news/top-stories/joseph-mcneil-greensboro-four-civil-rights-pioneer-dies-at-83/\">WGHP</a>’s Emily Mikkelsen. “His impact on the civil rights movement and his service to the nation will never be forgotten.”</p>\n<p>McNeil was born in Wilmington in March 1942. After graduating from an all-Black high school, McNeil enrolled at the Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina (now North Carolina A&amp;T State University) in the fall of 1959.</p>\n<p>During his first semester on campus, McNeil started talking with a handful of his fellow dorm-mates about taking a stand against segregation. McNeil’s desire to take action was further solidified when, while returning to campus after the holiday break, he faced discrimination at a bus station in Richmond, Virginia.</p>\n<p>With support and funding from a handful of older Greensboro residents, McNeil and three classmates—Franklin McCain, Ezell Blair Jr. (who later changed his name to Jibreel Khazan) and David Richmond—decided to take action.</p>\n<p>On February 1, 1960, the four men sat down at the whites-only lunch counter at Woolworth’s in Greensboro. They tried to order coffee, but the waitress refused to serve them because they were Black. She called over the manager, who asked the four students to leave. But they stayed put.</p>\n<p>The restored Greensboro location of Woolworth’s was named a <a href=\"https://www.sitinmovement.org/museum-news/post/2319583/restored-greensboro-f-w-woolworth-s-receives-highest-federal-landmark-designation\">National Historic Landmark</a> in late 2024.</p>\n<p>They remained seated even after a police officer showed up, and as white customers yelled racial slurs at them. Eventually, the manager closed the store early and the four men went home.</p>\n<p>They returned to the lunch counter over the next few days, bringing more and more classmates with them. By February 5, the peaceful sit-in had ballooned to hundreds of students, including <a href=\"https://library.uncg.edu/the-woolworth-sit-ins-remembered-by-womans-college-alumni/\">white women</a> from the Woman’s College of the University of North Carolina (now the University of North Carolina at Greensboro).</p>\n<p>All along the East Coast, protesters began picketing at various Woolworth’s locations, demanding that the five-and-dime chain store allow Black patrons to sit at the lunch counter and be served. By the end of March, the demonstrations had spread to 54 cities and included thousands of students, per the <i>Times</i>.</p>\n<p>In May, the city of Nashville <a href=\"https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2020/05/10/nashville-lunch-counters-desegregation-civil-rights/4807209002/\">integrated</a> its lunch counters. In late July, about six months after the first sit-in, the Greensboro Woolworth’s quietly desegregated its lunch counter. Four Black employees were the first to be served, according to <a href=\"https://www.history.com/articles/the-greensboro-sit-in\">History.com</a>.</p>\n<p>McNeil graduated with a degree in engineering physics in 1963. He went on to serve in the U.S. Air Force, working as a navigator on an aerial refueling plane during the Vietnam War.</p>\n<p>He met and married Ina Brown while he was stationed in South Dakota. McNeil held numerous jobs over the course of his career, including as an investment banker, according to the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-sitin-civil-rights-obituary-0c13287d31e24c8f5f1f0dcee46039bd\">Associated Press</a>’ Gary D. Robertson. He also joined the Air Force Reserve, retiring in 2000 with the rank of major general.</p>\n<p>Woolworth’s Greensboro location closed in 1993, but a section of the lunch counter was saved and is now on <a href=\"https://americanhistory.si.edu/exhibitions/greensboro-lunch-counter\">permanent display</a> at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History.

Jonathan Romiguier</p>\n<p>Iberian harvester ant queens have a unique superpower: They can lay eggs that hatch into an entirely different species.</p>\n<p>This discovery, described in a new paper published September 3 in the journal <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09425-w\"> Nature</a>, defies a fundamental principle of biology and may cause scientists to reconsider how they define a species.</p>\n<p>“The classic concept says that [a species] is a group of organisms with similar physical and genetic characteristics that can reproduce with each other in nature and produce fertile offspring,” says <a href=\"https://www.ebd.csic.es/en/about-us/personnel/xim-cerda\">Xim Cerdá</a>, an ecologist at Doñana Biological Station in Spain who was not involved with the research, to Miguel Ángel Criado at <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2025-09-04/messor-ibericus-the-ant-that-lays-eggs-of-two-different-species.html\"> El País</a>. “But it turns out that’s not the case; two species are needed here. We’re going to have to rethink the concept.”</p>\n<p>Scientists estimate that <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/an-estimated-20-quadrillion-ants-live-on-earth-180980804/\">20 quadrillion ants</a> are crawling around the Earth, according to a 2022 <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2201550119\">study</a>.</p>\n<p>Scientists recently discovered that Iberian harvester ant queens (<i>Messor ibericus</i>) mate with males of another species, the builder harvester ant (<i>Messor structor</i>). When they do, the <i>M. ibericus</i> queens store the <i>M. structor </i>male’s sperm, then use it to fertilize some of the eggs they lay. Researchers think the <i>M. ibericus</i> queens remove their own genetic material from the eggs’ nuclei, so that when those eggs hatch, they effectively turn out to be <i>M. structor </i>male clones.</p>\n<p>The queens produce males of both <i>M. ibericus </i>and <i>M. structor</i>, and all the worker ants in <i>M. ibericus </i>colonies<i> </i>are female hybrids of the two species.</p>\n<p>“It’s an absolutely fantastic, bizarre story of a system that allows things to happen that seem almost unimaginable,” says <a href=\"https://www1.bio.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/186303\">Jacobus Boomsma</a>, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Copenhagen who was not involved with the research, to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02807-0#ref-CR1\"> Nature</a>’s Max Kozlov.</p>\n<p>Even more perplexing is the fact that <i>M. ibericus </i>and<i> M. structor</i> are not closely related, evolutionarily speaking. The two species diverged more than five million years ago, according to the paper. For comparison, scientists think <a href=\"https://humanorigins.si.edu/education/frequently-asked-questions\">humans and chimpanzees</a> split from a common ancestor that lived between six million and eight million years ago.</p>\n<p>Proving the relationship between <i>M. ibericus</i> and <i>M. structor</i> was challenging. The scientists dug up various <i>M. ibericus</i> colonies they found along the sides of farm roads near Lyon, France, looking for male ants. But among a colony of 10,000 ants, there might be only a few males, writes <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/ant-queen-lays-eggs-hatch-two-species\"> Science</a>’s Erik Stokstad.</p>\n<p>In the end, they found 132 males from 26 <i>M. ibericus</i> colonies. Of those, about half were nearly hairless—a hallmark of <i>M. structor</i>—while the others were covered in dense hair, a trait typically found in <i>M. ibericus</i>. DNA testing confirmed their hunch: The hairy males were <i>M. ibericus</i>, and the bald ones were <i>M. structor</i>.</p>\n<p>Even more intriguing, the males of both species shared <i>M. ibericus</i> mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited from the mother, suggesting they had all been born from <i>M. ibericus</i> queens.</p>\n<p>This discovery is so novel and so unusual that the researchers had to come up with a new term to describe the behavior exhibited by <i>M. ibericus</i> queens: “xenoparity,” which essentially means “foreign birth.”</p>\n<p>The team also wanted to go beyond genetic evidence: They hoped to observe births of <i>M. structor</i> ants from an <i>M. ibericus</i> queen. So, they reared colonies in their laboratory. Then, they waited.</p>\n<p>“It was very difficult, because in lab conditions, it’s nearly impossible to have males,” says co-author <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QuMuD-gAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Jonathan Romiguier</a>, an ecologist at the University of Montpellier in France, to <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2494855-queen-ant-makes-males-of-another-species-for-daughters-to-mate-with/\"> New Scientist</a>’s Tim Vernimmen. “We had something like 50 colonies and monitored them for two years without a single male being born. Then we got lucky.” Observing the births of </p>\n<p><i>M. structor</i>males was another key piece of evidence in describing the ants’ strange biology.</p>\n<p>As for the <i>M. ibericus</i> males in the colony, the queens mate with them to produce the next generation of <i>M. ibericus </i>queens.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/these-ant-queens-seem-to-defy-biology-they-lay-eggs-that-hatch-into-another-species-180987292/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The specimens came from all over the world and spanned a wide time frame, including some from <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/what-killed-the-last-woolly-mammoths-scientists-say-it-wasnt-inbreeding-180984632/\">Wrangel Island</a>, which hosted the last surviving population of woolly mammoths before they went extinct roughly 4,000 years ago.</p>\n    <p>The oldest creature in the study was a 1.1-million-year-old steppe mammoth (<i>Mammuthus trogontherii</i>) found near the Adycha River in northeastern Russia. In 2021, that same mammoth <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/oldest-dna-sequenced-yet-comes-million-year-old-mammoths-180977035/\">made headlines</a> when scientists sequenced DNA from one of its molars.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/wkJlJ3-FIJ-yCNjAB6V4mp0Wp8M=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(2592x1728:2593x1729)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/7d/12/7d121e3d-a206-469c-8349-c3460b68d472/mammoth_foot_photo_by_love_dalen.jpg\" alt=\"Brown mammoth foot\"/>\n    <p>For the new study, scientists not only sequenced the DNA of the various mammoths—including 440 that had never been sequenced or published before—but they also identified DNA from 310 different microbes living on or in the animals’ tissues. Many of those microorganisms probably showed up after the mammoths died. But the scientists also identified six “host-associated” microbial groups that likely colonized the mammoths when they were still alive.</p>\n    <p>The researchers can’t say for certain, but the mammoths might have gotten sick from some of those microorganisms. One was <i>Pasteurella</i>, which was similar to a strain of bacteria that <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41987-z\">killed six African elephants</a>, among the closest living relatives of mammoths, in Zimbabwe in 2020. Another was <i>Erysipelothrix</i>, a group of bacteria that can cause endocarditis, a life-threatening inflammation of the heart’s interior tissues, in modern dogs and pigs. They also found two groups of <i>Streptococcus</i><i>,</i> including one that’s related to a strain that leads to tooth cavities in humans.</p>\n    <p>Because they found partial genomes of <i>Erysipelothrix</i> in the remains of the 1.1-million-year-old steppe mammoth, it’s now the oldest known host-associated microbial DNA ever sequenced.</p>\n    <p>“Our results push the study of microbial DNA back beyond a million years, opening up new possibilities to explore how host-associated microbes evolved in parallel with their hosts,” lead author <a href=\"https://palaeogenetics.com/benjamin-guinet/\">Benjamin Guinet</a>, an evolutionary biologist at the Center for Paleogenetics, says in the statement.</p>\n    <p>Scientists will need to conduct additional research to determine how these bacteria might have affected the health and well-being of their mammoth hosts. Some might have been benign or even helpful, while others might have caused deadly diseases. But for now, the study is a “good proof of concept” that ancient bacteria can be identified based on their DNA, says <a href=\"https://communities.springernature.com/users/52280-eva-maria-geigl\">Eva-Maria Geigl</a>, a paleogeneticist at the Institut Jacques Monod in France who was not involved with the research, to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02799-x\"> Nature</a>’s Katie Kavanagh.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7ArE_sgAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Nicolás Rascován</a>, a geneticist at the Pasteur Institute in France who was not involved with the research but did help peer-review the paper, echoes that sentiment, adding that the research “opens the door to exploring the microbiota of extinct species and asking ourselves what their microbial ecology was like,” he tells <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2025-09-02/oldest-known-bacterial-dna-found-in-a-mammoth-that-lived-more-than-a-million-years-ago.html\"> El País</a>’ Nuño Domínguez.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/scientists-investigate-the-bacteria-that-colonized-extinct-mammoths-and-uncover-the-oldest-known-microbial-dna-from-a-host-180987299/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

While supporters see the list as a celebration of national identity, <a href=\"https://swedenherald.com/article/canon-fails-to-address-cultural-issues-says-green-partys-lind\">critics see it</a> as a nationalist and exclusionary effort. The idea for a cultural canon came from the Sweden Democrats, a right-wing, anti-immigration party that’s not in power but negotiated for the list’s creation as part of a coalition agreement.</p><p>One aspect of the canon that has made it especially contentious is that it only includes entries that are at least 50 years old. That means no hit songs by <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/whats-behind-abbas-staying-power-180969709/\">ABBA</a>, the iconic Swedish musical group.

Do I need any more proof of the power of advertising?</p>\n<p>Now, with the release of a study showing a direct correlation between a kid’s exposure to alcohol advertising and how much of those alcohol brands they consume, I’m thinking it’s time to start recording football games and watching them via our DVR so we can fast-forward through the commercials.</p>\n<p>\n            “For a long time, a lot of people said, ‘Well advertising doesn’t really make a difference,’ ” when it comes to the impact on underage drinking, said <a href=\"http://www.bumc.bu.edu/care/faculty/timothy-naimi/\">Dr. Timothy Naimi, </a>the lead researcher on the new study and an associate professor at Boston University’s Schools of Medicine and Public Health.\n    </p>\n<p>Now, there is a good body of evidence showing that when kids are exposed to advertising for a particular brand, they’re more likely to drink that brand, he said. What’s been missing until now is an exploration of whether the alcohol ads don’t just influence the brands underage drinkers tend to choose but how much they drink in total.</p>\n<p>\n            The new study, published in the <a href=\"http://www.jsad.com/doi/abs/10.15288/jsad.2016.77.723\">Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs</a>, was based on a sample of more than 1,000 13- to 20-year-olds from across the country who said they had alcohol in the past month. Researchers then asked if they watched any of the 20 most popular non-sports television shows and how much they consumed of the 61 alcohol brands showcased in commercials during those shows.\n    </p>\n<p>What they found is those underage drinkers who didn’t see any alcohol ads drank about 14 drinks per month. That number rose to 33 drinks per month for the young people who had seen what amounts to an average amount of alcohol advertising, said Naimi. Underage drinkers exposed to the greatest amount of alcohol ads drank 200-plus drinks in the past month, he said, though very few of those in the study drank that much.</p>\n<p>\n            After factoring out that kids who watch more television may be more likely to drink anyway, researchers concluded that the more exposure kids had to these alcohol ads, the greater the amount they consumed of those brands. These findings are even more significant when you consider <a href=\"http://www.jsad.com/page/news/may2016\">the findings of another study</a>, which found that kids ages 11 to 14 typically see two to four alcohol ads per day.\n    </p>\n<p>“I think the message is that this adds to evidence that alcohol advertising matters in terms of youth drinking and it demonstrates good support for the idea that alcohol advertising is not only related to which brands kids might choose to drink but how much they choose to drink in total,” said Naimi.</p>\n<h2>\n        <strong>Parents the greatest influence on a child’s drinking</strong>\n</h2>\n<p>\n            Ralph Blackman is president and chief executive officer of <a href=\"http://responsibility.org/\">Responsibility.org</a>, a not-for-profit organization funded by the country’s biggest distillers. The organization is devoted to reducing drunken driving and underage drinking and promoting responsible drinking among people who are legally allowed to consume alcohol. \n    </p>\n<p>While Blackman said he and his team had not been able to review the findings of this newest study to determine their validity, he said parents – more than advertising – play the biggest role in determining a kid’s decision to drink.</p>\n<p>\n            Parents were found to wield 71 times more influence over their children’s decision to drink versus advertising, according to the <a href=\"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2016/images/09/07/influencesonyouthsdecisionsaboutdrinking-2016-03-11.pdf\">2016 Roper Youth Report</a> (PDF).\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/07/health/kids-alcohol-ads-impact-underage-drinking/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>Story highlights</h3>\n<p>Babies with multiple birth defects were born to US women infected with the rubella virus in the 1960s</p>\n<p>What these families have needed may signal what's in store for Zika babies</p>\n<p>One side of the bedroom is an explosion of pink, from the hair accessories and dangling trinkets to the stuffed animals and laundry hamper. The other, starting with the fuzzy pillows and puffy comforter, is an ode to purple.</p>\n<p>Kim Woodford is the pink aficionado in this well-kept townhome in Brooklyn. She’s 51 and believes in Santa. Her roommate, Darvena Idlet, is the same age; they’ve lived together for about 45 years.</p>\n<p>What bound these women together so long ago was an illness that struck while they were in their mothers’ wombs. It robbed them of their hearing and much of their vision, and it damaged their brains.</p>\n<p>They have congenital rubella syndrome, which they acquired during an outbreak of the rubella virus, or German measles. The epidemic swept across America from late 1963 into 1965, infecting an estimated 12.5 million people. And though the symptoms of the virus are generally minor, if detected at all, it takes its harshest toll on the unborn babies of infected pregnant women.</p>\n<p>The story of Kim and Darvena, and thousands of others like them, has largely been forgotten in the United States. But the threat posed by a new virus, Zika, has those intimately familiar with the 1960s rubella outbreak asking pointed questions.</p>\n<p>Who is going to take care of the babies irreparably damaged after being born to Zika-infected women? What resources will be available to their families, whose lives will be forever changed? Who’ll step in to help those mothers left alone after fathers walk away? And what will become of these children when they are adults still in need of around-the-clock care?</p>\n<p>What happened more than a half century ago, they say, should serve as a warning now.</p>\n<h2>Hoping for the best</h2>\n<p>Florence Woodford knew her baby might be harmed when she contracted the rubella virus early in her pregnancy. A doctor with the health department who paid a visit to her Brooklyn home told her as much. If her child survived, he said, she or he could be saddled with a long list of disabilities.</p>\n<p>\n            Though it was largely illegal at the time, the doctor suggested Florence consider having an abortion. The US medical community was finding ways to work around restrictions; ultimately the <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/09/health/rubella-abortion-zika/\">rubella virus helped make abortion legal</a>. \n    </p>\n<p>But abortion wasn’t an option for Florence, a devout Catholic. She chose to hope for the best and believed by keeping her baby she’d be rewarded. When Kim was born with cataracts, she rejoiced.</p>\n<p>“Oh, that’s wonderful. That’ll be OK. We could fix that,” Florence, 76, remembers saying about her second born. “And then as time went on, we found out it was a lot more than that.”</p>\n<p>Kim was among the 20,000 US-born babies harmed by congenital rubella syndrome in the mid-’60s. They faced a lifetime of defects including deafness, blindness, heart disease, neuromuscular tightness and spasticity, intellectual disabilities, autism and more. During the same period, there were 2,100 neonatal deaths and 11,250 abortions and miscarriages, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>\n<p>Kim “looked different,” Florence recalls. She was unable to roll over or sit up. She couldn’t hear. When Florence held her, Kim threw back her head as if she were struggling to see. She cried more than other babies.</p>\n<p>The challenges Kim and her family faced would only grow as she did. Some of the earliest doctors who saw her said she’d never walk or be toilet trained.</p>\n<p>But then a social worker showed up, first prodding and later insisting that Florence take Kim into Manhattan, where Dr. Louis Cooper headed up the Rubella Project, a long-term research and care effort he founded at Bellevue Hospital.</p>\n<p>Florence wept the entire ride there. She was sure Kim would be taken away from her. Instead, with the doctor’s help, she found hope.</p>\n<h2>Desperate for answers</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/08/health/rubella-house-zika-babies-future/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>Story highlights</h3>\n<p>Olympian Allison Schmitt struggled with depression after the 2012 London Games</p>\n<p>The swimmer decided to open up after her cousin's suicide</p>\n<p>\n            Imagine that swimming is what you’ve loved for more than 15 years, but whenever you dive into the pool, you feel like a disappointment, unmotivated to go forward. The feeling is almost destructive. That was what was going on in <a href=\"http://www.teamusa.org/usa-swimming/athletes/Allison-Schmitt\">Allison Schmitt</a>’s mind during training after the 2012 London Olympic Games. \n    </p>\n<p>It hasn’t always been that way.</p>\n<p>To Schmitt, swimming is a lifestyle, not a responsibility. Even when she felt stressed, she wouldn’t see swimming as a burden. Instead, she looked at it as something fun.</p>\n<p>“It’s what keeps me going,” she said.</p>\n<p>In and out of the pool, Schmitt keeps a positive attitude. She prefers to be a happy person, not the downer. “Laugh it off” is her go-to coping mechanism.</p>\n<p>Jack Bauerle, Schmitt’s coach at the University of Georgia until 2013, has known her since 2005. He calls her a giver. “Sometimes, she puts her feelings in the back burner so that she could help others,” Bauerle said.</p>\n<h2>Road to the Olympics</h2>\n<p>A swimming career that would net eight Olympic medals started when Schmitt was 9. As “the kid that wanted to [play] every sport,” Schmitt was a soccer player but didn’t end up making the team. She decided to devote her athletic spirit and talents to the pool.</p>\n<p>In fact, Schmitt didn’t quite like swimming at first; she was just following her older sister, Kirsten. Her fondness for swimming grew as she made friends on the team, and those relationships became an increasingly important part of her life.</p>\n<p>Growing up swimming, Schmitt has always been disciplined. No matter how busy the training, she made sure that she finished schoolwork and didn’t miss classes.</p>\n<p>It was a surprise when she found out that she made the Olympic team for the 2008 Beijing Games. She thought she wouldn’t be qualified because she was the “slow kid.” She didn’t feel like she belonged on the team and even had a “breakdown” during the training camp.</p>\n<p>Winning a bronze medal in the 4x200-meter freestyle relay and almost making it to the 200-meter freestyle final during the Games gave her confidence.</p>\n<p>Between 2008 and 2012, she trained as hard as she could while studying psychology at the University of Georgia. Before the London Games, she took a year off from school to concentrate on preparing for the game.</p>\n<p>Her effort paid off: She hauled in three golds in the 2012 Games.</p>\n<h2>The shadows of depression</h2>\n<p>The London Olympics marked a high point in Schmitt’s swimming career. After that, depression crept in.</p>\n<p>She became cranky and got irritated at minor problems. She remembered getting mad at not having the sports drink that she liked on the day of training and thinking, “This is the worst day ever.”</p>\n<p>She began to sleep more and more. When she entered the water, she didn’t feel motivated, instead thinking she was a disappointment.</p>\n<p>Schmitt didn’t want others to notice. All she wanted was for her team to achieve its goal and to do what she could as a good teammate.</p>\n<p>“Allison is the last person you would think that will get depressed,” said Bob Bowman, Schmitt’s coach since 2006. “She just has a bubbly, happy and smiling personality.”</p>\n<p>He knew something was off when he got calls from a crying, upset Schmitt after the London Games.</p>\n<p>Her performance in the pool also tipped her off. “The spirit wasn’t there,” said Bauerle, Schmitt’s Georgia swimming coach. “You could just see the difference sometimes.”</p>\n<p>Bauerle thought it was just a passing phase, “post-Olympic blues.” But for Schmitt, this “phase” lasted a little too long.</p>\n<p>She had kept her struggles from friends and family. The hidden pains, however, didn’t fool fellow Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, her surrogate brother.</p>\n<p>In January 2015, Schmitt was at what she calls the breaking point. She would dive into the water, thinking, “oh, my gosh, I can’t do this anymore.” She became angrier and more isolated. Then Phelps reached out, telling Schmitt that he would be there to help if she needed anything. Coaches and teammates also came to her aid.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/09/health/turning-points-allison-schmitt-depression-struggle/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The participants were asked to taste different liquid solutions of simple and more complex carbohydrates under normal conditions and then while the sweet receptors on their tongues were blocked.</p>\n<p>The researchers discovered that even when the sweet taste receptors were blocked, the study participants could still detect a starchy taste.</p>\n<p>It was previously assumed that starch was tasteless, but the new findings suggest that starch is broken down into glucose oligomers by an enzyme in our saliva, called alpha-amylase, and these so-called glucose oligomers can be tasted, Lim said.</p>\n<p>Some of the study participants described the taste of glucose oligomers as cereal-like, bread-like or rice-like and generally “starchy.”</p>\n<p>“It has long been assumed that simple sugars are the only class of carbohydrates that humans can taste. Thus our findings are surprising,” Lim said.</p>\n<p>“At the same time, I am not surprised, because humans use starch as a major source of energy, which enables the body to perform its functions.”</p>\n<p>The team noted its study shows the first direct demonstration that humans can taste glucose oligomers and reveals that human taste is much more complicated than previously thought.</p>\n<h3>Content by Food &amp; Wine</h3>\n<p/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"http://www.foodandwine.com/fwx/slideshow/most-insane-restaurants?xid=pd_cnn_sept16_healthtest\">The most insane restaurants</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"http://www.foodandwine.com/slideshows/best-pizza-unexpected-places?xid=pd_cnn_sept16_healthtest\">The best pizza in unexpected places</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"http://www.foodandwine.com/slideshows/best-burgers-us?xid=pd_cnn_sept16_healthtest\">Best burgers in the US</a>\n    </p>\n<p>For instance, “as much as we know that glucose oligomer detection is not through the sweet taste receptor, we do not yet know the exact mechanism of how we detect them,” Lim said.</p>\n<p>As the mechanism remains a mystery, some scientists said they are dubious about the new study.</p>\n<p>\n            “It is not likely to be a sixth taste. Instead it is probably just another version of sweet taste initiated by the taste cells that respond to sugars, noncaloric sweeteners and sugar polymers,” said Dr. <a href=\"http://www.monell.org/faculty/people/margolskee\">Robert Margolskee</a>, director and president of Monell Chemical Senses Center, who was not involved in the study. \n    </p>\n<p>“Mechanistically it is plausible that there is either a glucose oligomer receptor … or that it is from enzymatic breakdown within the oral cavity of the glucose polymers into glucose that then gets transported into the sweet-responding taste cells,” he said.</p>\n<h2>Other candidates for the sixth taste</h2>\n<p>It isn’t the first time scientists have made the case for a sixth taste.</p>\n<p>\n            Last year, researchers at Purdue University published a study in <a href=\"http://chemse.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/07/02/chemse.bjv036.abstract\">the journal Chemical Senses</a> that suggested we can detect fat as a taste.\n    </p>\n<p>For the study, which involved two separate experiments, researchers asked 102 adults to taste multiple cups of solutions that each contained a compound for either sweet, sour, salty, bitter, umami or fatty tastes. The study participants were asked to sort each solution into the taste group to which they believed it belonged.</p>\n<p>\n            The researchers noticed the participants succeeded in <a href=\"http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2015/Q3/research-confirms-fat-is-sixth-taste-names-it-oleogustus.html\">grouping the fatty acids together</a> and separately from the other solutions.\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/07/health/starchy-sixth-taste-discovered/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Similarly, 9% of girls in the baby simulator group had at least one abortion, compared with 6% of the non-baby group.</p>\n<p>\n            This is the first long-term study to look at pregnancy outcomes of the program throughout girls’ entire teenage years until they turn 20, said epidemiologist <a href=\"http://telethonkids.org.au/our-people/staff-student-index/b/sally-anne-brinkman/\">Sally Brinkman</a> of the Telethon Kids Institute at the University of Western Australia and lead author of the study. \n    </p>\n<h2>‘Clearly, the program doesn’t work’</h2>\n<p>The researchers took into account the girls’ socioeconomic status, family type, prior sexual experience, prior baby-caring responsibility, level of psychological distress, smoking and alcohol use, and education, but the difference between the two groups remains significant.</p>\n<p>“It is definitely more than just a trend,” Brinkman said. “Clearly, the program doesn’t work.”</p>\n<p>According to the study, schools in over 89 countries use the Realityworks baby simulator program, including the United States.</p>\n<p>The president and CEO of Realityworks, Timm Boettcher, said the study recklessly associated its products with the Australian health agencies’ adapted versions.</p>\n<p>The study “was not a representation of our curriculum and simulator learning modality, but the researchers’ ‘adaptation’ and is consequently not reflective of our product nor its efficacy,” Boettcher said in a statement. “The RealCare Program, is a combination of curriculum and hands-on aids, and if they are being tested and judged for effectiveness should be judged in their entirety.”</p>\n<p>Brinkman said that although her study didn’t involve as many educational sessions as Realityworks’ programs, what the researchers did for the study is overall “very similar” to what Realityworks recommends. “I would be surprised to see a couple of more educational sessions would make a difference on the results,” she said.</p>\n<p>She and her colleagues have advocated for an end to the fake baby program, but some schools asked whether the program should be tweaked or the girls should have the fake babies for longer.</p>\n<p>Brinkman is not sure whether such amendments would have an impact and compared the scenario to testing a drug. If research evidence has clearly pointed out adverse effects, “it’s generally not a thing for people to say ‘oh, they just need more of the drug.’ “</p>\n<p>Brinkman considers this a cautionary tale and hopes long-term studies can be conducted in the future to evaluate the effectiveness of educational programs before they are widely implemented and cost taxpayers’ money.</p>\n<h2>‘Maybe it wasn’t that bad’</h2>\n<p>Due to the anonymous nature of the study, researchers were unable to pinpoint reasons why the program might not work as well as planned.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/08/30/health/baby-simulator-teenage-pregnancy/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>Story highlights</h3>\n<p>Pediatric group concludes that violent video games increase aggression</p>\n<p>Alternatively, some research shows that gaming may decrease violence</p>\n<p>President Donald Trump said Thursday during a White House meeting on school safety that the nation needs to address what young people are seeing.</p>\n<p>“I’m hearing more and more people saying the level of violence on video games is really shaping young people’s thoughts,” he said. “And then you go the further step, and that’s the movies. You see these movies – they’re so violent, and yet a kid is able to see the movie if sex isn’t involved.” Killing, though, is involved, he said.</p>\n<p>His remarks were dismissed by Chris Grady, a survivor of the February 14 shootings at Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida: “I grew up playing video games … first-person shooter games, and I would never, ever dream of taking the lives of any of my peers.”</p>\n<p>\n            In Munich, Germany, an <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/24/europe/germany-munich-shooting/index.html\">18-year-old gunman</a> who killed nine people in July 2016 was a fan of first-person shooter video games, according to reports. This detail led many to worry that violent video games may be negatively affecting their own children. \n    </p>\n<p>What is the truth?</p>\n<p>Both the American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics take a firm stance against children and teens playing violent video games.</p>\n<p>The psychological group reports that more than 90% of children in the United States play video games. Among kids between the ages of 12 and 17, the number rises to 97%. More important, 85% or more of video games on the market contain some form of violence. The titles seem to say it all: “Manhunt,” “Thrill Kill,” “Gears of War” and “Mortal Kombat.” However, even the seemingly benign “Pokemon Go” requires players to go to battle.</p>\n<p>\n            The American Psychological Association observed in an August 2015 <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/about/policy/violent-video-games.aspx\">policy statement</a> that research demonstrated a link “between violent video game use and both increases in aggressive behavior … and decreases in prosocial behavior, empathy, and moral engagement.”\n    </p>\n<p>\n            In its July 2016 <a href=\"http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2016/07/14/peds.2016-1298\">guideline</a> on media violence,<strong> </strong>the American Academy of Pediatrics warned that violent media set a poor example for kids. Video games, the academy noted, “should not use human or other living targets or award points for killing, because this teaches children to associate pleasure and success with their ability to cause pain and suffering to others.”  \n    </p>\n<p>Overall, the academy’s summary of the results from more than 400 studies revealed a “significant” link between being exposed to violent media (in general) and aggressive behavior, aggressive thoughts and angry feelings.</p>\n<p>These clear, no-nonsense arguments appeal to many parents. However, they may not represent the views of the entire field. Some social scientists have come up with more unexpected results.</p>\n<p>Whitney DeCamp, an associate professor of sociology at Western Michigan University, says the evidence points to either no relationship between playing video games and violent behavior or an “insignificant” link between the two.</p>\n<p>Sure, he said, some studies have revealed a connection between kids playing violent video games and violent behavior. But there is a problem with “looking at those two things in a vacuum”: Kids who like to play brutal video games may have a predisposition toward aggression, he said.</p>\n<p>The real question, he said: Does playing violent games cause a person to act violently?</p>\n<p>\n            In his <a href=\"https://ee46fd3b-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/tbdresearch0/2015iac.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7coiC166BHf1_4d37vjzqpdBgGYQAM9IQp9Ds-dp2wXK9VCcZB07bqxxvO8Txw_HSfFAfSn8HfoQXzXhR7XbzGn04D0irmzaX9fBpQh6Xt3WYha69hDusr2EmuVcOxu1fQC3nqIU_ZyqMhmat9Cmzlv-dSNPtKXfhMbOVFKALQf9ipOcIicrTQLkQejBLh-MomCPMH8vK2Ut6kW3kPf2YH39s1jdjA%3D%3D&amp;attredirects=0\">own study</a>, he examined that question using data from the 2008 Delaware School Survey, which included responses from 6,567 eighth-graders. Among the questions, students were asked whether they had played violent video games in the past year. DeCamp factored out the propensity to play violent video games (due to a natural attraction to brutality) along with other factors, such as gender and family relations. \n    </p>\n<p>He discovered that playing video games, no matter how bloody, did not predict violent behavior.</p>\n<p>Christopher Ferguson, associate professor and co-chairman of the Department of Psychology at Stetson University, supports this view. In fact, he goes so far as to suggest that violent video games may help reduce societal violence rather than increase it.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/07/25/health/video-games-and-violence/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Last week’s change to the <a href=\"http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2016/2016-09-07/html/sor-dors239-eng.php\">Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</a> permits doctors to apply for permission under the federal Special Access Program to offer their addicted patients diacetylmorphine: pharmaceutical-grade heroin.\n    </p>\n    <p>The government referred to a “medical need for emergency access to diacetylmorphine” in the regulation.</p>\n    <p>“A number of countries have allowed doctors to use diacetylmorphine-assisted treatment to support the small percentage of patients with opioid dependence who have not responded to other treatment options,” the regulation states. “There is also a significant body of scientific evidence supporting its use.”</p>\n    <p>The new rule reinstates an old one, explained Eugenia Oviedo-Joekes, an associate professor in the School of Population and Public Health at the University of British Columbia.</p>\n    <p>In October 2013, then-Health Minister Rona Ambrose removed diacetylmorphine from the federal Special Access Program and so banned doctors’ access to prescription heroin. The new regulation clarifies that heroin can be prescribed to patients only under supervision in specialized circumstances, said Oviedo-Joekes: “They made it a bit more clear how this request should be handled.”</p>\n    <p>\n            Oviedo-Joekes led the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18758964\">North American Opiate Medication Initiative</a>, an experimental drug trial evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of heroin-assisted treatment in a Canadian context. The study, which is referred to in the new regulation, examined heroin as a treatment for severe addicts in British Columbia and found a higher percentage of female users and a significantly higher prevalence of crack use than in European settings. The authors noted that cocaine addiction jeopardizes the possible results in opioid addiction treatment.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            Of course, not all Canadians believe that treating addiction with heroin is a move in the right direction. Ambrose told <a href=\"http://globalnews.ca/news/855450/reality-check-is-health-canada-giving-addicts-free-heroin/\">GlobalNews.ca</a> in 2013 that giving addicts heroin is “not to treat an underlying medical condition, but simply to allow them to continue to have access to heroin for their addiction even though other safe treatments for heroin addiction, such as methadone, are available.”\n    </p>\n    <p>According to Oviedo-Joekes, “methadone doesn’t work all the time for everybody. Methadone works very well as a first-line treatment.” Addiction, “like any other illness,” may require second-line or even third-line treatments.</p>\n    <p>\n            Prescribing heroin to severe addicts who don’t respond to other treatments may not cure them of their habit, according to Oviedo-Joekes and her colleagues, but it can lessen their exposure to life-threatening health risks, such as drug overdoses, blood-borne viral infections and endocarditis, an inflammation of the chambers of the heart. Studies indicate that <a href=\"http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/191/1/55\">prescription heroin </a>reduces illicit drug use and so decreases <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2008.02185.x/abstract;jsessionid=B7F32CED406E3E928D76D990F357464F.f03t02\">criminal activity and health care costs</a>, so the greater societal toll is lessened.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            This fall, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government will sponsor a summit to address the issue of opioid addiction, Health Minister Jane Philpott told <a href=\"http://www.660news.com/2016/09/08/health-canada-approves-use-of-prescription-heroin/\">660 News</a>.  \n    </p>\n    <p>According to Oviedo-Joekes, opioid deaths in Canada are on the rise. Not all provinces keep count, she said, but the numbers in British Columbia are more than double last year’s figures.</p>\n    <p>“In British Columbia, the last [death] count was beyond 400 people, and it is estimated by the end of the year we will reach 800 deaths due to fentanyl,” Oviedo-Joekes said, citing a coroner’s statistics.</p>\n    <p>Fentanyl, a type of opioid, is most commonly prescribed to cancer patients for relief of pain. It is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine and 30 to 50 times more powerful than heroin.</p>\n    <p>The crux of the problem is that addicts don’t know they are buying fentanyl; they believe they are buying heroin or other opioids. Because fentanyl is so potent, it’s easier for drug dealers to make more money with it, so they cut heroin with it, Oviedo-Joekes explained.</p>\n    <h3>Join the conversation</h3>\n    <p/>\n    <p>“There are going to be other drugs beside fentanyl,” she said, noting that drug dealers will find a way to increase their profits: “They’ll always be a couple of steps ahead of us.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/14/health/prescription-heroin-canada/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>Story highlights</h3>\n<p>An effort aims to use agriculture to bring residents back to Georgia's Sapelo Island</p>\n<p>The Red Pea Project boosts production of local heirloom crops</p>\n<p>Off the coast of Georgia lies a quiet island, accessible only by boat and home to about 50 year-round residents – all descendants of slaves.</p>\n<p>Sapelo Island is a tangle of marsh and farmland, and its residents are known as Saltwater Geechees.</p>\n<p>This remote culture has survived years of displacement and migration from their island. With little resources available, Saltwater Geechees have learned to live off the land, fishing local waters and growing much of their own food.</p>\n<p>“I’m what you refer to as a ‘beenhere,’ ” joked Cornelia Walker Bailey, a Sapelo resident and vice president of the Sapelo Island Cultural and Revitalization Society. “It means I’ve always been here.”</p>\n<p>Bailey is one of the last residents born and raised in Hog Hammock, the sole community still owned by residents on Sapelo. Many are moving to the mainland to be closer to schools and possible income.</p>\n<p>In an effort to revitalize the island and preserve their culture, Bailey wants to bring residents back by using agriculture, specifically the Sapelo Island red pea. Red peas, their origins in Sierra Leone, have been growing in residents’ gardens for centuries.</p>\n<p>“We will always have a backyard or a side yard with red peas in it. We want to grow more … so we can hire young people, so they can come back home and plant peas,” Bailey said.</p>\n<h2>A pea with history</h2>\n<p>Bailey has paired up with Dr. William Thomas, physician and owner of the Sapelo Island Birdhouses. The man known affectionately as Doc Bill has invested many years in the revitalization of Sapelo. When this opportunity came up, he joined Jerome Dixon of Georgia Coastal Gourmet Farms to start the Sapelo Island Red Pea Project.</p>\n<p>“To get people involved in a project, they have to have an interest in it. It has to be something they identify with,” Thomas said, “and the red pea is something they brought from Africa to the Georgia coast, and that has strong ties.”</p>\n<p>He says everyone in the community is familiar with the pea. “They eat it in dishes, they know how it grows, and they have a whole culture of planting and harvesting it.”</p>\n<p>Now in its third year, the Red Pea Project has increased overall production land to 5 acres.</p>\n<p>A large part of this growth is the partnership with the mainland’s Georgia Coastal Gourmet Farms. Dixon’s family came from Sapelo generations ago and has farmed this area of the mainland for more than 60 years.</p>\n<p>Today, the project grows three heirloom crops with history in Georgia: Sapelo Island red peas, Sapelo Island purple ribbon sugar cane and sour oranges.</p>\n<p>“I’m really excited about the purple ribbon sugar cane,” Dixon said. “My grandfather directly planted that particular variety. To be able to handle things he handled is exciting.”</p>\n<h2>Preserving Geechee foodways</h2>\n<p>Dixon remains closely tied to the Geechee culture and enthusiastic about preserving Geechee foodways.</p>\n<p>“Sapelo Island red peas were brought to Sapelo Island by slaves from Africa who worked on the plantation,” he said. “You look at stuff that has not been grown since the 1800s, when slaves were forced to grow the crops. Now, people like myself are able to do it at our leisure.”</p>\n<p>Heirloom crops, like the Sapelo Island red pea and purple ribbon sugar cane, are more than just history. The diversity of the products give chefs more options.</p>\n<h3>Join the conversation</h3>\n<p/>\n    <p>Sapelo Island red peas are about the same size as any other pea. “However, they are genetically distinct from commercial or modern varieties. They are unique in color, texture and taste,” Dixon said, elaborating on the significance of diversity. “By eating and seeing this crop grow gives consumers a sense of importance to making sure another great heirloom variety thrives 50 more years.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/14/health/sapelo-island-red-peas/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

America watched the president’s recovery intently, and <a href=\"http://hms.harvard.edu/news/harvard-medicine/harvard-medicine/play/backstory\">exercise paired with a healthy diet</a> became a new mantra to ward off heart disease. The following year, Eisenhower was elected to a<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/presidents/dwightdeisenhower\"> second term</a>, and America’s focus on heart health – and, specifically, what constituted a heart-healthy diet – burgeoned.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            But by the 1960s, two opposing ideas about what caused heart disease emerged. John Yudkin, a British physiologist and nutritionist, suggested that sugar consumption was linked to incidence of and mortality rates from coronary heart disease: Specifically, eating too much sugar might boost levels of <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/triglycerides.html\">triglycerides</a>, a type of fat found in blood.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Meanwhile, Ancel Keys, an American physiologist, argued that heart disease was related to scarfing down too many <a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-truth-about-fats-bad-and-good\">bad types of fat</a>, as such fats may raise cholesterol and possibly cause a heart attack.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Keys’ theory became more widely accepted than Yudkin’s. Keys even graced a <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19610113,00.html\">1961 cover of Time magazine</a> and was one of the first scientists to champion the health benefits of the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3684452/\">Mediterranean diet</a>.\n    </p>\n<p>Whatever happened to Yudkin’s theory? Researchers suggest that when the sugar industry “manipulated” the scientific debate on heart disease, his theory – along with other sugar consumption research – was swept under the rug.</p>\n<h2>Old letters reveal new secrets</h2>\n<p>The new paper was led by Cristin Kearns, a postdoctoral researcher at the UCSF School of Dentistry, who collected letters dating from 1959 to 1971 between executives at the Sugar Research Foundation and various scientists.</p>\n<p>\n            Some of the letters, about 319, were in correspondence with <a href=\"http://archives.library.illinois.edu/ead/ua/1505023/1505023f.html\">Roger Adams</a>, an organic chemist at the University of Illinois who died in 1971, and about 27 documents were in correspondence with <a href=\"http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~med00138\">David Mark Hegsted</a>, a nutritionist at Harvard University who died in 2009.\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/12/health/sugar-industry-heart-disease-research/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But at the bottom of all these wishes is the hope that our kid turns into a decent human being – someone who is kind, respectful, and honest.</p>\n    <p>How do you bolster these strengths as well as teach key skills such as teamwork, communication, and perseverance? For the most part, kids will learn these things by following your example and through experience gained at school and in their communities. But media is another entry point. Since movies, TV shows, books, video games, and social media are such a huge part of kids’ lives, it makes sense that kids can learn important lessons about character through media.</p>\n    <p>\n            <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/blog/100-ways-to-help-kids-learn-grit-determination-and-resilience?utm_source=cnn&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_campaign=advice\">100+ ways to help kids learn grit, determination and resilience</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>Here are some specific things you can do or say to reinforce character:</p>\n    <h2>Watch sports.</h2>\n    <p>Not only can watching sports with kids be a really fun way to bond over a favorite team or player, it can be a perfect opportunity to point out character strengths from teamwork to perseverance. After cheering over a big touchdown or basket, point out how important the linebackers or passers were to the score: Even though they don’t get all the attention, the team wouldn’t be successful without the admirable work of supporting players.</p>\n    <p>\n            <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/blog/how-movies-can-build-kids-character-and-the-ones-that-do-it-well?utm_source=cnn&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_campaign=advice\">How movies can build kids’ character – and the ones that do it well</a>\n    </p>\n    <h2>Share social media.</h2>\n    <p>From Facebook and Instagram to YouTube, social media is ripe with character lessons. If you notice a post, photo, or video of something especially touching or beautiful, share it with your kid and comment on how much courage it took for the poster to share their story or creative expression.</p>\n    <p>Discuss the risks involved with putting yourself out there and how important it is to take (reasonable) risks to be true to yourself, even though you might face criticism.</p>\n    <h2>Expand your horizons.</h2>\n    <p>Watching documentaries or movies about people who live very different lives can trigger empathy, compassion, and humility. During a family movie night, choose something out of the ordinary – a story about someone of a different race or religion, or about a community that’s less fortunate than yours, or a subculture with different values or beliefs than yours – and encourage discussion afterward.</p>\n    <h2>Play video games together.</h2>\n    <p>Gaming as a family offers the chance to practice teamwork, problem-solving, communication, and perseverance, while also having fun. Choose multiplayer games where gamers are required to work together to win. Model positive, respectful communication during the game (try “I need help over here” instead of “you idiot!”). If kids are trying over and over again to achieve a game goal, you can recognize their effort as well as their success.</p>\n    <p>\n            <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/video/modal/4996841?utm_source=cnn&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_campaign=advice\">Can TV and games teach kids patience and empathy?</a>\n    </p>\n    <h2>Take a time-out.</h2>\n    <h3>Join the conversation</h3>\n    <p/>\n    <p>Most households are abuzz as various mobile devices alert us to text messages or Instagram posts. But we can help teach our kids self-control by resisting the urge to respond immediately. Next time you hear a text message alert (and you know it’s nothing urgent), say out loud, “I don’t need to check that right now.” This lesson can work on social media, too. If you’re a Twitter or Facebook user and you see something that makes you mad, talk through with your kid why you don’t want to respond right away (“I might say something I regret because I’m upset” or “I’d rather tell my friend that this bothers me privately instead of publicly on Twitter”).</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/09/health/kids-character-digital-world/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She made the decision to get a Mirena intrauterine device, known as an IUD; it’s more than 99% effective in preventing pregnancy and lasts for five years.<strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Those facts are part of a concerted effort by the <a href=\"https://thenationalcampaign.org/\">National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy</a>, working in conjunction with entertainment outlets such as MTV, to educate teens and young women about the range of birth control methods available to them.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            But judging by the results of <a href=\"http://www.urban.org/research/publication/knowledge-gaps-and-misinformation-about-birth-control-methods-persist-2016\">a new survey by the Urban Institute,</a> far too many women still don’t know anything about the so-called longer-acting reversible contraceptives, the IUD and the implant, which are more effective at preventing pregnancy than birth control pill and condoms.\n    </p>\n<p>While 90% and 86% of women 18 to 44 were very aware of condoms and the pill respectively, only 31% said they heard a lot about IUDs and implants, according to the Urban Institute survey of roughly 800 women.</p>\n<p>“It’s not a surprise that women were most aware of the condom and birth control pills, but the lack of awareness of IUDs and, in particular, implants was definitely surprising,” said Adele Shartzer, a research associate at the Urban Institute and one of the co-authors of the survey. “I guess I just assumed that most women have at least heard of these methods, but it seems like they really haven’t.”</p>\n<h2>‘The IUD is not the IUD’ of the past</h2>\n<p>According to the survey, 32% of women didn’t know anything about the effectiveness of the implant, a tiny rod inserted in the arm that releases a hormone to prevent pregnancy. Nearly 20% said the same about the IUD.</p>\n<p>As for safety, 21% of the women surveyed said the IUD was either somewhat or very unsafe, and 23% felt the same way about implants.</p>\n<p>\n            “Part of it is that the IUD is not the IUD that it was 20, 30 years ago,” said Ginny Ehrlich, chief executive officer of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. In 1974, the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10308671\">Food and Drug Administration suspended the sale of an IUD known as the Dalkon Shield </a>after reports of deaths and infections among users.\n    </p>\n<p>“And so if young women in particular are getting information from their mothers and their parents, the IUD and implant information that their mothers and parents have might not be accurate,” she said.</p>\n<p>\n            The <a href=\"http://www.acog.org/About-ACOG/News-Room/News-Releases/2011/IUDs-Implants-Are-Most-Effective-Reversible-Contraceptives-Available\">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, in recommendations to doctors in 2011, </a>said IUDs and implants are the most effective reversible contraceptives available and are safe to use by almost all women of reproductive age. These birth control methods can have some side effects, including irregular bleeding or no periods for <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mirena/basics/risks/prc-20012867\">Mirena IUD</a> users, heavy bleeding or anemia for <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/paragard/basics/risks/prc-20013048\">copper IUD</a> users, or back pain and changing bleeding patterns for <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/contraceptive-implant/basics/risks/prc-20015073\">implant users</a>.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            In 2009, 8.5% of women in the United States used an IUD or an implant, <a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/contraceptive-use-united-states#9\">according to the Guttmacher Institute.</a> That’s up from 5.5% in 2007 and 2.4% in 2002.\n    </p>\n<p>It’s hard to know to what extent women head into their doctor’s office with perceptions about IUDs and implants based on family or friends and already have said “yes or no” to themselves about different birth control options based on those perceptions, Shartzer said.</p>\n<p>“IUDs, they’re very safe now, but they do have, kind of from way back, a history of less-than-safe products, and if you’re talking to your aunt or your grandmother about it, that may be kind of their perception. That’s not in line with what the current products are,” she said.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/14/health/iud-birth-control-knowledge-gaps/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>With a collector’s eye and a collagist’s heart, <i> Doors</i> (2022), Swiss-American artist and composer Christian Marclay’s most recent assemblage-style film, splices together clips of doors and the various comings and goings they usher, all plucked from films spanning cinema history. Playing on a continuous loop in the Brooklyn Museum’s fifth-floor Moving Image Gallery, which is appointed with nine backless benches, this 55-minute work shares DNA with the artist’s other film and television montages, including his monumental, 24-hour-long film </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>(2010) and</i>\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/55022/six-things-i-learned-and-one-i-didnt-from-christian-marclays-the-clock/\">The Clock</a>\n    <p>\n      <i>(1995), anchored, respectively, in the evolving technologies of time pieces and communication devices.</i>\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.paulacoopergallery.com/exhibitions/christian-marclay2#tab:slideshow\">Telephones</a>\n    <p>In Marclay’s latest mashup, doorways serve as passageways from one scene to the next: When one shuts, another opens, revealing another character in another room and another era. In one sequence, a lone cowboy struts through a wood-paneled space. He grabs a door handle, and a posse of leather-jacketed men exit into a dim apartment hallway. And so the scenes unfold with an air of a surprise, unknowns lurking and morphing behind every door.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/DIG_E_2025_Christian_Marclay_Doors_07_Paula_Abreu_Pita_PS22-General-Use-JPEG-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Christian Marclay: Doors</i>at the Brooklyn Museum</p>\n    <p>As vexing and disjointed as this premise might sound, the painstaking transitions and match cuts create an internal logic and sense of continuity. Sorrow and searching give way to mischievous escapades, peppered with comedy and crime. Fear simmers. Tension builds. Doors slam and squeak open again, leading into well-to-do homes, modest apartments, workplaces, doctor’s offices, and winding corridors. The result is a labyrinthine, imagined architecture that feels, at turns, like one of M.C. Escher’s <a href=\"https://mcescher.com/gallery/impossible-constructions/\">impossible constructions</a> and the product of the Surrealist parlor game <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/terms/exquisite-corpse\">exquisite corpse</a>, with its neatly matched doorways cobbling together a chimera. Even though the actors, setting, and plot specifics shapeshift every few seconds, as if jumping into a different plane of a multiverse tale, the emotional thrust and action create a propulsive through line that coheres the sea of snippets.</p>\n    <p>In <i>Doors</i>, Marclay makes visible the mindless, forgettable actions of life indoors — turning keys in locks, twisting knobs, entering and exiting spaces — while exploring the ways that doors serve as charged metaphors and well-worn cinematic devices and tropes. This congress of clichés could teeter into tedium. But, with a wink and a nod, the precise editing and absurd juxtapositions between the assembled film excerpts toy with perception, flowing like a dream sequence. Doors double as sites of transformation. Space and time warp. Narratives get remixed and reinvented. Nothing is static, and anything could happen in the next scene. In this art film, as in life, the whole story can change course in an instant.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/DIG_E_2025_Christian_Marclay_Doors_04_Paula_Abreu_Pita_PS22-General-Use-JPEG-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Christian Marclay: Doors</i>at the Brooklyn Museum</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/christian-marclay\">Christian Marclay: Doors</a>\n      <i> continues at the Brooklyn Museum (200 Eastern Parkway, Prospect Heights, Brooklyn) through April 12, 2026.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>LOS ANGELES — <i> Truthfully, Nancy Buchanan: A Retrospective</i> at the Brick, a comprehensive survey of the LA-based artist’s work, is as sprawling and diverse as the city she calls home. Buchanan studied art at the University of California, Irvine, from 1965 to 1971, along with fellow classmates (and single mothers) Barbara T. Smith and Marcia Hafif, who would become her longtime friends and collaborators. Soon, LA peers Chris Burden, Ulysses Jenkins, and Michael Zinzun, among many others, would also work with Buchanan, together helping to define the 1970s Southern California art scene. As core faculty at the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) for more than 30 years, as well as a founding member of the experimental F Space Gallery, and an integral part of </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://thewomansbuilding.org\">the Woman’s Building</a>, Buchanan has remained deeply engaged with the city’s artistic community for more than five decades.</p>\n    <p>The exhibition’s curators draw from an expansive body of work spanning video, performance, drawing, painting, sculpture, collage, and installation. Each of the space’s nine galleries focuses on a theme that runs through Buchanan’s oeuvre, such as hair, interiors, and consumption. Early works reveal her eager engagement with both feminist politics and consumer culture; in the mock video advertisement “These Creatures” (1979), images of young women with ghoulishly applied makeup are paired with a male voiceover that asks “Isn’t it amazing that we allow them to live among us, these creatures that we can and do control?”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3-1200x1600.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Equally unsettling are a number of pieces that deal with military intervention and weapons technology. The installations “<a href=\"https://primo.getty.edu/primo-explore/fulldisplay/GETTY_ALMA21126289310001551/GRI\">Fallout from the Nuclear Family</a>” (1980) and “Security” (1985) incorporate documents from Buchanan’s father’s career as a nuclear physicist and the artist’s own research into his complicated involvement in the development of atomic weapons. In the same gallery, “…And Babies?” (2003–6) presents a large glass jar, like one might see in a laboratory setting, containing a video projection of malformed fetuses and deceased babies that Buchanan witnessed in a hospital in Vietnam, preserved to document the effects of the US use of Agent Orange in that country in the 1960s. Perhaps more horrifying is that Buchanan’s work could easily be replicated to reference <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/30/faulluja-birth-defects-iraq\">the birth defects caused by depleted uranium used in the US invasion of Iraq in 2004</a>, and other untold military conflicts.</p>\n    <p>Indeed, the main takeaway from this retrospective is that the issues Buchanan began grappling with in the 1970s — misogyny, racism, the climate crisis, government secrecy, warfare, gentrification, and unbridled capitalist consumption — are not past threats but hauntingly present ones. In the video sculpture “American Dreams #7: The Price is Wrong” (1991), a miniature model of a living room, lavishly decorated with fine art paintings and gilded furnishings, holds a small television set broadcasting part of a speech by Oakland’s progressive mayor, Ron Dellums, along with attorney Mary Lee and writer Mike Davis, discussing LA’s speculative real estate market and the communities being overlooked. Nearly 30 years later,<a href=\"https://thegepi.org/the-origins-of-californias-housing-crisis/\"> the number of California’s unhoused residents is at an all-time high</a>. If this all feels a bit dispiriting, let hope be found in Buchanan’s artistic practice itself. Hers is an enduring legacy of creating communal strength amid forces that seek to divide.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2-1200x1600.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/NB2-1200x1329.jpg?resize=1200%2C1329&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/NB7-1200x937.jpg?resize=1200%2C937&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1-1200x1600.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Truthfully, Nancy Buchanan: A Retrospective</i>at The Brick, Los Angeles</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/NB5-1200x999.jpg?resize=1200%2C999&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Truthfully, Nancy Buchanan: A Retrospective</i>at The Brick, Los Angeles</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/NB4-1200x1464.jpg?resize=1200%2C1464&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_9-1200x1600.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Truthfully, Nancy Buchanan: A Retrospective</i>at The Brick, Los Angeles</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://the-brick.org/buchanan\">Truthfully, Nancy Buchanan: A Retrospective</a> <i>continues at The Brick (518 North Western Avenue, Melrose Hill, Los Angeles) through September 20.

    "body": "<p>CHICAGO — The Impressionist artists working in France in the 1800s clearly liked women. While landscapes and still lifes studded their oeuvres, they turned repeatedly to the subjects of dancers, opera singers, boaters, bathers, strollers, book readers, barmaids, and picturesque, rosy-cheeked gals in fashionable gowns and big hats. Male painters found the female form not only tantalizing but a symbol of modernity, as women explored new social access and fashions. They felt that being artists gave them license to peer (or leer).</p>\n<p>Only recently have art historians shed light on another, lesser-known Impressionist artist, Gustave Caillebotte, whose contrarian gaze primarily focused on men and the male body. A major exhibition of his work that originated at the Musée d’Orsay in Paris is now on view at the Art Institute of Chicago. The midwestern museum choose to change the show’s title from the original <i>Gustave Caillebotte: Painting Men</i> to the less definitive <i> Gustave Calllibotte: Painting His World</i>. Both are apt.</p>\n<p>The show, to its credit, does not speculate on Caillebotte’s sexuality, but rather floats intrigue: Why did this artist choose to focus on the male body? The question teases the viewer by way of wall labels that identify his models as bachelors and note that he lived out of wedlock with a woman, with little known about the nature of their relationship. She is listed as “friend” in census data. The show charts Caillebotte’s path from Paris haute bourgeois life to a country home along the Seine where a coterie of male friends frequently visited. Here, plein-air painting, yachting, and gardening occupied him until his death at age 45. These facts function to keep the audience scrutinizing the paintings like detectives searching for evidence of homoerotic desire (or not). The AIC’s Gloria Groom, who co-curated the show, stated declaratively in the French newspaper <i>Le Figaro</i>, “His subject matter is radical during the time because men were not supposed to stare at men, and he’s staring at men.” </p>\n<p>The most riveting painting in the exhibition, “Man at his Bath” (1884), portrays a well-built, naked man from the back as he towels his upper torso. His pale buttocks are tinged with pink after the hot soak. The masculine stance of splayed feet allows for the painterly definition of each leg. A night shirt or towel occupies the floor in the foreground with his shoes near a chair holding folded clothing. Wet footprints mark his trail, bringing an immediacy to the scene. Compare this to Edgar Degas’s many female bathers, who bend, turn, and scrub in awkward poses that are far less sexy. The composition suggests that someone is watching — it’s the lingering gaze of the artist. Caillebotte was a friend and collector of Pierre-Auguste Renoir; one wonders if this is a “cheeky” response to paintings in Caillebotte’s collection, such as “The Swing” (1876), that depict pink-cheeked maidens. In the same room, his only female nude, “Nude on a Couch” (c. 1880), shows an unidealized, thin woman reclining, with clothes piled around. Everything except her face is carefully rendered, including pubic hair and pale skin. The light is specific, from a nearby window. The painting’s unembellished, private immediacy feels unique to the time period.</p>\n<p>A less-finished painting nearby, “Man Drying his Leg” (1884), reveals a greater Degas influence. Here, the same model sits naked in a chair, his leg resting on the edge of the bath as he towels himself. While the beauty of the body has classical echoes, the intimate domestic scene feels voyeuristic. There is no distanced allegorical or mythological overlay, nor any type of Jacques-Louis David “Death of Marat” (1793) heroism.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037994/gustave-caillebotte-impressionist-ode-to-male-sensuality/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>In this essay for <i>Noēma</i>, James O’Sullivan reflects on how early social media brought people on the internet together—through curiosity, connection, genuine engagement, and authentic reciprocal relationships. That period is long gone, replaced by influencers and algorithms, and now AI slop. But O’Sullivan argues that the death of social media can lead to a better web—smaller and slower platforms, private spaces with real people. “[A]s social media collapses on itself, the future points to a quieter, more fractured, more human web,” he writes, “something that no longer promises to be everything, everywhere, for everyone.” </p><blockquote><p>Intentional, opt-in micro‑communities are rising in their place — like Patreon collectives and Substack newsletters — where creators chase depth over scale, retention over virality. A writer with 10,000 devoted subscribers can potentially earn more and burn out less than one with a million passive followers on Instagram.</p><p>But the old practices are still evident: Substack is full of personal brands announcing their journeys, Discord servers host influencers disguised as community leaders and Patreon bios promise exclusive access that is often just recycled content. Still, something has shifted. These are not mass arenas; they are clubs — opt-in spaces with boundaries, where people remember who you are. And they are often paywalled, or at least heavily moderated, which at the very least keeps the bots out. What’s being sold is less a product than a sense of proximity, and while the economics may be similar, the affective atmosphere is different, smaller, slower, more reciprocal. In these spaces, creators don’t chase virality; they cultivate trust.</p></blockquote><h2>\n\t\t\t\t\tMore picks from <i>Noēma</i>\n\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/07/24/the-unseen-fury-of-solar-storms/\">The Unseen Fury of Solar Storms</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Lurking in every space weather forecaster’s mind is the hypothetical big one, a solar storm so huge it could bring our networked, planetary civilization to its knees.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/05/06/how-to-build-a-thousand-year-old-tree/\">How To Build A Thousand-Year-Old Tree</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“A set of experimental techniques and technologies that might seem harmful to trees is actually helping ancient forests survive.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/05/01/sex-gender-nature-fruits-vegetables/\">The Sex Lives Of Common Vegetables</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Nature is full of species for which sex and gender are more fluid than the heterosexual gender binary that is commonly accepted in Western societies.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/02/25/the-languages-lost-to-climate-change/\">The Languages Lost To Climate Change</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Climate catastrophes and biodiversity loss are endangering languages across the globe.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2024/12/30/trespassing-for-the-common-good/\">Trespassing For The Common Good</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“In England, a movement is growing to defy enclosure by trespassing on private land.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2024/09/12/living-in-a-lucid-dream/\">Living In A Lucid Dream</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Recent research on lucid dreams suggests that consciousness exists along a spectrum between sleep and waking, between hallucination and revelation, between dreamworlds and reality.”</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/09/08/death-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Four decades after dozens of culturally significant objects were stolen from the Santa Ana Pueblo in New Mexico, a team of Tribal investigators has pledged to bring the missing items back home.</p>\n<p>In August 1984, the Santa Ana Pueblo (Tamaya in the Keresan language) was plagued by a 10-month-long string of burglaries. Thieves looted pottery, war shields, clothing, drums, baskets, and rugs from homes in this Native American community situated on the Rio Grande, about 20 miles north of Albuquerque. The Pueblo, generally closed to the public, opens its doors on rare occasions such as feast days, and the first thefts took place shortly after one such event.</p>\n<p>“This is particularly heartbreaking because these people took ceremonial items actively being used,” Shannon O’Loughlin (Choctaw), chief executive of the Association on American Indian Affairs, told<i> Hyperallergic</i>.</p>\n<p>The robberies continued until a sting operation in May 1985. According to court records obtained by the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/native-american-stolen-artifacts-santa-ana-pueblo-75e8271e9bb7b27778f46eb5fbfca5c8\"> Associated Press</a>, the architect of the plot was an Albuquerque-based dealer of Native American artifacts who recruited members of a nearby pueblo to infiltrate the historic village. Although the perpetrators were caught, little effort was made to recover the stolen artifacts by the FBI and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), the agencies that oversaw the case. (A spokesperson for the FBI Albuquerque Division told </p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>that “attempts to recover stolen items have been made.”</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>submitted a FOIA request for additional details.)</p>\n<p>Last fall, however, a team from the Santa Ana Pueblo took it upon themselves to track down the roughly 150 looted objects, working meticulously to return them to their rightful owners, one by one.</p>\n<p>“Memories of the thefts and the loss of cultural heritage items still weighed heavily on the community,” said Monica Murrell, director of the Santa Ana Pueblo’s Historic Preservation Department. The Pueblo tapped William Woody, a former “top cop” at the Bureau of Land Management, to join the search. Woody’s experience with cases involving the Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA) and Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) was key, and “teaming up created a synergy,” Murrell said. “Woody brings a law enforcement angle, we bring technical expertise as preservation specialists.”</p>\n<p>The task force also includes Pueblo members Jarrett Lujan and Thomas Armijo, grandson of the Pueblo’s governor, Myron Armijo, who told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that their family lost a war shield, ceramics, pottery, and jewelry in the burglaries.</p>\n<p>Working with the often scant descriptions in case files obtained from the FBI and BIA, the team began scouring auction catalogues, gallery websites, and museum databases for similar objects. “We were looking for anything that suspiciously appeared on the market in the mid-1980s, items with no former provenance,” Murrell said. Notably, pottery made on the Santa Ana Pueblo was not commonly sold to outsiders, so the few examples that make it into the hands of dealers fetch relatively high prices.</p>\n<p>The team got a big break when they discovered that several of the stolen artifacts were later sold to Larry Frank, a collector and dealer of Native American art. Frank died in 2006, but his son Ross Frank, now a professor in the Department of Ethnic Studies at the University of California, San Diego, agreed to share his father’s ledgers with investigators, yielding invaluable clues to some of the missing objects’ current whereabouts.</p>\n<p>Their first victory was a bowl that, according to Frank’s records, had been sold to a local gallery. It was illustrated in an old catalogue and matched a case file description of a medium-sized bowl with triangle designs. They were able to track the item to the last gallery to sell it, which then contacted the family who purchased it. That family agreed to return it, and this past May, the bowl was returned to the Santa Ana Pueblo.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had great cooperation from some of the galleries on getting items back, when you explain the stories. I’ve been quite impressed,” Woody said.</p>\n<p>Despite some people’s willingness to cooperate, Murrell said that not every source has been as eager to assist in their repatriation efforts.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037100/decades-after-heartbreaking-thefts-santa-ana-pueblo-recovers-stolen-artifacts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "author": "AventurOO Editorial",
    "body": "<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>LONDON — The Wallace Collection is famous for its trove of Rococo art, such as <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/tag/jean-honore-fragonard/\">Fragonard</a>’s pastel depiction of indulgent flirtation “The Swing” (1767–68), in which a woman with a voluminous skirt kicks a pink slipper into the air with coquettish abandon, closely watched by two male suitors. In his solo exhibition, Grayson Perry responds to these holdings, offering a fever-dream take on Fragonard’s painting in a tapestry entitled “Fascist Swing” (2024). Here, pastels give way to psychedelically bright colors, while the woman’s smiling expression is contorted into a mask of horror. The laughing suitors are also absent — Perry’s protagonist is alone in her mental disintegration. The work depicts a delusion of excess and grandeur much like Fragonard’s, but with a much darker, more frightening tone.</p>\n<p>“Fascist Swing” depicts Perry’s alter ego Shirley Smith, dreamed up for this exhibition as a way to explore both the Wallace Collection and his ideas around gender, class, and mental illness. Smith, Perry tells us, is a working-class Londoner whose mental illness pushed her into “delusions of grandeur,” as the exhibition’s title puts it, leading to a prolonged psychotic breakdown in which she came to believe she was a member of the aristocracy and the rightful heir to Hertford House, the home of the Collection. Smith is based in part on real-life so-called outsider artists who suffered from mental health challenges and delusions, such as Aloïse Corbaz (1886–1964) and Madge Gill (1882–61) — some of whose fascinating works are included at the beginning of the exhibition.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Grayson Perry: Delusions of Grandeur</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Visitors unprepared for Perry’s <i>gesamtkunstwerk</i> approach to this exhibition may be puzzled by this opening room, where the boundary between truth and fiction is bafflingly but effectively blurred. Fictionalized “archival” photographs of and letters by Smith sit beside real documentation of Gill’s activities at the Wallace Collection in the 1940s, with false dates attributed to the former but not the latter, for instance. Unusually, the audio guide is key to entering Perry/Smith’s world; tracks are alternately narrated by Perry and Smith, making for an immersive experience — although it is a shame that Smith is given a caricatured Cockney accent, which creates a lazily stereotyped image of working-class identity. </p>\n<p>The exhibition loosely follows Smith’s life, ending in a quasi-recreation of the bedroom in which she spent her final days. There are some beautiful objects in here, including a cabinet decorated with portraits of women from the Wallace Collection. There is also a piece called “Hospital Queen” (2024), a hand-beaded self-portrait Smith supposedly made during a stay in a mental hospital. This perhaps alludes to our somewhat morbid fascination with such objects. But even though Perry has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/apr/13/grayson-perry-donates-sketch-to-help-mental-health-support-group\">struggled with issues around mental health</a>, his treatment feels a bit flippant. </p>\n<p>Similarly, in “A Tree in a Landscape” (2024), Perry creates a family tree using portrait miniatures from the museum’s collection, labeling each one with a different mental health diagnosis. The caption notes, “We all exhibit some traits that could be pathologized.” Do we? Perry’s analysis feels glib; here, as in his treatment of Smith’s psychosis, he fails to engage with the realities of serious mental illness.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Grayson Perry: Delusions of Grandeur</i>\n    </p>\n<p>This is but one instance of a recurring lack of nuance in some of Perry’s engagements with complex issues. It is evident that he thinks deeply — but not always about the right things in the right places. For instance, “Man of Stories” (2024), a central piece in the exhibition, is a truly (and deliberately) hideous beaded sculpture of a bard-like figure, inspired by “the expert storytellers of the Luba people in central Africa,” according to Perry’s caption. It is not explained why Perry was inspired by this particular culture, or whether the Luba people have any connection to objects held in the Wallace Collection. The caption continues: “One of my ongoing concerns is over-intellectualism in Western culture, so I was fascinated by the idea of a travelling bard.” Is the implication that he is ascribing a desirable non-intellectualism to central African culture? This speaks to me, at best, of a failure to allow viewers to engage with the figure at an intellectual level, and at worst, of exoticism.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1027871/insider-artist-grayson-perry-outsider-alter-ego-wallace-collection/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><i>Cavalier Perspective: Last Essays, 1952-1966</i>(2025) by André Breton, translated by Austin Carder (image courtesy City Lights Books)</p>\n<p>What does Surrealism, a major art movement in the 20th century, have to do with surrealism, a term often used to describe so many uncanny facets of life in the 21st? The word “surreal” was first used in 1917 to describe a ballet choreographed by Jean Cocteau and composed by Erik Satie, with Cubist costumes by Pablo Picasso. Today, it has been used to describe the “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/12/alligator-alcatraz-trump-cruelty\">Alligator Alcatraz</a>” immigrant detention center and the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-04/-it-s-surreal-trump-s-freeze-on-climate-money-sows-fear-and-confusion\">Trump administration’s climate policy</a>. Does the world today merely resemble dreamlike visions by Leonora Carrington and Salvador Dalí? Or is the American mind reaching for a deeper affinity?</p>\n<p>To answer this question, we must turn to André Breton, the architect and apostle of Surrealism. At just 28 years old, Breton <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1006369/the-small-magazines-that-birthed-surrealism/\">established</a> the movement in a 1924 manifesto, where he defined it as manifesting one’s subconscious “in the absence of any control exercised by reason.” His attempt to exert dictatorial powers over this movement would be his undoing, after a caustic Second Surrealist Manifesto in 1929 largely alienated him from his peers for suggesting that he could excommunicate them. But Breton continued to think, write, and speak about Surrealism until his death at age 70. </p>\n<p>In <i>Cavalier Perspective: Last Essays 1952–1966</i>, translated by Austin Carder, an elder Breton appears for the first time in English — gentler, wiser, and far more adept at analyzing the ideological underpinnings of a movement that had ballooned into an international sensation. It’s in these late writings that his ideas about the surreal begin to mingle with our own. </p>\n<p><i>Médium: Communication Surréaliste</i>, which Breton contributed to (image courtesy City Lights Books)</p>\n<p>While it’s now understood instinctively as shorthand for unreality, one of the ironies of Surrealism is that it has never neatly circumscribed a particular style or technique, the way Fauvism or Impressionism once did. In a 1952 essay titled “Link,” Breton explains that this was by design; Surrealism was never meant to simply define an aesthetic. “When I began searching as early as 1936 for the emotional catalyst for Surrealism,” he wrote, “I discovered it right away in the anxiety inherent to a time when human brotherhood was collapsing more and more each day.” He was referring to the period between World Wars, when the “rational” forces of industrial capitalism, fractious nationalism, and global imperialism continued unabated, with violence looming on the horizon again.</p>\n<p>Breton had spent World War I in a neurological ward in Nantes, treating soldiers suffering from what we now understand as PTSD. As poet Garrett Caples writes in his excellent introduction to <i>Cavalier Perspective</i>, Breton “saw firsthand the effects of technologically advanced weaponry on the human psyche” and responded with a system of thought that was both mystical in power and revolutionary in scope. By the 1950s, Breton’s vision of a liberatory anti-rationalism had become fully postcolonial. He hailed France’s Algerian War as “an orgy of crime,” championed the work of Martinican writer Aimé Césaire and Haitian poet Clément Magloire Saint-Aude, and <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2022/07/andre-breton-haiti-revolution-communists-surrealism\">helped foment a student revolution in Haiti</a>.</p>\n<p>In <i>Cavalier Perspective</i>, Breton explores this anti-rationalism as inherently accessible and corrosive to systems of logic that demand conformity and deride creativity. His many short essays of the period championed astrology, Medieval alchemy, games of automatic word association, and emotionally expressive art forms dismissed by mainstream Western institutions as “primitive,” from Celtic poetry to African masks. I was particularly struck by “The Language of Stones,” which suggests that certain polished rocks draw sensitive seekers toward them and may even be imprinted with divine messages. Today, the theory reads like a startlingly familiar concoction of new-age natural mysticism poisoned by a terminally online paranoia that “it’s all connected” — Make America Healthy Again, <i>avant la lettre</i>.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038721/andre-breton-cavalier-perspective-surrealism/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>What’s the opposite of a white cube exhibition? <i> Touch Jamaica</i>, Rejin Leys’s show of paper sculptures set among the period props of a historic home, feels pretty close. The Queens-based Haitian-American artist creates mixed-media work that meditates on displacement due to the climate crisis, political shifts, and the legacy of colonialism. She is also known for the PulpMobile, a paper-making studio she wheels out to public spaces like parks and street fairs for community art-making. Both strains of her work come together in this exhibition featuring relief sculptures of local landmarks — the oldest tree in Jamaica, Queens, architectural details of defunct libraries and theaters —</p>\n<p>\n      <i>at the King Manor Museum, a historic house built by Rufus King, a United States founding father. Taken in this context, these paper works feel like the surface of the densely layered past that is our collective inheritance.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>The King Manor Museum is currently only accessible via guided tours between noon and 4pm, Tuesdays through Saturdays. This creates a unique dynamic: There is no skimming through didactic information here; rather, a staff member — in my case, Hannah — leads you through, room by room. The house itself has been decorated to reflect various periods within its past — an 18th-century room on the first, 19th- on the second — making you feel that you are moving through time. History feels not only alive but in progress: The very person walking with you is currently researching the objects that surround you. It is their archival research that determined the decoration of the library (jaguar pelts, apparently, were all the rage in the 18th century); the reproductions of paintings on the walls (art history lovers will be excited to learn that John Trumbull and Gilbert Stuart painted family members); and, speaking of the anti-white cube, even the color of the paint (plaster painted to look like wood, an original marigold yellow the museum hopes to restore soon).</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Rejin Leys: Touch Jamaica</i>\n    </p>\n<p>It’s fitting, then, that Leys works in paper, a medium so closely associated with archives and record-keeping. In the servants’ preparation room, beside antique muffin tins, dark glass jars, and a weathered wooden storage box, is a thick, pale blue paper sculpture imprinted with some of those very objects. Similar items are strewn around the gallery and the kitchen next door. Between two windows, in a darker blue paper patchwork set against a white wooden armature, for instance, is the imprint of what looks like an arched window with intricate ironwork. Around the corner, also set on a wooden armature, is a cobalt-blue work seemingly cast from a stone monument engraved with the years “1861” and “1865,” the date range of the Civil War.</p>\n<p>Indeed, in this room, it’s impossible to forget that each of us carries a collective history, that no one exists within a vacuum. Hannah, my tour guide, pointed to reproductions of the food that would’ve been available to the house’s early residents: On one side, local items, such as a turkey and potatoes, and on the other, those produced or transported via the labor of enslaved people, such as sugar and lemons. Whereas a white cube induces you to suspend the broader context in favor of the here and now, Leys’s exhibition demands that you see these objects in relation to yourself and the larger world.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Rejin Leys: Touch Jamaica</i>\n    </p>\n<p>I found myself drawn to the formal beauty of the works: the square dimpling and ripped apertures of one piece, the white spatters that dot another midnight blue sculpture like stars. But I felt that I missed Leys’s intention to make present not just the deep past of the 18th and 19th centuries, as represented by this house, and the contemporary, through her objects, but also the many nested layers of history between them. A link included in the exhibition’s didactics takes a viewer to a map of the sites from which Leys drew these impressions, such as a former Queens Public Library, bank, and theater. This information was intellectually engaging, but didn’t penetrate my felt experience; perhaps a Jamaica local might recognize some of these places and be more deeply moved.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038759/rejin-leys-contemporary-art-exhibition-in-an-18th-century-home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>It’s 1925. It’s a new age, all the lines on the economic graphs are going up, and surely no future conflict could ever be as bad as what Europe had just gone through — they didn’t call it “the Great War” for nothing. That spring, the French government inaugurated its <i>Exposition internationale des arts décoratifs et industriels modernes </i>(International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts) in Paris. The event proved wildly popular; millions flocked to see new styles of architecture, sculpture, fashion, and decoration that consciously eschewed 19th-century influences. Years later, this movement would become globally known as Art Deco (an abridging of <i>arts décoratifs</i>).</p>\n<p>One of the many foreign visitors enraptured by the striking line work, stark colors, and complex geometric designs was up-and-coming American film designer Cedric Gibbons. In their 1987 book <a href=\"https://www.alibris.com/Screen-Deco-A-Celebration-of-High-Style-in-Hollywood-Howard-Mandelbaum/book/5944449\"> Screen Deco: A Celebration of Hollywood High Style</a>, authors Howard Mandelbaum and Eric Myers speculate that Gibbons may in fact have been Hollywood’s only envoy to the exhibition. He brought Art Deco to theaters in the United States with his work on 1928’s </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019237/\">, and the look would proliferate through both cinema and society from there. To celebrate the centenary of the Paris exhibition, Film Forum is collaborating with the Art Deco Society of New York to present</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://filmforum.org/series/screen-deco\"/>\n    </p>\n<p><i>,</i>a months-long retrospective of notable showcases for Art Deco in cinema. As the title suggests, the series is patterned after Mandelbaum and Myers’s book, and it will include a live presentation from the duo on November 24.</p>\n<p><i>Our Dancing Daughters</i>(1928), directed by Harry Beaumont</p>\n<p>Gibbons is one of the more influential of the lesser-known film artists. He would amass more than 1,500 credits over his nearly four-decade career, a testament to the dizzying pace of industrial film production during Hollywood’s golden age. Even if you aren’t a classic Hollywood aficionado, you know his work — he’s the one who designed the Oscar statuette. <i>Our Dancing Daughters </i>is one of more than 15 films he’s credited on as art director in 1928 alone. Beyond being Art Deco’s US debut, the film<i> </i>was also the breakout role for Joan Crawford, the most notable of the titular dancing daughters. The movie does not feature spoken dialogue but does have a synchronized soundtrack, making it an early novelty of the burgeoning sound era. This aspect is important, since conveying the music directly makes the characters’ partying lifestyle much more vivid and immediate. Indeed, the film was formative in the image of the flapper.</p>\n<p><i>Our Dancing Daughters </i>was a hit, and other studios scrambled to capture the new look of Art Deco. Soon, reality would race to reflect art. In <i>Screen Deco, </i>Myers and Mandelbaum write about how Gibbons’s rich clients would “ask for exact duplications of settings he had created for the screen,” and that he “received requests from newlyweds and engaged couples for blueprints of the dream houses seen at their local Bijou.” (We should bring back calling theaters “Bijous.”) Movie stars would use set designers as interior decorators for their own mansions. Ramon Novarro, Hollywood’s first Latin American heartthrob, had Gibbons furnish <a href=\"https://www.laconservancy.org/learn/historic-places/samuel-novarro-residence/\">his Lloyd Wright-designed house</a> in black fur and silver. Cinema conjured a dream of what modernity could look like, and modernity raced to make that dream real.</p>\n<p><i>Animal Crackers</i>(1930), directed by Victor Heerman</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039097/how-art-deco-changed-american-cinema-film-forum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Kennedy International Airport (JFK), including a relief with a Ptolemaic-era cartouche, a complete gold funerary amulet set, and wooden sculptures dating back to approximately 1900 BCE, federal prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/smuggler-egyptian-antiquities-sentenced-prison\">announced</a> last week.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/artifacts5-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Ashraf Omar Eldarir, a 52-year-old Brooklyn resident, pleaded guilty to four counts of smuggling earlier this year, according to the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York. On each occasion, he used fake provenances to conceal the trafficked artifacts’ illicit history and subsequently sell the objects to multiple prominent US-based auction houses.</p>\n    <p>A licensed physician in Egypt, Eldarir was first arrested in January 2020 for attempting to smuggle 590 bubble-wrapped rare artifacts through Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at JFK. Upon searching his luggage, customs officers noted that the suitcases were filled with “loose sand or dirt” and some of the objects “smelled of wet earth” — tell-tale signs of recent illicit excavation, according to court filings.</p>\n    <p>The lot, which included a large Egyptian stone face, a pair of Osiris headpieces, and a Greco-Roman terracotta headless torso, was later appraised at $82,000, the court papers say.</p>\n    <p>“When asked about the various pieces of stone, wood, and ceramic pieces, Eldarir stated that they were items to decorate his two-bedroom apartment,” a February 2020 court filing read.</p>\n    <p>Authorities also found materials Eldarir allegedly used to falsify the objects’ provenance, including “decades-old” Egyptian watermarked stationery and loose stamps and multiple doctored “old-looking photographs purporting to depict an ancestor of the defendant displaying several of the artifacts in his office from long ago,” an August 2025 court filing read.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/artifacts-7-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/artifacts-6-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Art crime professor and <i>Hyperallergic</i> <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/author/erin-l-thompson/\">contributor</a> Erin L. Thompson commented that antiquities smugglers have been implementing fraudulent provenance schemes “ever since museums and auction houses began to ask for provenance information.”</p>\n    <p>“The question is why the people who are supposed to check this paperwork are fooled over and over again by these obvious forgeries,” Thompson said, pointing to another high-profile case in which the Metropolitan Museum of Art <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/485562/the-metropolitan-museum-will-return-prized-gilded-coffin-after-learning-it-was-stolen/\">acquired a looted ancient gilded coffin</a> for approximately $4 million.</p>\n    <p>“The answer is that they want to be fooled,” Thompson said.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/artifacts1-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Investigators were ultimately able to untangle Eldarir’s smuggling web using geotagged and timestamped photographic evidence in his cell phone. They also consulted with an Egyptologist at the British Museum, which holds its <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/843150/the-sun-is-setting-on-the-british-museum/\">own collection of contested objects</a>, to determine that his illicit antiquities dealings dated back as far as approximately December 2011 and spanned more than 500 Egyptian relics. Auction houses offered many of these items, said the August 2025 court filing, “similarly (and fraudulently) purporting to reflect that they came from the same pre-1948 family collection of Egyptian antiquities,” before it became illegal to remove Egyptian antiquities. </p>\n    <p>“Auction houses and dealers would have many fewer antiquities to sell if they spotted all the fake artifacts and fake paperwork they’re offered — it’s in their financial interest to be fooled,” Thompson said. “This allows them to blame the smuggler when they’re caught.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/artifacts2-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/artifacts4-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039134/man-caught-smuggling-hundreds-of-egyptian-antiquities-through-jfk-airport/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The FOIA request, reviewed by <i>Hyperallergic</i>,<i> </i>asked the agency to produce documentation including notes, biometric and DNA records, call logs, video and audio recordings, and immigration documents, as the 21-year-old considers taking legal action against the US government. CBP also denied having any records related to Mikkelsen in a FOIA response reviewed by <i>Hyperallergic</i>.</p>\n<p>“This case also matters beyond my client, because every international traveler should have clarity about the grounds on which they may be detained or refused entry,” Vestby said.</p>\n<p>The public records request filed by Mikkelsen and his lawyer also alleged that Mikkelsen was detained for 18 hours, during which his repeated requests to contact the Norwegian consulate were denied in violation of diplomatic conventions. Mikkelsen also claimed he was threatened with imprisonment and fines if he did not turn over passwords to his device or sign certain documents.</p>\n<p>A DHS spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic </i>that ICE did not have records on Mikkelsen because he had not been taken into custody, though Mikkelsen told <i>Hyperallergic </i>that he was first questioned by ICE agents. The DHS spokesperson did not answer an inquiry as to why the CBP could not provide a record of its encounter with Mikkelsen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/offthetrackbutnotlost?igsh=NXJwa212dWt3ZTMw\">Max Wernerson</a>)</p>\n<p>In an August 8 email to Vestby reviewed by <i>Hyperallergic</i>,<i> </i>ICE said that the agency considered his request under the FOIA and Privacy Act, the latter of which entitles individuals to learn how the government stores and uses information about them. While the FOIA and Privacy Act are both avenues to accessing federal records, agencies can deny requests on certain <a href=\"https://www.foia.gov/faq.html\">grounds</a>, including concerns over national security and trade secrets. The government is <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-B/chapter-XXI/part-2105\">required</a> to provide a reference to “any FOIA exemption applied.”</p>\n<p>Vestby told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that he considers ICE and CBP’s response to be insufficient under what is required by the FOIA. In an appeal, Vestby claimed the agencies’ responses were “ambiguous and incomplete.”</p>\n<p>Mikkelsen had planned a months-long trip to the US to visit friends and tour national parks with his mother, he told <i>Hyperallergic </i>in an interview after he returned to Norway in June. However, while passing through passport control at Newark, he was summoned into a room where he said ICE agents asked him if he planned to commit terrorism, belonged to any extremist groups, or was smuggling narcotics.</p>\n<p>CBP officers then inspected Mikkelsen’s phone, according to his account of the events, where they found the viral meme of a bald JD Vance and photos of a pipe he said he made in trade school. Publicly, the DHS has stated that Mikkelsen was denied entry because he admitted to using marijuana, which he acknowledges having done twice in places where the substance is legal.</p>\n<p>However, DHS’s public narrative does not match what Mikkelsen claims officers told him in the interrogation room, nor does it match documents from CBP reviewed by <i>Hyperallergic. </i></p>\n<p>Officers handed Mikkelsen a document known as an I-877, which is an official sworn report provided by DHS in instances where an individual is denied entry into the US. Mikkelsen’s I-877 states that he was denied entry because he appeared to be seeking illegal employment, which he denies.</p>\n<p>Mikkelsen told <i>Hyperallergic </i>that during his interview, however, he remembers that he was told the JD Vance meme was “illegal” and “dangerous.”</p>\n<p>Mikkelsen requested a copy of his I-877 in his FOIA request, which the agency claimed it had no record of.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038623/us-agencies-say-they-have-no-records-of-tourist-flagged-for-jd-vance-meme/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In this exhibition, open through December 6, Filsoofi engages with the layered histories of place, the materials drawn from it, and a poetic dialogue between her own migration from Iran and the forced migration of enslaved Africans who arrived in Charleston. Through this lens, she reflects on our shared presence in the land — not through similarity, but through resonance across time, material, and memory.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/RahelehFilsoofi_2-1200x857.jpg?resize=1200%2C857&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>In her audio and video work, Filsoofi aims to render the land not as a silent backdrop, but as an active, sonic archive alive with the textures of wind, water, and human experience. In this spirit of immersion, Filsoofi created a book of dust poetry, inspired by the exhibition’s location adjacent to the Halsey Institute Library. Books are another vessel of memory, language, and reflection. Through poetry, Filsoofi gives voice to otherwise unspeakable threads of thought. This idea carries through her ceramic vessels, which honor the legacy of David Drake (Dave the Potter), an enslaved African American artisan who lived and worked in Edgefield, South Carolina. Drake inscribed his pots with poems that wove resistance into utility and embodied the radical potential of clay as both record and refusal, objects that speak even under conditions designed to silence. In using clay as legacy, Filsoofi asks the land to tell its story — her story, our story, the stories of all of those who moved across it.</p>\n    <p>Having lived and worked across nine Southern states over the last twenty years, Filsoofi’s experience informs her exploration of geography not only as a physical landscape but as a layered archive of labor, displacement, and survival. This exhibition offers a poetic excavation, a mapping of arrival and absence, a listening for the sounds that persist in soil. It honors the people, plants, and stories rooted in this region, while asking: What connects us across difference?

In the main space are large depictions of grim scenes (e.g., bodies immersed in water or on a raft, coupled with formidable avian creatures) that draw on the surreal and the grotesque.</p>\n<p>So, who was Spore Bush? She was born in 1878 in Bay City, Michigan. She studied dentistry at the University of Michigan and was among the state’s first woman dentists. After her mother died in 1919, she used a Ouija board to contact her, and began receiving messages from deceased artists urging her to take up painting. The next year, she left her dentistry practice and moved to New York to dedicate herself to art and charity work; while organizing a soup kitchen, she met and eventually married millionaire Irving Bush.</p>\n<p>It’s the kind of compelling narrative the art world — or just about any audience — devours: rags (or middle-class) to riches, spiritualism, obscurity, and rediscovery, all in one fascinating figure. Hilma af Klint’s 2018–19 Guggenheim survey resurfaced the narrative of the self-taught, visionary woman artist, often unknown to or forgotten by the art world until her posthumous or late-life “discovery,” as a popular trope. It’s easy to read Spore Bush’s story and situate her in this lineage, and the exhibition essay does so — along with af Klint, it cites Agnes Pelton, Emma Kunz, <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/661920/paulina-peavy-spiritualist-artist-who-channeled-a-ufo/\">Paulina Peavy</a>, and <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/991689/gertrude-abercrombie-american-surrealism/\">Gertrude Abercrombie</a>, disparate artists whose notable commonalities are their spiritualist leanings and their gender.</p>\n<p>There’s no doubt that Spore Bush and her work deserve recognition. But this framing, particularly when little literature on her exists, should raise some questions. Who acts as the discoverer, who tells the story, how do they tell it, and what are its ripple effects?</p>\n<p>Thematically, her late mostly grisaille paintings bring to mind a different set of artists, including Goya, Otto Dix, and Käthe Kollwitz, whose art addresses violence, struggle, and salvation. Stylized birds occupy the bulk of the composition in multiple pieces from 1933 to ’43. In the United States, those dates span the Great Depression and midway through World War II, a fraught period rich with those same themes.</p>\n<p>In “The Gaunt Bird of Famine” (1933) — a stunning painting, but not the show’s most dramatic — a giant whitish bird, rendered in thin gossamer lines that arc into<strong> </strong>graceful points, looms large against a solid black sky. Below, in the same dirty white, is what looks like a village. Spore Bush articulates it loosely and thickly, but realistically enough that it feels separate from the sky. The divide suggests a symbolic menace sweeping over the real world.</p>\n<p>Two similarly striking birds, rendered in black against a cloudy gray sky, nearly meet at the center of “The Pawn Broker (Three Vultures),” from the following year. Below the rigid horizon line is a body of black water. A face, just above the surface, looks up at the birds, fearfully or dolefully; chains are visible around the person’s neck. The show’s standout is “The Avengers” (1943). Here, a winged figure flies close to a dead tree, from which three bodies hang. The dark, undulating ground resembles both earth and water, a stark contrast with the oceanic turquoise sky.</p>\n<p>Spore Bush herself described her art as prophetic and guided by the spiritual forces she called “They” or “the People.” Edward Alden Jewell’s 1943 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1943/05/19/archives/mrs-irving-t-bush-to-open-exhibition-artist-with-psychic-powers.html\"> New York Times</a> review, for instance, quotes her as saying: “They move my hand up and down and onward across and sideways in all directions.” Though this automatic process might echo that of af Klint, Peavy, and others, defaulting to such comparisons defangs the art and erases its cultural context. A more substantive comparison is the oversized vultures that recur in Goya’s </p>\n<p><i>Disasters of War</i>print cycle (1810–20), in works like “</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://fristartmuseum.org/exhibition/goya-the-disasters-of-war/#lg=1&amp;slide=4\">The Carnivorous Vulture</a>” and “</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038749/marian-spore-bush-was-nobodys-visionary-artist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "author": "AventurOO Editorial",
    "body": "<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>An esteemed nonprofit wants to turn a West Chelsea arts building on the market into an artist residency program while keeping longtime tenants in their studios.</p>\n<p>The Wolff Building at 508-534 West 26th Street was listed on the market earlier this year, a move <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/987172/artists-and-galleries-decry-sale-of-iconic-chelsea-building/\">contested by artists and residents</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.efanyc.org/\">Elizabeth Foundation for the Arts</a> submitted an offer in April to purchase it and establish a studio program similar to its West 39th Street flagship, where artists have obtained subsidized workspaces through an annual application process since 1998.</p>\n<p>“It is extremely important to preserve what I believe is the largest concentration of creative workers in Manhattan,” Anne-Brigitte Sirois, a principal at Art State LLC who helped formulate the foundation’s bid with Eagle Point Properties and Art State, told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “Artists contribute immeasurable cultural value to New York City and play a critical role in sustaining Chelsea’s character and real estate strength.”</p>\n<p>Under the proposal, the Elizabeth Foundation would own the 362,000-square-foot building, while Eagle Point Properties, a private real estate firm, would act as a co-borrower and guarantor, and all three parties would share its governance. The offer amount was not disclosed.</p>\n<p>Foundation officials envision keeping the historic warehouse’s roughly 200 existing artists, designers, and galleries while introducing shared cultural spaces and professional development resources, including curatorial visits, peer critiques, and networking opportunities.</p>\n<p>“This model is not limited to the Wolff Portfolio. It is replicable,” Sirois said. “If not here, then in other buildings where artists and creative businesses already cluster.”</p>\n<p>The site’s future remains in the hands of attorneys representing the estate of Raymond and Gloria Naftali, who <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/987172/artists-and-galleries-decry-sale-of-iconic-chelsea-building/\">put the lot up for sale</a> last December for <a href=\"https://commercialobserver.com/2024/12/wolff-building-chelsea-hits-market-170m/\">$170 million</a>. </p>\n<p>The Naftalis purchased the commercial building a half-century ago and converted it into artist studios, attracting prominent tenants including photographer Hiroshi Sugimoto, painter Ross Bleckner, and conceptual artist Glen Ligon, as well as galleries such as Berry Campbell, Galerie Lelong, and Morgan Lehman.</p>\n<p>Gloria Naftali, who co-founded Chelsea’s Greene Naftali gallery, had hoped the building would remain an artist haven in perpetuity, but did not include a legal directive requiring her wish in her will. Instead, attorneys representing Naftali’s estate claim the building is not profitable enough to support the arts-related initiatives of the Raymond and Gloria Naftali Foundation, of which they are both trustees (Raymond died in 2003).</p>\n<p>Three years after Naftali’s <a href=\"https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/new-york-ny/gloria-naftali-10943093\">death</a>, the building’s status as an art hub remains uncertain. Four offers have emerged, including the Elizabeth Foundation’s bid, as well as one from Bedrock Mini-Storage, an art storage facility one block west of the Wolff Building, sources familiar with the negotiations said.

    "body": "<p>This fall, museums around Los Angeles are showcasing art’s ability to foster community, to rage against injustice, and to rewrite history. A historical survey of Mail Art in Latin America highlights subversive networks of artistic production in the face of political repression, while a traveling exhibition of radical Chicano prints from the Smithsonian lands at the Huntington. A show at the Getty pulls from the Guerrilla Girls’ archive, and a two-person exhibition at Skirball pairs the late Philip Guston with contemporary painter Trenton Doyle Hancock. The timely show <i>Monuments</i>, co-organized by the Brick and the Museum of Contemporary Art, juxtaposes decommissioned US monuments with work by artists engaging with current debates over how we want to reimagine our nation’s history. Ken Gonzales-Day and Tavares Strachan both engage in research-based practices that scrutinize who and what gets written into — and out of — mainstream narratives.</p>\n<h3>Flesh of the Forest</h3>\n<p><strong> Oxy Arts</strong>, 4757 York Boulevard, Highland Park, Los Angeles</p>\n<p>Through December 13</p>\n<p><i>Flesh of the Forest </i>brings together work by nine contemporary Black artists who focus on the forest as a complex site of liberation, danger, history, and boundless possibility. Curated by Tiffany E. Barber, the exhibition features wide-ranging portrayals of the wilderness as a surreal, liminal space where historical realities and speculative fictions coexist. Highlights include Alicia Piller’s maximalist assemblages built from the landscape of LA; Josèfa Ntjam’s video “Matter Gone Wild” (2023) that draws on gaming, mycology, and cosmic exploration; Reuben Telushkin’s kinetic sculpture connecting global struggles for freedom; and Simphiwe Ndzube’s fantastical mixed-media installations rooted in his childhood experience of post-Apartheid South Africa.</p>\n<h3>Guadalupe Maravilla: Les soñadores</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.redcat.org/events/2025/guadalupe-maravilla-1\"> REDCAT</a>, 631 West 2nd Street, Downtown, Los Angeles</p>\n<p>September 13–December 19</p>\n<p>Guadalupe Maravilla fled his native El Salvador as a child during its bloody civil war, arriving in the US as an unaccompanied child. He later survived cancer, a disease he attributes to the trauma of violence, migration, and his previously undocumented status. <i>Les soñadores</i>, his first solo show in LA, includes sculptures that reflect his personal history of upheaval and resilience. These include “Migratory Birds Riding the Celestial Serpent (Aves migratorias montando la serpiente celestial)” (2021), an undulating serpentine form that incorporates objects picked up on a recreation of his migration path, and “Dream Backpacks” made from volcanic rock, which merge precolonial sculptural precedents with contemporary narratives of diasporic dislocation.

Tracing threads across generations and geography, the exhibition showcases a rebellious DIY attitude grounded in underground, queer, and musical communities. Joey Terrill’s imaginative map “Los Diablos,” begun in 1969 when he was a high school freshman, will be on public view for the first time, while Griselda Rosas presents monster drawings created collaboratively with her child. Deanna Templeton pairs photos of adolescent girls with her own journal entries, Seth Bogart offers cartoonish tributes to girl groups and punk idols, and Stanya Kahn screens her meditative, post-apocalyptic film “No Go Backs” (2020).

    "body": "<p>The art world has seen its fair share of eyebrow-raising brand collaborations in recent years. Damien Hirst made a bag for Prada festooned with bejeweled insects. Shepherd Fairey displayed his <a href=\"https://lgoledart.com/artist/Shepard_Fairey\">street art works</a> on digital TVs in a partnership with LG Electronics at Frieze LA. And this spring, Takashi Murakami teamed up with Louis Vuitton to release a leather goods <a href=\"https://www.lvmh.com/en/news-lvmh/louis-vuitton-and-takashi-murakami-celebrate-20th-anniversary-of-era-defining-collaboration-with-launch-of-re-edition-collection\">collection</a>.</p>\n<p>But here’s a new alliance that wasn’t on our 2025 bingo cards: Today, September 8, Independent 20th Century announced a partnership with Sotheby’s, marking the first such collaboration between an auction house and an art fair, two distinct models for selling modern and contemporary art.</p>\n<p>A staple of the city’s art fair circuit for the past 15 years, Independent’s dedicated modern art show will leave its home at Casa Cipriani within the Battery Maritime Building and trek uptown into the Marcel Breuer’s Madison Avenue landmark from September 24 to 27 next year, a few weeks after the fall art season typically begins. It will also roughly double in size to include more than 50 galleries.</p>\n<p>In a press release, Independent founder Elizabeth Dee said the fair’s partnership with the auction house and the historic venue would create a “museum-caliber exhibition experience” for exhibitors while showcasing their rosters of artists to a new group of collectors. Sotheby’s Global Head of Fine Art Madeline Lissner said the collaboration would “create new bridges between the galleries, collectors and the public.”</p>\n<p>Both parties, they say, have much to gain from the arrangement.</p>\n<p>Independent hopes the fair’s location change will spur programming, exhibitions, and audience enthusiasm around modern art, not to mention boost sales at a time when the economy is shaky and collector habits are <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039842/how-new-collector-habits-are-shaking-up-art-fair-season-2025/\">changing</a>. Sotheby’s, meanwhile, has been trying to attract younger audiences comfortable splurging on artwork at fairs and in online forums, though it’s unclear whether Independent 20th Century attracts that collector base. </p>\n<p>“It’s sort of that uptown-downtown divide,” Andy Massad, an art advisor and private dealer with Masaad Fine Art, told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “This introduces a new generation to the brand. Sotheby’s has been making a big push into other luxury items to appeal to the same generation, not just the fine arts market, so this would be a way of pulling that base up.”</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>The announcement comes amid reports of a lagging art market. According to the Art Basel and UBS Art Market Report, auction sales <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1002180/art-auction-sales-dropped-by-25-percent-in-2024-amid-global-volatility/\">dropped by 25%</a> in 2024, though private transactions rose, possibly a sign of increased uncertainty among collectors. Sotheby’s global sales fell <a href=\"https://puck.news/sothebys-billion-dollar-real-estate-play/\">23 percent</a> to $6 billion from $7.8 billion in 2023, while its fine art sales in particular dropped 31 percent over the same period.</p>\n<p>Though more difficult to quantify, the impact appears to be felt by art fairs, too. The Art Dealers Association’s (ADAA) annual Art Show, an anchor of New York’s fall fairs, abruptly <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032202/as-adaas-art-show-changes-course-a-nonprofit-is-left-in-limbo/\">halted</a> its 2025 edition this summer, insisting that the decision “was not driven by market forces, exhibitor contraction, or diminished sales,” while NADA <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/market/nada-quietly-nixes-second-edition-of-paris-fair-2680613\">cancelled</a> its Paris iteration with no public announcement.</p>\n<p>Caren Decter, a partner at the art law firm Frankfurt Kurnit Klein &amp; Selz, said that Sotheby’s teaming up with an art fair was not completely surprising given that the art market has been softening for several years.</p>\n<p>“There’s always been some sort of tension between gallerists and auction houses, because they operate in competition with each other,” she told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “It’s a hard time for the art market right now, but maybe this is where we’re going to see interesting new collaborations and energy injected.”</p>\n<p>That energy is nothing new in the gallery space, where dealers have been teaming up for years now. Last year, six galleries <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/930948/six-art-world-cool-kids-take-over-abandoned-high-school-in-upstate-new-york-the-campus/\">partnered</a> up to launch a new exhibition space, The Campus, in an abandoned high school in Upstate New York. Transmitter and Tiger Strikes Asteroid have <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/994167/iconic-bushwick-galleries-transmitter-tiger-strikes-asteroid-celebrate-10-years-together/\">shared a space in Brooklyn</a> for over a decade, a communal model that’s now being embraced by others, such as <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DGEBwNkxxkc/\">Proxyco and Instituto de Visión</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040296/independent-art-fair-partners-with-sothebys-raising-larger-market-questions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>CHICAGO — On a recent Saturday night, I sat in a tiny storefront with a dozen or so others. Three dancers moved with glacial slowness not 10 feet in front of us, illuminated by the streetlights outside. Eerie sounds buzzed throughout the space. “Nether,” by Zachary Nicol, was 30 minutes of dystopia until, at the very last minute, it was not, by the grace of the trio finally linking their bodies together.</p>\n<p>This was not my first experience at <a href=\"https://romansusan.org\">Roman Susan</a>, a gallery of just 280 square feet located in a wedge-shaped space on the ground floor of a nearly 100-year-old flatiron building — but it will be one of my last. The artist-run nonprofit, which Nathan and Kristin Abhalter Smith opened in 2012, will close on September 30 because the building in which it resides, 1224–1234 West Loyola Avenue in Rogers Park, has been emptied out and slated for demolition by Loyola University Chicago, its new owner. </p>\n<p>This is happening despite a set of facts that, in a more just universe, would have ensured a different outcome: The property housed 30 apartments full of tenants, many on social security, plenty of whom had lived there for over a decade. Downstairs were three beloved, creative, intergenerational community spaces: Archie’s Café, Edge Art, and Roman Susan. A protest was held by residents, neighbors, supporters, and elected officials, including Illinois state senator Mike Simmons and 49th Ward alderwoman Maria Hadden. Roman Susan, with the longest lease, advocated for its neighbors to be able to stay at least until they themselves were forced to clear out. The university cannot even develop the site anytime soon, due to future renovations of the adjacent Red Line El station.</p>\n<p>The kicker is that Loyola, as a Jesuit institution, professes a deep responsibility to the surrounding community and to the environment. Neither is served by the displacement of residents and small businesses, or by the failure to reuse viable historic property rather than dump it into a landfill. That’s growth and profit at the expense of a diverse and sustainable neighborhood, a pattern the university has repeated throughout the Rogers Park and Edgewater neighborhoods. On this one block of Loyola Avenue alone stand three vacant lots, fenced off and unused for years, except as employee parking.

    "body": "<p>LIVERPOOL — <i>Bedrock</i> offers a multilayered theme for the <a href=\"https://www.biennial.com\">2025 Liverpool Biennial</a>, the United Kingdom’s largest free contemporary art festival. Curator Marie-Anne McQuay notes in a catalog essay that it explores three overlapping strands: The city’s underlying sandstone foundations, which have also shaped its architecture; modern layers built during periods of industrialization, colonization, and the transatlantic slave trade; and, finally, the city’s diverse demographics and the places they cohabit today. The theme’s potency is, however, impaired by the presence of many underwhelming artworks, some of which feel weak in isolation while others come across as speculative responses to the theme.  </p>\n<p>For starters, the 30 participating artists are scattered across 14 venues and four outdoor installations, with many presenting more than one work. Despite Liverpool being a walkable city, the staging feels too fragmented. Tate Liverpool’s current closure for renovations has robbed the organizers of an anchoring venue. The site that comes closest is Bluecoat, where McQuay headed the programming from 2015 to 2022. Her familiarity with the space comes in handy as she cohesively presents a set of works that examine familial ties, identity, and heritage.</p>\n<p>Incredibly, only one of the artists in the biennial has enduring ties to the city. Presented at Bluecoat, Liverpool-born Amber Akaunu’s documentary “Dear Othermother” (2025) shines through in its authenticity. It is a heartfelt examination of single motherhood, intergenerational bonds, and unconventional friendships in the Toxteth neighborhood. The film is deeply tied to the social fabric, given that this area historically harbored people of African and Caribbean ancestry, and one out of six households there today is headed by a single mother. A few other artists have also created meaningful participatory projects involving the local community. Through workshops, the Somali-Indian collaboration DARCH surfaces spiritual traditions around the death and grieving using soil as medium and metaphor. Dublin-based Alice Rekab’s vibrant vinyl murals “Bunchlann / Buncharriag” (2025), co-created with college students, explore assertions of immigrant identities among young people.</p>\n<p>However, at many venues, the works fail to engender meaningful dialogue in congruence or contrast, despite the curatorial assertions. Take Turkish artist Cevdet Erek’s “Away Terrace (Us and Them)” (2025) at 20 Jordan Street — a sprawling but drab installation with pulsating sounds mimicking the in-stadia buzz of a football match. It is presented alongside Imayna Caceres’s assortment of handmade clay sculptures whose flora and fauna motifs commemorate pre-Columbian knowledge systems related to their Peruvian heritage. The curatorial suggestion that both artists explore “foundational references from the city including football stadia and naturally occurring materials” comes across as unconvincing.</p>\n<p><i>Origin Family</i>/</p>\n<p><i>Bedrock</i>in Irish Gaelic) (2025), outdoor vinyl installation</p>\n<p>At the Walker Art Gallery, the group exhibit is tucked away in a secluded cul-de-sac and fails to forcefully critique the museum’s colonial legacy. Next door, at the grand Liverpool Central Library, Eritrea-born Dawit L. Petros’s “As the Nile Flows or the Camel Walks” (2025) can also be hard to locate or viscerally engage with. His installation draws on colonial archives to reimagine a British-Canadian military expedition in the 1880s.</p>\n<p>In contrast, searching for Kara Chin’s tiles set into the sidewalks on Berry Street is like an enjoyable easter egg hunt. Her multimedia installation at a nearby venue also scores for its playful use of urban fixtures like seagulls, parking meters, and non-native plants to make a broader point about adaptation and resilience.</p>\n<p>The Biennial’s outreach in the city’s Chinatown, the oldest in Europe, is noteworthy for intent but fails to strike a deeper resonance. Montreal-based Karen Tam’s recreation of a Cantonese opera stage ponders how diasporic memory preserves histories vulnerable to erasure, but it feels more like a generic import than a conversation about Liverpudlian-Chinese immigrant experiences. Taiwanese artist ChihChung Chang’s Imperial Arch-shaped mural, “Keystone” (2025), did involve local residents in its making. What is missing is a penetrating examination of the discrimination that the community has suffered in the past, such as the forced repatriation of Chinese seamen after the Second World War, which tore apart mixed-race families and was not acknowledged properly until decades after.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039174/theres-not-enough-of-liverpool-in-the-city-2025-biennial/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Polymathic artist Rosalyn Drexler — Pop Art icon, Emmy-winning screenwriter, and one-time wrestler — passed away at her home in New York yesterday, September 3, at age 98. Her death was confirmed by Garth Greenan Gallery, which represented her for a decade.</p>\n<p>In the 1960s, Drexler developed what would become her signature painting process. She sourced images from posters, magazines, and other pop cultural print media, which she then arranged and enlarged on sheets of paper, before gluing them to canvas and painting over them in bright colors. Her paintings from then through the<strong> </strong>’80s probe gender and power as performed in pop culture. </p>\n<p>Perhaps related to her successful career in writing — she notably penned the novelistic adaptation of the film <i>Rocky </i>(1976) under a pseudonym — narrative and character were a particular focus. She captured her protagonists, often men in suits or swooning women, mid-action — a slap, a kiss — against abstracted color fields. The resulting paintings are compositionally masterful, with the clean lines of a movie poster charged with the psychologically unsettling undertones of a Rorschach test. </p>\n<p>Rosalyn Drexler, “Love and Violence” (1963), acrylic, oil, and paper collage on canvas</p>\n<p>Her 1963 work “<a href=\"https://buffaloakg.org/blog/rosalyn-drexlers-love-and-violence-1965\">Love and Violence</a>,” for instance, resembles a film reel spliced into a Mondrian painting: Orthogonal lines divide blocks of primary colors, inside which play out scenes like a woman recoiling from a man’s possessive hand clamped under her chin. As critic John Yau wrote in a 2017 review for <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/399656/rosalyn-drexler-occupational-hazard-garth-greenan-gallery-2017/\"> Hyperallergic</a>, “She brought a lively imagination to bear on the banal and absurd images that dominate our lives … and made them into something to contemplate.”</p>\n<p>Drexler was born in 1926 in the Bronx, New York, to Jewish immigrants from Russia. Attending the vivid spectacle of vaudeville shows and playing with art posters, books, and coloring sets were among her early artistic influences. She majored in voice at the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan, now the LaGuardia High School of Music and the Arts, and went on to attend Hunter College for a single semester before marrying her husband, figurative expressionist painter Sherman Drexler, in 1946. He died in 2014, leaving behind a body of paintings of which she is often the subject.</p>\n<p>In the late ’40s, the couple lived in Berkeley, California, where Drexler began making assemblage sculptures out of found scrap metal and wood. By 1951, the couple had moved to Hell’s Kitchen on Manhattan’s west side, near a gym where professional women wrestlers practiced. She became a wrestler herself under an alter ego, whom Andy Warhol captured in a series of silkscreen paintings, <i>Album of the Mat Queen</i><i> </i>(c. 1962–63). She would go on to write a critically acclaimed book in 1972 based on her time both in the ring and in the art world, <a href=\"http://bookshop.org/a/539/9781965028025\"> To Smithereens</a>, which was republished by Hagfish earlier this year. </p>\n<p>Drexler built a rich social life in New York. She frequented the now-shuttered Cedar Tavern, a legendary hotspot for artists; counted Franz Kline and Elaine and Willem de Kooning among her close friends; and participated in the <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/46882/happenings-new-york-1958-1963-pace-gallery/\">Happenings</a>. She was represented by Reuben Gallery, which closed after a year in 1961, and Korn Blee Gallery from 1964 to ’66, and showed in group exhibitions at spaces like Pace, in addition to penning nine novels and 10 plays. </p>\n<p>Still, she did not achieve the same recognition as her male peers, whether because of her gender, the subject matter she was drawn to, or both. Indeed, a political awareness underpinned Drexler’s life and art: In a <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/retrospective/eight-artists-reply-why-have-there-been-no-great-women-artists-4245/\">1971 conversation with Elaine de Kooning</a> published in response to Linda Nochlin’s groundbreaking article “Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?” she said, “I don’t think it’s ridiculous for women to demand that they be represented in equal numbers at the Whitney. You have to start somewhere.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039466/rosalyn-drexler-pop-artist-and-polymath-dies-at-98/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>‣ Robert Colquhoun and Bobby MacBryde were once household names in the London art world, until they weren’t. Author Damian Barr writes in the <i> Guardian</i> about the now-obscure artists, whose lives he attempts to recreate in his new novel:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>I stumbled across them as footnotes in the biographies of people who used to want to be them. Soho survivors claim Francis Bacon is supposed to have said “Everything I learned about drawing, I learned from Robert Colquhoun.” Endless enraging articles describe them as “friends” or “roommates”: polite closeting elisions, more final than any coffin. When Bobby was 27 he wrote to Robert: “We must be certain to create our legends before we die.” By the time I discovered them they were almost forgotten. Could fictionalising them bring them back?</p>\n      <p>Obsessing, I found them in an issue of the Picture Post from 1949 with Prunella Clough, Keith Vaughan, Patrick Heron and John Minton (Minty). Rich Minty was in love with Robert and would eventually move into their studio, making a couple a throuple – that’s a fun chapter. The Roberts’ interview is titled The Artists Who Live, Travel, Work and Exhibit Together. The photo, by Felix Man, shows them at their easels in matching shirts and ties. Robert is in a fisherman’s jumper probably knitted by Bobby who made most of their clothes, ironing Robert’s shirts with a spoon heated on their single gas ring. On the easels are Bobby’s Woman in a Red Hat and Robert’s Two Scotswomen – both bought by Alfred Barr, the first director of the Museum of Metropolitan Art and sadly no relation. On a mission to acquire the best young British artists, Barr’s other purchases were Bacon, Edward Burra and Lucian Freud.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>‣ After a protest, what happens to the visual language of its art and signage? Aaron Boehmer explores the rich lineage of typography used in social movements for <i> Carla</i>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Through their publishing platform GenderFail, the artist Be Oakley coalesced these individual moments, both from the Gay Liberation Movement, to create a single, downloadable typeface called “I am your worst fear; I am your best fantasy / FIRST GAY AMERICANS.” This typeface and nine others produced since 2018 were the subject of Oakley’s 2024–25 exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. Each of Oakley’s fonts are derived from distinct but intrinsically interconnected socio-political movements—from the Stonewall Riots in 1969 and ACT UP in the 1980s and ’90s, to the resurgent calls for Black liberation in 2020, and the student uprisings for Palestine in 2023–25. The fonts are symbolically meaningful, wherein the “uppercase letters [do not have] any hierarchical importance over lowercase letters.” But they are also meant primarily to be useful, readily downloadable for queer, trans and non-binary folks, and queer people of color to use for protest signs, fundraising and mutual aid purposes, personal projects, and more.</p>\n      <p>In this way, an archive of past protest typography is transformed into a tool for the present and future. Oakley engages with the archive of protest not as a fixed or nostalgic look at the past, but as a dynamic and living resource—a place from which a movement can be both catalogued and continually reimagined. The “I am your worst fear” typeface is not merely a symbol of queer history, but an instrument for queer futurity, allowing generational knowledge from a movement that has been decades in the making to be passed down, active and defiant.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>‣ Five Palestinian women reflected on cherished objects from Gaza, as told to the <i> Cut</i>‘s Danya Issawi. Artist Rama Duwaji, Zohran Mamdani’s partner, crafted quietly moving illustrations of the items they shared, from a portrait of two nieces to a handmade blanket:</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039358/required-reading-749/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

All mediums and workspaces are welcome, including your home studio.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.elainetnguyen.com\">Elaine Nguyen</a>, San Francisco, California</h2>\n<p><i>How long have you been working in this space?</i></p>\n<p>One year.</p>\n<p><i>Describe an average day in your studio.</i></p>\n<p>I work chaotically, on several pieces at a time — on the floor, the walls, tables, in the hallway where I’m not supposed to be, and in the sinks. Some days I show up and sit, and other days are filled with running back and forth, washing off cyanotypes in the sink, and having many more exposures in the hallway sun at the same time. It’s a dance, going from one task to another and back again to resting and spending time in a space. The routine is just being there as often as I can and making space to rest while also showing up.</p>\n<p><i>How does the space affect your work?</i></p>\n<p>The space has completely shaped my work, from the size of creatures that I call bugs or dreams to the imprints of the floor left on the work as it was drying. I enjoy the evidence of the studio left behind on the artwork, like the lines on the floorboards.</p>\n<p><i>How do you interact with the environment outside your studio?</i></p>\n<p>I’m located at Root Division, a gallery, studio space, and arts education hub. There is this stillness about the space despite having so many artists occupy it. I like being able to peek into another artist’s studio and seeing how much can change in a day, and taking walks around the gallery after hours. I love being able to teach a class and have my students’ work in the youth gallery below.</p>\n<p><i>What do you love about your studio?</i></p>\n<p>I love the creaky floorboards and how they hold the memories of artists before me. The walls were pristine when I arrived, but the floors held the history of the building, an old sewing factory to artist studios with their paint spills and hammer marks. There’s this window to the hall, and peering in after I’ve closed up makes me feel like the works become alive at night without me there.</p>\n<p><i>What do you wish were different?</i></p>\n<p>I wish it were enormous. My work tends to become to scale of my studio spaces and living, and having a studio in San Francisco has forced me to scale down significantly. At the same time, if I had everything I longed for in a studio, it would have prevented me from making the work I have made.</p>\n<p><i>What is your favorite local museum?</i></p>\n<p>My favorite local museum is the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive.</p>\n<p><i>What is your favorite art material to work with?</i></p>\n<p>I’m deeply moved by the shifting blues of the sky and the passage of time. I’ve been lucky to discover that working with cyanotypes lends itself well to both fascinations. I chase to memorialize moments, but like the fog moving in, they morph again before they are fully formed. There is an easiness in the medium’s allowance for me to make and repeat, which feels closest to the transformation I’m captivated by.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://patrick-lears.squarespace.com\">Patrick Lears</a>, Margate, United Kingdom</h2>\n<p><i>How long have you been working in this space?</i></p>\n<p>Four years.</p>\n<p><i>Describe an average day in your studio.</i></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039368/a-view-from-the-easel-301/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

His death was <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOMDlpIDtiM/\">announced</a> by Paula Cooper Gallery, which has represented the artist since the gallery opened in 1968.</p>\n<p>Grosvenor was primarily known for large-scale abstract sculptures, although his oeuvre also encompassed photography, drawing, and collage. He first gained recognition in the 1960s, participating in seminal Minimalist group exhibitions like <i>Primary Structures </i>(1966) at the Jewish Museum and <i>Minimal Art</i> (1968) at the Gemeentemuseum Den Haag. He often used unorthodox industrial materials and toyed with concepts of spatial dynamics and function, all with a dry wit and opaqueness that, at times, perplexed his audience. </p>\n<p>Grosvenor charted his own creative path, diverging from Minimalism’s strict formalism. His diverse output spanned many forms, from seemingly gravity-defying cantilevered steel structures to fractured wooden beams and the outer shells of vehicles set bluntly on the floor. He deliberately left much of his work untitled and presented little explanation, as with a complex 2020 sculpture composed of stacked cinder blocks, rubber lining, and stagnant water that art critic and <i>Hyperallergic</i> <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/author/john-yau/\">contributor</a> John Yau <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/539650/robert-grosvenor-at-karma/\">described</a> as “simple and brilliantly economical in its construction” while also “funny and generous.”</p>\n<p>“Grosvenor is able to walk right up to the line separating art from function without crossing over or commenting on it,” Yau wrote. “That’s his gift, and I don’t know of another sculptor who has it.”</p>\n<p><i>Robert Grosvenor</i>at 155 Wooster Street in April 1975 (© Robert Grosvenor, photo by Geoffrey Clements; courtesy Paula Cooper Gallery, New York)</p>\n<p>Born in New York City in 1937, Grosvenor grew up in Rhode Island and Arizona. As a teenager, he studied art and design in Europe, receiving a classical education at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Dijon, the Ecole Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs in Paris, and the Università de Perugia in Italy. As a student, he found inspiration in experimental artists like Yves Klein, Lucio Fontana, and Piero Manzoni, he told the<i> Brooklyn Rail</i> in a <a href=\"https://brooklynrail.org/2019/03/art/ROBERT-GROSVENOR-with-Alex-Bacon/\">2019 interview</a>.</p>\n<p>After returning to the United States in 1959 to complete a six-month military service requirement, he moved to New York, where he forged friendships in the art scene. He became acquainted with members of the cooperative Park Place Gallery, directed by Paula Cooper, and the Green Gallery, which gave an early platform to artists including Yayoi Kusama, Mark di Suvero, and Donald Judd. He described his art of that time to the<i> Brooklyn Rail </i>as “paintings that came off the wall,” and in 1962 he began exhibiting it in group shows.</p>\n<p><i>Robert Grosvenor</i>at Paula Cooper Gallery (© Robert Grosvenor, courtesy Paula Cooper Gallery, New York)</p>\n<p>According to Paula Cooper Gallery, he felt that his career began with the 1965 exhibition of “Transoxiana” — a 31-foot angular cantilevered sculpture that was later featured in the pivotal show <i>Primary Structures</i> alongside works by Judd and such other Minimalist pioneers as Sol LeWitt, Robert Morris, and Anne Truitt. He also garnered acclaim for his dynamic geometric works, as in “Topanga” (1965), which he built after seeing a picture of a massive solar telescope in Arizona’s Sonoran desert, and an untitled all-white steel structure from 1968–70 that hovers midair from cables attached to the ceiling. The latter was featured in his first <a href=\"https://www.paulacoopergallery.com/exhibitions/robert-grosvenor19#tab:slideshow\">solo show</a> at Paula Cooper Gallery. </p>\n<p>Departing from the Minimalist movement during the ’70s, Grosvenor experimented with wooden sculptures constructed from broken lengths of pine planks and found telephone poles. Resting horizontally on the ground, they featured symmetrical fractures, and at times were blackened with creosote, a toxic, oily preservative. In the following decades, he employed found materials like corrugated steel and concrete blocks​​ to create <a href=\"https://www.paulacoopergallery.com/exhibitions/recent-sculpture2#tab:slideshow;tab-1:thumbnails\">unclassifiable structures that wavered between architecture and sculpture</a>. His most recent works included vehicular floor sculptures stemming from his lifelong fascination with cars and boats.</p>\n<p>“His work of the past twenty years was among his very best, at times making that of younger sculptors appear awfully conservative in comparison. In comparison? There was none. His was a world really unto itself,” wrote curator Bob Nickas in a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOL0TsFjvka/?img_index=1\">statement</a> for the New York Art Critics Association.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039765/robert-grosvenor-dies-at-88/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>As I circled around the dozens of booths along the three wide lanes at Art on Paper on Thursday, September 4, one stood out above the rest. On the bare white walls were Moleskine journals, much like the small ones I use, except these were spread open to Nicolas V Sanchez’s ballpoint pen drawings of the many corners of his family members’ homes.</p>\n<p>This year marks Sanchez’s eighth time showing at Manhattan’s Art on Paper, he told me, alongside around 100 exhibitors at Pier 36 through Sunday, September 7.</p>\n<p>Smiling infectiously in his booth, Sanchez stood among his intimate journal works depicting pastoral and familial scenes from his Midwest-meets-Mexican upbringing, created with a combination of ballpoint pens. Ranging in price from about $3,000 to $6,000, three of Sanchez’s works had already sold during the first hours of the fair before I arrived, including two notebooks containing drawings of horses and one depicting the outside of his aunt’s fridge with forensic detail.</p>\n<p>“Because it’s pen, I can’t erase it, so I just have to keep going,” Sanchez said of his process drawing on the 4.5 x 7-inch (~11.4 x 17.8 cm) notebooks. “You just commit to it at a certain point, and then that’s kind of the beauty of it.”</p>\n<p>Sanchez’s still life of his aunt’s fridge, “Refri de mi Tia Blanca” (2025), features ruled notebook paper letters from his nephew held up by magnets. The biggest challenge in creating this piece, he said, was the meta task of ensuring that the letter within the notebook appeared to have been written in pencil rather than sketched by pen.</p>\n<p>The Los Angeles-based gallery Arts Unified’s booth featured another writing accessory. Illustrator Adam Greener’s clipboards initially stunned me due to their gargantuan size, but their familiar form encouraged me to take a closer look.</p>\n<p>Greener’s $13,500 “Choices XL” (2022) is a giant ruled piece of paper tucked into a giant clipboard on which the sentence “I will start making better choices” is repeatedly written. A gallery staff member told me that Greener’s work draws upon his school years, during which his doodles would land him in detention. Nearby clipboard pages inscribed with comically blown-up “F” grades transported me back to failing out of the Albuquerque Public School gifted program (in writing, by the way) circa 2011.</p>\n<p>At the Lower East Side-based gallery Van Der Plas Gallery’s booth, I found two artists who were excited to talk about their work: Susan Day, who flew in from Canada that morning, and New York City-based artist Jason McLean. Day was selling her “dream-inspired” drawings of air traffic control maps of Canadian airspace.</p>\n<p>“This is the stuff that kind of keeps me going,” Day said, describing the fair. “It puts my work into some context, and I think having other people’s eyes see my work … is a huge connection for me.”</p>\n<p>Day said her experiences at the New York art fairs bring her much more traffic than she usually receives in Canada. Showing alongside her was McLean, a fellow Canadian, who walked me through “Future Directions” (2025), a self-portrait that is also a map of New York City.</p>\n<p>Still other kinds of paper media could be found at Art on Paper’s fair within a fair, BOOKsmART, such as mixed-media artist Seth Apter’s stunning display of art books meditating on time and aging. Last year, Apter told me, he sold 12 of the 17 books he brought with him to the meta fair, despite initially doubting the fair audience’s interest in artist books. At his booth this year, his works were priced between $600 and $1800. Typically, he told me, he sells his works online and at institutions where he teaches.</p>\n<p>For my final stop, I went where the money was, like the brain-rotten Gen-Zer I am.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039661/art-on-paper-2025-leaps-off-the-page/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>A woman roaming the mountainside splashes her face in an unseen stream. Her hair drips toward a crystal prism glowing in her steady hand. Mist fills the space around her; her silhouette is gilded in light.</p>\n<p>In this scene from the 1932 film <i>Das blaue Licht </i>(The Blue Light), a plucky heroine emerges from an Alpine range. “Because a woman is the only one who can climb a dangerous mountain,” IMDb’s synopsis reads, “villagers regard her as a witch.” From today’s vantage, the clip exudes a feminist vibe of a piece with a Patagonia ad. You could be forgiven for feeling a wee bit stirred as she (literally) scales the sublime. And for not realizing that this woman — who also directed the film — would soon be the grande dame of fascist cinema.</p>\n<p>Or, as the new documentary <i> Riefenstahl</i> provocatively asks: </p>\n<p><i>Could you</i>?</p>\n<p>Andres Veiel’s movie makes a quiet — and disquieting — case for the insidious potential of the moving image, whose seductive power can be easily harnessed to heinous political agendas. That the propaganda in question comes from Leni Riefenstahl, a woman who directed her singular talent toward not only valorizing but <i>inventing </i>the Nazi aesthetic, throws into relief how foolish it is to reflexively affiliate a woman’s degree of artistic ambition or achievement with automatic progress. </p>\n<p><i>Olympia</i>, with Joseph Goebbels and Hermann Göring on the tribune (1936) (© Vincent Productions)</p>\n<p>Excavating archives <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/24/berlin-museum-offers-glimpse-of-leni-riefenstahl-estate\">recently gifted</a> to Berlin’s Museum of Photography, Veiel visually foregrounds the materiality of film, the inevitably tangled nature of Leni’s art and ideology. A celluloid strip whirs before us, pausing to reveal three figures in a field, a bucolic scene until one recognizes the inverted likeness of a trio of SS officers Here the documentary cuts to an iconic views of 1934 Nuremberg: Throngs of Germans furiously greet their beloved Führer, their bodies packed so close that one loses sight of where one human being ends and another begins. “As he spoke his very first words,” Leni recounts of the rally almost 50 years later, “I was overcome by a very peculiar feeling, my whole body … trembling. And I was somehow captured, as if by a magnetic force.”</p>\n<p>If Leni was enchanted by Hitler’s presence, she did all she could with her films to arouse that same captivation in her country(wo)men. “The camera pans over to one side, and then it pans back over to the other side,” she avidly narrates as she reviews a clip of <i>Triumph of the Will </i>(1935). Her 90-year-old hand proudly swaying to the beat of Herbert Windt’s soundtrack, she adds, “These two shots combine to create the form of a circle, and the resulting effect is very powerful.”</p>\n<p><i>Riefenstahl</i>’s head editor, Stephan Krumbiegel, also grasps the power of strategic juxtapositions — exposing not only Leni’s Nazi infatuation, but that of the German people at large. Following a sequence of unsettling shots of the Nuremberg rally, we pause on a close-up of a girl peeking out from behind a row of soldiers. Her short hair frames her mischievous grin; her side part parallels the swastika behind her. She, like Leni, exudes “girl-power” swagger seemingly at odds with masculinist fascism — and in many other contexts, she, like Leni, would inspire rather than repulse. </p>\n<p>And that is the point. <i>Riefenstahl </i>acknowledges Leni’s scrappy charm while also laying bare her terrifying legacy. Whether it’s taking a lover 40 years her junior or setting off to live among the Nuba people of Sudan, she had no issue flouting standard feminine decorum. Nor did she have a problem with building her career on the goose-stepping heels of a murderous regime. “What responsibility should I have?” she rebuffs a journalist decades later. “Back then 90% of people were enthralled by Hitler. You think I should have been a resistance fighter?”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039657/examining-the-legacy-of-fascist-cinema-grand-dame-leni-riefenstahl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A Smithsonian spokesperson reached by </p>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>confirmed the letter was sent but declined to share a copy or comment on its contents.</p>\n    <p>The Trump administration has sought to <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/999509/trump-whitewashes-history-in-new-smithsonian-executive-order/\">gut the Smithsonian</a> of what it calls “divisive” narratives and “race-centered ideology” and install “unifying, historically accurate, and constructive descriptions.” In a tirade on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump has criticized the Smithsonian for focusing too much on “<a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035605/trump-says-us-museums-should-focus-less-on-slavery/\">how bad slavery was</a>,” among other things. Last month, the White House <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1033993/trump-american-exceptionalism-smithsonian/\">notified the institution</a> that it would conduct a review of the Smithsonian and make “content corrections.”</p>\n    <p>Based on an email shared by Bunch with Smithsonian staff explaining what he told the president, the <i>Times </i>reported that the secretary defended the institution’s independence, but vowed to share certain information with the Trump administration. Bunch, in the description of his letter, said that the institution is already conducting its own review of content to ensure it is “nonpartisan and factual.” The Smithsonian would conduct this review, not the White House, Bunch reportedly said in the letter.</p>\n    <p>“Our own review of content to ensure our programming is nonpartisan and factual is ongoing, and it is consistent with our authority over our programming and content,” the letter said, according to the <i>Times.</i></p>\n    <p>It is unclear, though, whether Bunch outright rejected Trump’s authority to issue “content corrections” on the independent institution. It is also unclear what information Bunch offered to share with the White House, and what say, if any, the institution would have in the Smithsonian-led process. If the Smithsonian doesn’t comply with the White House’s review, it could <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1019966/museum-of-the-american-latino-could-vanish-under-trump/\">jeopardize its federal funding</a>, which accounts for about <a href=\"https://www.si.edu/newsdesk/factsheets/facts-about-smithsonian-institution-short\">62%</a> of its annual budget. The institution has yet to make a public statement addressing the White House’s attempted audit of its <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036180/trump-targets-lgbtq-history-migrants-and-more-in-chilling-smithsonian-hit-list/\">targeting of specific items</a> at the Smithsonian.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039356/smithsonian-secretary-lonnie-bunch-responds-to-trump-museum-crackdown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Historian and curator Kim Sajet, who recently left her longtime post as director at the National Portrait Gallery (NPG) after President Donald Trump claimed he had fired her, will be the next director of the Milwaukee Art Museum (MAM), the institution <a href=\"https://mam.org/info/pressroom/2025/09/director-update/\">announced</a> yesterday, September 3.</p>\n    <p>Sajet will assume the new role on September 22, succeeding Marcelle Polednik, who <a href=\"https://mam.org/info/pressroom/2025/05/milwaukee-art-museum-launches-search-for-next-executive-director/\">stepped down</a> at the end of July after nine years in the post. </p>\n    <p>Sajet’s appointment at the MAM comes several months after a public dispute with the president, who <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1016952/amid-assault-on-the-arts-trump-says-he-fired-national-portrait-gallery-director/\">boasted that he had fired her</a> from the Smithsonian Institution’s NPG in Washington, DC, over her so-called “inappropriate” support for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives. The accusations came in the wake of Trump’s <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/999509/trump-whitewashes-history-in-new-smithsonian-executive-order/\">executive order</a> targeting “improper, divisive, or anti-American ideology” and “race-centered ideology” across the Smithsonian’s museums. </p>\n    <p>At the time, Trump’s assertions that he had terminated Sajet’s employment were dubious, as the NPG is overseen by the Smithsonian, independent of any of the three federal branches. The Smithsonian subsequently <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1019271/smithsonian-pushes-back-against-donald-trump-meddling-in-defiant-statement/\">clarified</a> that only its Secretary Lonnie G. Bunch III, with supervision from its Board of Regents, has the authority to make “personnel decisions.” Sajet ultimately <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1020249/national-portrait-gallery-director-quits-after-trump-firing/\">resigned</a> from her position two weeks later, stating that the decision was “the best way to serve the institution.” She was appointed to the post in 2013 by President Barack Obama. Kevin Gover, the Smithsonian’s under secretary for museums and culture, has been since serving as the NPG’s acting director.</p>\n    <p>In a statement from the museum, Sajet expressed enthusiasm for the MAM’s “culturally vibrant and refreshingly authentic” character, as well as its history of experimental collecting and exhibition. She cited programs like the ongoing <i>Currents</i> series, which has spotlighted artists including Cindy Sherman, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, and Idris Khan.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/mam-waterside-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>“I am keen to expand on this commitment to living artists and also explore the educational opportunities that flow from the art and design of the past,” Sajet said.</p>\n    <p>Her appointment coincides with the museum’s 50th anniversary of the Bradley Collection of Modern Art, a gift of nearly 400 modern pieces including works by Wassily Kandinsky, Pablo Picasso, and Mark Rothko which will be commemorated with a <a href=\"https://mam.org/exhibitions/bradley-collection-modern-art/\">tribute exhibition</a> opening at the end of this month.</p>\n    <p>“To begin my tenure during this milestone exhibition is a privilege, and a reminder of the impact that art — and the generosity behind it — can have on a community for generations,” Sajet said.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039482/curator-kim-sajet-targeted-by-trump-tapped-to-lead-milwaukee-art-museum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Especially now that <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2023/09/25/divorce-what-surprised-me/\">I’m the only adult in the house</a>, I’m so grateful when friends snap a candid shot of my boys and me. So! In honor of moms in the frame, we asked 10 friends to share their favorite photos of themselves in action…</p>\n<p>“This was taken in 2018 at my mom’s house in Vermont. My own mom and I had just gone thrifting, and she had convinced me to buy this great homemade dress. We were in her yard having gin and tonics, and the kids were on summer break, fully feral, as you can see from my four-year-old, who was really feeling himself in his straw hat.” — <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/author/kathryn-jezer-morton/\">Kathryn Jezer-Morton</a> </p>\n<p>“My son had just started kindergarten and was having such a difficult time. I felt so overwhelmed and didn’t know how to help him or what to do. On his birthday in late September, the two of us rode the Q train all the way out to Coney Island. The park was empty, we played games and won a stuffy, ate cotton candy, and rode the ferris wheel (this is a photo from the top). It was a special day.” — <a href=\"https://work.theindigobunting.com/\">Erin Jang</a></p>\n<p>“My second birth experience was so fast. The doctor told me that if I felt like I needed to poop, to let them know right away. And I was like, I need to poop now. I remember they were like, no, it’s too soon. But sure enough, they checked and I was ready to go. I only pushed twice, and she came out! My first birthing experience was much, much longer, so I was so relieved to be done. We don’t have family in NYC, so it was just Zach and me in the birthing room. I’m so grateful for the nurse who asked if she could have my phone while I was pushing, so she could take photos of us during the birth. Otherwise, I never would’ve got this photo, which I’ll cherish forever.” — <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alisonpiepmeyer/\">Alison Piepmeyer</a></p>\n<p>“This was our first big family hiking trip! It was my daughter Louise’s idea for us to have matching braids. Now we do them every time we do anything adventurous together.” — <a href=\"https://www.lewisishome.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqGZXovNefn1P-obC2b9EzNM9AYjfVJSx2pOLfjS_3irwlrzj8G\">Liz Libré</a></p>\n<p>“This summer, we went on a screen-free road trip as a family up the East Coast, and it was wild and difficult and beautiful. We were forced into this sitcom-esque closeness that was both impossibly hard and also funny and sweet. I’ll never, ever forget it. (Here, we were at <a href=\"https://www.newenglandwaterfalls.com/nh-franconiafalls.html\">Franconia Falls</a>.)” — <a href=\"https://katebaer.substack.com/p/road-trip-diaries\">Kate Baer</a></p>\n<p>“After having my second child, Emiliano, I could NOT get over how different he was from my older daughter, Ella. He never slept through the night, he loved the stroller, and he spat up all the time. I felt like everything I’d learned about parenting was useless because none of my old tricks worked with him. But one difference that always brought me to my knees? He was thumb sucker.” — <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/author/jannelle/\">Jannelle Sanchez</a></p>\n<p>“This photo was taken shortly after I finished my final round of chemo, and my hair finally started to grow back! I remember thinking how long and luscious my locks felt, and all I wanted at that point was photos of my kids with me in the frame — proof of my existence, and my survival, if I’m being honest! It was the purest form of happiness that I’d ever experienced.” — <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nickisebastian/\">Nicki Sebastian</a></p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-08-at-5.33.48-PM.jpeg\" alt=\"Selena Ma\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>“I love this photo on vacation with my two girls. I’m working long hours right now and really treasure time with both of them.” — <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/selenaleema/\">Selena Ma</a></p>\n<p>“This photo is from last year at the U.S. Open. My kids don’t play tennis yet but I’m obsessed with tennis and encourage the fandom. I always root for Carlos Alcaraz on the men’s side and Jasmine Paolini on the women’s side, and they love to make fun of my intensity.” — <a href=\"https://youngna.substack.com/\">Youngna Park</a> </p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/bess-kalb-son-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Bess Kalb\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>“I hope heaven is lying in my cousin’s garden with my baby napping on my chest.” — <a href=\"https://besskalb.substack.com/\">Bess Kalb</a> </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/09/08/moms-in-the-picture/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The chemical, trimethylbenzoyl diphenylphosphine oxide – referred to more commonly as TPO – functions as a so-called photoinitiator in such polishes. In plain English, it’s the component that allows gel nails to harden, providing customers with a stronger, longer-lasting end result.</p>\n    <p>But that durable manicure could come at a cost, EU officials warn – specifically, long-term fertility problems, according to the studies officials cited. (Other research efforts, meanwhile, have indicated <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/beauty/features/gel-manicure-safety?src=RSS_PUBLIC\">negative effects</a> on skin from the UV light used to harden gel polishes.)</p>\n    <p>Here in the U.S., however, the Food and Drug Administration – the governing body <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics\">responsible</a> for monitoring the safety of <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/bigname-cosmetics-gave-woman-entrepreneur-creative-business-idea/\">cosmetics</a> and other items on behalf of American <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/arina-ponomareva-flashee/\">consumers</a> – has put no such ban in place. </p>\n    <p>Perhaps it’s a staffing matter. <a href=\"https://www.skadden.com/insights/publications/2025/04/trump-administrations-first-100-days/mass-layoffs-at-fda\">Roughly 3,500 employees</a> were laid off at the agency in April.  Though <a href=\"https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/07/fda-reinstated-roughly-a-quarter-of-initial-doge-job-cuts-00474273\">about 25%</a> of them have since been reinstated, the FDA’s ability to inspect goods and process reviews has been significantly hamstrung. Regardless of firings or hirings, however, there are numerous products and ingredients available in the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.byrdie.com/banned-ingredients-europe\">that are banned elsewhere</a> – from the formaldehyde found in other types of nail polish, to trace amounts of lead in lipsticks. </p>\n    <p>Some see the logic of the EU ban. Francesca Rapolla, scientific affairs manager at the Cosmetic, Toiletry &amp; Perfumery Association, a trade organization, <a href=\"https://www.scratchmagazine.co.uk/news/what-is-tpo-why-is-it-being-banned-from-nail-products/\">told UK-based Scratch Magazine</a> that while industry heads could lobby for exemptions from rulings like the one handed down this month, “the industry did not, and could not, defend the continued use of [TPO] in nail products, mainly because it could not demonstrate that there are no alternative ingredients.”</p>\n    <p>Others in the beauty industry, however, are speaking out against it. One <a href=\"https://www.asap-nails.be/about-ASAP-Nails-Beauty\">Belgian beauty wholesaler</a> even launched a <a href=\"https://www.tpo-eu.com/en/\">protest website</a> that calls the ban “unjust,” and asserts that it will have “a huge impact on thousands of salons, training centers, distributors and manufacturers.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/eu-bans-gel-nail-polishes-that-the-u-s-continues-to-sell/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Two days after police arrested almost 900 people at a demonstration in support of Palestinian activists in London, a new Banksy mural depicting a court judge violently striking a protester has appeared in the heart of the city.</p>\n    <p>The famed elusive street artist shared an image of the stencil artwork with his 13.3 million followers on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOVoHlVDMIU/?img_index=1\">Instagram</a> this morning, September 8. It features a judge in a traditional white wig and black robes using a gavel to hit a protester, who is shown holding a blood-spattered picket sign. According to the caption of the post, the mural was painted on the exterior of the Royal Courts of Justice building in central London.</p>\n    <p>The <i> BBC</i> reported that the mural was quickly concealed with a large plastic sheet and two metal barricades under the watch of two security guards. </p>\n    <p>Although the street artist does not make any explicit mention of a particular event, his latest artwork appeared shortly after mass arrests at a protest opposing a government <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93901n9z0qo\">ban on the activist group Palestine Action</a> on Saturday, September 6. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/BANKSY-COURT-OF-JUSTICE--1200x1033.jpg?resize=1200%2C1033&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>In July, the UK government designated Palestine Action as a terrorist organization, making support of the group a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The ban was put in place after the group <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/raf-brize-norton-palestine-action-planes-8467a20bcd088e24c3fe061852b33ba2\">vandalized two military aircraft with red paint and crowbars</a> in June. Saturday’s demonstration, which was held in Parliament Square, reportedly gathered an <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rvly00440o\">estimated 1,500 attendees</a>, who carried homemade cardboard and paper signs reading, “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action.”</p>\n    <p>The spot Banksy chose for his latest work is located on Carey Street on the outer wall of the Queen’s Building, part of the Royal Courts of Justice complex in Westminster. It is <a href=\"https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1469797\">classified</a> as a Grade II building on the National Heritage List for England, which constitutes <a href=\"https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/what-is-designation/listed-buildings/\">approximately 92% of all listed buildings</a> in the UK.</p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for HM Courts and Tribunals told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that the Royal Courts of Justice was a listed building and that it was “obliged to maintain its original character.”</p>\n    <p>Known for his sharp government criticism and sociopolitical commentary, Banksy has often used his art as a platform to draw attention to human rights struggles. Many of his works call attention to Palestinian suffering at the hands of Israel, such as the <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/863486/banksy-hotel-in-occupied-west-bank-shutters/\">temporarily closed</a> <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/363167/a-visit-to-banksys-new-hotel-in-bethlehem/\">Walled Off Hotel</a> in the Occupied West Bank and <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/185876/new-banksys-highlight-plight-of-palestinians-in-gaza/\">various murals</a> throughout Gaza. </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040173/banksy-paints-mural-of-judge-beating-protester-after-mass-arrests-in-london/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Obsession often does an artist good. That idea she can’t stop thinking about, that uncompleted project that keeps her up at night — such fixations compel her to create, focus her efforts, and keep her returning to the desk, the stage, the studio. But not all obsessions are equally generative.</p>\n<p>Stephanie Wambugu’s stimulating debut novel, <i>Lonely Crowds </i>(2025), centers on Ruth, a painter, and Maria, a filmmaker. The two women are pulled into each other’s orbits as children and prove unable, or unwilling, to extricate themselves. “When I met Maria,” a middle-aged Ruth recalls, “I learned that without an obsession life was impossible to live.” But time and again, her devotion to Maria<i> </i>keeps Ruth from living her life, convincing her she is a minor character in her own story rather than its author, even as her career takes her into the supposed upper echelons of the art world. </p>\n<p>Ruth’s fascination with Maria is instant: As a nine-year-old, she notices her in line to purchase school uniforms — they are the only two Black girls in their grade — and begins dreaming up their life together. The reality is more complicated. Ruth, the reserved, self-effacing daughter of Kenyan immigrants, and Maria, a rebellious orphan living with her unstable aunt, develop a fast but lopsided relationship. Ruth’s infatuation with the precocious Maria, which straddles the platonic and romantic, goes unrequited, her gestures of care largely unreturned.</p>\n<p>But Ruth’s obsession later serves her as a budding teenaged artist: Maria becomes her muse. When Ruth’s father gives her pencils and a sketchbook (a gift, she recalls, that “opened a hatch that would not close again”), she starts drawing “impressionistic, muted half nudes” of Maria — “a girl whose face I’d seen so many times, from so many angles,” she says, “and who still appeared novel and even alarming depending on the light of the hour.” Ruth deems the work “unambitious” in favor of being “allegiant to the model in front of me.”</p>\n<p>This is also how Ruth ultimately conceives of her life. Wambugu writes her narrator as indifferent to her own agency, content “riding Maria’s coattails” from their Rhode Island prep school to college at Bard and beyond. As they pack up Ruth’s childhood bedroom, Maria tells her to throw away her treasured drawings of Maria; more allegiant to her model than to her work, Ruth complies. Ruth’s passivity is rendered in prose that can feel limp or frustratingly remote, even as it’s occasionally dotted with sparkling turns of phrase.</p>\n<p>The holding pattern continues after college, when Ruth follows Maria to New York City. There, Maria’s wealthy girlfriend bankrolls her films and helps turn her into an art world “it girl,” though it’s unclear how much of her success emanates from her talent rather than the sheer force of her charisma, not to mention her financial cushion. “It was so unsettling how no one ever spoke about money or how they were making it,” Ruth observes after attending a gallery opening with her art collector boss — her first introduction to the New York art scene — where she feels like an interloper. Eventually, Ruth finds a service job and a well-off boyfriend-turned-husband to subsidize her painting practice. By the novel’s end, Ruth’s determination to live in Maria’s shadow means she can hardly recognize, let alone enjoy, her own success as an artist.</p>\n<p><i>Lonely Crowds</i> offers up some pointed critiques of the art world — how many artists’ romantic partners act as their patrons, for instance, or how Black artists are converted into trendy tokens. Wambugu’s writing is most astute, however, when depicting the powerful lure of social mobility. It’s the promise of being lifted out from their hardscrabble surrounds that, ironically, first draws the main characters to careers in the arts, which Maria insists can be extraordinarily lucrative if you’re “any good.” As young women, they seem more enamored with the idea of being artists than with making art.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039734/stephanie-wambugu-lonely-crowds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>LONDON — Demonstrating “influence” between artists is a thorny enterprise. Side-by-side comparisons can often reveal how one individual or movement’s technical practice or iconography was taken up and/or further developed by another, furthering art historical progression — yet confirmation bias can underpin curatorial efforts, resulting in an optimistic assertion of direct influence where coincidence may be more at play.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/kiefer-van-gogh\"> Kiefer / Van Gogh</a> at the Royal Academy faces a wholly different challenge: connecting two fundamentally different artists, one of whom professes to be influenced by the other. The show acknowledges the titular artists’ dissimilarity from the outset, with its first caption stating that “Kiefer’s monumental works may not appear to have much in common with van Gogh.” Fundamentally, Kiefer is more a sculptor, articulating enormous-scale impasto patterns and surface texture using straw and other detritus in monochrome sludge occasionally punctuated by gold, while van Gogh is, well, one of the most accomplished and technically individual painters — not to mention colorists — in art history. Kiefer, who was born in Germany just before the end of World War II and grew up in the shadow of the Holocaust, is concerned with the greatest matters of life and death, and is widely recognized by the art establishment. van Gogh’s concerns were smaller in scope and more personal — he made local landscapes and portraits while suffering from debilitating mental illness — and he received no recognition until after his death. And Kiefer’s few tiny line drawings compared to van Gogh’s skilled paintings indicate a significant gulf in draftsmanship capability between the two.</p>\n<p>Though the 80-year-old giant of contemporary art is given equal listing in the title with the 19th-century post-Impressionist legend — the show is supported by White Cube, which happens to be exhibiting the former concurrently — the focus is squarely on the former’s adoration of the latter throughout his 60-year career. The show begins with the first travel grant Kiefer received as a student, which took him throughout the Netherlands, Belgium, Paris and Arles — what curators Julien Domercq and Natasha Fyffe call “following in van Gogh’s footsteps.” Rather than exploring “influence,” though, the exhibition is really about Kiefer, who just happens to really, really like van Gogh. For in the exhibition’s three galleries, the latter is short-changed: The full width of the walls in the first and last are dominated by Kiefer’s monumental pieces, which dwarf the single van Gogh work in each room: 1887’s “Piles of French Novels” and 1886’s “Shoes.”</p>\n<p>The key to understanding “influence,” or more fittingly in the case of Kiefer’s relationship with van Gogh, “affinity” or “inspiration,” is through words more than pictures, particularly the former’s personal interpretations and responses. The caption for van Gogh’s humble shoes, for example, cites the contemporary artist’s thoughts: “This painting of well-worn shoes is for Kiefer a portrait of sorts in their owner’s absence, a relic of journeys past and at the same time a symbol of what is to come.” Again, the grandiosity of Kiefer’s concerns is at odds with the modest immediacy of van Gogh’s subjects, painted from the simple items around him.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the curators make some attempt to link the two via iconography, specifically of the field, though these attempts are either generic or undermined yet again by fundamental differences in their perspectives. “For both artists, a painting of a field is not merely a view, wheat or earth, but is imbued with a deeper meaning,” the exhibition materials state — is this not the case for most artists? Indeed, the text itself admits their differences: “Kiefer believes a landscape also stands as a silent witness of human history, while for van Gogh it was a conduit to express intense feelings and emotions.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036727/anselm-kiefer-van-gogh-royal-academy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Calling Alexa Kumiko Hatanaka’s solo presentation at the Armory Show a “booth” feels somehow wrong, like a reduction of the all-encompassing sanctum that she and Toronto gallery Patel Brown assembled for the Manhattan art fair. Suspended gently from wooden rods are billowing linocut and <i>gyotaku</i> prints on handmade Japanese <i>washi</i> paper in deep indigos and earth tones. In conversations with attendees on the fair’s opening day, Hatanaka shared that she has bipolar disorder, and that her landscapes are informed in part by her research into evolutionary theories for the condition as a form of climactic adaptation.</p>\n<p>Hatanaka, a first timer at the Armory Show, said she was moved and gratified by visitors’ responses. “It’s still quite stigmatized to talk about bipolar, even though there’s more conversation about mental health,” she told me. “I think telling my story has been kind of disarming to people, allowed them to be vulnerable.”</p>\n<p>For all the whispers about the market downturn, gallery closures, and <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032202/as-adaas-art-show-changes-course-a-nonprofit-is-left-in-limbo/\">art fair shake-ups</a>, a crisp air of first-day-of-school excitement cut through the drab halls of the Javits Center during the Armory Show’s VIP preview on Thursday, September 4. Often accompanying the gallerists fielding collectors’ inquiries were the artists themselves, many of them showing for the first time at the modern-day incarnation of the historic exhibition where Marcel<strong> </strong>Duchamp shocked American audiences with his dizzying 1912 “Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2.”</p>\n<p><i>Rumination</i>(2025) by Alexa Kumiko Hatanaka</p>\n<p>“It is a classic, world-famous fair, and it is the ambition of every artist to show there, particularly if you come from Europe … or the edge of Europe, in my case,” said Irish artist Alice Maher, whose drawing “The Glorious Maid (of the Charnel House)” (2016) is displayed in a nook at David Nolan Gallery’s booth of 100 drawings from 1944 to the present. Maher could “hardly believe,” she said, that her work is hanging in the company of such figures as Hannah Wilke, Dorothea Rockburne, Etel Adnan, and Ellsworth Kelly.</p>\n<p>Diagonally across from Patel Brown’s booth is New York’s own Swivel Gallery, where ceramic works by Alejandro García Contreras stopped attendees in their tracks. The Guadalajara-based artist, another newcomer to the Armory, said that though his practice dates back to 2002, he’s glad this moment didn’t come sooner. “In some ways it was complex and discouraging,” García Contreras told me in Spanish, reflecting on his early years, “but it helped me build up the patience not to do something stupid.”</p>\n<p>Though his sculptures today are hyper-detailed, Boschian constructions dripping in symbolism, the artist’s earliest inspiration came from action figures — especially the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles — which, as a child, he didn’t so much play with as study to figure out how they were made.</p>\n<p>“That’s where the origin of my obsession with the sculptural object comes from,” García Contreras said. “Sometimes I think, ‘Wow, when I was a kid, it was my dream to make action figures. And now I’m making collectibles for adults. I’ve made it.’”</p>\n<p>There’s always fresh blood at the Armory, in part thanks to the participation of first-time galleries. The big four (Gagosian, Hauser, Zwirner, Pace) haven’t showed at the fair in years, opting for Frieze (which also owns the Armory Show) and the various Art Basels. But notably absent in the main section this year are other major players, such as Lehmann Maupin, Galerie Lelong (which skipped 2024 too), Almine Rech, and Kasmin (currently <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032581/kasmin-and-clearing-galleries-announce-closures/\">transitioning</a> into a new gallery started by two partners). Younger galleries — some of which <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038050/new-york-art-dealers-get-candid-ahead-of-the-armory-show-2025/\">told  Hyperallergic</a> that they got a last-minute call from Armory Show organizers this year offering them a booth — are eager to step up, and the Presents section, notably dedicated to emerging spaces no more than 10 years old, is slightly larger than in past editions. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039712/armory-show-2025-first-time-artists-steal-the-spotlight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Eduardo Holgado encounters most of his art on Instagram now, perusing posts from galleries and artists before ever setting foot in a fair. But when it comes time to buy, the collector, who is in his early 30s, still needs to experience the work in person. It’s Thursday, September 4, day one of the Armory Show, and Holgado is sipping a sparkling beverage as he walks jauntily down the gallery corridors with his art advisor, Clara Andrade Pereira, who encouraged him to experience the work he admired on social media in person. This hybrid approach of digital discovery paired with in-person verification has become the new normal for many art collectors since the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>Susan Vecsey, 54, literally keeps art at arm’s length — but not for the reasons you might think. Walking through the cavernous fair at the Javits Center, the artist-collector positions herself exactly one arm’s distance from paintings, the locus of her collection, replicating where she imagines the artist stood while creating the work.</p>\n<p>Across this year’s Armory Show, gallery directors are learning how to navigate this tension between digital discovery and physical experience, which is subtly reshaping how artists, collectors, and gallerists interact with one another. Sean Kelly, whose <a href=\"https://www.skny.com/\">gallery</a> has participated in the fair for decades, acknowledged that collectors “do come having done homework online, but info online is a partial picture.” </p>\n<p>The challenge, he told <i>Hyperallergic</i>, is “reaching out of the computer and phone and moving people to feel there is some kind of reality.” This shift toward more deliberate engagement is reflected in purchasing patterns: “Anything over $1 million is extremely slow,” Kelly observed. “Anything under $200k, people are much more comfortable making decisions.”</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>International dynamics further complicate the landscape. Sébastien Janssen of <a href=\"http://www.sorrywereclosed.com/en/gallery/presentation/0/sorry-we-re-closed\">Sorry We’re Closed</a>, discussing the impact on global tensions under the Trump administration, notes the effects on <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielwebber/2025/04/24/trumps-tariffs-create-new-opportunities-for-cross-border-payments/\">cross-border payments</a> for East Asian clients.</p>\n<p>“Many Chinese collectors disappeared because it’s more difficult to send money outside the country, but they are still there and will come back,” Janssen said. His Brussels-based gallery has adapted by strengthening relationships with American collectors, whom he described as “faster and happy to buy” compared to Europeans. Despite the challenges, Janssen maintains a philosophical approach to sales: “Every sale is a miracle,” he noted, explaining that he sold works to European and Hong Kong collectors before the fair opened, including one piece he says went for $290,000.</p>\n<p>This pattern seems to hold across regions. At the booth of Buenos Aires-based <a href=\"https://store.praxis-art.com/\">Praxis</a> gallery, Director Carolina Constantino opined that Argentinian collectors “are more like Europeans — slower and deliberate,” while “Americans are quick” in their decision-making. </p>\n<p>To accommodate changing collector needs, galleries are experimenting with new approaches: Praxis offers installment payment plans and brings works directly to collectors’ homes to stage them in situ. Cierra Britton told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that her nomadic <a href=\"https://cierrabritton.com/\">New York gallery model</a> allows collectors to experience curated presentations, with buyers willing to travel significant distances for pop-up shows.</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>Beyond pricing and payment strategies, many collectors want to see themselves reflected in the work they buy. Britton, whose itinerant gallery focuses on artists who are women of color, said that many of her buyers are collectors of color. “I am not a response to BLM,” she said. “I was born Black.” She explained that while people initially bought work “in solidarity with social justice” in 2022 when she opened, her approach sustains collector interest by showing diverse work by Black artists. Britton observes that “Black figurative work is often treated as a trend” in contrast to abstract work by Black artists — a double standard that reduces complex artistic practices to identity markers.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039842/how-new-collector-habits-are-shaking-up-art-fair-season-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Am I right?</p>\n<p>So in this post I want to share with you how I whipped that whole situation into shape and how easy it was. Now, it’s smelling like the Mandarin Oriental and is totally dialed in, no matter what goes on in there.</p>\n<p>The thing is, I want to love every detail of my house. My life and work is so chatoic that when I’m at home I want to feel relaxed and zen and peaceful. So every.little.thing. matters.

You do this by making the best <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/homemade-cinnamon-spice-potpourri/\">homemade potpourri</a>. My stepmom taught me this and all you do is take a small pot, fill it with water, orange slices and cinnamon sticks and let it simmer.</p>\n<p>It’s easy, non-toxic and sets the best vibe throughout your whole house. A little better for winter/cozy weather but works all year around, really.</p>\n<p>We can’t forget about the actual toilet. <a href=\"https://bit.ly/480MvK0\">Poo~Pourri</a> should be in every single bathroom in the world.</p>\n<p>You basically just spritz it into the toilet bowl before-you-go. The spray is a pure blend of NATURAL ESSENTIAL OILS that creates a film on the surface of the water.</p>\n<p>The protective barrier traps the bad odors under the surface, before it ever begins! I MEAN!!! All you’ll smell is a refreshing bouquet of natural essential oils. I love preventative measure.</p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/non-toxic-candle-667x1000.jpg\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>This is my favorite brand of <a href=\"https://branchbasics.com/collections/all#starter-kits\">cleaning products</a> (use code SKINNY for 15% off) because they’re all natural and you need to make sure your bathroom is clean to make it smell good.</p>\n<p>The brand is family-owned and all their products are non-toxic.

    "body": "<p>You may have seen peaks of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOHOHAQkgHY/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\">Bond’s nursery on Instagram</a>, or already seen <a href=\"https://thechalkboardmag.com/lauryn-bosstick-nursery-david-samuel-ko/\">The Chalkboard</a> article that went up the other day. Either way I’m so excited to give you the full tour of Bond’s nursery.</p>\n<p>We decided to work with David Ko of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/maison.ko/\">Maison Ko</a> and we’re so thrilled with the results, I can’t even put it into words. It’s perfect.</p>\n<p>David was such a pleasure to work with. He totally executed my vision and understood that although it’s a nursery, it’s also a room that Bond can grow into. Overall the vibe was texture, depth, neutral but rich color with interesting touches to make the room unique.</p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://liketk.it/5mDYz\">shop the whole nursery look here</a> and in the meantime, read on to learn about the whole process and the details that brought the vision together.</p>\n<h2>Step Inside Bond’s Nursery</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>What was the first piece or idea that kicked off the whole vision for the nursery?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>DK</strong>: The idea that really laid the groundwork for Bond’s nursery was doing some sort of mural wall treatment. At first, we were looking into hiring an artist to do a custom hand-painted mural, but then we came across this wallpaper and knew it was the one. We wanted it to feel moody, yet still a touch whimsical—something that Bond could grow into and not feel permanently newborn. The colors in the wallpaper really inspired the rest of the room and led the overall direction.</p>\n<p><strong>LB:</strong> The vision of baby Bond’s nursery was to incorporate texture, <a href=\"https://www.glamora.it/en/product/GLX38\">artistic wallpaper</a>, but without feeling too thematic. The room had to have depth with calming and soothing energy for the baby. Simply stepping into the room is an experience, and along with functional, unique details, meditation chimes, and red lights, David worked with me to execute our vision perfectly. </p>\n<p>We focused on texture and richness with deep shades of evergreen and chocolate brown. I didn’t want it to feel beige and muted—opposite, actually. I also wanted the nursery to tell a story, so many elements are personalized: from specific books, to Michael’s silver baby rattle, to pictures and details.</p>\n<p>Bringing in the baby element was obviously important, but I challenged David and his team to do something you don’t see on Instagram all the time. For example, <a href=\"https://rh.com/us/en/\">the darker crib</a> (<a href=\"https://bit.ly/45Mbe3j\">lighter version here</a>) feels masculine, yet there’s still a baby-esque aura.</p>\n<p>Also, I am huge on <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3vfmQfL\">organization</a>—each drawer, closet area, and shelf is efficiently organized with thought and purpose so that when the baby arrived, everything was streamlined.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>What did you want this nursery to </strong>\n      <i>feel</i>\n      <strong> like—for you, for the baby, and for your family?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>DK:</strong> When we started working together, all Lauryn told me was that she didn’t want it to feel like a typical beige nursery. She wanted it to feel elevated yet approachable, suited for a newborn, but not overly trendy or something you’ve seen a thousand times. Lauryn wanted it to be a space that felt unique and truly special for Bond.</p>\n<p><strong>LB:</strong> Along with our home being a place where we can all recharge, each child is unique and deserves their own space that reflects their essence. My daughter’s room is sort of a pinkish-lilac and white, and my son’s room is very much a rock ‘n roll vibe. The new baby also needs his own moment and David and his team really helped us to achieve Bond’s essence.</p>\n<p>It brings me joy to create spaces for children to relax their nervous system. My Mom did it for me by sewing curtains and duvet covers and making my room specifically tailored to me. I remember loving to be in my room and feeling comforted in my bedroom. So creating that for my own kids is a priority. It’s funny, my Dad walked into the baby’s nursery the other day and said, “Your Mom was just like this with you and your sister, Faye.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/step-inside-bonds-nursery/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Between the gorgeous <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/homemade-cinnamon-spice-potpourri/\">fall scents</a> to the upcoming time with your family it’s maybe the best season of the year.</p>\n<p>And fall fashion? We’re here for it.<br/>One thing we’re NOT so pumped for though, is seasonal skin changes.<br/>It’s that time of year when the air outside gets cooler and drier, and our skincare routines need some modification to keep up with the environment. Because drier air = drier, duller skin. </p>\n<p>So how best to keep your skin bouncy and beautiful year-round?<br/>As always, we’ve looked into it for you. We’ve got all the info you need to keep your skin glowing and healthy all year long.</p>\n<h2>6 Créme de la Créme Fall Skin Care Tips</h2>\n<p>To get the most out of your fall skincare routine, you’ve got to know how the changes in weather actually affect your skin. You don’t want to overdo it, after all—if you’re moving all the way from light skincare to <a href=\"https://health.clevelandclinic.org/slugging\">slugging</a>, but your face is only slightly more dry than in the summer, you might end up with a completely different problem. That’s not the move.</p>\n<p>Everyone’s skin is different, and many of us are dealing with different types of weather changes. So, before we get into what to do about your seasonal skin change, let’s talk about what that change actually looks like for you.</p>\n<h3>How Does Cold Weather Affect Skin?</h3>\n<p>The biggest thing affecting your skin as the seasons change is the humidity. As the weather gets cooler, humidity levels tend to drop as well.</p>\n<p>While this can be amazing for those of us whose hair tends to change styles in the humidity, it can also dry out our skin, leaving our summer skincare struggling to keep up. <a href=\"https://www.aad.org/news/cold-weather-and-your-skin#:~:text=Due%20to%20the%20drop%20in,healthy%20during%20the%20colder%20months.\">Dry, cold air can also make fine lines and wrinkles more noticeable</a>.</p>\n<p>But, it’s not just the air outside that’s stealing all your hydration—it’s the air inside, too. When you turn on the heat or kindle an indoor fire, the indoor moisture is sucked out of the air as well. So even when you get inside, your skin may still be suffering.</p>\n<p>Don’t sweat it. We’ve got the ideas you need to stay hydrated and baby soft this fall and winter.</p>\n<h3>Here’s Exactly How To Take Care Of Your Skin In The Fall</h3>\n<p>The first thing you can do to combat the dry air for your skin is to LITERALLY combat the dry air. Put some humidity back into your life. Your skin will thank you.</p>\n<p>Lauryn’s so obsessed with this humidifier, she actually designed <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/the-dreamy-humidifier-of-your-dreams-has-launched-and-its-by-the-skinny-confidential/\">her own</a>. It was limited edition but you can still get the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4fTCGhL\">bedside humidifier</a> AND a <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3GmEUYl\">TSC aroma diffuser</a> from the Canopy, and they really work.</p>\n<p>As the air gets drier both inside and out, we need to boost our skincare products to add and lock in moisture.</p>\n<p>Let’s start at the beginning: You’ll need a fragrance-free cleanser, like <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3AKPQig\">this one Lauryn loves</a>, that gently removes makeup and environmental residue from your face. </p>\n<p>It’s a good idea to get fragrance-free body wash as well. Even if your skin type isn’t sensitive, you’ll have more sensitive skin in the fall/winter. Fragrances and <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/the-best-beauty-products-for-senstive-skin/\">sensitive skin</a> do NOT get along.</p>\n<p>After cleansing, follow your normal skin care routine, but consider swapping out your products for more hydrating versions. You’ll want to look for products with humectants like hyaluronic acid and glycerin. This <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3Of3XPV\">Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream</a> has both.</p>\n<p>Reducing the frequency of treatments that dry your skin can help prevent weather-related irritation, as well as swapping light lotions for heavier creams.</p>\n<p>As ALWAYS, you’ll need to protect your skin from sun damage by using a product with at least SPF 30.<br/>HOT TIP: The best sunscreen on the block is the <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/sunscreen?selling_plan=1819443293\">Caffeinated Sunscreen</a> from TSC. It’s SPF 40, caffeinated, and super nourishing.</p>\n<p>For a super moisturizing skin care routine, check out Lauryn’s <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/my-exact-korean-skincare-routine-and-why-i-love-it/\">Korean skincare routine</a> or her <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/my-updated-skincare-routine/\">go-to routine</a> that she always updates.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/fall-skin-care-tips/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>This post may contain affiliate links and Corporette® may earn commissions for purchases made through links in this post. As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.</p>\n<p>I am so curious about this hydrating gloss stain from NYX, and just need to pick a color to try. A few years ago I randomly had a lip gloss like this from Sephora's brand — it applied like a gloss, but once it wore off was a really pretty stain, and my lips were actually hydrated. They, of course, discontinued the product, and I was so sad.</p>\n<p>The hydrating gloss stain that I loved had one problem, though: it was a really garish raspberry pink, which felt like a lot of look on a regular day. So I'm thrilled to see that the NYX stain looks like it has a lot more muted colors.</p>\n<p>Ulta first brought me to color “Bubblegum Burst,” pictured here — and I do think that would be my first pick after looking at the swatches on the arm. “Drippin in Rose” also looks great, as does “Hydra-Honey” if you want a much more subtle MLBB look.</p>\n<p>The gloss stain is $12 at Ulta, but keep an eye out at drugstores near you. Of the 1,200+ reviews, 788 are 5-star reviews — even the lower-starred reviews like the hydration (but not the saturated color).</p>\n<p>Did anyone read the surrogacy article in Wired? It was…cray. I don’t even have more words to describe it right now. I’ve been against surrogacy for a long time for ethical reasons and it still affected me.</p>\n<p>Its not “one woman” she may be an extreme example but its pretty common for people to be abusive and predatory towards surrogates. The power imbalance of rich people renting poor people naturally results in this.</p>\n<p>Agreed. And any situation where two people have an interest (especially a legally cognizable interest(!!!)) in one person’s body is asking for trouble.</p>\n<p>Tell me you haven’t lived in Silicon Valley without telling me you haven’t lived in Silicon Valley. This woman’s personality type is soooo common there.</p>\n<p>I’ll never forget reading an article about a rich CA couple that hired a Ukrainian surrogate, made her get a preterm induction when the war started, made her own husband drive the fragile newborn and the American couple over the border (against medical advice), and then left, just like that. Used and abused.</p>\n<p>Agreed, not when response articles are saying things like “who should have control over the carrier’s body if something goes wrong?” So chilling.</p>\n<p>Oh my god. Bi’s behavior is absolutely horrific. Like you I have very serious ethical qualms about surrogacy and this is just a tragic illustration of all the reasons why. Just awful.</p>\n<p>Well that was more bananas than the Elizabeth Gilbert article and the kind of thing that keeps me coming back here.</p>\n<p>I had no idea surrogacy was such a grey area but was supportive for situations like same sex male couples or when the woman physically can’t carry a child due to medical reasons (thinking of Senator Duckworth). I’m deeply uncomfortable with it now.</p>\n<p>Same. It’s not less awful if you are sympathetic to the identity of the IPs. And the IPs stories can be sad and tragic and yet that doesn’t let you get the privilege to be like Bi.</p>\n<p>Even if you were dealing with the cleanest-living family member as a GC, it is amazing that IPs expect to be able to demand stuff beyond The Handmaid’s Tale with no consequences.</p>\n<p>I didn’t know about the increased complication rate. That one poor woman now has no further ability to have children. There is a new fertility clinic by me that is full of very shiny happy people and I’m curious about how it is if you scratch the surface just a little bit</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://corporette.com/nyx-lip-iv-hydrating-gloss-stain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>This post may contain affiliate links and Corporette® may earn commissions for purchases made through links in this post. As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.</p>\n<p>I was thinking, how I'm always amused to stumble on older pieces that we've featured here on Corporette® … sometimes they still look good, or I remember liking them. Other times, the styling or the featured piece of clothing is just… fug.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I started thinking… it might be fun to share some previously featured pictures with you guys, and discuss — would you wear these items today? If so, how would you style them in 2025? If you've replaced items like this in your closet, what are you wearing instead of them?</p>\n<p>First up, some of the things we featured on September 8 over the years… because we have only ever posted during the workweek, any years where 9/8 fell on a weekend won't have content.</p>\n<p>I had a pair of shoes almost identical to this that I wore everywhere because they were so comfortable (except I think mine were wedges, ha). Looking back, why yes, I can see how fug. Commenters at the time (all 3 of them) were bored by the menswear detailing.</p>\n<p>(Note that this was also before we started the afternoon post, so we still featured shoes in the morning…)</p>\n<p>The price was pretty good, though: they were $75, marked to $13, at La Redoute (which readers were mentioning recently for their bedding, if I remember correctly).</p>\n<p>Say what you will about my shoe choices (which, admittedly, readers have said a lot over the years) — but I am consistent. (I have narrow heels so I walk out of a lot of regular pumps!)</p>\n<p>These Pour la Victoire heels were our pick of the day for Sept. 9, 2009 — and they were $189 at Endless.com, which was a competitor with Zappos (and possibly owned by the Gap family of brands?).</p>\n<p>2010: Short Belted Wool Jacket</p>\n<p>We featured this Burberry belted wool jacket in 2010, and I still love this one — the color, the shawl collar, the shrunken fit. The belt I'm less excited about, but we belted everything back then. (Remember the trend of wearing multiple skinny belts? Just me? Ok then.)</p>\n<p>Awww, my first maternity leave. This pick was from our guest poster, Becki of Shopping's My Cardio — she was a lawyer at the time, although I think she eventually left the law to pursue other projects.</p>\n<p>(I don't know if this was apparent at the time — half of the guest posters I only knew through their blogs, aside from my good friend Auntie M (who just guest-posted over at CorporetteMoms and I was just texting with this morning). In many cases with the potential guest posters, I reached out cold to ask if they would guest post — and I was thrilled when so many great people said yes.)</p>\n<p>(We did another round of guest posters when my second son was born, but ultimately stopped allowing guest posters in general because my email was getting deluged with poorly-disguised efforts from companies who only wanted text links and basically ads-as-content. If any actual readers would be interested in guest posting, we'd love to have you.)</p>\n<p>Not in a million years would I normally suggest Bebe for anything, really, much less work-ready fashion. But this jacquard pencil skirt is exactly what I’m after this season. Printed pants are all the rage, but they’re tricky to pull off, especially at the office. This print is subtle with substance, the silhouette is as classic as it gets, and the navy/black palette can’t help but be closet-friendly. Pair it with mushroom, pink, or a rich emerald green, and you’ll have an unexpected wardrobe workhorse. This is also a great piece to use for your first pattern-mixing attempt. Add a zigzag or a tribal print in the same color family, and you’re instantly a trendsetter.</p>\n<p>Commenters wondered why the model wasn't wearing a shirt.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://corporette.com/blast-from-the-past-september-8/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Here at <a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/\">Travel Off Path</a>, we’ve been analyzing the latest travel data, and one island nation is consistently delivering incredible value, officially making it the cheapest and smartest choice for a fall beach trip this year.</p><p>That destination is the <strong>Dominican Republic</strong>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic-1024x1024.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Aerial view of Bavaro Beach, Punta Cana, Dominican Republic\" class=\"wp-image-202114 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic-1024x1024.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic-300x300.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic-150x150.jpg.webp 150w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic-768x768.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic-728x728.jpg.webp 728w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic-960x960.jpg.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic-1080x1080.jpg.webp 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic.jpg.webp 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-2\" loading=\"lazy\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p><graphic src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic-1024x1024.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Aerial view of Bavaro Beach, Punta Cana, Dominican Republic\"/><h3><strong>✈️ Why The Flights Are So Cheap</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting to paradise is half the battle, and this is where the Dominican Republic has a massive advantage. The sheer volume of flights from the U.S. means fierce competition, and that competition drives prices way down. Budget carriers like <strong>Spirit</strong> and <strong>Frontier</strong> have a huge presence here, forcing major airlines to compete on price.</p><p>The result? You can find incredible deals. We’re seeing nonstop, roundtrip flights to <strong>Punta Cana (PUJ)</strong> this fall from hubs like <strong>Fort Lauderdale (FLL)</strong> and <strong>Orlando (MCO)</strong> for as low as <strong>$250</strong>. Even from major northern cities like <strong>New York (JFK)</strong> and <strong>Newark (EWR)</strong>, deals can often be found for under $400. It’s one of the most accessible and affordable Caribbean islands to fly to from the U.S.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic-1024x1024.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Aerial View Of A Coastal Area In Punta Cana, Caribbean Sea, Dominican Republic\" class=\"wp-image-201056 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic-1024x1024.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic-300x300.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic-150x150.jpg.webp 150w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic-768x768.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic-728x728.jpg.webp 728w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic-960x960.jpg.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic-1080x1080.jpg.webp 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic.jpg.webp 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-3\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p><graphic src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic-1024x1024.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Aerial View Of A Coastal Area In Punta Cana, Caribbean Sea, Dominican Republic\"/><h3><strong>🏨 The All-Inclusive Is King</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the Dominican Republic’s superpower. The island is the undisputed king of the affordable all-inclusive resort. Because there are so many amazing properties competing for your business, you can find luxury experiences for a fraction of what you’d pay on other islands.</p><p>Fall is the shoulder season—the sweet spot between the summer rush and the peak winter crowds—which means the deals get even better. You can regularly find 4-star, all-inclusive resorts right on the stunning beaches of <a href=\"https://www.hotels.com/affiliate/lbFFOCH\">Punta Cana for  under $150 a night</a>. That means your room, all your meals, all your drinks, and your entertainment are covered. It’s a level of value that is almost impossible to beat anywhere else in the Caribbean.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/White-Sand-Beach-DR.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"761\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/White-Sand-Beach-DR-1024x761.jpg.webp\" alt=\"White Sand Beach DR\" class=\"wp-image-215022 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/White-Sand-Beach-DR-1024x761.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/White-Sand-Beach-DR-300x223.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/White-Sand-Beach-DR-768x571.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/White-Sand-Beach-DR-960x713.jpg.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/White-Sand-Beach-DR-1080x803.jpg.webp 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/White-Sand-Beach-DR-1200x892.jpg.webp 1200w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/White-Sand-Beach-DR.jpg.webp 1740w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/White-Sand-Beach-DR.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-4\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p><graphic src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/White-Sand-Beach-DR-1024x761.jpg.webp\" alt=\"White Sand Beach DR\"/><h3><strong>🌴 Free &amp; Affordable Fun</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best things to do in the Dominican Republic doesn’t cost a penny: relaxing on its world-class beaches. Punta Cana is lined with miles of pristine, public-access white sand beaches where you can soak up the sun for free.</p><p>But it’s not just about the beach. For a dose of culture, you can take an affordable bus trip to the capital, <strong> Santo Domingo</strong>, and explore the historic </p><p><strong>, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Wander the cobblestone streets, see the first cathedral of the Americas, and enjoy a delicious, authentic Dominican lunch at a local spot for under $10.</strong></p><a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/es/list/526\">Zona Colonial</a><p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic-1024x1024.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Colonial Square In Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic\" class=\"wp-image-214326 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic-1024x1024.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic-300x300.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic-150x150.jpg.webp 150w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic-768x768.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic-728x728.jpg.webp 728w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic-960x960.jpg.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic-1080x1080.jpg.webp 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic.jpg.webp 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-5\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p><graphic src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic-1024x1024.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Colonial Square In Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic\"/><h3><strong>☀️ The Perfect Fall Weather</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re chasing that endless summer feeling, the Dominican Republic delivers. By October and November, the main rainy season is over, and the hurricane risk drops significantly. You’re left with idyllic weather: sunny skies, daytime temperatures in the mid-80s, and warm, turquoise water that’s perfect for swimming. It’s the ideal time to visit before the high-season crowds (and prices) arrive for the holidays.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tropical-beach-In-the-Dominican-Republic.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tropical-beach-In-the-Dominican-Republic-1024x667.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Tropical beach In the Dominican Republic\" class=\"wp-image-215023 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tropical-beach-In-the-Dominican-Republic-1024x667.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tropical-beach-In-the-Dominican-Republic-300x195.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tropical-beach-In-the-Dominican-Republic-768x500.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tropical-beach-In-the-Dominican-Republic-960x625.jpg.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tropical-beach-In-the-Dominican-Republic-1080x704.jpg.webp 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tropical-beach-In-the-Dominican-Republic-1200x782.jpg.webp 1200w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tropical-beach-In-the-Dominican-Republic.jpg.webp 1948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tropical-beach-In-the-Dominican-Republic.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-6\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p><graphic src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tropical-beach-In-the-Dominican-Republic-1024x667.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Tropical beach In the Dominican Republic\"/><p>Before you book your amazing and affordable fall adventure, be sure to run our essential <a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/with-dozens-of-new-travel-rules-this-1-minute-check-is-now-essential-for-every-traveler/\"> 1 Minute Trip Check</a> to get the </p><p><strong>latest entry requirements and travel advisories</strong>for your destination.</p><p>Happy Fall Travels!</p><p><strong>The Travel Off Path Advantage: Your Travel Toolkit</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/with-dozens-of-new-travel-rules-this-1-minute-check-is-now-essential-for-every-traveler/\">\n                \n                    \n                \n            \n            </a></p><h3>The 1-Minute Trip Check</h3><p>Our flagship tool.

    "body": "<p>In the international queer community, Arewà Basit is known as a dancing, singing don-diva who makes music, performs in drag, and co-leads the Black queer production organization <a href=\"https://www.legacy-bqpc.com/\">Legacy</a>. These days, she’s also <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1029808/amy-sherald-cancels-smithsonian-show-citing-censorship-of-trans-artwork/\">making headlines</a> for being the subject of a “controversial” artwork by Amy Sherald. The controversy in question: a painting depicting her as the Statue of Liberty in a pink bob. In July, Sherald <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037072/amy-sherald-speaks-out-on-cancelling-her-smithsonian-show/\">pulled her exhibition</a> <i>American Sublime</i> from the National Portrait Gallery (NPG) in Washington, DC, over concerns that the institution would censor her painting of Arewà. Amid the nation’s descent into fascism, “Trans Forming Liberty” (2024) calls into question whether institutions represent the state or the people — and whether they’ll ever learn from their past.</p>\n<p>The Dallas-born musician, performer, and artist is no stranger to adversity. In an interview with <i>Hyperallergic</i>, Arewà explained that teachers often labeled her as unruly and disruptive for her “larger-than-life personality” and “ambition to entertain and to express.”</p>\n<p>“Being a queer kid in Texas, I was often reprimanded for just existing,” Arewà recalled. “I was disciplined for being too effeminate, for getting attention that my family or people thought was unwarranted.”</p>\n<p>That same repressive impulse may have influenced the NPG to allegedly consider excluding Sherald’s portrait of Arewà from the show. (A representative for the Smithsonian Institution previously told<a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1029808/amy-sherald-cancels-smithsonian-show-citing-censorship-of-trans-artwork/\">  Hyperallergic</a></p>\n<p>\n      <i>that it “could not come to an agreement with the artist.”) Days after Sherald withdrew her exhibition, “Trans Forming Liberty” graced the cover of the</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1031893/amy-sherald-trans-lady-liberty-painting-graces-new-yorker-cover/\">; on August 21, the White House included the painting on a</a>\n    </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036180/trump-targets-lgbtq-history-migrants-and-more-in-chilling-smithsonian-hit-list/\">hit list</a>targeting 26 artworks and shows depicting queer, trans, and migrant experiences as tools of so-called “divisive narratives.”</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>Arewà recognized that the virality of this story speaks volumes about the <a href=\"https://www.them.us/story/texas-trans-bathroom-bill-sb8-passes-house\">blatant</a> <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/sex-education-gender-curriculum-6cc8e3142b566260dd9af82a0b24ecc2\">attacks</a> on trans people across the country and the ways they are often sensationalized in the media and that “the narrative of being visible as a Black, queer trans individual has never been more complex.”</p>\n<p>“America likes to tell Black people what kind of a Black person they think they should be,” she said. “I think this country was gonna have an issue with a Black trans person being in the same museum as all of the presidents.”</p>\n<p>Arewà first gained mainstream recognition in 2019 after joining the first all-queer cast of the dating show <i>Are You the One?</i>. Though she balked at the performative aspects of reality TV, she knew her presence would make an impact on young trans people who don’t get to see themselves on screen — particularly in a media ecosystem that chews up Black trans femmes, capitalizes on them, and spits them out. She sings about this experience on her EP <i>Archive</i>, which drops on November 11, drawing from a performance she gave on Fire Island, a queer getaway known for being overwhelmingly <a href=\"https://www.intomore.com/entertainment/music/staying-on-fire-island-as-a-queer-person-of-color/\">White and cis</a>. Like many of her trans sisters, she felt loved and embraced during the day and discarded by night.</p>\n<p>“The people who told me I was special were most often Black people,” Arewà said, reflecting on the role models who shaped her upbringing. “And so I learned from an early age that the only thing that was gonna protect what makes me special is to embrace it.”</p>\n<p>Arewà drew a comparison between the scrutiny of her portrait and historical reactions to other muses and models, namely the socialite Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau in John Singer Sargent’s <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/goings-on/john-singer-sargents-scandalous-madame-x\">infamous</a> “Madame X” (1884), which scandalized the public and art critics upon its debut at the Paris Salon.</p>\n<p>The painting, Arewà explained, was the original reference for “Trans Forming Liberty,” which she was chosen to model for after Sherald put out a casting call for a Black drag artist. “What she found was a video of me performing ‘I Can’t Stand the Rain’ by Ann Peebles,” Arewà commented.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037302/arewa-basit-amy-sherald-portrait-alchemizing-trans-joy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>AMSTERDAM — Whenever I encounter artworks or architecture from the so-called “Dutch Golden Age,” perhaps more accurately known as its colonial period — a daily occurrence since my relocation to the Netherlands last year — I’m reminded of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/25/magazine/vermeer-beauty-brutality.html\">Teju Cole’s reevaluation of Vermeer’s paintings</a> as “an artifact inescapably involved in the world’s messiness.” Cole argues that the nation’s history of violent extraction and global oppression during that era, notably its instrumental role in the slave trade, suffuses Vermeer’s seemingly innocent scenes of a milkmaid or a woman in a pearl necklace. Works that use ultramarine paint made from lapis lazuli, or portraits depicting something as benign as silvery cutlery, abstract the vicious methods that produce such wares. The paint was likely sourced from a 17th-century Afghan mine, while the precious metal probably came from the brutal Potosí silver excavation in Bolivia — both items available due to the Dutch East and West India Company’s key role in capitalist exploitation. That’s to say nothing about the country’s active involvement in the transatlantic slave trade, trafficking 1.6 million enslaved people over two centuries and abetting the largest forced migration in history. </p>\n    <p>These facts came to mind when I encountered Kimsooja’s delicate <i>bottari</i>, or traditional Korean textile bundles of cherished objects carried during travel, dotting the floor of the Oude Kerk (Old Church), Amsterdam’s oldest building-turned-contemporary art institution, as the city celebrates its 750th anniversary. Built 300 years before the Dutch colonial period, the church expanded into its current iteration in 1570, 30 years before the Dutch East India Company prepared to embark on a campaign that would establish Amsterdam as an economic powerhouse through proto-capitalist means. “The church could exist, flourish, and expand partly thanks to the proceeds of the major trading companies in the Golden Age,” reads <a href=\"https://oudekerk.nl/en/about-the-oude-kerk\">the church’s About Us page</a> on their website, adding that some names and coats of arms “immortalized” in the building were part of that exploitation. Though it does not explicitly state this intention in exhibition materials, with its injection of Kimsooja’s quietly disruptive bottari, a form central to her four-decade practice, <i> To Breathe — Mokum</i>, accidentally or not, illuminates Dutch colonial history and skewers contemporary right-wing attitudes around diversity and migration that resist multiculturalism in favor of a dominant cultural or national identity. The name of the exhibition derives from the Yiddish word </p>\n    <p><i>mokum</i>, meaning “city” or “safe haven,” contradicting the</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0r1x5yyd5wo\">recently dissolved Dutch government</a>, whose anti-immigration party attempted to freeze asylum applications and limit family reunification, among other far-right measures.</p>\n    <p>Bottari only partially make up the site-specific exhibition. Each bundle is filled with donated clothing from Amsterdam’s various cultural communities, while the wrapping cloths themselves range from West African wax prints to not-as-easily-identifiable linens. Diffraction grating film serves as the exhibition’s other chief element. Pasted over 44,000 of the church’s imposing window panes, the iridescent film refracts ever-shifting sunlight into a shattering pool of color. Multicolor light swaddles the delicate bottari, wresting attention away from the church’s monumental, gilded organ or ancient stone graves that tile the floor, toward sacks filled with migration histories, reveling in the glory of diversity inextricably woven into and held within a discrete, formalized object. Look up to take in the grand architecture, and you might trip on a bottari or find yourself distracted by a rainbow — a visceral reminder that this seemingly beautiful paean to the Dutch national project might be more subversive than its exhibition materials suggest. Like Vermeer’s milkmaids, these bottari are inextricable from their contemporary world, one in which increasingly nativist governments seek to sanitize the past and censor the present.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3523-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3513-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <i>Kimsooja: To Breathe — Mokum at Oude Kerk</i>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3124-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <i>Kimsooja: To Breathe — Mokum at Oude Kerk</i>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3512-1200x1566.jpg?resize=1200%2C1566&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_9355-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <i>Kimsooja: To Breathe — Mokum at Oude Kerk</i>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_9359-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3503-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <i>Kimsooja: To Breathe — Mokum at Oude Kerk</i>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3191-1200x1616.jpg?resize=1200%2C1616&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <i>Kimsooja: To Breathe — Mokum at Oude Kerk</i>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3195-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3530-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <i>Kimsooja: To Breathe — Mokum at Oude Kerk</i>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3515-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_9352-1200x1531.jpg?resize=1200%2C1531&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <i>Kimsooja: To Breathe — Mokum at Oude Kerk</i>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3507-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3504-1200x1629.jpg?resize=1200%2C1629&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <i>Kimsooja: To Breathe — Mokum at Oude Kerk</i>\n    </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://oudekerk.nl/en/whats-on/exhibitions/kimsooja/37745\">Kimsooja: To Breathe – Mokum</a> <i>continues at Oede Kerk (Oudekerksplein 23, Amsterdam, Netherlands) through November 9.

It would be a catastrophe otherwise.”</p>\n<p>The sweeping array of <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/988525/how-will-trump-tariffs-affect-art-supplies-in-the-us/\">emergency tariffs</a> that Trump imposed on foreign trade in April has injected a new level of uncertainty during one of the art world’s busiest sale seasons. </p>\n<p>Artworks have largely been exempt from the new duties because they are generally categorized as cultural and <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/31/560.210\">informational materials</a>, along with photographs, posters, publications, and other media, in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. </p>\n<p>But several international galleries at last week’s fairs faced <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1012630/artists-brace-for-high-production-costs-amid-tariffs-chaos/\">unanticipated costs</a> from reciprocal levies depending on the type of object they shipped and what method they used to send them, not to mention jittery American buyers reluctant to fork over additional fees. </p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>Southern Guild, a Cape Town-based gallery featuring African contemporary artists, paid a 30% duty on a unique designer table and a 10% levy on a ceramic vessel, while other works in the booth escaped without a tithe. Southern Guild founder Trevyn McGowan held shipping and tax meetings with her staff for one hour per day and still received a customs bill that was $20,000 higher than she had expected.</p>\n<p>“This country is psychotic,” she said. “How can you do this to collectors? We’re trying to develop this fantastic exchange between cultures and hemispheres and bring American artists to Africa and bring African artists to the West.”</p>\n<p>Other galleries also absorbed new taxes on furniture, ceramics, and pieces less easily characterized as artworks than paintings and prints. SMAC Gallery, another Cape Town art space, had to pay a 15% fee on a small wooden table and two matching chairs they specifically had made for their exhibition booth.</p>\n<p>“People said, ‘Why didn’t you just declare something else?’ but we didn’t want to take any chances of it being held up in customs, and the fines are astronomical,” said Jean Butler, SMAC’s managing director.</p>\n<p>Some European galleries that did not have to pay duties still needed to reassure buyers that their purchases would not come with hidden charges. Astrid Engström, business director for the London and Baku-based Gazelli Art House, believed that widespread anxiety over tariff policy has dampened sales this year.</p>\n<p>“Buyers think that there are tariffs, and we were struggling to sell to US clients, but once we were here at the fair with the imported works, that worry was off the table,” Engström told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. </p>\n<p>Even United States galleries have not escaped Trump’s trade wars. Yancey Richardson had to put a major sale at her Chelsea photography gallery on hold this year because a Canadian museum was afraid its government would impose a 25% duty on the purchase. Unlike the US, Canadian tariffs apply to both artworks and photographs.</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>But artworks that faced the most scrutiny from customs officers were imported from China. Gallery reps with Tang Contemporary Art, which has eight outposts across East Asia and had a large booth at the Armory Show with several paintings, ceramic sculptures, and Ai Weiwei photographs, expected to encounter tariffs on Chinese works sold at the fair, but did not know what the customs rate would be.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040245/trump-tariffs-send-shockwaves-through-the-art-world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>LOS ANGELES — Last Thursday, September 4, the Holocaust Museum LA posted a message on Instagram that was widely interpreted as a denunciation of Israel’s ongoing <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cde3eyzdr63o\">genocide</a> in Gaza, which has been <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/07/israel-opt-israeli-organizations-conclude-israel-committing-genocide-against-palestinians-in-gaza-in-another-milestone-for-accountability-efforts/\">characterized</a> as such by human rights organizations around the world. The first slide featured a drawing of a hexagon formed by six linked arms — various shades of brown and tan, the lightest one bearing a holocaust prisoner number tattoo — with the words “‘Never Again’ Can’t Only Mean Never Again For Jews.” </p>\n<p>Two days later, the museum deleted the post and published <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DORTyTbgZ6v/\">an apology</a>. Unlike the first Instagram post, for this one, the museum blocked commenters from weighing in. </p>\n<p>The Holocaust Museum LA, founded in 1961 by Holocaust survivors, is the oldest museum of its kind in the country. Its “Never Again” post — the first such statement from the institution — garnered more than 2,700 likes and 3,300 comments. The text continued on four slides: “Jews Must Not Let the Trauma of our Past Silence our Conscience. Standing with Humanity does Not Betray Our People. It Honors Them. To Be Jewish is to Remember And to Act.”</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>via Instagram)</p>\n<p>Although the post didn’t mention Gaza, Israel, or Palestine, most commenters understood it as a rebuke of Israel’s military assault on Gaza, which has killed <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/palestinian-death-toll-in-gaza-passes-64000-officials-say-after-ceasefire-talks-break-down\">more than 64,000 Palestinians</a>. Reactions were mixed, with some commenters expressing appreciation for the museum’s recognition of “our shared humanity.” Others decried the post as “antisemitic” for drawing parallels between the Holocaust and the devastating, systematic slaughter of civilians in Gaza.</p>\n<p>“This post is beyond disgraceful,” wrote one commenter. “Whoever created, approved, and posted this should be ashamed of themselves. Our ancestors are rolling in their graves.”</p>\n<p>In response to such perspectives, another commenter observed, “If a post encouraging our shared humanity causes you to bristle with indignation … you might want to be curious about why that is.”</p>\n<p>Still others found the original post to be a toothless declaration that did not go far enough. “Statements like these are in fact extensions of the subversive violence that attempts to erase the genocide,” a representative for <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/857383/writers-protest-nyt-gaza-coverage-with-posters-of-journalists-killed-by-israel/\">Writers Against the War on Gaza</a> (WAWOG), a group of media and academic professionals that mobilize protests and campaigns in support of Palestine, told <i>Hyperallergic</i> via email. </p>\n<p>“Gaza is being starved and annihilated by Israel, and it should be called what it is,” they continued. “Anything else is hollow prevarication.”</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>via Instagram)</p>\n<p>The Holocaust Museum LA deleted the post on Saturday and issued an apology, stating that it “will ensure that posts in the future are more thoughtfully designed and thoroughly vetted.”</p>\n<p>“We recently posted an item on social media that was part of a pre-planned social media campaign intended to promote inclusivity and community that was easily open to misinterpretation by some to be a political statement reflecting the ongoing situation in the Middle East,” the museum’s post said. “That was not our intent. It has been removed to avoid further confusion.”</p>\n<p>A representative for the museum declined to comment on the motivation behind the original post and its deletion, telling<i> Hyperallergic</i> that the new statement “reflects the thought and purpose behind the original post.”</p>\n<p>The museum’s decision to remove a post that many saw as a vague show of solidarity with the mass killings of Palestinians from an institution representing Holocaust survivors has sent ripples of outrage across the arts and culture world. Although comments were turned off on the museum’s apology post, observers from the realms of art, politics, and activism took to various platforms to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOUHNhSkjYb/\">express their dismay</a> with the institution’s turnaround. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040088/los-angeles-holocaust-museum-walks-back-never-again-statement-sparking-outcry/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The <a href=\"https://worksonwater.org/\">Works on Water (WoW) Triennial</a> at the Arts Center at Governors Island, now in its third iteration, has been led since 2017 by a resourceful group of artists and curators (Emily Blumenfeld, Carolyn Hall, sTo Len, Clarinda Mac Low, Nancy Nowacek, and Sarah Cameron Sunde, at present). The collective remains oriented toward humble grassroots projects, such as performance artist Nora Almeida’s and videographer iki nakagawa’s <a href=\"https://openwaterhere.com/\">collaborative multimedia explorations of Brooklyn’s Coney Island Creek</a>.</p>\n    <p>This and other projects are compelling in their own right, but what stands out about their 2025 triennial is how many artists, and even artworks, have returned from the first two editions. This apparent repetitiveness may seem strange given that many bi- and triennials aspire to be cultural status updates. But WoW’s willingness to revisit projects indicates that it values art for its depth and persistence rather than how it sets or fits trends.</p>\n    <p>That commendable commitment is evident in “Walking the Edge” (2020–25), a preliminary version of which appeared in the previous WoW triennial and which here appears as a dense grid of shoreline photographs. The photos document an ambitious durational feat: From May to October 2025, in collaboration with Culture Push and NYC’s Department of City Planning, WoW <a href=\"https://www.culturepush.org/walking-the-edge\">members are leading walks covering the city’s entire 520 miles of coastline</a>.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4867-1200x754.jpg?resize=1200%2C754&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Video documentation of Sarah Cameron Sunde’s “36.5 / A Durational Performance with the Sea” (2013–22) — in which the artist and local participants stand in coastal waters for one full tidal cycle at sites around the world — also makes a repeat appearance. Sunde’s performance, oriented toward deep time, patiently bears witness to the accelerating rate of sea level rise. The horizon-long Great Lakes vistas in Jana Harper’s short video, “Song for Water” (2025), likewise operate in a pensive, almost oracular, register.</p>\n    <p>It’s not surprising that Water Art, as WoW calls it, would take the long view of things, given the philosophical depth associated with its subject. But this triennial’s design emphasizes contemplative aesthetic gestures over the nitty-gritty logistics of its community projects, from sTo Len’s 30-foot-long <i>gomitaku</i> — a Japanese portmanteau meaning “trash impression” — mono print that undulates across the gallery like an elegant serpent (“Impressions for Coastal Constellation Alignment: Potomac River, Virginia,” 2020), to the floor-to-ceiling netting and cotton <i>sari</i>s that Elizabeth Velazquez and Monica Jahan Bose use, respectively, to demarcate circular spaces (“Calling Forth The Waters That Surround Us” and “Darchira River,” both 2025).</p>\n    <p>However counterintuitive emphasizing aesthetics over logistics might sound, it constitutes an effective solution to the problem of how to translate public and social practice art into a gallery setting. The triennial — especially the moody basement gallery suffused with a scent by perfume maker Frank Bloem (“Zeelucht (A Perfume from Forty Smells of the North Sea),” 2021) — reminded me of the dramatic installation environments in this summer’s inaugural <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1027811/10-new-york-upstate-art-weekend-2025-destinations-worth-the-trip/\">Sky High Farm biennial</a>, an eco-minded Hudson Valley show. But whereas the Sky High installations evince showmanship, WoW’s installations evince introspection. Nobody in the group has given up on doing the work — quite the contrary — but there’s an ambient sense that, given what has and hasn’t changed in the world since 2017, progress’s horizon might be further off than one would hope.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4776-1200x663.jpg?resize=1200%2C663&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4927-1200x1464.jpg?resize=1200%2C1464&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4924-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4914-1200x723.jpg?resize=1200%2C723&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4817-1200x809.jpg?resize=1200%2C809&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://worksonwater.org/2025-triennial\">The Works on Water 2025 Triennial </a>\n      <i>continues at the Arts Center of Governors Island (110 Andes Road, Manhattan) through October 26.

    "body": "<p>LONDON — An exquisite rhythm rolls across the sheer mass of Emily Kam Kngwarray’s paintings, produced in prolific bursts of creativity between 1980 and 1996, the last decade and a half of her life. As she worked at the forefront of a movement that sought to translate millennia-old Aboriginal cultural traditions onto media such as acrylic, canvas, and batik, much of her oeuvre is marked by a strong visual cohesion. Colorful fields of dots and linear motifs in earthy tones proliferate across the entirety of each picture plane, often covering the edges of the canvases, creating an impression of an expansiveness that seems to incorporate both microcosm and macrocosm, landscape and human, ancestral time and contemporary pressures.</p>\n<p>Kngwarray was an Anmatyerr woman born in Alhalker, in what is now known as the Northern Territory of Australia. An important Elder within her community, she is credited with breaking down the distinctions between fine art, craft, and cultural practice, gaining international recognition for her contribution to contemporary art. Her paintings and batik silks are inextricably rooted in the lands on which she was born, which in her earliest years were untouched by White settlers. However, when she was a child, they colonized Alhalker, and their introduction of sheep, cattle, and fences irrevocably changed her people’s Country.</p>\n<p>This concept of “Country” is key to understanding Kngwarray’s work and the culture in which she developed her practice. As an explanatory wall text puts it, “For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, the concept … encompasses the lands, skies and waters to which they are deeply connected, over countless generations. Country is a shared place of spiritual, social and geographical origins.” In Kngwarray’s paintings, such as “Ankerr (Emu)” (1989), this manifests as a map-like depiction of emu footprints emerging from a web of patterns and dots, charting the routes taken by the birds between underground water sources.</p>\n<p>Kngwarray’s work also draws closely on Dreamings: ancestral beings who manifest in the plants, animals, and natural phenomena of Country. Dreamings are intrinsic to Kngwarray’s worldview and practice, with a focus on animals and plants which are special to her, including the <i>ankerr</i> (emu) and <i>anwerlarr</i> (pencil yam). Yet in Western contexts, such traditions have too often been <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/australian-literatures-legacies-of-cultural-appropriation-103672\">exoticized, flattening their complexity and cultural significance</a>. The Tate show doesn’t openly refer to previous Western cultural or curatorial practices in relation to art by Aboriginal peoples, but it does take pains to explicate the respectful approach used throughout this show, using terms like Country and Dreaming without romanticization, and applying spellings of Anmatyerr words deemed appropriate by Kngwarray’s family and community. In addition, the exhibition texts use Aboriginal place names alongside English ones, as well as Anmatyerr words for the plants and animals Kngwarray depicts. </p>\n<p>Some of Kngwarray’s paintings relate to Awely, women’s ceremonies celebrating certain animals or plants, in which they grind pigments to paint dots and patterns on each other’s bodies. Included in the exhibition is a video in which Kngwarray’s family members perform one such ceremony; they also contributed to the curating and textual interpretation of the exhibition. The show draws convincing parallels between these rituals and the texture, techniques, and patterning of some of the large-scale works displayed nearby, such as “Alhalker – My Country” (1992), a heavily layered tall panel dotted with shades of rust and ocher. Swirling patterns emerge and fade before the viewer’s eyes, recalling the cyclical verses of ceremonial songs, or the tradition of temporary sand drawings made by women to tell stories.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1034784/emily-kam-kngwarray-language-of-country-tate-modern/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The air feels sharper, the light softens, and there’s a certain beauty in the shift that asks us to pause and savor.</p>\n<p>At Camille Styles, we often talk about what it means to romanticize life. For us, it isn’t about chasing an aesthetic or curating a picture-perfect day. Instead, it’s a practice of presence—choosing to notice the beauty in <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/daily-rituals/\">small rituals</a> and finding joy in the ordinary. This idea has made its rounds on TikTok and Pinterest, but we think fall is when it truly comes to life.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=30 Ways to Romanticize Your Life This Fall&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-romanticize-fall/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/coffee-cup-865x1296.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>How to Romanticize Fall: 30 Cozy Ideas to Embrace the Season</h2>\n<p>Here’s the truth: romanticizing fall doesn’t mean escaping reality. It means leaning into it—welcoming the season’s rhythms, flavors, and textures, and allowing them to nourish us. From the golden glow of an early sunset to the familiar comfort of pumpkin bread in the oven, these are the moments that ground us in the season and remind us of what’s good.</p>\n<h2>Why Fall Is the Season for Slowing Down</h2>\n<p>Autumn has a way of nudging us inward. As the days grow shorter and the air turns crisp, the expansive energy of summer naturally gives way to a quieter, more grounded rhythm. It’s not just the cooler weather or the changing leaves—it’s the gentle invitation to be more wholly <i>here.</i></p>\n<p>This season, especially, feels made for mindfulness. Fall is abundant with sensory details: the scent of cinnamon, the crunch of leaves, the softness of a favorite sweater pulled from storage. These simple rituals carry a kind of poetry and invite us to experience the season more fully. It’s choosing to find beauty in the ordinary and allowing the smallest pleasures to anchor us in the moment.</p>\n<h2>30 Ways to Romanticize Fall</h2>\n<p>With that spirit in mind, I’ve compiled simple and intentional ways to embrace the season. If you’re ready to embrace the softer side of autumn, here are 30 ideas for how to romanticize fall—and in doing so, rediscover the joy of slowing down.</p>\n<h3>Cozy Rituals at Home</h3>\n<p><strong>1. Savor a cup of chai by the window.</strong> Let the warm spices wrap around you as you watch the leaves fall. <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/masala-chai-recipe/\">This is my favorite recipe</a>—it’s perfectly spicy and sweet.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Light a candle in the early morning.</strong> Don’t get me wrong, I love sleeping in. But in the fall, there’s something magical about leaning into this quiet ritual that brings a soft glow to the stillness of your waking moments.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Reread a favorite book under a blanket.</strong> There’s a reason certain stories feel like autumn companions—returning to them can feel like visiting an old friend. These <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/beautifully-written-books/\">beautifully written books</a> do just the trick.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Play a vinyl record instead of streaming music.</strong> The warm crackle of sound sets a nostalgic and cozy tone.</p>\n<p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Journal with a cup of tea.</strong> Reflect on the season’s shifts, your rhythms, and what you want to release (and welcome in) before the year ends.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Bake something spiced just because.</strong> No occasion needed—let cinnamon and nutmeg fill the air, and enjoy the comfort of fresh-from-the-oven warmth. Let your <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/fall-baking-recipes/\">fall baking marathon</a> commence.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Take a midday bath.</strong> Warm water, eucalyptus steam, and no rush—let yourself be indulgent in the middle of the day.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Rearrange your space for the season.</strong> Swap lighter linens for cozy throws, tuck fresh branches into vases, and create a <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/cozy-reading-nook-tips/\">reading nook</a> that feels like autumn itself.</p>\n<p><strong>9.</strong> <strong>Start a seasonal playlist.</strong> Soft jazz, acoustic covers, or instrumental roundups that feel like they belong to golden hours and candlelight.</p>\n<p><strong>10. Write a letter by hand.</strong> Slow down enough to connect with someone the old-fashioned way, with pen, paper, and intention.</p>\n<h3>Seasonal Food &amp; Drinks</h3>\n<p><strong>11.</strong> <strong>Bake an apple crumble.</strong> A warm and comforting dessert that requires no perfection—just a love for seasonal fruit and crunchy topping. Bonus: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/the-easiest-apple-crumble-just-6-ingredients/\">this recipe</a> couldn’t be easier.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-romanticize-fall/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Our bodies and lifestyles are unique—especially when it comes to eliminating foods like <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/grain-free-meal-plan/\">gluten</a> and <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/dairy-free-dinner-recipes/\">dairy</a>. Yes, many people have food sensitivities—but not everyone, so experiment with the way of eating that makes you feel best before you start cutting things out. What works for one person may or may not work for you.</p>\n    <p>That said, certain foods are powerful in nourishing your gut, boosting the good bacteria, and supporting digestion. What you eat directly influences your microbiome—and a healthy microbiome can help <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-reduce-inflammation-tips/\">reduce inflammation</a>, protect against chronic disease, enhance brain health, and support weight loss.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Probiotic rich yogurt&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/breathing-space/gut-healthy-meal-plan/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/probiotic-rich-yogurt-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/probiotic-rich-yogurt-865x1298.jpg\" alt=\"Probiotic rich yogurt\"/>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Specifically, I focus on:</strong>\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Whole, unprocessed foods</strong>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Fiber-rich ingredients</strong>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>A wide variety of plants (the more diversity, the better for your microbiome!)</strong>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Healthy fats like salmon, avocado, and olive oil</strong>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Prebiotic and probiotic-rich foods</strong>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p><a href=\"https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2021/07/fermented-food-diet-increases-microbiome-diversity-lowers-inflammation\">Research shows</a> that diversifying your plate can improve your microbiome in as little as 24 hours.</p>\n    <p>Okay, enough science—let’s talk about what to eat! Don’t know about you, but I love a good meal plan. It’s easy to get stuck in a cooking rut, and a balanced meal plan can inspire you to try new ingredients and flavors—and help reduce food waste, since you’re grocery shopping for specific meals.</p>\n    <h3>So, here’s the plan:</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Each recipe in this meal plan emphasizes digestion-friendly ingredients, high fiber, and colorful fruits and veggies to nourish your microbiome and keep your gut happy all week long.</li>\n      <li>Breakfast and lunch are all about simplicity. (I tend to pick a lunch and repeat it throughout the week!) Choose one or two recipes to prep ahead, or mix it up with dinner leftovers—all the dinners (except the tacos) are great reheated as lunches. Likewise, both lunch salads double beautifully as dinners—so make extra if you want to save time.</li>\n      <li>Dinner recipes each serve four. If you’re cooking for fewer people, halve the recipes or plan on leftovers to simplify busy evenings.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>***</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Inside  this Substack post,  I share all the nourishing recipes, simple strategies, and the daily habits that support long-term wellness from the inside out.

We <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/fashion/wardrobe-essentials/best-fall-basics/\">pull on sweaters</a> even when it’s 85 degrees, decorate with all the shades of autumn leaves (since ours stay stubbornly green), and start <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/easy-halloween-recipes/\">planning Halloween</a> in September. And don’t even get me started on the candles. But without a doubt, my favorite part of the season is baking. Every year, I dive into a new round of fall baking recipes—and this season’s lineup might be the coziest yet.</p>\n<p>From spiced snack cakes to boozy crisps, these treats turn simple afternoons into rituals worth savoring. There’s nothing like the moment pumpkin, spice, and butter hit the oven, filling the kitchen with that unmistakable fall fragrance. And while the classics are covered, seasonal stars like sweet potatoes, figs, and maple make these recipes extra special. Scroll on for the fall desserts I can’t wait to bake this year.</p>\n<h2>20 Fall Baking Recipes to Embrace the Cozy Season</h2>\n<h2>Pumpkin Loaf Cake</h2>\n<p>This recipe goes triple platinum in my house during fall. With the crunchy walnut and cream cheese frosting topping, it’s big on the pumpkin flavor, with just the right amount of sweetness.</p>\n<h2>Cardamom Frangipane Pear Tart</h2>\n<p>This cardamom-pear frangipane tart feels like a warm hug in pastry form. The tender pears nestle atop a softly spiced almond base, all crowned by a crisp, golden crust. With each bite, you’ll taste floral sweetness from cardamom, a hint of citrus from marmalade, and a delicate crunch of almonds that makes it as charming as it is comforting.</p>\n<h2>Healthy Apple Crumble</h2>\n<p>This healthy apple crumble delivers all the nostalgic comfort of autumn—spiced with pumpkin-pie blend and sweet, tender apples—while staying light and easy to love. Topped with a wholesome oat-and-almond-flour crumble, it’s a make-ahead treat that fills your kitchen with cozy, cinnamony aroma without feeling too indulgent.</p>\n<h2>No-Bake Pumpkin Pie Bars</h2>\n<p>These no-bake pumpkin pie bars bring all the spiced, cozy flavors of pumpkin pie—without ever having to turn on the oven—making them a genius addition to your fall baking lineup. Creamy, mousse-like pumpkin filling rests atop a nutty, brown-butter graham-cracker crust, delivering comforting autumn sweetness with zero oven fuss.</p>\n<h2>Maple Pecan Pie</h2>\n<p>Maple syrup adds sweetness, and pecans bring the crunch—this pie is one you don’t want to skip out on this fall. Bonus: decorative leaf cutouts for the crust make it as beautiful as it tastes.</p>\n<h2>Sour Cream and Onion Biscuits</h2>\n<p>These flaky sour cream and onion biscuits may not lean on pumpkin or spice, but they’re downright cozy. Imagine tangy green onions, rich sour cream, and melted cheddar wrapped in light, buttery layers that warm the kitchen with their golden aroma. They may not scream ‘fall ingredients,’ but they’ve got all the comfort-season charm you didn’t know you needed.”</p>\n<h2>Cinnamon Baked Apples</h2>\n<p>Nothing says fall like the arrival of crisp, sweet apples at the local market. Baked apples offer up all of apple pie’s beloved flavor and comfort, but with only a fraction of the effort, and in the case of this recipe, sans refined sugars or wheat flour. <i>WIN!</i></p>\n<h2>Butternut Squash and Ricotta Tart</h2>\n<p>This butternut squash and ricotta tart is like autumn transformed into a savory centerpiece—layering caramel-kissed squash, sweet potato, apples, and onion on a bed of herbed ricotta, all resting in a buttery, flaky crust. It’s effortless yet elegant, with a flower-like arrangement that feels more like edible art than dinner.</p>\n<h2>Spiced Sweet Potato Cake With Cream Cheese Frosting</h2>\n<p>Naturally dairy-free, yet indulgent, this spiced sweet potato cake is perfect for kicking off the fall season, paired with a warm latte or your favorite tea. You can even swap sweet potato for pumpkin puree if whimsy calls.</p>\n<h2>Pumpkin Snack Cake</h2>\n<p>Imagine pumpkin season wrapped up in a small, bite-sized treat. A streusel-topped, tender crumb that blurs the line between breakfast and dessert, all dusted in a soft snowfall of sweet powdered sugar.</p>\n<h2>Chocolate Bourbon Pecan Pie Bars</h2>\n<p>All the joy of pecan pie, no crust required. These bars combine a buttery shortbread base with a vibrant, chocolate-bourbon-spiked filling. This is the elevated dessert I love bringing out at the end of my fall get-togethers.</p>\n<h2>Chewy Pumpkin Spice Cookies</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/fall-baking-recipes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It was like living in two worlds at once, never fully grounded. As the season shifts, I’m not just welcoming cooler air and longer shadows—I’m noticing the crispness in the mornings, the golden light spilling across my Portland streets, and how the sunlight catches in my eyes in a way that makes me feel fully awake again. I’m craving a September reset: a return to rhythm, <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/health/healthy-habits/founder-wellness-rituals/\">to rituals</a>, and to a steadiness that feels like home.</p>\n<p>Fall has always been my season of becoming. Summer’s spontaneity is beautiful in its own way, but it can leave me untethered, spinning from one thing to the next. This year, my intention isn’t to return to who I was before. It’s to step into someone new: rooted, aligned, and intentional. My September reset is made up of small adjustments that help me find my footing again. These aren’t grand gestures or sweeping overhauls, but everyday practices that remind me I can always start anew.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=How to Reset This September (Without Overhauling Your Whole Life)&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/september-reset/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/drinking-coffee-fireplace-865x1296.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>How to Approach Your September Reset</h2>\n<p>A September reset doesn’t mean completely overhauling your life or chasing a brand-new version of yourself. After a summer that had me juggling travel and constant transitions, I’ve realized the most meaningful shifts are subtle, small adjustments that help me feel centered and steady. They’re the practices I return to when I want to feel like a real and complete person again. (Not someone who’s—frantically, chaotically—going through the motions.)</p>\n<p>Think of this reset as a gentle guide rather than a checklist. The goal isn’t perfection—it’s alignment and a sense of reconnecting with your authentic self as the days grow cooler and the season turns.</p>\n<h2>10 Simple Changes to Inspire Your September Reset</h2>\n<p>As I step into fall, I’m focusing on the everyday practices that help me return to myself—clearing space, inviting presence, and creating the consistency I’ve been craving. They’re not about reinventing my life, but about realigning with it in ways that feel manageable, meaningful, and (spoiler!) completely within reach.</p>\n<h3>1. Clear Space at Home</h3>\n<p>After a summer of <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/fashion/2-week-carry-on-packing-list/\">suitcases</a> and scattered piles, I need blank surfaces and organized drawers. The chaos of caregiving and travel left my home feeling more like storage than sanctuary. I’m starting small: a 20-minute tidy before bed, tackling one drawer at a time, and creating little pockets of calm.</p>\n<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Pick one surface and clear it completely. This could be your nightstand, desk, kitchen counter, etc. Notice how that small change improves your energy.</p>\n<h3>2. Reclaim Morning Rituals</h3>\n<p>This summer, my mornings belonged to everyone but me. Early flights (or recovering from late ones), appointments, and unpredictable schedules made starting the day with intention impossible. Now, I wake a bit earlier to make coffee, journal, or sit quietly by the window. Even five mindful minutes can anchor my day.</p>\n<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Before reaching for your phone, take a few deep breaths and ask yourself: How do I want to move through today?</p>\n<h3>3. Cook with the Season</h3>\n<p>After months of takeout and eating on the go, I’m craving meals that ground me. Not only that, but I miss the way shopping at the farmer’s market would make me feel connected, both to my local community and to myself. September markets are full of squash, apples, and late-summer tomatoes. Cooking with <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/fall-seasonal-vegetables/\">these ingredients</a> feels like reestablishing roots, nourishing both body and soul.</p>\n<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Choose one seasonal recipe this week that invites slowness, like <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/best-roasted-root-vegetables/\">roasting vegetables</a> or baking bread.</p>\n<h3>4. Move with Intention</h3>\n<p>This summer, I often pushed through exhaustion with long, intense workouts, thinking that more miles or higher intensity was the only way to feel strong. Now, as I <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/marathon-training/\">train for my marathon</a>, I’m learning to honor movement that feels purposeful and restorative: a focused run at a comfortable pace, a barre class to stretch and build strength, or a <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/walking-for-mental-health/\">mindful walk </a>through my neighborhood. Movement has become about experiencing presence in my body, not just sweat. It’s a practice that grounds me while still challenging me.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/september-reset/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>We may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article.</p>\n<p>Though I’m a sucker for sundresses and sandals, this year I’m feeling ready—and excited—for <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/fall-2025-fashion-trends/\">fall fashion</a>. Getting creative with layering, embracing warm shades of olive greens and chocolate browns, and breaking out my favorite barn jackets and boots feels like the reset I’ve been craving. One of the best parts about fall style is that the pieces are all built to last—a good sweater or tailored coat can stay with you for years, while summer pieces like raffia and linen always seem to need replacing. Last year, I built a foolproof <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/fashion/wardrobe-essentials/fall-capsule-wardrobe-2024/\">10-piece</a> fall capsule wardrobe, and instead of feeling the urge to shop for newness this season, I’m more inspired to reimagine the staples I already own and love.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Camille Styles folding fall capsule wardrobe pieces.&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/style/fall-capsule-wardrobe/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fall-capsule-wardrobe-865x1296.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>10 Timeless Fall Essentials:</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li>The Everyday Jeans</li>\n      <li>The Leather Boot</li>\n      <li>The Lightweight Layer</li>\n      <li>The Suede Bag</li>\n      <li>The Statement Belt</li>\n      <li>The Basic Blazer</li>\n      <li>The Tailored Trouser</li>\n      <li>The Neutral Sweater</li>\n      <li>The Classic Loafers</li>\n      <li>The Knit Dress</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>With these 10 essentials, I’ve found there are endless ways to get dressed for the moments that matter most this time of year: coffee dates, <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/friendsgiving-recipe-ideas/\">Friendsgiving dinners</a>, college game days, and cozy weekend getaways. </p>\n<p>Ahead, I’m sharing how I’m styling my fall capsule wardrobe for six occasions you’re likely to have on your calendar—using pieces you probably already have in your closet.</p>\n<h2>Your 10-Piece Fall Capsule Wardrobe, Styled for Every Occasion</h2>\n<h2>Cozy Morning Coffee Date</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Everyday Jeans + Neutral Sweater + Classic Loafers</i>\n    </p>\n<p>There’s nothing cozier than grabbing a cappuccino on a crisp fall morning, and this outfit is my go-to for those casual moments. A soft sweater and broken-in jeans feel effortless, while loafers add just enough polish that I still feel put together. I’d also layer on some socks with my loafers for added warmth and texture. It’s cozy, classic, and takes all of two minutes to throw on.</p>\n<h2>Office-to-Dinner Transition</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Tailored Trouser + Basic Blazer + Statement Belt</i>\n    </p>\n<p>When your day doesn’t stop at five, this outfit works overtime. Tailored trousers and a blazer give structure for the office, but come happy hour, I’ll button the blazer and cinch it at the waist with a belt—it instantly feels more styled and flattering. To finish the transition, I swap my loafers for kitten heels and add a bold lip. Just like that, I’m ready for a night out.</p>\n<h2>Friendsgiving Dinner Party</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Knit Dress + Leather Boot + Suede Bag</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Friendsgiving is my favorite excuse to get a little dressed up while still staying comfortable. A knit dress is cozy enough for hours at the dinner table but feels elevated with tall leather boots. I’ll carry a suede bag to add texture—and to sneak in a bottle of wine or some homemade pumpkin sourdough for the host.</p>\n<h2>Warm Weekend Getaway</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Everyday Jeans + Neutral Sweater + Lightweight Layer</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Whether you’re heading to the countryside with your SO or a cabin with your friends, this outfit is all about ease. A lightweight layer over denim and a sweater keeps you cozy in shifting temps, while still looking photo-ready. It’s proof that packing from your fall capsule wardrobe means less stress and more adventure. I’m obsessed with cuffed, dark denim for fall, and this houndstooth jacket is neutral and versatile, while still making a statement.</p>\n<h2>Festive Gameday</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Knit Dress + Statement Belt + Leather Boots</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Game days in fall call for an outfit that’s spirited but stylish. A knit dress belted at the waist adds shape without sacrificing comfort, and boots keep things practical whether you’re in the stands or at the tailgate. Obviously you might have to tailor the color scheme to root for your team of choice (hook ’em horns), but the formula feels festive without leaning too casual.</p>\n<h2>Brunch &amp; Shopping</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Neutral Sweater +  Tailored Trouser + Classic Loafers</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/fall-capsule-wardrobe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>We may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article.</p>\n<p>There’s something about fall that feels like a second new year. Maybe it’s the back-to-school energy still imprinted from childhood, or the subtle way the season nudges us back to structure after summer’s looseness. Whatever the reason, this moment always inspires me to reset—not with resolutions, but with rhythms that bring ease and balance into daily life. This year, I’ve been leaning on this holistic fall reset routine for body, mind, and spirit. We’re partnering with <a href=\"https://www.havenwellwithin.com/home\">Haven Well Within</a> to move through the season feeling more intentional and present.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Camille Styles journaling&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/fall-reset-routine/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/camille-styles-journaling-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Your Fall Reset Routine: Simple Shifts for a Season of Ease</h2>\n<p>Fall is about simplifying. A <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/fall-2025-fashion-trends/\">wardrobe</a> pared down to timeless layers, a beauty routine that feels restorative, and <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/healthy-daily-habits/\">daily practices</a> that create pockets of stillness. Each choice may seem minor, but together they form a foundation of calm, helping even the busiest days feel lighter.</p>\n<p>This kind of reset doesn’t require an overhaul. It’s about weaving ease into what already exists—finding rituals that support your energy, creativity, and sense of self. With Haven Well Within’s effortlessly elegant pieces alongside grounding practices, the season unfolds in ways that feel manageable, nourishing, and meaningful.</p>\n<h2>Dress With Ease, Live With Intention</h2>\n<p>Fall dressing is at its best when it supports your life instead of complicating it. Matching lounge sets, cozy sweaters, or fluid transitional layers free up mental energy. Here are a few ways I like to make getting dressed effortless, stylish, and a little joyful.</p>\n<h3>The Matching Set: Cozy Meets Polished</h3>\n<p>A matching lounge set with elevated slides is the ultimate <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/work-from-home-clothes/\">work-from-home uniform</a>. Comfy as pajamas, polished enough for a Zoom, it gives you a put-together silhouette without the effort. When your morning outfit feels simple, you reclaim energy for everything else in your day.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Your Fall Reset Starts Here: Effortless Ways to Feel Grounded This Season&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/fall-reset-routine/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/winter-white-outfit-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h3>Streamlined Style</h3>\n<p>Sleek tailoring and subtle patterns can make a matching set feel elevated without overcomplicating your look. Coordinated pieces, like a funnel-neck top and streamlined pants, keep your silhouette polished while allowing movement, comfort, and flexibility for both home and errands.</p>\n<p>Haven Well Within</p>\n<p>Haven Well Within</p>\n<h3>Relaxed Sophistication</h3>\n<p>Fluid fabrics and soft drapey silhouettes offer a balance of ease and refinement. Pieces that move with you, like wide-leg pants or floaty tops, are perfect for mornings at your desk or afternoons out. When clothes complement your day, they free you to navigate it with grace.</p>\n<p>Haven Well Within</p>\n<p>Haven Well Within</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Your Fall Reset Starts Here: Effortless Ways to Feel Grounded This Season&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/fall-reset-routine/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/woman-wearing-loungewear-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h3>Everyday Romance</h3>\n<p>Even simple pieces can feel special—a plush henley, cozy fleece pants, or a touch of lip gloss elevates ordinary moments. These small gestures invite comfort and joy, turning routine outfits into quietly luxurious rituals.

Here are three practical ways to realign your mind this fall:</p>\n<h3>1. Cultivate Your Journaling Practice</h3>\n<p>Writing isn’t just about chronicling your life—it’s a quiet practice of reflection and clarity. Set a timer for five minutes each morning, letting your thoughts wander freely. Use prompts like: “What am I grateful for today?” or “What would make today feel whole?” Over time, this ritual becomes a reliable place to realign.</p>\n<p>Haven Well Within</p>\n<h3>2. Revisit Your Vision Board</h3>\n<p>Goals evolve, and your vision board should too. Take stock: Does it still reflect where you want to go this year? Refresh it with new images, intentions, or words to help guide you toward the version of yourself you want to become.</p>\n<h3>3. Take a Digital Detox</h3>\n<p>Even brief breaks from screens can reset your energy. Consider a phone-free afternoon, a walk without notifications, or a Sunday offline. Stepping away from constant scrolling clears space for focus, creativity, and calm. <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/health/mental-health/digital-detox/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">These are our favorite tips for a mindful digital detox.</a></p>\n<h2>Align Your Workout Routine With the Season</h2>\n<p>Shorter days and cooler temps shift your energy—and your workouts. This fall, small changes can help you stay connected to your body without forcing intensity.</p>\n<h3>1.

Viola Zhou examines the complicated relationship between her mother, who struggles with complications from chronic kidney disease, and DeepSeek, one of China’s most popular AI chatbots, from which she seeks medical guidance and comfort.

For the sick, the<a href=\"\">anxious</a>, the<a href=\"\">isolated</a>, and many other vulnerable people who may lack medical resources and attention, AI’s vast knowledge base, coupled with its affirming and empathetic tone, can make the bots feel like wise and comforting partners. Unlike spouses, children, friends, or neighbors, chatbots are always available. They always respond.<p>Entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and even some doctors are now pitching AI as a salve for overburdened health care systems and a stand-in for absent or exhausted caregivers. Ethicists, clinicians, and researchers are meanwhile warning of the risks in outsourcing care to machines. After all, hallucinations and biases in AI systems are prevalent. Lives could be at stake.</p><p>Over the course of months, my mom became increasingly smitten with her new AI doctor. “DeepSeek is more humane,” my mother told me in May. “Doctors are more like machines.”</p></blockquote><h2>More picks about artificial intelligence</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/07/08/my-couples-retreat-with-3-ai-chatbots-and-the-humans-who-love-them/\">My Couples Retreat With 3 AI Chatbots and the Humans Who Love Them</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“I found people in serious relationships with AI partners and planned a weekend getaway for them at a remote Airbnb.

For <i>5280 Magazine</i>, Heather Hansman reports on how a day trip went horribly wrong, turning into the “largest search for a missing hiker in Colorado history,” and why it took nearly two decades to solve the mystery.</p><blockquote><p>It’s not uncommon for hikers to run into trouble on Holy Cross. Vail Mountain Rescue responds to about 15 individuals or groups there each year. Scott Beebe, a longtime member of the team, says hikers tend to get confused near the summit. Instead of taking the correct route to the North Ridge trail, which looks steep from the top, they can mistakenly head down mellower-looking paths that actually dead-end above cliffs. The searchers traced these and many other routes, looking for Vanek, to no avail. A few days in, snow began to fall. By the eighth, when rescuers were trudging through two feet of powder, the search was called off. Everyone was baffled. “We ended up the last day with not a clue, not a gum wrapper, not a boot print, absolutely nothing,” wrote searcher Tim Cochrane in his report to the sheriff. “How can anyone just vanish into thin air?”</p></blockquote><h2>\n\t\t\t\t\tMore picks from <i>5280 Magazine</i>\n\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2023/11/30/did-bad-fire-science-send-tim-and-deb-nicholls-to-prison/\">Did Bad Fire Science Send Tim and Deb Nicholls to Prison?</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“When he opens the bedroom window, there’s smoke billowing past his head.

That was only the start of Scott’s traumatic life journey.</h3>\n    <p>One morning in 1984, the school principal walked into the classroom where I taught fourth grade and whispered to me, “Scott is a missing child!”</p>\n    <p>I looked at 9-year-old Scott, who was present in my class that day. I was quite aware what was implied. The term “missing child” had been seared into the nation’s psyche in the 1980s following a few high-profile cases, including the kidnapping and murder of 6-year-old Etan Patz in 1979. None of us at the school had any idea that Scott had been kidnapped from his own home just a few months before Patz.</p>\n    <p>The principal explained that Scott had been kidnapped by his father, and over the past six years, including the four-plus he’d been enrolled in our school, his mother, who lived on the other side of the country, had been desperately searching for him. I did not know the depth of the story beginning to unfold.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The 2025 MTV VMAs were, as usual, a star-studded affair. This year, some of those stars used their moments in the spotlight to uplift <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/6-motivational-quotes-lgbtq-entrepreneurs/\">LGBTQ</a> people.</p>\n    <p>Singers <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/sabrina-carpenter-is-not-actually-the-problem/\">Sabrina Carpenter</a> and <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/for-the-first-time-women-got-an-equal-number-of-leading-film-roles-in-2024/\">Ariana Grande</a> both made headlines for their demonstrations and words in support of trans and gay individuals. </p>\n    <p>The biggest moment came in the form of Carpenter’s performance of “Tears.” She was joined onstage by numerous drag queens, including Honey Balenciaga, Symone, Jewels Sparkles and Denali. And at the end of the song, performers carried large signs reading, among other pro-LGBTQ messages, “protect trans rights” and “In Trans We Trust.”</p>\n    <p>Following the performance, viewers <a href=\"https://x.com/jessinomenon/status/1964868998291710001\">took to social media</a> to laud her (and other allied celebrities) for “showing constant support to the trans community and showcasing drag queens in their biggest projects,” which, they added, is “so important in this political state.”</p>\n    <p>Grande, meanwhile, ended her acceptance speech for the biggest award of the night – Video of the Year – by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/PRUbqNrbsWo\">thanking</a> “therapists and gay people” for their roles in supporting her success. “I love you,” she added.</p>\n    <p>It’s not the first time either performer has been vocal about supporting the community. Just this past June, Carpenter <a href=\"https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/07/01/sabrina-carpenter-shares-sweet-pride-month-message/\">raised $1 million</a> to support a variety of nonprofits that offer mental health and suicide prevention services to LGBTQ people. Grande, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/01/21/ariana-grande-president-donald-trump-executive-orders/\">spoke out</a> in January in support of trans individuals amid the slurry of anti-trans executive orders signed by President Donald Trump when he re-assumed the office.</p>\n    <p>And both of them signed an <a href=\"https://www.thetrevorproject.org/blog/an-open-letter-to-lgbtq-youth-we-will-not-stop-fighting-for-you/\">open letter</a> written by The Trevor Project, a nonprofit focused on suicide prevention among young people who identify as part of the LGBTQ community. The letter was written in protest of the Trump administration’s defunding of a crisis hotline.</p>\n    <p>While <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffconway/2025/06/30/the-sabrina-carpenter-fund-reaches-1-million-milestone-in-record-time/\">speaking with Forbes</a> earlier this year, Carpenter plainly laid out the drive behind such public displays of support. “I want to send so much love to my LGBTQ+ fans,” she said. “You’ve always shown up for me, and I’m committed to showing up for you.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/sabrina-carpenter-and-ariana-grande-go-pro-lgbtq-at-the-2025-vmas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Rather, the majority of the women whose deaths were studied (70%) were killed in their own homes.</p>\n    <p>The organization’s executive director, Dr. Karen Ingala Smith, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxw1yrlx5go\">noted to BBC News</a> that, for every woman who was murdered by a man she knew, “many more [are] living with and enduring serious violence and abuse”. </p>\n    <p>Though the Census looks at deaths that occurred in the UK, other studies have shown this trend to be true the world over. A 2024 report from <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/for-women-the-world-over-home-is-where-the-danger-is/\">UN Women</a> indicated that of the 85,000 girls and women murdered by men in 2023, 60% were killed by a man who was close to them.</p>\n    <p>“What the data is telling us is that it is the private and domestic spheres of women’s lives – where they should be safest – that so many of them are being exposed to deadly violence,” Nyaradzayi Gumbonzvanda, UN Women’s deputy executive director, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/nov/25/home-is-the-most-dangerous-place-for-women-to-be-global-un-femicide-report\">told the Guardian</a>. And what’s worse, she adds, is that “we see the numbers in this report as the tip of the iceberg.”</p>\n    <p>Smith, of the Femicide Census, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/women-killed-men-femicide-jess-phillips-b2817964.html\">says that</a> sharing this information could be life-saving in and of itself – and hopes government officials act to quell the violence. In the UK, the Labour Party, now in power, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/13/labour-violence-against-women-and-girls-vawg-policy\">has pledged</a> to halve serious violence – including men’s violence against women – in 10 years. </p>\n    <p>“They are going to have to act fast and ambitiously to even approach that target,” she says. “Men who are known to be a danger to women are too frequently at liberty to harm, rape and kill.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/the-biggest-threat-to-womens-lives-the-men-they-know/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Ro Khanna of California and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, the cohort stood outside of the U.S. Capitol building Wednesday afternoon to call for a release of the Justice Department’s full records – beyond the pages released Tuesday, many of which had <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/many-of-the-epstein-case-files-that-were-just-released-by-a-house-committee-were-already-public\">already been made public</a>.</p>\n    <p>“Today … we’re united in restoring trust in government. We’re here not as partisans, we’re here as patriots,” Khanna said at the press gathering.</p>\n    <p>She and Massie are going about their pursuit for the files through atypical means: By filing a discharge petition, which would force a Congressional vote on the release of information if they can get 218 signatures from fellow House members. In a show of bipartisan support, Republican Reps. Marjorie Taylor Green, Lauren Boebert and Nancy Mace have already signed.</p>\n    <p>The cohort of survivors who spoke was bipartisan, too – Haley Robsen, one of several women who took to the podium, identified herself as a registered Republican while addressing the public, adding, “not that that matters, because this is not political.” She called on Trump to remember the personhood of all of the survivors. “We are real human beings. This is real trauma.”</p>\n    <p>Epstein, who died by suicide in August 2019, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/jeffrey-epstein-key-victims-attorney/story?id=123805543\">victimized hundreds</a> of girls and women over the course of decades. British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, a longtime associate of Epstein’s, was convicted for her involvement in the mass trafficking and assault in 2021. The two are known to have relationships with many high-profile folks – from Trump himself, to British royal Prince Andrew and former President Bill Clinton – making Epstein’s client list of particular public interest.</p>\n    <p>In response to the demonstration, Trump <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-calls-epstein-files-irrelevant-push-release-gains/story?id=125225706\">dismissed the collective call</a> for openness as a “Democrat hoax that never ends.” He continued, while speaking to members of the press from the Oval Office: “They’re trying to get people to talk about something that’s totally irrelevant to the success that we’ve had as a nation since I’ve been president.”</p>\n    <p>The survivors have their own interpretation of such stonewalling. “The only motive for opposing this would be to conceal wrongdoing,” said Anouska De Georgiou, one of those gathered before the press on Wednesday.</p>\n    <p>She then added, “You have a choice: Stand with the truth – or with the lies that have protected predators for decades.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/epstein-survivors-speak-out-we-are-real-human-beings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Max didn’t think I’d really go into labor at 32 weeks that day so he dressed for work, just in case!</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Today, I am 35 weeks pregnant. I just felt a smooth rolling feeling underneath my belly as baby girl pressed her leg or arm up against me. Every week, her presence feels more real, and we’ve been preparing for her arrival by making room in her big sister’s bedroom and <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2016/03/28/what-to-pack-in-hospital-bag/\">packing our hospital bag</a>. But what’s also been taking up lots of brain space are two sweet labor-and-delivery moments…</p>\n    <p>The first one is introducing our two older kids — <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2023/08/14/parenting-tip-for-independent-toddlers/\">Ella</a> and <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2024/05/06/four-surprising-things-after-having-second-child/\">Emiliano</a> — to their little sister. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCvtLigNsEA/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\">This Instagram reel</a> has smart tips for that special moment. I love how the baby is in the bassinet when his older brother walks into the hospital room, and how his mom has her arms open to snuggle him in. Also the family group hug at the end? C’MON. </p>\n    <p>But my favorite part? The parents taped photos of the boy into the baby’s bassinet. That gesture created a space for him to feel loved and seen. It also showed him how excited his sister was to meet <i>him</i>. Isn’t that such an easy but beautiful tip?</p>\n    <p>Ella and Emiliano never had their meeting-for-the-first-time-in-the-hospital moment because after he was born, he spent the next month in the NICU, and they didn’t allow visitors under the age of 14. So, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C2x5XlmykQI/?img_index=1\">they first met at home</a>, which is one of the greatest memories of my life. But this time around — if all goes smoothly with this delivery and my two children get to visit us in the hospital — I’d love to hang their pictures in the bassinet so they feel a sense of connection with their new sister.</p>\n    <p>***</p>\n    <p>The second post-delivery moment I’m mustering up the courage to do is take a photo with my labor and delivery nurse. Whenever someone asks about my birth stories I ALWAYS talk about the nurses who helped me. These women! So kind and gentle, they were the safeguards of my body and soul in a moment that felt sacred but scary.</p>\n    <p>I’ll never forget the nurse who took care of me while I labored with Emiliano. She let me squeeze her hands as hard as I could when I got my epidural. And when I flinched with contractions, she pet my hair and led me through breathing exercises. She even stayed past her shift to see Emiliano arrive and write down his weight and height measurements on his baby tag.</p>\n    <p>Whenever I think of her, I tear up, and to this day, I regret not taking a photo with her. In the moment I felt too shy to ask and didn’t want to be a bother. But now I wish I could show a picture to Emiliano of the nurse who led me through one of the hardest moments of my life and helped bring him into this world.</p>\n    <p>If I’m lucky enough to meet another crew of caring labor and delivery nurses this time around, I’m going to go for it and ask for a quick selfie. Because these women and men are incredible, and play such a huge role in the moments we’ll always remember.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>If you’ve delivered a baby, what labor and delivery moments did you find meaningful? Is there anything you’d recommend to others? I’d love to hear.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>P.S. <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2017/04/17/birth-stories-c-section/\">Who would you want in the room while giving birth</a>, and <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2021/08/23/meal-after-giving-birth/\">what was the first meal you ate after giving birth</a>?

The ten year old just laughed. One of the 8-year olds grabbed a phone and asked Siri. The response? “6-7 is 67, the number following 66.” We all fell over laughing but the mystery of teen slang lives on.</p>\n<p>Regarding 67: According to my high school Junior, it has no real meaning. An NBA player was being interviewed and when asked about his height he replied, “ 6, 7” gesturing height with his hands. For some reasons, this was hilarious to younger teens/tweens and now they mimic it. Older teens thinks it’s “cringe” – haha!</p>\n<p>My husband has done mornings with my 10, 13 and 16 year old for the past 5 years since I’ve gone back to work full time. I’m suuuuure he asks the 10 year to get their backpack at least 6-7 times each morning ;) Also we have lists around the house to help the youngest get himself together—I truly have no idea how my husband feeds them gets them out the door and himself ready for work. Clocked it! I just quietly sneak out at 6am ready to stand on business teaching 6th graders…and yes I hear 6 7 ten million times a day.</p>\n<p>High school teacher here: the 67 song is unending. Oh my gosh.</p>\n<p>This seems just exactly right! Although some of it (the socks! The outfit crisis) already apply to my 7 year old—yikes :)</p>\n<p>I first interpreted Mood Swing as mine, the mom! Because there’s a tipping point in the morning rush and if you cross me…. watch it.<br/>\nLove my kids but I get dazed when I think about what mornings were like before them. I sat on the couch with an actual hot breakfast?!? Watching a morning show? damn I had it good.</p>\n<p>Oh how I wish I could get a “bye mom love you”… sigh.</p>\n<p>I have a senior this year! The looking at the baby pics after they leave got me! This year I snapped a quick last first day of school pic and then went through old photos looking for his first day of kindergarten and teared up remembering how small he used to be. I kept scrolling and thinking is this it? And then realizing that no thats 3rd grade! You forget so much even as he basically is still a baby<br/>\nin a quadrant of my heart and always will be. I’ll be tearing up all senior year. I well up because I couldn’t be prouder, because he’s about to go off on his own, because I want him to go out into the big wide world and do all the things and be so involved with friends and school a d fun that of course he forgets to call and at the same time I want him to<br/>\nstay home forever and never leave and only sit in the couch with me eating snacks and making jokes and having a few cuddles.<br/>\nBeing a mom is tough!</p>\n<p>So tough.</p>\n<p>My 10 yo taught my 6 yo the 6-7 thing and now I’m hearing it nonstop from both! S.O.S!!</p>\n<p>Our morning routine drastically changed when I asked my kids to choose their clothes the night before. It’s like they are emotionally detached from the decision at night, if that makes sense? There’s no rush, no stress, and it takes a total of 30 seconds. I even started to do the same.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/09/05/teens-the-back-to-school-board-game/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I love crunching through orange leaves and spotting toddlers wearing giant backpacks. Best of all, though, is pulling cozy clothes out of the closet. Here are five pieces I’m looking forward to wearing…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-04-at-12.58.30-PM.png\" alt=\"5 Pieces I'm Excited to Wear This Fall\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>1. Barn jacket.</strong> J.Crew’s famous for their <a href=\"https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-5347837-13270430?sid=campaign1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jcrew.com%2Fm%2Fwomens%2Fcategories%2Fclothing%2Fcoats-and-jackets%2Fbarn-jacket%2Fbarn-jackettrade-in-waxed-canvas%2FME632%3Fdisplay%3Dstandard%26fit%3DClassic%26color_name%3Dwashed-black-grey-combo%26colorProductCode%3DCN058\">1983 style</a>, but I’m even more into <a href=\"https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-5347837-14519783?sid=campaign1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.madewell.com%2Fp%2Fwomens%2Fclothing%2Fjackets%2Fdenim-jackets%2Fdenim-trapeze-jacket%2FNW310%2F%3Fccode%3DDM9455\">Madewell’s denim version</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-5347837-14519783?sid=campaign1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.madewell.com%2Fp%2Fwomens%2Fclothing%2Fjackets%2Fjackets%2Fwaxed-zip-front-jacket%2FNW759%2F%3Fccode%3DWR2185\">cropped waxed one</a>.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-04-at-1.24.05-PM.png\" alt=\"5 Pieces I'm Excited to Wear This Fall\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>2. Brown corduroy.</strong> Nothing feels more autumnal than brown corduroy; give me all the rich shades and soft textures. Five pieces: <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-24517380\">short dress</a>, <a href=\"https://gap.igs4ds.net/Qjr2Ez\">long dress</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-5347837-13270430?sid=campaign1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jcrew.com%2Fp%2Fwomens%2Fcategories%2Fclothing%2Fpants%2Fflare%2Fvintage-flare-pant-in-corduroy%2FCN731%3Fdisplay%3Dstandard%26fit%3DClassic%26color_name%3Dfrench-press%26colorProductCode%3DCN731\">long pant</a>, <a href=\"https://goto.quince.com/je3BO6\">cropped pant</a>, and <a href=\"https://gap.igs4ds.net/EEXRY9\">overalls</a>.

Rugby shirts.</strong> <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/06/08/dads-rules-for-life/\">My dad</a> played rugby in high school and college, and he’s famous for saying, “rugby is like football but without pads or helmets.” I’m a delicate flower and would never step foot on a pitch, but I do love the look of rugby shirts. Sporty style is huge this fall, and here are three great looks: <a href=\"https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-5347837-13270430?sid=campaign1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jcrew.com%2Fm%2Fwomens%2Fcategories%2Fclothing%2Ftees-and-tanks%2Fnew-premium-weight-classic-rugby-shirt%2FME649%3Fdisplay%3Dstandard%26fit%3DClassic%26color_name%3Drugby-stripe-press-sea%26colorProductCode%3DCN190\">brown</a>, <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-24548628\">cream</a>, and <a href=\"https://gap.igs4ds.net/3JxLrA\">green</a>.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/UNIVERSALSTANDARD_08.26.254776.jpg\" alt=\"5 Pieces I'm Excited to Wear This Fall\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>4. Track pants.</strong> Speaking of sporty, I’ve been spotting lots of women in Brooklyn wearing track pants with sweaters. The combo looks chic but feels like pajamas. <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-24550138\">The Adidas ones</a> are the classic, and <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-24550166\">Universal Standard</a> has a bunch of cool colors. Also, my friend <a href=\"https://jessieloves.substack.com/p/jessie-loves-9-pieces-in-my-sporty\">Jessie</a> just made <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-24551580\">a pair with wavy ric-rac stripes</a>!</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/brown-sezane-sweater.jpg\" alt=\"5 Pieces I'm Excited to Wear This Fall\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>5. Red flats.</strong> The viral <a href=\"https://lb.affilae.com/r/?p=5eb1843ec55770653019f763&amp;af=1029&amp;lp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sezane.com%2Fus-en%2Fproduct%2Fvalentin-low-ballerinas%2Fsmooth-red%23size-4\">Sézane pair</a> has sold out (although hopefully will come back), but here are two similar styles: <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-5347837-14519783?sid=campaign1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.madewell.com%2Fp%2Fwomens%2Fsale%2Fshoes%2Fthe-greta-ballet-flat-in-mesh%2FNP290%2F%3Fccode%3DRD5890\">ballet</a> and <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-24545786\">shiny</a>. They brighten up any outfit with that pop of color.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Thoughts? What are you excited to wear as the weather gets crisper? I also love  this brown sweater with just one button buttoned.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>P.S. <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2024/09/25/cupofjo-playlist-fall-2024/\">A playlist for long walks</a>, and <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2024/09/10/a-very-low-key-fall-checklist/\">our very low-key fall checklist</a>.</p>\n    <p>(Top photo, of course, from <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2020/06/30/comfort-movies/\">When Harry Met Sally</a>.)</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/09/04/5-pieces-im-excited-to-wear-this-fall/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We’d written on Cup of Jo about <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2023/09/13/bad-day-heres-a-bowl-of-pastina-for-you/\">how Dan turns around a bad day</a>, and he’d attended <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2022/12/14/cookie-swap-hosting-recipes/\">my holiday cookie swap</a> (although he’s more famous for <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C0-cHzQudRw/\">his own</a>!).</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-03-at-12.43.43-PM.png\" alt=\"dan pelosi new cookbook lets party\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>But then, last summer, <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/tag/toby/\">Toby</a> and I went upstate and ran into Dan and Gus at an outdoor pizza spot, and they immediately shepherded us to their picnic table and were so warm and wonderful that Toby didn’t stop talking about them the whole drive home.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dan-pelosi-lets-party-cookbook.jpg\" alt=\"dan pelosi lets party cookbook\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>So! I’m thrilled to report that Dan has written a new cookbook — <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=92005&amp;awinaffid=109390&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Flet-s-party-recipes-and-menus-for-celebrating-every-day-dan-pelosi%2F22478745\">Let’s Party: Recipes and Menus for Celebrating Every Day</a> — which came out yesterday.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_7535.jpeg\" alt=\"dan pelosi new cookbook lets party husband gus\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>How sweet is the dedication page?</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_7555.jpeg\" alt=\"dan pelosi new cookbook lets party\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>His book is full of entertaining showstoppers, like steak <i>over</i> frites…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pasta-dan-pelosi-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"dan pelosi new cookbook lets party\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dan-pelosi-salad-dressing-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"dan pelosi new cookbook lets party\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>…simple favorites, including a green salad with shallot dressing…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_7558.jpeg\" alt=\"dan pelosi new cookbook lets party\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>…and sweet treats. And, today, to celebrate tomato season <i>and</i> his cookbook, Dan has agreed to share his panzanella recipe. “You know that board game, Operation?” he says. “If it were based on me, you’d see a tomato where my heart should be.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Tuscan-Panzanella-Salad-scaled-1.jpeg\" alt=\"dan pelosi new cookbook lets party\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>Tuscan Panzanella Salad</strong><br/>\nfrom Dan Pelosi’s <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=92005&amp;awinaffid=109390&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Flet-s-party-recipes-and-menus-for-celebrating-every-day-dan-pelosi%2F22478745\">Let’s Party: Recipes and Menus for Celebrating Every Day</a><br/>\nServes 6 to 8</p>\n    <p>Says Dan: “I’ve always said panzanella salad is just a bread basket in drag. It’s the same satisfying taste of ripping apart a dinner roll and running it through vinegary oil but dressed up for the evening gown portion of the night. This salad began as Tuscan peasant food, a very smart way to get an extra meal out of stale loaves. Now you’ll find it with luxury accessories like cheese, stone fruits, or all kinds of proteins. When the tomatoes mingle with onions, red wine vinegar, oil, and plenty of salt and pepper, you’ve got everything you need in the world.”</p>\n    <p>3 pounds of heirloom tomatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces<br/>\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br/>\n1 large red onion, cut into 1-inch pieces<br/>\n1/4 cup red wine vinegar<br/>\n1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling<br/>\n1 (16-ounce) loaf crusty bread, torn into 1-inch pieces</p>\n    <p>Preheat the oven to 400°F. Place the tomatoes (and any collected juices from the cutting board) in a large bowl and add a few big pinches of salt and plenty of pepper. Toss gently to mix. Add the onion along with the vinegar and olive oil. Toss again.</p>\n    <p>On a rimmed sheet pan, drizzle the bread with a little bit of olive oil and toss to coat. Toast in the oven for about 10 minutes, until lightly golden. Remove and let the bread cool on the sheet pan, about 15 minutes.</p>\n    <p>Just before serving, add the bread to the bowl and toss to coat in the juices. Taste for seasoning and serve immediately.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Note: To make ahead, the bread can be toasted and stored in an airtight container at room temperature up to three days.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Thank you so much,  Dan!

    "body": "<p>September is already feeling so fresh—the kids are back in school, and I’m leaning into the cozy rituals that always give me a little thrill this time of year. Stocking up on new <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/work-from-home-essentials/\">supplies for my home office</a>, honing in on my <a href=\"https://camillestyles.substack.com/p/fall-wardrobe-essentials\">fall wardrobe essentials</a>, and returning to my <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/writing-rituals/\">daily writing routine</a> all feel like the reset I’ve been craving.</p>\n<p>More than anything, though, I’ve been focusing on staying present and finding joy in the small, unplanned moments. Over the long weekend, we had one of those rare, blissful days with nothing on the calendar. Instead of filling it with the things I thought we <i>should</i> do, I decided to just say yes to whatever the kids wanted. We played mini golf, waited in an hour-long line at La La Land for the viral strawberry matchas (Phoebe’s dream—they were actually worth it), and made a Target run for <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-24637653\">pumpkin spice tea</a> and a few festive little <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-24637653\">pumpkins</a> for her room.</p>\n<p>With no agenda other than being together, it ended up being a day I know I’ll remember—filled with laughter, connection, and the kinds of conversations I didn’t even know we needed. That’s the vibe I’m carrying into September: slowing down, leaning into simple pleasures, and remembering how good life feels when I don’t overcomplicate it.</p>\n<p>In that spirit, our editors are dishing out their <strong>Top Picks for September 2025</strong>—a mix of grounding, joyful finds that feel just right for a seasonal refresh.</p>\n<h2>Our Editors’ September 2025 Picks</h2>\n<h2><i>On Our Nightstands</i></h2>\n<h3><a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-22836363\">Arrae Tone Creatine Gummies</a></h3>\n<p>Like most women who are both chronically online and wellness-obsessed, <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/creatine-for-women/\">creatine</a> has been on my radar for ages. But I never found a brand that truly clicked—until now. Enter: Arrae. Their <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-22836363\">mixed berry gummies</a> (delicious, btw) slip right into my morning supplement lineup, and within a week, I noticed a serious boost in endurance for both cardio and strength workouts. And the name? Spot on. “Tone” is exactly what these gummies deliver. If building lean muscle is also your priority, consider this your new secret weapon. <i>– Isabelle Eyman, Editorial Strategist</i></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/the-women-by-kristin-hannah-hardcover/-/A-89029522?sid=955S&amp;afid=google&amp;TCID=OGS&amp;CPNG=Entertainment&amp;adgroup=59-1\"><i>The Women</i> by Kristin Hannah</a></h3>\n<p><i>The Women</i>by Kristin Hannah</p>\n<p>I’ve been in a bit of a reading slump, which is rare for the summertime when I’m typically tearing through novel after novel. The cure? <a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/the-women-by-kristin-hannah-hardcover/-/A-89029522?sid=955S&amp;afid=google&amp;TCID=OGS&amp;CPNG=Entertainment&amp;adgroup=59-1\"> The Women by Kristin Hannah</a>. Her best-seller, </p>\n<p><i>The Nightingale</i>is one of my all-time favorite books, and</p>\n<p><i>The Women</i>has the same perfect combination of historical fiction and romance. This book does come with a warning: you’ll be an emotional wreck at multiple points in the story! It’s a powerful, moving depiction of women during the Vietnam War, and the very real, complicated nature of love.</p>\n<p><i>– Bridget Chambers, Fashion Editor</i></p>\n<h2><i>In Our Carts</i></h2>\n<h3>The UBeauty Duo</h3>\n<p>The only skincare I’ve been using lately is this incredibly effective duo: the <a href=\"http://go.shopmy.us/p-24638139\">Resurfacing Compound </a>is my holy grail of exfoliation and resurfacing, while the <a href=\"http://go.shopmy.us/p-24638259\">SUPER Hydrator</a> locks moisture into skin for 48 hours and leaves the glowiest complexion. Yes, they’re an investment—but they’ve taken the place of all the other steps in my skincare routine, so—you do the (girl) math. <i>– Camille Styles</i></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-23779346\">Fridge to Face Blemish Defense Cooling Mist</a></h3>\n<p>Adding to my Sofie Pavitt praise: The best part of my morning is spritzing <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-23779346\">Fridge-to-Face Blemish</a> mist all over my face. I’m a big believer in niacinamide for minimizing breakouts and dark spots, and this delivers my daily dose in the best way. <i>– Langa Chinyoka, Beauty Editor</i></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-23989527\">Danessa Myricks Beauty Colorfix Stix</a></h3>\n<p>I’ve been loving the brand-new <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-23989527\">Danessa Myricks C</a><a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-23989527\">olor Fix</a><a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-23989527\"> sticks</a> on my eyes for a night out or a dinner with the girls. The iridescent finish might seem intimidating at first, but every shade is surprisingly wearable and easy to apply. Even just a dab in the corner of my eye adds a lot to a look. <i>– Langa Chinyoka, Beauty Editor</i></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.calpaktravel.com/products/terra-26l-backpack-duffel?pb=0\">Terra 26L Laptop Duffel Backpack</a></h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/editor-picks-september-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I was doing sit-ups when, suddenly, the left side of my body was overtaken by tingling. A colorful corona bloomed in my left eye. I found it hard to speak. My wife drove me to the emergency room. There was a cardiology investigation. Then there were others. I got a neurologist, and then a gastroenterologist. I started getting monthly blood tests. Doctors scanned my brain and tested my nerves. Each test showed me to be in good health. And yet symptoms of <i>something</i> have persisted. Where I live, family doctors are hard to come by, so I’ve been required to piece together my own care. My wife provides tremendous emotional support, but we’re not all so fortunate. Where, then, should we look for solace? Viola Zhou’s mother has lived with chronic kidney problems for two decades. As China’s aging population puts increased pressure on the nation’s healthcare infrastructure, Zhou’s mother has seen her marriage fracture and her daughter leave the country. In her isolation, she has turned to DeepSeek, an AI-powered chatbot, for medical guidance, tasking it with interpreting her medical records, changing her diet, and reducing her immunosuppressant dose. She warmly thanks the chatbot, and it responds in kind. Zhou brings her mother’s chat records to specialists, who point out the errors in Dr. DeepSeek’s responses. And yet Zhou’s mother dismisses the shortcomings. “DeepSeek is more humane,” she tells Zhou. “Doctors are more like machines.” These days, there is no shortage of stories about people in crisis who turn to AI for support, sometimes to perilous ends. Zhou’s feature reminds us that such stories are symptoms—of technological limits, isolation, and dysfunctional healthcare systems. —<a href=\"https://longreads.com/author/fitzheraldtribune/\">BF</a></p>\n<h2>2. <a href=\"https://www.nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/god-dog/?src=longreads\">God Dog</a></h2>\n<p><i>Mina Tavakoli</i> | <i>n+1</i> | <i>September 2, 2025</i> | <i>3,089 words</i></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/09/05/the-top-5-longreads-of-the-week-577/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>There is a moment of palpable tension at the center of Lulu Garcia-Navarro’s interview with Arundhati Roy, the Booker Prize-winning author of <i>The God of Small Things</i>. Garcia-Navarro asks Roy a series of questions about her persecution in India, including threats of arrest and the banning of her book, <i>Azadi</i>, in Kashmir. Roy grows circumspect; the interview seems, briefly, to teeter. Then the tension breaks, and Roy expands on the value of communication under authoritarian rule. It’s a stirring conclusion, and a terribly timely reminder of the power of a well-told story.</p><blockquote><p>The reason that I don’t talk about it is because I would much rather write what I want to write than have some controversy about something you say off the cuff. It’s like they’re always trying to trip people up and trying to prevent you from thinking clearly. This culture of fear is everywhere here. People are arrested for things they say on Facebook, on Twitter, or what they don’t say. In the U.S., it seems new to you, but we have been living with this, and it’s increasingly becoming normalized. It’s a very disturbing situation, especially for Muslims, where it doesn’t stop with just court cases and jail. It goes on to lynching and murder and social boycotts and economic boycotts and homes being bulldozed. You meet people who have stories that you can’t look away from.</p></blockquote><h2>More author interview picks</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/08/08/spotify-streaming-liz-pelly/\">Sister Inquiry</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“The Pelly twins on music, writing, and life beyond algorithms.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2024/05/01/salman-rushdie-the-world-has-abandoned-realism/\">Salman Rushdie: “The world has abandoned realism”</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“’Words are the only victors,’ Rushdie wrote in his last novel, ‘Victory City.’”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2023/03/07/margaret-atwood-is-ready-to-let-it-rip/\">Margaret Atwood Is Ready to Let It Rip</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“With exactly nothing to prove and no one left to impress, she seemed happiest bantering.”</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/09/04/arundhati-roy-interview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>Quick, name an annual televised event you’re powerless to resist watching even a <i>little</i> bit of. You said the Westminster Dog Show, right? Stop lying, of course you did. As a spectacle of both soul-cleansing cuteness and prissiness, it’s damn near unmatched. Behind the scenes, though? Chaos. Into the fray wades Mina Tavakoli, eyebrow arched above a gimlet eye. A don’t-miss piece for dog lovers and haters alike. </p><blockquote><p>First placed on earth as wolves, then domesticated as a sort of gift from mankind, to mankind, the non-dog-show dog is an obvious human benison. Today, they serve a role not unlike children, with all the typical hallmarks of those of our species aged 0–3 (occasional tantrums, eternal neediness, financial toll, effluvia), without the ensuing journey to personhood that eventually pries child and parent apart. A dog will not threaten to go to college in a different state, will not disappoint you by burning your curtains, stealing your liquor, marrying a moron; will not struggle with calculus, home ownership, suicidal ideation. Any dog owner is seeking the companionship of a terminally illiterate and devoted sponge.</p></blockquote><h2>\n\t\t\t\t\tMore picks from <i>n+1</i>\n\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/07/25/in-real-life/\">In Real Life</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“The first rule of the cloisters is to honor your vow of silence.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/07/16/personal-belgians/\">Personal Belgians</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“To love cycling of all sports in 2025 requires a hard look at yourself, and perhaps some special pleading..”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/06/10/at-immigration-court/\">At Immigration Court</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“The ICE agents stuck out for their stillness and homogeneity.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/05/22/pirates-of-the-ayahuasca/\">Pirates of the Ayahuasca</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“There have been times in my life when I wouldn’t have taken seriously the possibility that a South American psychedelic could help ease the horror of systems collapse.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/04/16/diary-of-a-spreadsheet/\">Diary of a Spreadsheet</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Landlords raise rents, evict, harass, all without hesitation.

    "body": "<p><i>Robert Weintraub</i> | <a href=\"https://magazine.atavist.com/\">The Atavist Magazine</a> | August 2025 | 2,613 words (9 minutes)</p>\n<p><i>This is an excerpt from issue no. 166, “ American Hindenburg.”</i></p>\n<h2><strong>One</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>It would be</strong> the greatest day in the history of Akron, Ohio. Forget the opening of the Ohio and Erie Canal, which allowed the budding metropolis to become an industrial center. No, the Rubber City—so-called because of the factories established there by Goodrich, Firestone, General Tire, and Goodyear—had never seen anything like this. <i>Akron</i> means “high” in Greek, and now, fittingly, the future was up in the sky.</p>\n<p>Before the sun rose on August 8, 1931, people poured into the streets. Lloyd Weil, Akron’s mayor, had declared a holiday, freeing from their desks and assembly lines those workers lucky enough to have jobs during the depths of the Great Depression. Cars converged from all directions, carrying people from Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Erie, Toledo, and farther afield. Many navigated epic traffic jams en route to their destination: the Goodyear-Zeppelin Airdock, where the day’s action would take place.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://magazine.atavist.com/\"> The Atavist</a>, our sister publication, publishes one deeply reported, elegantly designed story each month. Support </p>\n<p><i>The Atavist</i>by</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://magazine.atavist.com/subscribe/\">becoming a member</a>.</p>\n<p>In all, some 250,000 people came to witness the official launch of the new U.S. Navy airship. It would be called the USS <i>Akron</i>, after the city where it was engineered and built over a span of nearly three years. Dubbed by the press “the Queen of the Skies,” it was the culmination of America’s effort to conquer the heavens using dirigibles—vessels steered through the atmosphere buoyed by gas that was lighter than air. Aviation leaders and enthusiasts were eager to see the new ship take flight; Amelia Earhart was among the luminaries who came to Akron for the launch.</p>\n<p>The city had the air of a carnival. Goodyear offered an aerial view of the festivities in a small blimp, a technological predecessor of the mighty airship, for a dollar a ride. A music teacher for the city’s schools had written a song for the occasion, and now glee clubs stood ready to belt out “Ode to <i>Akron</i>”:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Akron</p><i>, beautiful airship,</i><i>Speed on your way;</i><br/>Akron<i>, beautiful airship,</i><i>Greet lands far away;</i><i>May you carry the message,</i><i>“Brotherhood of Man”;</i><br/>Akron<i>, beautiful airship,</i><i>As the world you span</i>.</blockquote>\n<p>Thousands of people queued up in the bright sunshine to enter the egg-shaped hangar where the airship was moored. The building was so enormous it contained its own climate—rain occasionally fell inside. As the crowds streamed in, listening to no less than five brass bands blaring away, spectators blinked to adjust their eyes. Before them sat a behemoth.</p>\n<p>Locals had seen Goodyear crafts drifting overhead before—the company had manufactured balloons since 1912, and its now famous blimps since 1925—but the <i>Akron </i>was an order of magnitude larger. It stood 14 stories high, ran 785 feet long, and weighed 400,000 pounds when fully loaded, dwarfing anything that had ever taken flight. The ship’s cavernous body, formed by a skeleton of curved metal sheathed in lacquered cotton, could have held everyone assembled, though the <i>Akron</i>’s official capacity was 2,200. It required fewer than 100 crew to fly.</p>\n<p>As two radio broadcasters, James Wallington of NBC and Ted Husing of CBS, competed for superlatives to describe the ship to rapt audiences around the nation, the guest of honor arrived—the First Lady of the United States, Mrs. Lou Hoover, Herbert’s vivacious wife. She would perform the christening.</p>\n<p>Preceding her at the microphone was the man most responsible for the day: Rear Admiral William Moffett, known in military circles as the “air admiral.” He reached out his hand and placed it gently on the <i>Akron</i>’s nose as he spoke. “We do not lead the world in our merchant marine, nor, alas, in our navy,” he said,” but we do, by the construction of this great airship, now take the lead in lighter-than-air in the world.” A roar went up from the crowd.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/09/04/zeppelin-navy-aircraft-disaster/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>Mary Oliver is one of the most beloved and reviled poets in the English language. While legions of readers find her work uniquely legible and inspirational, fellow poets tend to dismiss it as shallow and sentimental. Maggie Millner, a poet herself, examines this reputational dichotomy and finds revelation in Oliver’s relationship with shame:</p><blockquote><p>Oliver’s detractors, pro- and anti-lyric alike, show all the classic symptoms of this sort of shame: a discomfort with her work’s digestibility, earnestness, and apparent disinterest in other people—and a fear about what the popularity of such work might say about</p><i>them</i>. Her commercial success alone seems to imply her complicity in American capitalism; could a true devotee of observation and stillness—someone aspiring to be the “tiniest nail in the house of the universe”—really have churned out such a large and lucrative corpus? And why did she seem not to know about modernism?<p>It was easy to detect shame in the contempt of Oliver’s critics, but it hadn’t occurred to me to diagnose it in the author herself: such a distinctly social emotion seemed unlikely to have inspired so many poems about the nonhuman world. Yet as I revisited her work, what struck me again and again was the tinge of social difference that suffuses her best poetry. Oliver’s own childhood was intensely lonely, marred by abuse and neglect that she referred to in interviews but treated only obliquely in her poems. It was this early trauma, she said, that first sent her both out of doors and into books. “Oh, I wanted // to be easy / in the peopled kingdoms, / to take my place there, / but there was none // that I could find / shaped like me,” she writes in a poem I love called “Trilliums.” Her more boring poems might pretend to a state of prelapsarian innocence, but the most vivid ones unfold in the fallen world inhabited by this highly self-conscious speaker, who is dogged by feelings of shame and unbelonging. As Oliver writes in “The Moths”: “I was always running around, looking / at this and that. // If I stopped / the pain / was unbearable.” What my favorite Oliver poems seem to dramatize, I realized gradually, is not a successful defection from human society but a deeply moving failure to leave it.</p></blockquote><h2>More picks about poetry</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/05/22/stuff-hoarding-maximalism/\">Maximalisma</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“A professor endeavors to separate treasure from trash—before her children have to do it for her.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/05/20/in-defense-of-despair/\">In Defense of Despair</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“The feeling is most commonly framed as an end point, a level of despondency that cannot be overcome.

Here I am looking not just for individual scenes per se, but a scene or set of scenes that comprise one event or a continuous piece of action. Admittedly this is subjective and there is no right or wrong, the point is simply to break down the script into a series of parts which you then can use dig into the script’s structure and themes.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>The value of this exercise:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>We pare down the story to its most constituent parts: Scenes.</li>\n      <li>By doing this, we consciously explore the structure of the narrative.</li>\n      <li>A scene-by-scene breakdown creates a foundation for even deeper analysis of the story.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Today: <i>Destroyer </i>(2018)<i>. </i>You can download a PDF of the script <a href=\"https://www.scriptslug.com/assets/scripts/destroyer-2018.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n    <p>Written by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://gointothestory.blcklst.com/script-analysis-destroyer-scene-by-scene-breakdown-af36dcfa4bdb?source=rss----cd46c47af086---4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Self-Doubt Versus Confidence</h2>\n<p>If you want to crush self-doubt and get more confident as a writer, you’ve come to the right place. Here’s some common beliefs of writers and how to crush them for good. Ready? Let’s go …</p>\n<h2>1) “I don’t know if my writing is good enough.”</h2>\n<p>I remember having self-doubt about my own writing. I agonised for ages about whether I was ‘good enough’.</p>\n<p>Then someone said something very wise to me: <i>‘You don’t get to decide that.’ </i></p>\n<p>That person was absolutely right. It didn’t matter what<i> I</i> thought … it mattered what agents, producers, publishers, readers or viewers thought! All I had to do was give my writing to them.</p>\n<p>So I did … and here’s the REALLY interesting thing: some of those people thought my writing was great. Others thought it sucked. Some didn’t even notice it was even there.</p>\n<p>So really it didn’t matter if my writing was ‘good enough’. It just had to exist. Boom.</p>\n<h2>2) “I don’t know if I have what it takes.”</h2>\n<p>This is an interesting one, because what are we REALLY saying here … Perhaps:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <i>‘Am I talented enough?’</i>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <i>‘Can I sustain my career?’</i>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <i>‘Can I get paid for writing?’</i>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Those seem to be the most common questions hiding beneath. Well guess what, it’s not talent that sustains your career. It’s craft, yes but also networking, resilience and perseverance. And yes, you stick it out long enough and you’ll probably get paid for your writing at least once. Facts.</p>\n<h2>3) “I’m embarrassed to call myself a ‘real’ writer.”</h2>\n<p>Of course you are. Society tells us constantly we don’t have a ‘real’ job. It tells us all we do is play around and mess about. It claims any writer who wants to be paid for their work should give their stories away for free, too.</p>\n<p>Hell, pro writers even say shit like <i>‘I’m JUST a writer, my husband/wife/spouse has the real job of teaching, nursing, police officer [INSERT SO-CALLED REAL JOB HERE].’ </i></p>\n<p>But here’s the thing. When the 2020 pandemic occurred, what did everyone not only WANT, but NEED?</p>\n<p>That’s right … stories.</p>\n<p>The world went through an appalling trauma. Millions of people were ill; lots died. Families and individuals could not see their loved ones. Everyone’s stabilising routines were literally junked overnight as we were confined to our homes.</p>\n<p>But who was there for us? Oh, that’s right … CREATIVES.</p>\n<p>Novels, TV shows and movies gave comfort to people all over the world. Now society might have already forgotten that, but don’t be complicit in your own erasure.</p>\n<p>You’re a real writer. You always have been and you always will be … as long as you write. <strong>MORE:  Repeat After Me: You ARE NOT An ‘Aspiring Writer’</strong></p>\n<h2>4) “I’m struggling to find my creative voice again after taking time off.”</h2>\n<p>It’s common for any creative to struggle with self-doubt and confidence after a break. In my work with creatives, this is most common in female writers when they’ve taken time out to have children. However, ANY writer can struggle this way.</p>\n<p>I frequently invite creatives to imagine their creativity like <a href=\"https://youtu.be/wbl67-TRUzM?si=TGioPIzwJ5UzTz_S\"> one of those toy sparking flywheels</a> from the 1970s and 1980s. As the wheel goes around, they light up because the mechanism creates sparks.</p>\n<p>But most crucially, the wheel only goes around causing those sparks because of the plunger. The user has to push it in and pull it out to create those sparks and the movement of the wheel.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>The plunger = your effort</li>\n      <li>The spark = your creativity</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>In other words, you only get the creative stuff by putting the effort in. When you first start, the sparks are smallest. The longer you continue pushing the plunger, the bigger the sparks become.</p>\n<p>So don’t be dissuaded by the fact it takes a while to get going again. Like the flywheel, the longer you stick at it, the more your brain will spark with great ideas. It’s PHYSICS, baby!</p>\n<h2>5) “I don’t receive any support from the people in my life.”</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2025/09/5-tips-to-crush-self-doubt-get-more-confident-as-a-writer.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>We know that Alaskan communities pay high prices at the grocery store, largely due to the cost of shipping food by road, water, and air from the lower 48. But with trade tensions simmering between the US and Canada, and the premier of British Columbia threatening to put tolls on trucks headed to the Last Frontier, Eva Holland’s investigation for <i>High Country News</i> discovered that among the obstacles between Alaskans and the food on their table, the threat of tolls is only the beginning.</p><blockquote><p>I’ve lived alongside the Alaska Highway, where it passes through the Yukon capital of Whitehorse, for most of the past 16 years. The tolls have yet to be implemented — although Eby’s government has created the legislative framework to do so — but I was fascinated by the threat, and by the paradox of a road built for Alaska’s defense transformed into a glaring weakness by unpredictable foreign relations. I pictured Alaska as a balloon bobbing at the end of a very long string, with Canada, an unexpected adversary, wielding a pair of scissors.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It struck me that, for a state where many residents pride themselves on their self-</p><br/>sufficiency — and Alaskans in general are some of the most quietly competent and resourceful folks I’ve ever met — their food supply was unusually dependent on public infrastructure. Down South, private sector producers might rely mainly on a functioning road network to get their food to private retailers. But in Alaska, so much more was in play, across ocean, land and air.</blockquote><h2>More picks about Alaska</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/08/20/where-the-dogs-run/\">Where the Dogs Run</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Along the Yukon River, declining salmon populations threaten the future of the region’s sled dogs—and the communities that rely on them.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2022/12/01/in-alaska-a-mystery-over-disappearing-whales/\">In Alaska, A Mystery Over Disappearing Whales</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Sam Ellis his colleagues have shown that killer whales with living grandmothers are more likely to survive than those without.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2024/04/11/bats-of-the-midnight-sun/\">Bats of the Midnight Sun</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Reimer has spent over a decade specializing in chiropterology, the study of the species with “’winged hands.’”</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/09/08/alaska-food-precarity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Here I am looking not just for individual scenes per se, but a scene or set of scenes that comprise one event or a continuous piece of action. Admittedly this is subjective and there is no right or wrong, the point is simply to break down the script into a series of parts which you then can use dig into the script’s structure and themes.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>The value of this exercise:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>We pare down the story to its most constituent parts: Scenes.</li>\n      <li>By doing this, we consciously explore the structure of the narrative.</li>\n      <li>A scene-by-scene breakdown creates a foundation for even deeper analysis of the story.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Today: <i>Flight </i>(2012)<i>. </i>You may download the script <a href=\"https://www.scriptslug.com/assets/scripts/flight-2012.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n    <p>Written by John Gatins, starring Denzel Washington, directed by Robert Zemeckis.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://gointothestory.blcklst.com/script-analysis-flight-scene-by-scene-breakdown-e8326381cfcf?source=rss----cd46c47af086---4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>LONDON — An exquisite rhythm rolls across the sheer mass of Emily Kam Kngwarray’s paintings, produced in prolific bursts of creativity between 1980 and 1996, the last decade and a half of her life. As she worked at the forefront of a movement that sought to translate millennia-old Aboriginal cultural traditions onto media such as acrylic, canvas, and batik, much of her oeuvre is marked by a strong visual cohesion. Colorful fields of dots and linear motifs in earthy tones proliferate across the entirety of each picture plane, often covering the edges of the canvases, creating an impression of an expansiveness that seems to incorporate both microcosm and macrocosm, landscape and human, ancestral time and contemporary pressures.</p>\n<p>Kngwarray was an Anmatyerr woman born in Alhalker, in what is now known as the Northern Territory of Australia. An important Elder within her community, she is credited with breaking down the distinctions between fine art, craft, and cultural practice, gaining international recognition for her contribution to contemporary art. Her paintings and batik silks are inextricably rooted in the lands on which she was born, which in her earliest years were untouched by White settlers. However, when she was a child, they colonized Alhalker, and their introduction of sheep, cattle, and fences irrevocably changed her people’s Country.</p>\n<p>This concept of “Country” is key to understanding Kngwarray’s work and the culture in which she developed her practice. As an explanatory wall text puts it, “For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, the concept … encompasses the lands, skies and waters to which they are deeply connected, over countless generations. Country is a shared place of spiritual, social and geographical origins.” In Kngwarray’s paintings, such as “Ankerr (Emu)” (1989), this manifests as a map-like depiction of emu footprints emerging from a web of patterns and dots, charting the routes taken by the birds between underground water sources.</p>\n<p>Kngwarray’s work also draws closely on Dreamings: ancestral beings who manifest in the plants, animals, and natural phenomena of Country. Dreamings are intrinsic to Kngwarray’s worldview and practice, with a focus on animals and plants which are special to her, including the <i>ankerr</i> (emu) and <i>anwerlarr</i> (pencil yam). Yet in Western contexts, such traditions have too often been <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/australian-literatures-legacies-of-cultural-appropriation-103672\">exoticized, flattening their complexity and cultural significance</a>. The Tate show doesn’t openly refer to previous Western cultural or curatorial practices in relation to art by Aboriginal peoples, but it does take pains to explicate the respectful approach used throughout this show, using terms like Country and Dreaming without romanticization, and applying spellings of Anmatyerr words deemed appropriate by Kngwarray’s family and community. In addition, the exhibition texts use Aboriginal place names alongside English ones, as well as Anmatyerr words for the plants and animals Kngwarray depicts. </p>\n<p>Some of Kngwarray’s paintings relate to Awely, women’s ceremonies celebrating certain animals or plants, in which they grind pigments to paint dots and patterns on each other’s bodies. Included in the exhibition is a video in which Kngwarray’s family members perform one such ceremony; they also contributed to the curating and textual interpretation of the exhibition. The show draws convincing parallels between these rituals and the texture, techniques, and patterning of some of the large-scale works displayed nearby, such as “Alhalker – My Country” (1992), a heavily layered tall panel dotted with shades of rust and ocher. Swirling patterns emerge and fade before the viewer’s eyes, recalling the cyclical verses of ceremonial songs, or the tradition of temporary sand drawings made by women to tell stories.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1034784/emily-kam-kngwarray-language-of-country-tate-modern/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Robert Grosvenor, whose work resisted artistic classification for more than six decades, died in Long Island, New York, on Wednesday, September 3, at the age of 88. His death was <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOMDlpIDtiM/\">announced</a> by Paula Cooper Gallery, which has represented the artist since the gallery opened in 1968.</p>\n<p>Grosvenor was primarily known for large-scale abstract sculptures, although his oeuvre also encompassed photography, drawing, and collage. He first gained recognition in the 1960s, participating in seminal Minimalist group exhibitions like <i>Primary Structures </i>(1966) at the Jewish Museum and <i>Minimal Art</i> (1968) at the Gemeentemuseum Den Haag. He often used unorthodox industrial materials and toyed with concepts of spatial dynamics and function, all with a dry wit and opaqueness that, at times, perplexed his audience. </p>\n<p>Grosvenor charted his own creative path, diverging from Minimalism’s strict formalism. His diverse output spanned many forms, from seemingly gravity-defying cantilevered steel structures to fractured wooden beams and the outer shells of vehicles set bluntly on the floor. He deliberately left much of his work untitled and presented little explanation, as with a complex 2020 sculpture composed of stacked cinder blocks, rubber lining, and stagnant water that art critic and <i>Hyperallergic</i> <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/author/john-yau/\">contributor</a> John Yau <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/539650/robert-grosvenor-at-karma/\">described</a> as “simple and brilliantly economical in its construction” while also “funny and generous.”</p>\n<p>“Grosvenor is able to walk right up to the line separating art from function without crossing over or commenting on it,” Yau wrote. “That’s his gift, and I don’t know of another sculptor who has it.”</p>\n<p><i>Robert Grosvenor</i>at 155 Wooster Street in April 1975 (© Robert Grosvenor, photo by Geoffrey Clements; courtesy Paula Cooper Gallery, New York)</p>\n<p>Born in New York City in 1937, Grosvenor grew up in Rhode Island and Arizona. As a teenager, he studied art and design in Europe, receiving a classical education at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Dijon, the Ecole Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs in Paris, and the Università de Perugia in Italy. As a student, he found inspiration in experimental artists like Yves Klein, Lucio Fontana, and Piero Manzoni, he told the<i> Brooklyn Rail</i> in a <a href=\"https://brooklynrail.org/2019/03/art/ROBERT-GROSVENOR-with-Alex-Bacon/\">2019 interview</a>.</p>\n<p>After returning to the United States in 1959 to complete a six-month military service requirement, he moved to New York, where he forged friendships in the art scene. He became acquainted with members of the cooperative Park Place Gallery, directed by Paula Cooper, and the Green Gallery, which gave an early platform to artists including Yayoi Kusama, Mark di Suvero, and Donald Judd. He described his art of that time to the<i> Brooklyn Rail </i>as “paintings that came off the wall,” and in 1962 he began exhibiting it in group shows.</p>\n<p><i>Robert Grosvenor</i>at Paula Cooper Gallery (© Robert Grosvenor, courtesy Paula Cooper Gallery, New York)</p>\n<p>According to Paula Cooper Gallery, he felt that his career began with the 1965 exhibition of “Transoxiana” — a 31-foot angular cantilevered sculpture that was later featured in the pivotal show <i>Primary Structures</i> alongside works by Judd and such other Minimalist pioneers as Sol LeWitt, Robert Morris, and Anne Truitt. He also garnered acclaim for his dynamic geometric works, as in “Topanga” (1965), which he built after seeing a picture of a massive solar telescope in Arizona’s Sonoran desert, and an untitled all-white steel structure from 1968–70 that hovers midair from cables attached to the ceiling. The latter was featured in his first <a href=\"https://www.paulacoopergallery.com/exhibitions/robert-grosvenor19#tab:slideshow\">solo show</a> at Paula Cooper Gallery. </p>\n<p>Departing from the Minimalist movement during the ’70s, Grosvenor experimented with wooden sculptures constructed from broken lengths of pine planks and found telephone poles. Resting horizontally on the ground, they featured symmetrical fractures, and at times were blackened with creosote, a toxic, oily preservative. In the following decades, he employed found materials like corrugated steel and concrete blocks​​ to create <a href=\"https://www.paulacoopergallery.com/exhibitions/recent-sculpture2#tab:slideshow;tab-1:thumbnails\">unclassifiable structures that wavered between architecture and sculpture</a>. His most recent works included vehicular floor sculptures stemming from his lifelong fascination with cars and boats.</p>\n<p>“His work of the past twenty years was among his very best, at times making that of younger sculptors appear awfully conservative in comparison. In comparison? There was none. His was a world really unto itself,” wrote curator Bob Nickas in a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOL0TsFjvka/?img_index=1\">statement</a> for the New York Art Critics Association.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039765/robert-grosvenor-dies-at-88/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>As I circled around the dozens of booths along the three wide lanes at Art on Paper on Thursday, September 4, one stood out above the rest. On the bare white walls were Moleskine journals, much like the small ones I use, except these were spread open to Nicolas V Sanchez’s ballpoint pen drawings of the many corners of his family members’ homes.</p>\n<p>This year marks Sanchez’s eighth time showing at Manhattan’s Art on Paper, he told me, alongside around 100 exhibitors at Pier 36 through Sunday, September 7.</p>\n<p>Smiling infectiously in his booth, Sanchez stood among his intimate journal works depicting pastoral and familial scenes from his Midwest-meets-Mexican upbringing, created with a combination of ballpoint pens. Ranging in price from about $3,000 to $6,000, three of Sanchez’s works had already sold during the first hours of the fair before I arrived, including two notebooks containing drawings of horses and one depicting the outside of his aunt’s fridge with forensic detail.</p>\n<p>“Because it’s pen, I can’t erase it, so I just have to keep going,” Sanchez said of his process drawing on the 4.5 x 7-inch (~11.4 x 17.8 cm) notebooks. “You just commit to it at a certain point, and then that’s kind of the beauty of it.”</p>\n<p>Sanchez’s still life of his aunt’s fridge, “Refri de mi Tia Blanca” (2025), features ruled notebook paper letters from his nephew held up by magnets. The biggest challenge in creating this piece, he said, was the meta task of ensuring that the letter within the notebook appeared to have been written in pencil rather than sketched by pen.</p>\n<p>The Los Angeles-based gallery Arts Unified’s booth featured another writing accessory. Illustrator Adam Greener’s clipboards initially stunned me due to their gargantuan size, but their familiar form encouraged me to take a closer look.</p>\n<p>Greener’s $13,500 “Choices XL” (2022) is a giant ruled piece of paper tucked into a giant clipboard on which the sentence “I will start making better choices” is repeatedly written. A gallery staff member told me that Greener’s work draws upon his school years, during which his doodles would land him in detention. Nearby clipboard pages inscribed with comically blown-up “F” grades transported me back to failing out of the Albuquerque Public School gifted program (in writing, by the way) circa 2011.</p>\n<p>At the Lower East Side-based gallery Van Der Plas Gallery’s booth, I found two artists who were excited to talk about their work: Susan Day, who flew in from Canada that morning, and New York City-based artist Jason McLean. Day was selling her “dream-inspired” drawings of air traffic control maps of Canadian airspace.</p>\n<p>“This is the stuff that kind of keeps me going,” Day said, describing the fair. “It puts my work into some context, and I think having other people’s eyes see my work … is a huge connection for me.”</p>\n<p>Day said her experiences at the New York art fairs bring her much more traffic than she usually receives in Canada. Showing alongside her was McLean, a fellow Canadian, who walked me through “Future Directions” (2025), a self-portrait that is also a map of New York City.</p>\n<p>Still other kinds of paper media could be found at Art on Paper’s fair within a fair, BOOKsmART, such as mixed-media artist Seth Apter’s stunning display of art books meditating on time and aging. Last year, Apter told me, he sold 12 of the 17 books he brought with him to the meta fair, despite initially doubting the fair audience’s interest in artist books. At his booth this year, his works were priced between $600 and $1800. Typically, he told me, he sells his works online and at institutions where he teaches.</p>\n<p>For my final stop, I went where the money was, like the brain-rotten Gen-Zer I am.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039661/art-on-paper-2025-leaps-off-the-page/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>A woman roaming the mountainside splashes her face in an unseen stream. Her hair drips toward a crystal prism glowing in her steady hand. Mist fills the space around her; her silhouette is gilded in light.</p>\n<p>In this scene from the 1932 film <i>Das blaue Licht </i>(The Blue Light), a plucky heroine emerges from an Alpine range. “Because a woman is the only one who can climb a dangerous mountain,” IMDb’s synopsis reads, “villagers regard her as a witch.” From today’s vantage, the clip exudes a feminist vibe of a piece with a Patagonia ad. You could be forgiven for feeling a wee bit stirred as she (literally) scales the sublime. And for not realizing that this woman — who also directed the film — would soon be the grande dame of fascist cinema.</p>\n<p>Or, as the new documentary <i> Riefenstahl</i> provocatively asks: </p>\n<p><i>Could you</i>?</p>\n<p>Andres Veiel’s movie makes a quiet — and disquieting — case for the insidious potential of the moving image, whose seductive power can be easily harnessed to heinous political agendas. That the propaganda in question comes from Leni Riefenstahl, a woman who directed her singular talent toward not only valorizing but <i>inventing </i>the Nazi aesthetic, throws into relief how foolish it is to reflexively affiliate a woman’s degree of artistic ambition or achievement with automatic progress. </p>\n<p><i>Olympia</i>, with Joseph Goebbels and Hermann Göring on the tribune (1936) (© Vincent Productions)</p>\n<p>Excavating archives <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/24/berlin-museum-offers-glimpse-of-leni-riefenstahl-estate\">recently gifted</a> to Berlin’s Museum of Photography, Veiel visually foregrounds the materiality of film, the inevitably tangled nature of Leni’s art and ideology. A celluloid strip whirs before us, pausing to reveal three figures in a field, a bucolic scene until one recognizes the inverted likeness of a trio of SS officers Here the documentary cuts to an iconic views of 1934 Nuremberg: Throngs of Germans furiously greet their beloved Führer, their bodies packed so close that one loses sight of where one human being ends and another begins. “As he spoke his very first words,” Leni recounts of the rally almost 50 years later, “I was overcome by a very peculiar feeling, my whole body … trembling. And I was somehow captured, as if by a magnetic force.”</p>\n<p>If Leni was enchanted by Hitler’s presence, she did all she could with her films to arouse that same captivation in her country(wo)men. “The camera pans over to one side, and then it pans back over to the other side,” she avidly narrates as she reviews a clip of <i>Triumph of the Will </i>(1935). Her 90-year-old hand proudly swaying to the beat of Herbert Windt’s soundtrack, she adds, “These two shots combine to create the form of a circle, and the resulting effect is very powerful.”</p>\n<p><i>Riefenstahl</i>’s head editor, Stephan Krumbiegel, also grasps the power of strategic juxtapositions — exposing not only Leni’s Nazi infatuation, but that of the German people at large. Following a sequence of unsettling shots of the Nuremberg rally, we pause on a close-up of a girl peeking out from behind a row of soldiers. Her short hair frames her mischievous grin; her side part parallels the swastika behind her. She, like Leni, exudes “girl-power” swagger seemingly at odds with masculinist fascism — and in many other contexts, she, like Leni, would inspire rather than repulse. </p>\n<p>And that is the point. <i>Riefenstahl </i>acknowledges Leni’s scrappy charm while also laying bare her terrifying legacy. Whether it’s taking a lover 40 years her junior or setting off to live among the Nuba people of Sudan, she had no issue flouting standard feminine decorum. Nor did she have a problem with building her career on the goose-stepping heels of a murderous regime. “What responsibility should I have?” she rebuffs a journalist decades later. “Back then 90% of people were enthralled by Hitler. You think I should have been a resistance fighter?”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039657/examining-the-legacy-of-fascist-cinema-grand-dame-leni-riefenstahl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It features a judge in a traditional white wig and black robes using a gavel to hit a protester, who is shown holding a blood-spattered picket sign. According to the caption of the post, the mural was painted on the exterior of the Royal Courts of Justice building in central London.</p>\n    <p>The <i> BBC</i> reported that the mural was quickly concealed with a large plastic sheet and two metal barricades under the watch of two security guards. </p>\n    <p>Although the street artist does not make any explicit mention of a particular event, his latest artwork appeared shortly after mass arrests at a protest opposing a government <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93901n9z0qo\">ban on the activist group Palestine Action</a> on Saturday, September 6. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/BANKSY-COURT-OF-JUSTICE--1200x1033.jpg?resize=1200%2C1033&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>In July, the UK government designated Palestine Action as a terrorist organization, making support of the group a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The ban was put in place after the group <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/raf-brize-norton-palestine-action-planes-8467a20bcd088e24c3fe061852b33ba2\">vandalized two military aircraft with red paint and crowbars</a> in June. Saturday’s demonstration, which was held in Parliament Square, reportedly gathered an <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rvly00440o\">estimated 1,500 attendees</a>, who carried homemade cardboard and paper signs reading, “I oppose genocide.

    "body": "<p>Obsession often does an artist good. That idea she can’t stop thinking about, that uncompleted project that keeps her up at night — such fixations compel her to create, focus her efforts, and keep her returning to the desk, the stage, the studio. But not all obsessions are equally generative.</p>\n<p>Stephanie Wambugu’s stimulating debut novel, <i>Lonely Crowds </i>(2025), centers on Ruth, a painter, and Maria, a filmmaker. The two women are pulled into each other’s orbits as children and prove unable, or unwilling, to extricate themselves. “When I met Maria,” a middle-aged Ruth recalls, “I learned that without an obsession life was impossible to live.” But time and again, her devotion to Maria<i> </i>keeps Ruth from living her life, convincing her she is a minor character in her own story rather than its author, even as her career takes her into the supposed upper echelons of the art world. </p>\n<p>Ruth’s fascination with Maria is instant: As a nine-year-old, she notices her in line to purchase school uniforms — they are the only two Black girls in their grade — and begins dreaming up their life together. The reality is more complicated. Ruth, the reserved, self-effacing daughter of Kenyan immigrants, and Maria, a rebellious orphan living with her unstable aunt, develop a fast but lopsided relationship. Ruth’s infatuation with the precocious Maria, which straddles the platonic and romantic, goes unrequited, her gestures of care largely unreturned.</p>\n<p>But Ruth’s obsession later serves her as a budding teenaged artist: Maria becomes her muse. When Ruth’s father gives her pencils and a sketchbook (a gift, she recalls, that “opened a hatch that would not close again”), she starts drawing “impressionistic, muted half nudes” of Maria — “a girl whose face I’d seen so many times, from so many angles,” she says, “and who still appeared novel and even alarming depending on the light of the hour.” Ruth deems the work “unambitious” in favor of being “allegiant to the model in front of me.”</p>\n<p>This is also how Ruth ultimately conceives of her life. Wambugu writes her narrator as indifferent to her own agency, content “riding Maria’s coattails” from their Rhode Island prep school to college at Bard and beyond. As they pack up Ruth’s childhood bedroom, Maria tells her to throw away her treasured drawings of Maria; more allegiant to her model than to her work, Ruth complies. Ruth’s passivity is rendered in prose that can feel limp or frustratingly remote, even as it’s occasionally dotted with sparkling turns of phrase.</p>\n<p>The holding pattern continues after college, when Ruth follows Maria to New York City. There, Maria’s wealthy girlfriend bankrolls her films and helps turn her into an art world “it girl,” though it’s unclear how much of her success emanates from her talent rather than the sheer force of her charisma, not to mention her financial cushion. “It was so unsettling how no one ever spoke about money or how they were making it,” Ruth observes after attending a gallery opening with her art collector boss — her first introduction to the New York art scene — where she feels like an interloper. Eventually, Ruth finds a service job and a well-off boyfriend-turned-husband to subsidize her painting practice. By the novel’s end, Ruth’s determination to live in Maria’s shadow means she can hardly recognize, let alone enjoy, her own success as an artist.</p>\n<p><i>Lonely Crowds</i> offers up some pointed critiques of the art world — how many artists’ romantic partners act as their patrons, for instance, or how Black artists are converted into trendy tokens. Wambugu’s writing is most astute, however, when depicting the powerful lure of social mobility. It’s the promise of being lifted out from their hardscrabble surrounds that, ironically, first draws the main characters to careers in the arts, which Maria insists can be extraordinarily lucrative if you’re “any good.” As young women, they seem more enamored with the idea of being artists than with making art.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039734/stephanie-wambugu-lonely-crowds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>LONDON — Demonstrating “influence” between artists is a thorny enterprise. Side-by-side comparisons can often reveal how one individual or movement’s technical practice or iconography was taken up and/or further developed by another, furthering art historical progression — yet confirmation bias can underpin curatorial efforts, resulting in an optimistic assertion of direct influence where coincidence may be more at play.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/kiefer-van-gogh\"> Kiefer / Van Gogh</a> at the Royal Academy faces a wholly different challenge: connecting two fundamentally different artists, one of whom professes to be influenced by the other. The show acknowledges the titular artists’ dissimilarity from the outset, with its first caption stating that “Kiefer’s monumental works may not appear to have much in common with van Gogh.” Fundamentally, Kiefer is more a sculptor, articulating enormous-scale impasto patterns and surface texture using straw and other detritus in monochrome sludge occasionally punctuated by gold, while van Gogh is, well, one of the most accomplished and technically individual painters — not to mention colorists — in art history. Kiefer, who was born in Germany just before the end of World War II and grew up in the shadow of the Holocaust, is concerned with the greatest matters of life and death, and is widely recognized by the art establishment. van Gogh’s concerns were smaller in scope and more personal — he made local landscapes and portraits while suffering from debilitating mental illness — and he received no recognition until after his death. And Kiefer’s few tiny line drawings compared to van Gogh’s skilled paintings indicate a significant gulf in draftsmanship capability between the two.</p>\n<p>Though the 80-year-old giant of contemporary art is given equal listing in the title with the 19th-century post-Impressionist legend — the show is supported by White Cube, which happens to be exhibiting the former concurrently — the focus is squarely on the former’s adoration of the latter throughout his 60-year career. The show begins with the first travel grant Kiefer received as a student, which took him throughout the Netherlands, Belgium, Paris and Arles — what curators Julien Domercq and Natasha Fyffe call “following in van Gogh’s footsteps.” Rather than exploring “influence,” though, the exhibition is really about Kiefer, who just happens to really, really like van Gogh. For in the exhibition’s three galleries, the latter is short-changed: The full width of the walls in the first and last are dominated by Kiefer’s monumental pieces, which dwarf the single van Gogh work in each room: 1887’s “Piles of French Novels” and 1886’s “Shoes.”</p>\n<p>The key to understanding “influence,” or more fittingly in the case of Kiefer’s relationship with van Gogh, “affinity” or “inspiration,” is through words more than pictures, particularly the former’s personal interpretations and responses. The caption for van Gogh’s humble shoes, for example, cites the contemporary artist’s thoughts: “This painting of well-worn shoes is for Kiefer a portrait of sorts in their owner’s absence, a relic of journeys past and at the same time a symbol of what is to come.” Again, the grandiosity of Kiefer’s concerns is at odds with the modest immediacy of van Gogh’s subjects, painted from the simple items around him.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the curators make some attempt to link the two via iconography, specifically of the field, though these attempts are either generic or undermined yet again by fundamental differences in their perspectives. “For both artists, a painting of a field is not merely a view, wheat or earth, but is imbued with a deeper meaning,” the exhibition materials state — is this not the case for most artists? Indeed, the text itself admits their differences: “Kiefer believes a landscape also stands as a silent witness of human history, while for van Gogh it was a conduit to express intense feelings and emotions.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036727/anselm-kiefer-van-gogh-royal-academy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Calling Alexa Kumiko Hatanaka’s solo presentation at the Armory Show a “booth” feels somehow wrong, like a reduction of the all-encompassing sanctum that she and Toronto gallery Patel Brown assembled for the Manhattan art fair. Suspended gently from wooden rods are billowing linocut and <i>gyotaku</i> prints on handmade Japanese <i>washi</i> paper in deep indigos and earth tones. In conversations with attendees on the fair’s opening day, Hatanaka shared that she has bipolar disorder, and that her landscapes are informed in part by her research into evolutionary theories for the condition as a form of climactic adaptation.</p>\n<p>Hatanaka, a first timer at the Armory Show, said she was moved and gratified by visitors’ responses. “It’s still quite stigmatized to talk about bipolar, even though there’s more conversation about mental health,” she told me. “I think telling my story has been kind of disarming to people, allowed them to be vulnerable.”</p>\n<p>For all the whispers about the market downturn, gallery closures, and <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032202/as-adaas-art-show-changes-course-a-nonprofit-is-left-in-limbo/\">art fair shake-ups</a>, a crisp air of first-day-of-school excitement cut through the drab halls of the Javits Center during the Armory Show’s VIP preview on Thursday, September 4. Often accompanying the gallerists fielding collectors’ inquiries were the artists themselves, many of them showing for the first time at the modern-day incarnation of the historic exhibition where Marcel<strong> </strong>Duchamp shocked American audiences with his dizzying 1912 “Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2.”</p>\n<p><i>Rumination</i>(2025) by Alexa Kumiko Hatanaka</p>\n<p>“It is a classic, world-famous fair, and it is the ambition of every artist to show there, particularly if you come from Europe … or the edge of Europe, in my case,” said Irish artist Alice Maher, whose drawing “The Glorious Maid (of the Charnel House)” (2016) is displayed in a nook at David Nolan Gallery’s booth of 100 drawings from 1944 to the present. Maher could “hardly believe,” she said, that her work is hanging in the company of such figures as Hannah Wilke, Dorothea Rockburne, Etel Adnan, and Ellsworth Kelly.</p>\n<p>Diagonally across from Patel Brown’s booth is New York’s own Swivel Gallery, where ceramic works by Alejandro García Contreras stopped attendees in their tracks. The Guadalajara-based artist, another newcomer to the Armory, said that though his practice dates back to 2002, he’s glad this moment didn’t come sooner. “In some ways it was complex and discouraging,” García Contreras told me in Spanish, reflecting on his early years, “but it helped me build up the patience not to do something stupid.”</p>\n<p>Though his sculptures today are hyper-detailed, Boschian constructions dripping in symbolism, the artist’s earliest inspiration came from action figures — especially the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles — which, as a child, he didn’t so much play with as study to figure out how they were made.</p>\n<p>“That’s where the origin of my obsession with the sculptural object comes from,” García Contreras said. “Sometimes I think, ‘Wow, when I was a kid, it was my dream to make action figures. And now I’m making collectibles for adults. I’ve made it.’”</p>\n<p>There’s always fresh blood at the Armory, in part thanks to the participation of first-time galleries. The big four (Gagosian, Hauser, Zwirner, Pace) haven’t showed at the fair in years, opting for Frieze (which also owns the Armory Show) and the various Art Basels. But notably absent in the main section this year are other major players, such as Lehmann Maupin, Galerie Lelong (which skipped 2024 too), Almine Rech, and Kasmin (currently <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032581/kasmin-and-clearing-galleries-announce-closures/\">transitioning</a> into a new gallery started by two partners). Younger galleries — some of which <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038050/new-york-art-dealers-get-candid-ahead-of-the-armory-show-2025/\">told  Hyperallergic</a> that they got a last-minute call from Armory Show organizers this year offering them a booth — are eager to step up, and the Presents section, notably dedicated to emerging spaces no more than 10 years old, is slightly larger than in past editions. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039712/armory-show-2025-first-time-artists-steal-the-spotlight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Eduardo Holgado encounters most of his art on Instagram now, perusing posts from galleries and artists before ever setting foot in a fair. But when it comes time to buy, the collector, who is in his early 30s, still needs to experience the work in person. It’s Thursday, September 4, day one of the Armory Show, and Holgado is sipping a sparkling beverage as he walks jauntily down the gallery corridors with his art advisor, Clara Andrade Pereira, who encouraged him to experience the work he admired on social media in person. This hybrid approach of digital discovery paired with in-person verification has become the new normal for many art collectors since the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>Susan Vecsey, 54, literally keeps art at arm’s length — but not for the reasons you might think. Walking through the cavernous fair at the Javits Center, the artist-collector positions herself exactly one arm’s distance from paintings, the locus of her collection, replicating where she imagines the artist stood while creating the work.</p>\n<p>Across this year’s Armory Show, gallery directors are learning how to navigate this tension between digital discovery and physical experience, which is subtly reshaping how artists, collectors, and gallerists interact with one another. Sean Kelly, whose <a href=\"https://www.skny.com/\">gallery</a> has participated in the fair for decades, acknowledged that collectors “do come having done homework online, but info online is a partial picture.” </p>\n<p>The challenge, he told <i>Hyperallergic</i>, is “reaching out of the computer and phone and moving people to feel there is some kind of reality.” This shift toward more deliberate engagement is reflected in purchasing patterns: “Anything over $1 million is extremely slow,” Kelly observed. “Anything under $200k, people are much more comfortable making decisions.”</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>International dynamics further complicate the landscape. Sébastien Janssen of <a href=\"http://www.sorrywereclosed.com/en/gallery/presentation/0/sorry-we-re-closed\">Sorry We’re Closed</a>, discussing the impact on global tensions under the Trump administration, notes the effects on <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielwebber/2025/04/24/trumps-tariffs-create-new-opportunities-for-cross-border-payments/\">cross-border payments</a> for East Asian clients.</p>\n<p>“Many Chinese collectors disappeared because it’s more difficult to send money outside the country, but they are still there and will come back,” Janssen said. His Brussels-based gallery has adapted by strengthening relationships with American collectors, whom he described as “faster and happy to buy” compared to Europeans. Despite the challenges, Janssen maintains a philosophical approach to sales: “Every sale is a miracle,” he noted, explaining that he sold works to European and Hong Kong collectors before the fair opened, including one piece he says went for $290,000.</p>\n<p>This pattern seems to hold across regions. At the booth of Buenos Aires-based <a href=\"https://store.praxis-art.com/\">Praxis</a> gallery, Director Carolina Constantino opined that Argentinian collectors “are more like Europeans — slower and deliberate,” while “Americans are quick” in their decision-making. </p>\n<p>To accommodate changing collector needs, galleries are experimenting with new approaches: Praxis offers installment payment plans and brings works directly to collectors’ homes to stage them in situ. Cierra Britton told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that her nomadic <a href=\"https://cierrabritton.com/\">New York gallery model</a> allows collectors to experience curated presentations, with buyers willing to travel significant distances for pop-up shows.</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>Beyond pricing and payment strategies, many collectors want to see themselves reflected in the work they buy. Britton, whose itinerant gallery focuses on artists who are women of color, said that many of her buyers are collectors of color. “I am not a response to BLM,” she said. “I was born Black.” She explained that while people initially bought work “in solidarity with social justice” in 2022 when she opened, her approach sustains collector interest by showing diverse work by Black artists. Britton observes that “Black figurative work is often treated as a trend” in contrast to abstract work by Black artists — a double standard that reduces complex artistic practices to identity markers.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039842/how-new-collector-habits-are-shaking-up-art-fair-season-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

If I asked your opinion of my answer, I would want to hear it.’ ”</p>\n<p>\n            Ferrara, the author of <a href=\"http://triciaferrara.com/parenting-2-0-tricia-ferrara-the-book/\">“Parenting 2.0: Think in the Future, Act in the Now,”</a> a guidebook for parents with step-by-step advice on how to strengthen their relationships with their children, said Simms could also build in an incentive for the good behavior: If her daughter wants to do a sleepover at a friend’s house, for instance, she needs to go 10 days without making a comment about something her mother says unless her mother asks for her opinion. \n    </p>\n<p>“Occasionally, I would ask them their opinion and say, ‘What do you think of that?’ so they have an understanding it’s not that you don’t want to hear from them, but there is a time and a place.”</p>\n<p>What also plays a role in how our kids respond to us, said Ferrara, herself a mom of two teenagers, is how we respond as parents.</p>\n<p>“I see a lot of parents just barking on their kids or barking on their business,” she said. “And so that they think it’s OK to do that in reverse.”</p>\n<p>\n            Having a child who thinks you are wrong all the time is very common, said pediatrician and author <a href=\"http://claudiamgoldmd.com/\">Dr. Claudia Gold, </a>who is an infant mental health specialist. “Depending on the degree, it’s a normal developmental phenomenon.”\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Before adolescence, it may be happening because the child’s group of friends is beginning to take prominence over the family, said Gold, author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Keeping-Your-Child-Mind-Overcoming/dp/073821485X\">“Keeping Your Child in Mind”</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Silenced-Child-Medications-Quick-Fix-Resilience/dp/0738218391\">“The Silenced Child.”</a> During adolescence, it may be related to the teen’s desire to separate from their family and forge their own identify.\n    </p>\n<p>“When they get older and they have more advanced cognitive skills and are capable of abstract thinking, it’s a kind of practicing of their own newfound abilities,” Gold said.</p>\n<p>Her advice is for parents to brush it off and not butt heads with their kids. The irritating behavior will probably go away, she said.</p>\n<p>What needs to be looked at a bit more closely is when the child’s thinking that everything their parents do or say is wrong is causing problems in a family and when the behavior really seems to be pushing the parent’s buttons, said Gold.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/13/health/parent-acts-kids-think-parents-wrong/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

That’s when my girls, as toddlers, would arch their backs, screaming uncontrollably, usually in a public place (of course!) and there was nothing my husband or I could do to satisfy them.</p>\n<p>If you have kids and you’ve experienced one of their meltdowns, you no doubt know what I mean and what it feels like at that moment, when you are a mixture of emotions – embarrassed, frustrated, angry and completely at a loss for how to resolve the problem. Even bribery, which we know is never the way to go, doesn’t seem to work when your child is at wit’s end and unable to calm down.</p>\n<p>\n            We recently asked some parents to act out what their children do and say when they melt down as part of a new CNN Digital video series called <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/health/2016/05/11/parent-acts-meltdown-kelly-wallace-orig.cnn\">“Parent Acts.”</a> Since we know parents tend to get the best advice and support from other parents, we thought it would be fun and helpful for parents to act out what their kids are doing when there is a problem, and then have a parenting expert listen to their role play and weigh in with advice.\n    </p>\n<p>Pauline Hilborn, a mom of two in New York City, describes herself as an expert on meltdowns based on the experiences of her daughter, who she says is “7-years-old but sounds more like 13.”</p>\n<p>Case in point: Hilborn’s daughter wanted a ponytail like the pop singer Ariana Grande, but felt like her mom didn’t do the ponytail properly and put it in the wrong place.</p>\n<p>“She came out crying and said, ‘Ariana Grande’s ponytail is here not here,’” said Hilborn, pointing to the place on her head where her daughter preferred the ponytail to go, not where it ended up.</p>\n<p>“I was at a loss for words,” she said. “I had no idea what to say but my husband said, ‘Well, she’s right you know,’ which didn’t help the situation.”</p>\n<p>Debi, another mother of two in Manhattan, says her 7-year-old has definitely had some tantrums. When I asked her son what a meltdown is, he told me it’s when you cry a lot. When I asked him to imitate one, he said he keeps screaming until his mom lets him have whatever it is that he wants at that moment.</p>\n<p>“I completely freeze in those situations,” she said. “I lose all rational sense of now what do I do … I don’t know how to do it without bribing him, so I end up taking away things.”</p>\n<h2>Help is on the way</h2>\n<p>\n            <a href=\"http://triciaferrara.com/\">Tricia Ferrara</a> is a licensed family therapist and parenting strategist who has been in private practice in the Philadelphia area for more than a decade.

Kids get tired and hungry, and then they can’t tell you what’s going on. “You want to try and maybe not bring a child to places that trigger them,” and avoid outings at the end of the day when it’s still difficult for them to coordinate their emotions with their body, she said. (I wish I had this in mind that time I decided to take my kids, then 2 and 4, grocery shopping right before dinner time. Not a smart move.)</p>\n<h2>No. 2 – Disregard what other people think</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/05/24/health/parent-acts-meltdowns-children-advice-parents/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Still, my children have so much more than I ever had when I was their age, and I admit I sometimes break down when they want something and plead over and over again, “Please, please, can I have this?”</p>\n<p>I know I’m not alone.</p>\n<p>\n            In the third installment of our new CNN Digital Video series <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/health/2016/06/06/parent-acts-tweens-deodorant-kelly-wallace-nccorig.cnn\">“Parent Acts,”</a> we asked parents to act out why it’s so hard to say no to our kids when they want something, and then we had a parenting expert listen to their role play to weigh in with advice.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            “I feel like my children are never satisfied and happy with what they have, so that’s really, I think, that’s my issue,” said Laura Simms, a mom of three in Atlanta and <a href=\"http://www.thekeygrp.com/\">owner of a public relations firm.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n            <a href=\"http://triciaferrara.com/\">Tricia Ferrara</a> is a licensed family therapist and parenting strategist who has been in private practice in the Philadelphia area for more than a decade. \n    </p>\n<p>\n            “In a changing world, raising your child to think they must be statically happy is not helpful,” said Ferrara, author of <a href=\"http://triciaferrara.com/parenting-2-0-tricia-ferrara-the-book/\">“Parenting 2.0: Think in the Future, Act in the Now,”</a> a guidebook for parents with step-by-step advice on how to strengthen their relationships with their children. “Children need a process for coping with and adapting to a changing environment. It’s up to us, as parents, to give them that process.”\n    </p>\n<p>As parents, Ferrara says, we want our kids to look at the world and think, “I want more,” but we want them to be able to do that in such a way that they realize that getting what they want is a result of their efforts and not from “poking at somebody else.”</p>\n<p>“Just folding and giving your children just what they want is not helpful for them over the long run,” Ferrara said. “I know for parents, sometimes it’s easier for them … but easy for you is not healthy for them. So teaching them or compelling them how to organize their energy toward a goal is critical. It’s a critical skill for now, but it’s a very critical skill for the future.”</p>\n<p>When your child sees the ice cream truck and screams, “Please, Mommy, you never let me get Mister Softee,” instead of breaking down and getting your child that ice cream, you could proactively offer your child ice cream – but only after they show “big-kid behavior.”</p>\n<p>For many little kids, the No. 1 thing they want is to feel like they’re growing up, said Ferrara, a mom of two teenagers. “So incentivizing them to do behaviors that show they’re a big kid will get them the big-kid goodies.”</p>\n<h2>\n        Why ‘spoiled’ is a sensitive word for parents<strong> </strong>\n</h2>\n<p>\n            Most parents will admit that the single worst word that someone could use to describe their children – the word that would feel like the biggest indictment of their parenting – would be to call them “spoiled,” said Ron Lieber, author of <a href=\"http://ronlieber.com/books/the-opposite-of-spoiled/\">“The Opposite of Spoiled: Raising Kids Who are Grounded, Generous and Smart About Money.”</a>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/06/21/health/parent-acts-spoiled-children-how-to-say-no/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

They looked for the presence of potentially toxic chemicals and divided them into five classes of chemicals, two of which were found to be more common than the rest: phthalates and flame retardants.</p>\n<p>“Many of the top 10 fall into these two categories,” Zota said.</p>\n<p>But when factoring in the wide range of chemicals we’re exposed to, small amounts can add up, she stressed.</p>\n<h2>Lurking in the dust</h2>\n<p>The chemicals found in dust samples came from a range of things typically found inside your home, including vinyl products – such as flooring – cosmetics, baby products, furniture and nail polish.</p>\n<p>To understand how these chemicals are entering your home, it helps to understand where they are used. Phthalates make plastic softer and more flexible, so they tend to be found in vinyl (PVC) materials such as flooring, blinds and food packaging. Flame retardants help products meet flammability standards that are built into building codes, insurance requirements and fire regulations.</p>\n<p>The other three classes of chemicals found in dust samples included environmental phenols, usually used as preservatives in personal care products like shampoo; fluorinated chemicals, used as stain- and water-repellent treatments for upholstery, carpets and clothes and in nonstick pans; and fragrances.</p>\n<p>Only one chemical used in fragrances had been the topic of a study, meaning many more chemicals are likely to be present in dust with little insight into them, according to the researchers. “We know very little about the health hazard of these fragrances,” said Zota.</p>\n<p>But the researchers note that it is about more than exposure. For example, phthalates were detected in the highest concentrations in the study, but the chemicals found in flame retardants had the “highest estimated intake,” meaning they are more likely to enter the body.</p>\n<p>“You can breathe it in and can absorb into your skin,” Zota said. “These chemicals are not bound to the products, so they can migrate out.”</p>\n<h2>A risk to child development</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest concerns underlying the presence of these chemicals hiding in house dust is the fact that children are most likely to inhale or ingest them as they crawl around, touching things and inevitably placing their hands in their mouths multiple times a day.</p>\n<p>“Environmental insults during early development can have long-lasting adverse health effects that persist across the lifespan,” Zota said. Phthalate exposure in children “can increase risk of respiratory, behavioral and neurodevelopmental problems.”</p>\n<p>Phthalates are also known to disrupt hormones inside the body, meaning they could cause reproductive problems.</p>\n<p>\n            “We know from lead that exposures are not acceptable,” said Dr. Asa Bradman, associate director for exposure assessment at the <a href=\"http://cerch.org/about/investigators-and-key-personnel/\">Center for Environmental Research and Child’s Health</a> at the University of California, Berkeley, who was not involved in the new study.\n    </p>\n<p>“There’s a strong argument to reduce exposure to children whose brains are changing and bodies are developing.”</p>\n<p>As for the study findings, Bradman noted that the reason phthalates were found to be most common in house dust was probably because most studies have been done on this class of chemicals.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/14/health/toxic-chemicals-house-dust/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

That’s the case, however, for only 5 percent of large companies.\n    </p>\n<p>This is an issue in which I have considerable experience. I have been studying the health effects of long working hours for nearly 30 years. All the studies point to the potential dangers that can occur as the result of the additional risks created when work demands exceed a particular threshold. Most of the studies I have performed suggest that the dangers are most pronounced when people regularly work more than 12 hours per day or 60 hours per week.</p>\n<h2>It sounded like a good idea</h2>\n<p>\n            The idea of <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/06/four-day-workweek/396530/\">a four-day workweek</a> is not new. Labor experts have been studying and advocating these approaches since the 1970s. For example, in 2008, researchers from <a href=\"https://news.byu.edu/news/byu-study-reveals-results-city%E2%80%99s-four-day-work-week\">Brigham Young University</a> conducted a series of surveys among employees and community members to assess their perspectives about a four-day workweek. The researchers found that about four-fifths of the employees reported a positive experience working that type of schedule.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Based on these positive results, Utah’s governor enacted a <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2011/09/04/utah-ends-4-day-workweek-experiment/\">mandatory four-day workweek</a> for all state employees. The state’s goal was to curb energy costs, improve air quality, ensure that needed services would still be available (for instance, garbage collection) and help to recruit and retain state employees. In 2011, however, Utah reversed course, saying that savings never materialized.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/could-flexible-working-hours-be-the-answer-to-the-sleep-loss-epidemic-38213\">Could flexible working hours be the answer to the sleep-loss epidemic?</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Other research has also supported the development and adoption of compressed work schedules. A 1989 study found that <a href=\"http://myweb.usf.edu/~jdorio/CONSEQUENCES%20OF%20ALTERNATIVE%20WORK%20SCHEDULES.pdf\">compressed schedules</a> (PDF) were related to high levels of job satisfaction and employees’ satisfaction with their work schedules; supervisors also reported they were pleased with the four-day workweek schedules.\n    </p>\n<h2>Are there hidden dangers?</h2>\n<p>Despite the widespread enthusiasm for a four-day week, I am not convinced that kind of schedule is beneficial for employees or for businesses. The primary problem with the idea is that whatever work needs to be done, needs to get done in the same amount of total time. Despite wishes to the contrary, there are still only 24 hours in a day.</p>\n<p>The math is simple: working five eight-hour shifts is equivalent to working four 10-hour shifts. That’s true. But the implications of these schedules are different. The danger is in disregarding the health effects that can occur as a result of fatigue and stress that accumulate over a longer-than-normal working day.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/15/health/four-day-workweek/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/worried-over-womens-disinterest-in-motherhood-make-it-something-wed-want/\">Earlier this year</a>, the Trump administration launched a crusade to address falling birth rates in the United States, which they and other conservatives view as a matter of grave concern.</p>\n<p>In order to galvanize families, and women in particular, into having more kids, they proposed everything from $5,000 birthing bonuses to menstruation classes, so people could better track their ovulation cycles – instead of universal childcare, or other forms of study-backed, government-subsidized assistance.</p>\n<p>And none of their proposals involved <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/sandy-hook-scarlett-lewis-choose-love/\">protecting our children</a> from the gun violence that continues to plague the U.S., to a degree <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/2024/oct/comparing-deaths-gun-violence-us-other-countries\">unheard of</a> anywhere else in the world. </p>\n<p>We’ve been reminded, this week, of how dangerous our <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/u-s-education-is-under-attack-a-new-battle-in-a-long-war-but-women-are-resisting/\">schools</a> are because of this problem, by a gutting <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/shocked-by-school-shootings-an-artist-brings-back-playground-from-hell/\">mass shooting</a> in Minneapolis. As of publication, two children died – ages 8 and 10 – and 17 people were injured when suspect Robin Westman (who also died, of a self-inflicted gunshot wound) opened fire during a morning mass at the city’s Annunciation Catholic School.</p>\n<p>Of the 17 who were hurt, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy40znde9eko\">14 were kids</a>. Some of them were as young as 6 years old.</p>\n<p>“These were American families,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said during a press briefing. “Don’t just say this is about ‘thoughts and prayers’ right now. These kids were literally praying.”</p>\n<p>Yet that’s largely what conservatives, including President Donald Trump, had to offer in the wake of the attack. “Please join me in praying for everyone involved,” <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/shooting-annunciation-church-minneapolis/\">Trump wrote</a> on Truth Social, with Vice President JD Vance offering a similar call. “My prayers are with everyone involved in this tragedy,” Attorney General Pam Bondi also <a href=\"https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/1960716027131519061\">posted</a>.</p>\n<p>The solution to our <a href=\"https://www.apha.org/topics-and-issues/gun-violence\">gun-violence epidemic</a> should be to pass more stringent gun laws. Experts have found that the <a href=\"https://rockinst.org/blog/more-guns-more-death-the-fundamental-fact-that-supports-a-comprehensive-approach-to-reducing-gun-violence-in-america/\">sheer tonnage</a> of guns available in the U.S., and <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/debunking-the-guns-make-us-safer-myth/\">the ease</a> with which they can be purchased, makes ours a deadlier, more dangerous nation to live in. And <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11381453/\">study</a> after <a href=\"https://everytownresearch.org/rankings/\">study</a> has shown that gun violence could be curbed significantly through policy prescriptions.</p>\n<p>But for this particular shooting, after praying for peace, conservatives found an alternative scapegoat: Transgender people. Despite the fact that the <i>vast</i> majority of mass shootings are <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/fact-check/majority-of-us-mass-shooters-are-cis-men-not-transgender-or-non-binary-people-idUSL1N363273/\">committed by cisgender men</a>, Westman was a trans woman, so some are using this shooting to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/27/us/minneapolis-school-shooting-suspect-gunman.html\">further anti-trans agendas</a>.</p>\n<p>Attacking a community that is <a href=\"https://glaad.org/trump-accountability-tracker/\">already subject</a> to extreme discrimination, while refusing to enact legislation that would see gun violence lessened, and then offering boiler-plate calls for prayer in the aftermath… None of this does anything to actually help the children they claim to want, the children they claim to care about. </p>\n<p>None of this helped 10-year-old Weston Halsne, who survived the Minneapolis shooting because his equally-young friend <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/minneapolis-mass-shooting-catholic-school-survivor-friend/\">shielded him from gunfire</a>, and was injured in the process. “It was like, shots fired, and then we kind of, like, got under pews,” he recalled to members of the press. “They shot through the stained glass windows I think, and it was really scary.”</p>\n<p>Weston added that was praying for his friend’s recovery – because it’s the only recourse he, a traumatized child, has in the U.S., where people with the power to enact laws that would protect children from shootings like this <a href=\"https://www.thetrace.org/2025/06/big-beautiful-bill-atf-silencer-gun-laws/\">fail to do so</a> over and over again. </p>\n<p>Conservative politicians and pundits continue to pressure women to bring more lives like Weston’s into this world, into this country – while at the same time demonstrating a refusal to even<i> try</i> to keep them safe. <a href=\"https://www.security.org/blog/a-timeline-of-school-shootings-since-columbine/\">Over 400 school shootings</a> have taken place in the U.S. since the 1999 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School_massacre\">Columbine High School massacre</a>, with dozens killed, hundreds injured and thousands traumatized by these attacks.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/conservatives-want-more-kids-yet-offer-only-prayers-when-kids-are-gunned-down/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s the only timely source of this demographic-level data.</p>\n<p>Without it, economists and policymakers would have no way of knowing how economic policy is affecting marginalized groups of workers in real time. They’d be flying blind on how to help them.</p>\n<p>But that’s just what President Donald Trump’s nominee to run the bureau is suggesting doing.</p>\n<p>On August 1, Trump fired the head of the bureau, Erika McEntarfer, after BLS published one of the largest revisions to its data in decades. The revision showed that the economy was in fact weaker than previously reported, leading Trump to accuse McEntarfer of tampering with the data to make his administration look bad.</p>\n<p>Revisions of economic data have also always been part of how BLS, an independent and nonpartisan agency, functions. The data is collected from surveys of employers and households, and then published in three waves. The surveys are voluntary, so not all responses come in on time. BLS publishes an initial release and then revises in the subsequent two months as more responses come in. It’s done this way to ensure that markets and economists get real-time data on the economy. Since the pandemic, BLS has been struggling with lagging response rates and a rapidly changing economy that has led to larger revisions.</p>\n<p>The reports are still considered one of the most reliable sources of U.S. economic data in the world.</p>\n<p>McEntarfer, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden and was confirmed in a nearly unanimous Senate vote, is a widely respected economist who had worked in the federal government under multiple administrations. Trump’s nominee to replace her, E.J. Antoni, is an economist at the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation who <a href=\"https://static.heritage.org/project2025/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf\">contributed</a> <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/thebulwark.com/post/3lwen55jkbk25\">to Project 2025</a>. Discussing the employment data <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trumps-bls-pick-could-pause-monthly-jobs-report-over-accuracy-concerns\">earlier this month</a>, Antoni suggested that until the data is “corrected,” “the BLS should suspend issuing the monthly job reports but keep publishing the more accurate, though less timely, quarterly data.” </p>\n<p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier this week that the Trump administration had noted Antoni’s suggestions but intended to continue issuing the monthly reports.</p>\n<p>“I believe that is the plan, and that’s the hope, and that these monthly reports will be data that the American people can trust,” Leavitt said.</p>\n<p>Losing timely economic data, particularly at a time when the economy is showing signs of softening, is bad for every group, economists told The 19th. But it could disproportionately impact women and women of color, who are often the first to feel the impact of weakness in the economy and serve as a bellwether of what is to come.</p>\n<p>“The household survey is really the only source for intersectional employment data on a monthly basis. That means that for groups of women we and others have been watching especially closely during this period — for example, disabled women, Black women, women veterans — timely information about these groups would disappear,” said Katherine Gallagher Robbins, a senior fellow at the National Partnership for Women &amp; Families who routinely analyzes the data.</p>\n<p>The National Women’s Law Center, which also publishes its monthly analysis of women in the workforce using BLS’ data, said in a statement that “losing this impartial data will undermine efforts to improve women’s economic wellbeing, damage the credibility and reliability of data coming from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and hurt overall efforts to objectively assess the health of our economy.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/suspending-monthly-economic-reports-would-be-really-bad-for-women-of-color/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

And with it, higher than ever temperatures, thanks to heat waves and rather ominous-sounding weather phenomenons like the <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/heat-dome-100-million-people-27-states-extreme-heat-tornado-warnings-forecasts/story?id=111347390\">heat dome</a>. As temperatures soar from the East Coast to the West Coast, and folks gather for summer BBQs, backyard gatherings, beach trips and pool days – ice cold beverages will be a necessity. <br/>So we’ve compiled a list of summertime drinks from female entrepreneurs whose startup stories we’ve enjoyed – and who we think you should get to know. From rosé, to flavored seltzers, to functional beverages packed with minerals and adaptogens,  there’s something here for everyone at the party to enjoy.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>(All images courtesy of the companies.)</i>\n    </p>\n<h2>Drink Besa</h2>\n<p>Tori Brodsky has been leading the helm of <a href=\"https://drinkbesa.com/\">Drink Besa</a> since 2022. With a background in nutrition science, she became interested in making convenient drinks with quality ingredients, such as canned wine that’s, in fact, pretty darn good (we tried the “sexy and bright” <a href=\"https://drinkbesa.com/product/just-right-white/\">white wine</a>). Drink Besa also offers a line of hard seltzers, which it says are among the first on the market to use organic wine instead of malt liquor or spirits. The 5% ABV drink comes in three flavors – peach, fruit punch, and citrus – and is, according to Brodksy, “the ideal summer beverage: Delicious, premium, and truly unique.”</p>\n<h2>Bow &amp; Arrow Brewing Co.</h2>\n<p>“We didn’t set out to be the first <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/a-native-owned-brewery-inspired-by-the-southwest/\">Native-woman-owned brewery</a> in the United States, but I’m told we are,” says Shyla Sheppard, founder of <a href=\"https://www.bowandarrowbrewing.com/\">Bow &amp; Arrow Brewing Co</a>. She and her partner, Missy Begay, take inspiration from the American Southwest, incorporating traditional Indigenous ingredients into their craft beers. Their beers, like “Dance In and Out of The Beams of a Neon Moon” (a fruity IPA), and “Cactuscolada” (a Pina Colada-inspired sour ale) are available in their Albuquerque, New Mexico, tap room  – where they are served cold straight from the tap – as well as <a href=\"https://www.bowandarrowbrewing.com/find-our-beer\">other locations</a>. </p>\n<h2>Heti</h2>\n<p>Dana Thompson, who built the celebrated <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/owamni-indigenous-cuisine-healing/\">Owamni</a> restaurant, is now turning her attention to the functional beverage space. Her new business, <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/dana-thompson-heti-drinks/\">Heti</a>, is a health-conscious brand selling low-dose THC beverages. The name itself means “home” in Dakota; Thompson is a direct descendant of the tribe through her mother. Evoking a sense of place — and the flavors of home — is intentional. “I wanted something that resonated with what the people I know were asking for,” Thompson told The Story Exchange in a recent interview, especially women who wanted to relax with something other than wine. There is a home-related social-impact component to her business model in the works, as Thompson also plans to create hempcrete housing on tribal lands with some of the profits.</p>\n<h2>Trois Noix</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/jaime-araujo-trois-noix/\">Jaime Araujo</a> says her Napa Valley winery, <a href=\"https://troisnoixwine.com/\">Trois Noix</a>, was born from a lifelong love of wine. She’s not only passionate about what ends up in the bottle, “but also how it got there, what happens when it fills your glass, and how it can bring a table of people together.” And how’s this for a summertime drink: The winery’s Sonoma Valley Rosé, made from pinot noir, contains aromas of papaya, just-ripe strawberry, and crushed rose petals. Reviewers on wine app <a href=\"https://www.vivino.com/US/en/trois-noix-rose-of-pinot-noir/w/9858056?year=2021\">Vivino</a> called it “light-bodied with a tart plum finish” and “very refreshing.” Trois Noix recommends pairing with grilled seafood and summer vegetables … or just sipping on its own, if you don’t have grand cooking plans on the hazy horizon. </p>\n<h2>All Phenoms</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/cristina-kown-all-phenoms/\">Cristina Kown’s</a> sparkling waters, <a href=\"https://allphenoms.com/\">All Phenoms</a>, are packed with organic fruits and filled with vitamins, adaptogens, minerals, prebiotics and probiotics. Her aim? To offer a super healthy alternative to sugary sodas. The Redondo Beach, California-based entrepreneur is a self-proclaimed healthy beverage fan – but was dismayed that most of the drinks on the market contained tons of sugar, or low-quality ingredients. We imagine All Phenoms drinks in flavors like berry hibiscus, citrus ginger and mango lemongrass would do a good job of keeping you sufficiently hydrated at any sweltering gathering. </p>\n<h2>Boyd Cru</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/the-best-summer-beverages-to-beat-the-heat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

(Credit: Courtesy of Artemis Virtu)</p>\n<p>Charlotte Wissel’s design company, Artemis Virtu, collaborates with customers on crafting furniture that’s made to suit their individual tastes.</p>\n<p><strong>For Charlotte Wissel, </strong><strong>furniture</strong><strong> has always been about more than function or necessity – it’s also an alternative form of expression. Wissel told us, “I see each piece as a blank canvas with the potential to become a work of art.” In 2020, the Fort Lauderdale, Florida, designer launched her company, </strong><strong>Artemis Virtu</strong><strong>, through which she aims to combine craftsmanship, storytelling and bold design into something tangible and lasting. Wissel also takes upholstery to another level by integrating custom materials and original artwork into every project. </strong></p>\n<p><i>Here’s our lightly edited Q&amp;A, from</i><i> </i><i>The Story Exchange 1,000+ Stories Project</i><i>.</i></p>\n<h3><strong>How is your business different from others in your industry?</strong></h3>\n<p>We treat upholstery as an art form, not just a service. While many upholstery businesses focus solely on repair or restoration, our work goes far beyond function — we design statement pieces that transform a space. We’re not just reupholstering furniture; we’re creating one-of-a-kind pieces that reflect the client’s vision, style and story.</p>\n<h3><strong>Tell us about your biggest success so far. </strong></h3>\n<p>Seeing my work featured in homes I never imagined I’d have the opportunity to be part of. Over the past year, I’ve had the honor of creating custom pieces for private clients whose taste and stature I deeply admire — individuals I never expected to connect with, let alone have my artwork in their personal spaces.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is your top challenge and how have you addressed it?</strong></h3>\n<p>Like many creatives-turned-entrepreneurs, I quickly learned that talent alone isn’t enough to build a business. One of my first challenges was navigating the startup phase — figuring out pricing, sourcing materials and positioning myself in a niche market. I had to learn how to run a business while still being the creative force behind every piece, which meant wearing many hats and making decisions that didn’t always come naturally at first.</p>\n<p>As the business began to grow, scaling up became the next big hurdle. I found myself reaching capacity quickly, with more requests than I could handle solo. It forced me to evaluate how I could grow without compromising the quality or uniqueness of my work. I’ve since streamlined my process, established stronger boundaries around production timelines, and begun forming partnerships that allow me to take on more without losing the personal touch.</p>\n<h3><strong>Have you experienced any significant personal situations that affected your business decisions? </strong></h3>\n<p>As we began to gain traction, I was thrilled to see demand increase. I hired staff, took on large-scale projects, and worked with designers on high-volume orders. On the surface, it looked like success — but in reality, I found myself drifting further and further from the soul of what I had created.</p>\n<p>Many of the pieces I was producing no longer felt like mine. I was executing someone else’s vision, with little input or creative freedom, simply because they had seen my past work and wanted me to replicate it. It became clear that I was on the verge of turning my studio into a production line, and that was never what I wanted this business to be. So, I made the conscious decision to recalibrate — to scale with intention, not volume.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is your biggest tip for other startup entrepreneurs? </strong></h3>\n<p>Trust your instinct and protect your craft. In the early stages, it’s easy to feel pulled in every direction by trends, advice or what you think people want from you. But your vision is the core of your business – it’s what will set you apart.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do you find inspiration on your darkest days?</strong></h3>\n<p>I’ve learned to take a step back and reconnect with my “why.” I reflect on the pieces I’m most proud of, the clients who trusted me with their vision, and the moments that reminded me that I’m doing what I love.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/charlotte-wissel-artemis-virtu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Or are we going to do what we’ve always done in this country and leave something better for our children and our grandchildren?”</p>\n<p>Someone could mistake these words as being spoken in 2025 by a Trump administration official advocating to “Make America Healthy Again” — the catch-all agenda that has zeroed in on kids’ health and in particular, chronic disease and childhood obesity.</p>\n<p>But <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Fq-VJNihU\">the remarks were from then-first lady Michelle Obama</a>, and the year was 2013.</p>\n<p>Obama was promoting <a href=\"https://letsmove.obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/initiatives\">“Let’s Move!,”</a> her initiative aimed at improving children’s nutrition at home and school and encouraging them to exercise more. The initiative is credited with making improvements to school lunch standards, creating more transparency in food labeling and bringing more awareness to childhood obesity.</p>\n<p>But the first lady drew widespread partisan backlash for her efforts, as right-wing media personalities and Republicans vehemently criticized related regulation as government overreach. They have been more muted as the Trump administration, led in part by <a href=\"https://19thnews.org/2025/01/robert-f-kennedy-jr-moms-hhs-health/\">Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a>, now adopts similar messaging about children’s health.</p>\n<p>“I do think that there’s a double standard going on, especially with RFK Jr.,” said Sydney Carr-Glenn, a political science professor at the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts who studies the intersectionality of race and gender for Black women in politics, including in the media. “People seem to be a little bit more accepting or a little bit more on board with this whole ‘Make America Healthy Again’ initiative.”</p>\n<p>Last month, President Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/07/the-white-house-announces-restoration-of-the-presidential-fitness-test-and-revitalization-of-the-presidents-council-on-sports-fitness-nutrition/\">announced he would revive</a> the presidential fitness test, a once ubiquitous staple of school gym class. Just a few years ago, Let’s Move! offered <a href=\"https://letsmove.obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/initiatives\">programming</a> to educators to encourage physical activity at school for at least 60 minutes each day.</p>\n<p>In some ways, Michelle Obama’s health policy efforts walked so MAHA could run. But you won’t find many Republicans acknowledging that.</p>\n<p>“We live in such polarized times now that you would think the Trump administration would look at the things that Michelle Obama achieved and maybe try to build upon that,” said Sharon Wright Austin, a political science professor at the University of Florida. “But there is no collaboration. There are no coalitions. I’m sure if you were to say to Trump, ‘You’re doing the same thing that Michelle Obama originally started doing when Barack Obama was president,’ he would probably not only deny it, but he probably would be pretty offended.”</p>\n<p>Obama’s motivation to launch Let’s Move!, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oBeuSCfGeg\">the first lady explained</a>, was rooted in her experience as a working mother trying to feed her kids nutritious food. The <a href=\"https://www.deseret.com/2009/1/21/20297484/mom-in-chief/\">self-described “mom-in-chief”</a> recognized that if she struggled with what to feed her children, other families with fewer resources might, too.</p>\n<p>Within months of moving into the White House, the first lady <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/white-house-kitchen-garden.htm\">started a vegetable garden</a> to help <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/20/dining/20garden.html?_r=2&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss\">teach children</a> about locally grown food and to start a conversation about their health. She <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/first-lady-michelle-obama-launches-lets-move-americas-move-raise-a-healthier-genera\">launched “Let’s Move” in early 2010</a>, and her husband <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/presidential-memorandum-establishing-a-task-force-childhood-obesity\">issued a directive</a> to establish a task force on childhood obesity. Michelle Obama was present months later when the task force <a href=\"https://letsmove.obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/letsmove.gov/files/TaskForce_on_Childhood_Obesity_May2010_FullReport.pdf\">released a report</a> assessing how to reduce childhood obesity within a generation.

The Washington, D.C.-based entrepreneur spent years planning parties and more for mission-driven organizations, coordinating upwards of 20 events per year at her busiest. But when Covid first began to spread in 2020, Legrand’s company took a huge hit. Despite losing 98% of her business, she remained undeterred, and worked to build the firm back up. And that she did, doubling her yearly revenue each year for the past 3 years and expanding to produce events in 42 states. Legrand, who recently rebranded her business as </strong><strong>LaJoy Creative</strong><strong>, takes pride in her ability to shift, adapt and pivot as needed – telling us that doing so has helped her become a more resilient leader. </strong></p><p><i>Here’s our lightly edited Q&amp;A, from</i><i> </i><i>The Story Exchange 1,000+ Stories Project</i><i>.</i></p><h3><strong>Tell us about your biggest success so far. </strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Using my expertise to contribute to conversations around the gender pay gap and blending profit with purpose.

    "body": "<h3>Story highlights</h3>\n<p>Grindr came under fire because of a user survey about an HIV filter</p>\n<p>Experts said a filter for HIV status would most likely do more harm than good</p>\n<p>After uploading those carefully selected profile photos and writing a well-crafted personal bio for a dating app, you’re now thinking, “What type of person am I actually looking for?”</p>\n<p>Dating apps and sites offer the option to filter matches by sex, ethnicity, height or religion – but they could be even more personal.</p>\n<p>This summer, the gay social networking app Grindr caught some criticism for asking in a user survey “What is your current HIV status?” and “How would you feel if Grindr allowed you to filter the guys you see by HIV status?”</p>\n<p>In a statement, a Grindr representative said the survey is an effort to better understand its users and to encourage discussions.</p>\n<p>“We have observed a significant increase in user profiles openly discussing their HIV status and test dates. Given that this has not been a part of our profile options to date, we are surveying users to determine both their desire to share this information, and ways to prevent stigma and provide proper support,” the statement said. “Sometimes this involves asking uncomfortable questions.”</p>\n<p>\n            Screenshots of the survey were posted online by <a href=\"http://regnet.anu.edu.au/our-people/phd-students/daniel-reeders\">Daniel Reeders</a>, a Ph.D. candidate who studies HIV stigma at Australian National University. He got the images from a colleague, he said, and called the filter a “digital quarantine.” \n    </p>\n<p>“Dating sites and apps shouldn’t ask for HIV status, because there’s no way to guarantee that privacy and safety will be protected for people who disclose they are positive,” Reeders said. “The harassment that ‘poz’ (HIV-positive) people face can be extreme, even though it’s from a small segment of the community. People already have the ability to disclose their status in their profile text, if they choose to do so.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, public health and relationship experts suggest that HIV or other STD filters on a dating app might do more harm than good.</p>\n<h2>More harm than good?</h2>\n<p>\n            Although an HIV filter could have the benefit of letting HIV-positive people meet others – avoiding potentially awkward and stigmatizing conversations – it also could have a dark side: creating a false sense of security, said Dr. <a href=\"https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/es458\">Eric Schrimshaw</a>, associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University.\n    </p>\n<p>Some states have laws that mandate the disclosure of HIV status prior to any kind of sexual activity. But for some, a dating app filter could lead HIV-negative people to think that the filtered matches consist of only HIV-negative people, he said. From there, they might engage in unprotected sex.</p>\n<p>This could lead to HIV infections because “one, the potential partner might not be telling the truth in order to be able to get partners or to avoid stigma, and also the person may simply have engaged in behaviors recently that result in status change that they just don’t know yet.”</p>\n<p>Another concern is that such filters could increase stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV by further isolating them socially and “demonizing the population.”</p>\n<p>\n             “With more HIV stigma and discrimination, you are going to have less people who will get tested,” said Dr. <a href=\"https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/harper-gary.html\">Gary Harper</a>, a public health professor at the University of Michigan\n    </p>\n<p>Since most STDs are temporary and treatable, such as gonorrhea and chlamydia, people are more likely to seek treatment as soon as possible, Harper said; they wouldn’t even think to include them in their dating profiles. But a filter for any incurable STD, like herpes, could increase stigma, experts said.</p>\n<p>Harper added that imposing a filter on dating app users takes away privacy rights: You may no longer have control over who can disclose information about your HIV status on an online network of strangers.</p>\n<h2>Dating apps and the rise of STDs</h2>\n<p>\n            Online dating sites and mobile dating applications where users can create profiles and meet with strangers, have become increasingly popular among Americans. According to the <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/02/11/15-percent-of-american-adults-have-used-online-dating-sites-or-mobile-dating-apps/\">Pew Research Center</a>, about 15% of adults in the United States are now using online or mobile matchmaking services to seek potential partners, a 36% increase from 2013.\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/15/health/online-dating-app-hiv-std-filter/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Lina Rosengren, lead author of the study and an infectious diseases fellow at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. The study says that not only are the home test kits convenient, they can help bypass some of those stigmas by providing anonymity.</p>\n    <p>With a swab of the gums, the oral fluid test kits distributed in the study deliver results in 20 minutes. If the results are positive, participants are advised to seek additional blood tests for confirmation.</p>\n    <p>Researchers offered free access to these HIV home test kits through banner ads and full-screen notifications on Grindr. Clicking on the ads took users to the study’s website, where they could choose how they want to receive the test kit: by mail, using a redeemable voucher at a local pharmacy or with a code for use at a vending machine. They were also invited to complete two surveys, an online survey at the time of the test request and a follow-up after getting tested.</p>\n    <p>\n            The researchers chose Grindr because of its popularity among gay men in Los Angeles. The app attracts 2 million daily active users in 192 countries, according to its <a href=\"http://www.grindr.com/gay-advertising/\">website</a>. \n    </p>\n    <p>The study’s website received 4,389 unique visits over four weeks and 333 test kit requests.</p>\n    <p>Among the 125 participants who answered the first survey, 74% reported having unprotected anal sex at least once in the past three months. Twenty-nine percent were last tested for HIV more than a year ago, and 9% had never been tested for HIV.</p>\n    <p>Of the 56 users who took the follow-up survey, two tested positive for HIV. Still, 77% of those users preferred testing at home to doing so in clinical settings.</p>\n    <p>The pilot study, spearheaded by the University of California, Los Angeles, is part of a larger effort to incorporate HIV self-testing with mobile technology.</p>\n    <h3>Join the conversation</h3>\n    <p/>\n    <p>“We were surprised about the number of people who were willing to engage with us in health prevention through mobile apps,” Rosengren said. “People are comfortable receiving and giving fairly private health information through mobile technology.”</p>\n    <p>She hopes the study can inspire future efforts in HIV prevention and more research that finds ways to bridge the gap between HIV testing and early, proper treatment.</p>\n    <p>\n            The FDA has approved two types of home HIV tests, according to the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/testing/hometests.html\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. The Home Access HIV-1 Test System involves pricking your finger and sending the blood sample to a licensed laboratory, with results available seven business days after shipment. The other one is the oral fluid testing type used in the study.

Women who said they had frequent, extremely satisfying sex had a lower risk of hypertension, a common precursor to heart disease.</p>\n<h2>Mediocre sex better for heart health?</h2>\n<p>“These findings challenge the widely held assumption that sex brings uniform health benefits to everyone,” Liu said. “I think it is important for older people to understand the potential risks and benefits of sex.”</p>\n<p>\n            “You have to interpret this data with grain of salt,” said <a href=\"http://www.drkevincampbellmd.com/\">Dr. Kevin Campbell</a>, a cardiologist at the University of North Carolina who specializes in heart rhythm disorders. “It’s in direct contrast with the significant clinical data we have showing that as men age if they continue to be sexually active their risk of cardiovascular disease actually decreases.\n    </p>\n<p>“I tell my patients a month after they have a heart attack or open heart surgery if they can walk a flight of steps without getting chest pain or shortness of breath,” said Campbell, “then they are fine to resume sexual activity.”</p>\n<h2>Surprising results for men</h2>\n<p>“The results for men were surprising,” said Lui, agreeing they run counter to decades of research that shows a positive health effect from sexual behavior for men, including better prostate health.</p>\n<p>One reason for the unusual findings, she said, could be in the design of the study. She said while other research has tended to focus on younger age groups, this survey was on a nationally representative sample of older adults across the United States.</p>\n<p>“It’s a survey, not a gold-standard, randomized, clinically controlled trial,” countered Campbell, also highlighting that the study was conducted in 2005, with a follow-up in 2010. “Is it really relevant now that most everyone is on a statin and our treatment of cardiovascular disease has continued to improve?” he asked.</p>\n<p>Another reason for her findings, Lui said, might lie in the use of erectile dysfunction supplements by many older men, or the level of stress created by the act of sex itself.</p>\n<p>“Older men may have more difficulties reaching an orgasm for medical or emotional reasons,” Lui said. “Therefore, they may exert themselves to a greater degree of exhaustion and create relatively more stress on their cardiovascular system in order to achieve a climax, which may hurt health.”</p>\n<p>That could possibly be true, Campbell said, if the man is suffering from an unknown cardiovascular blockage or if he is using certain medications for existing heart disease.</p>\n<p>“If they are taking any type of nitroglycerin, it can cause a dramatic drop in blood pressure with any of the erectile dysfunction drugs,” Campbell said. “That needs to be monitored very carefully.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/08/health/great-sex-older-men-women-study/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It was a boon to the grassroots movement, which started in the 1980s in response to a pattern of permitting landfills and polluting industries in neighborhoods that were disproportionately Black, Brown and low-income.</p>\n<p>In the past four years, advisory councils were created — with many of the positions filled by women of color, who have long been leaders in environmental justice spaces — and offices opened to spearhead the work on the federal level. During that time, the administration also <a href=\"https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USEPAIAQ/bulletins/37c321b\">earmarked billions of dollars</a> to address longstanding environmental issues, and to help these communities adapt to the climate crisis.</p>\n<p>But as President Donald Trump took office for a second time, all that momentum at the federal level disappeared, seemingly overnight. An executive order issued on inauguration day took aim at dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, and environmental justice. As a result, any mention of the work is being scrubbed from government websites and funding has been paused.</p>\n<p>For Jalonne White-Newsome, who led the first ever office on environmental justice in the White House, the shift has been jarring if not unexpected. Still, she’s not undaunted. Through her over three decades of working in environmental justice — starting from her youth in Detroit, Michigan — there is one thing she knows: The movement, at its core, is driven by everyday people who will continue to advocate for their communities.</p>\n<p>“Environmental justice did not start with the federal government,” she said. “Nor will it end with the federal government.”</p>\n<p>The 19th spoke with White-Newsome, formerly the federal environmental justice officer for the White House Council on Environmental Quality, about the Trump administration’s recent attacks on her work and how the movement responds now.</p>\n<p><i>This interview has been edited for length and clarity. </i></p>\n<h3><strong>Jessica Kutz: What is it like to see the new administration issue executive orders aimed at dismantling environmental justice, work that you played a part in implementing?</strong></h3>\n<p>Jalonne White-Newsome: I mean, it’s crushing, right? It is offensive. It’s really hard because we have really tried to work hard over these past four years to create a foundation that our federal family could build on.To see a lot of that dismantled, to see our information wiped off websites, to really try and eliminate the trace of any environmental justice work, it’s very frustrating.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do you think this pull back in funding will affect the momentum of the movement? Is there work that was done under Biden that might be protected from this shift? </strong></h3>\n<p>I’ve had so many community leaders over the past couple years come up to me, folks that have been in the movement for decades and decades, to say there has never been this amount of funding and resources to support environmental justice.</p>\n<p>And so our agency partners worked really, really hard to try and get as much money out as possible [before the Trump administration]. I mean, they were grinding very hard.</p>\n<p>I know there are groups that are positioning to make sure that communities can keep the funds that were obligated to them. So that is happening right now. Where it gets sticky is some of the funds were kind of in that period of not being obligated. [Especially with] the current administration’s review of anything that remotely thinks, talks or looks like equity or environmental justice.</p>\n<p>I’m not a lawyer. Is that legal? Can they actually do that? I don’t know. But it’s a fear tactic, right? And they’re trying to cause fear and confusion, and they have been successful.
