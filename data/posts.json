    "body": "<p>After a long, rainy summer, the Bay Area art scene is beginning to thaw out, with galleries returning from summer vacation and museums kicking off the fall. The country seems to be spiraling ever further towards authoritarian chaos, but a small flame of resistance burns bright in our cultural spaces. This season’s lineup of exhibitions brings together artists and activists across generations, at large institutions and small art spaces alike, offering modes of resistance and community through art. Be it a celebration of local Filipino artists, the newly renovated Museum of the African Diaspora’s exhibition on Blackness and the cosmos, the formal experimentations of Jim Melchert, or Suzanne Jackson’s diaphanous hanging paintings, we are reminded that art itself is a radical act.</p>\n<h3>Mike Henderson: Truth, Love, and Curiosity</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hainesgallery.com/exhibitions/93-mike-henderson-truth-love-and-curiosity/\">Haines Gallery</a>, 2 Marina Boulevard, Building C, San Francisco, California<br/>Through October 25</p>\n<p>Mike Henderson is a force. At 82 years old, the pioneering Bay Area painter’s work remains as fresh and innovative as ever. His solo show at Haines Gallery features 16mm films from the 1970s and ’80s and  brand-new paintings, alongside pieces from the ’90s and early 2000s that result from persistent, exploratory revision, earning them the nickname “worry paintings.” On view for the first time, the abstract compositions in <i>Truth, Love, and Curiosity</i> are both explosive and measured, exhibiting Henderson at his most experimental and exacting.</p>\n<h3>Julio César Morales: OJO and My America</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://gallerywendinorris.com/exhibitions/forthcoming/\">Gallery Wendi Norris</a>, 436 Jackson Street, San Francisco, California<br/>September 19–November 1<a href=\"https://manettishremmuseum.ucdavis.edu/current-exhibitions\">Manetti Shrem Museum of Art</a>, 254 Old Davis Road, Davis, California<br/>Through November 29</p>\n<p>Returning to his full-time art practice after several years as a curator and museum director in Arizona, Julio César Morales debuts two concurrent exhibitions in the Bay Area: <i>OJO</i> and <i>My America</i>. In both shows, the Mexican-born artist tackles themes of human trafficking and immigration on his own terms. A neon sign heralding “tomorrow is for those who can hear it coming” resonates with intimate watercolors of figures hiding in desperate modes of transportation — perhaps seeking that tomorrow.  </p>\n<h3>Auudi Dorsey: What’s Left, Never Left</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jonathancarvermoore.com/exhibitions/\">Jonathan Carver Moore</a>, 966 Market Street, San Francisco, California<br/>October 9–December 20</p>\n<p>Following a six-week residency at the gallery, New Orleans-based painter Auudi Dorsey will open his first solo exhibition at Jonathan Carver Moore. His new body of figurative work imagines scenes from the now-defunct Lincoln Beach amusement park in New Orleans, which was a hub of Black community during Jim Crow-era segregation. Here, Dorsey paints into the absent documentation of this landmark of Black joy and leisure.</p>\n<h3>Jim Melchert: Where the Boundaries Are</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dirosaart.org/2025/04/jim-melchert-where-the-boundaries-are/\">di Rosa SF</a>, 1150 25th Street, San Francisco, California<br/>October 18–January 3, 2026</p>\n<p>The first major retrospective dedicated to late artist Jim Melchert, this exhibition mines the continuum of conceptual ceramic art in the Bay Area. Accompanied by the work of contemporary artists carrying on his legacy, Melchert’s geometric abstractions tangle with photography and performance. With a brand of experimentation deeply rooted in materiality, Melchert had his head in the clouds and his hands in the mud.</p>\n<h3>MAKIBAKA: A Living Legacy</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://ybca.org/event/makibaka-a-living-legacy/\">Yerba Buena Center for the Arts</a>, 701 Mission Street, San Francisco, California<br/>Through January 4, 2026</p>\n<p>Organized with the SOMA Pilipinas cultural organization, <i>MAKIBAKA </i>celebrates the history and legacy of San Francisco’s Filipino community through works ranging from fine art to protest posters. The show takes its title from the Tagalog word meaning to struggle, resist, and defy and features work by over 20 artists and collectives, including Cherisse Alcantara’s luminous paintings of light and shadow in urban scenes and England Hidalgo’s palimpsestic homages to historic Filipino spaces in the city.</p>\n<h3>Suzanne Jackson: What is Love</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/suzanne-jackson-what-is-love/\">San Francisco Museum of Modern Art</a>, 151 Third Street, San Francisco, California<br/>September 29–March 1, 2026</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1042570/10-art-shows-to-see-in-the-bay-area-fall-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>In 2006, I <a href=\"https://brooklynrail.org/2006/04/art/stephen-westfall-with-john-yau/\">interviewed</a> Stephen Westfall about his longtime interest in the possibilities of a skewed grid, among other subjects. He came to this grid by connecting Agnes Martin with Paul Klee; he also discussed vulnerability and planar abstraction, and the different sources from modern signs and symbols he could tap into: </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>In my work, there’s Navajo rugs, Walker Evans, and NASCAR scoreboards. You see this stuff and then you go back to start thinking about a structure that has all that without advertising any single one of those things; a structure that might breed another structure in and of itself, and all those things are in it.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>The relationship of vulnerability with planar abstraction and the culture of signs and symbols came to mind when I visited Westfall’s current exhibition, <i> Ornithology</i>, at Alexandre Gallery. The title has three points of reference: The great American saxophonist Charlie Parker, who revolutionized jazz improvisation, was popularly known as “Bird”; the triangles that serve as key elements in Westfall’s current work allude to abstracted bird beaks; and the Abstract Expressionist Barnett Newman famously said “Aesthetics is to artists as ornithology is to birds.” </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/SW25_03KirbyCove_small.jpg?resize=1034%2C1296&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>What Parker and Newman, both pioneering artists, share is an interest in phrasing — whether in music or painting — within an overall composition. Parker is credited with asymmetrical phrasing, which broke up the patterned rhythms that structure big band jazz, while Newman used his vertical “zips” to divide his paintings into uneven areas in order to merge the different sides into one experience. The tension between merging and dividing, and well as constantly fluctuating unities, lay at the core of Westfall’s geometric abstractions, with the triangle as the central feature in keeping the viewer engaged.</p>\n    <p>The exhibition consists of 10 oil and alkyd paintings from 2024 and ’25, and seven gouaches dating from 2010 to 2025, as well as a wall mural painted in the stairwell connecting the first and second floors. The shift in the wall’s orientation gave Westfall the opportunity to divide the mural into discrete sections, “Conference of Birds” I, II, and III (2025). The collision of the sections — each of which incorporates triangles in different colors and interlocking, sawtooth configurations — is simultaneously cacophonous and rhythmic.</p>\n    <p>Two gouaches with similar compositions, “Sharp Haze” and “Olivera,” both from 2010, convey how far Westfall has advanced in his use of the diamond, coupled with the expansive limits of asymmetry. Both gouaches depict concentric diamonds. In each, the large, monochromatic diamond in the center dominates the picture plane, while the enclosing ones are cropped by the paper’s edges. The two works are composed of static forms, with their cropped edges hinting that this stasis continues beyond the purview of the pictorial space.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/SW25_04JuJuForWayneShorter_small-1-1200x1198.jpg?resize=1200%2C1198&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Westfall has spent his career working within the geometric abstraction genre while trying to disrupt the rhythmic patterns associated with planar abstraction and Op Art. The multivalent tensions and asymmetrical shifts in “Ornithology” and “JuJu (for Wayne Shorter)” (both 2025) never settle into stable compositions, as they likely would in the geometric abstraction of previous generations, whether it’s that of Pattern and Decoration, Op Art, or Hard Edge painting.</p>\n    <p>“JuJu (for Wayne Shorter)” is divided into a grid of nine irregular rectangles on a square canvas, each one further divided diagonally into two triangles. This composition allows Westfall to improvise with color, painting each of the 18 triangles a different monochromatic hue. For some paired triangles, he uses sharply contrasting colors, and for others, he applies related tones, such as two different grays.</p>\n    <p>It is with “Ornithology” and “Juju (for Wayne Shorter),” and two related paintings, “Cabana I” and “Cabana II” (both 2024), that Westfall breaks open planar abstraction more than he ever has. The logic of these works is internal. There is no formula to his color choices, and he does not rely on a signature structure. He achieves his desire to improvise and he chooses unpredictable colors. With this group of new paintings, Westfall has entered a groundbreaking phrase in his long career.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/SW25_06TheTallGrass_small.jpg?resize=1070%2C1296&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.alexandregallery.com/exhibitions/stephen-westfall2#tab:thumbnails\">Stephen Westfall: Ornithology</a> <i>continues at Alexandre Gallery (25 East 73rd Street, Second and Third Floors, Upper East Side, Manhattan) through October 25.

    "body": "<p>CHARLESTON, S.C. — Under a full moon very early on a Tuesday morning 162 years ago, Harriet Tubman, already sweating in the South Carolina late spring humidity, prepared her troops to attack the Confederacy. Under the command of Union Colonel James Montgomery, she led a group of spies, scouts, and pilots, as well as a volunteer contingent of 300 Black soldiers and one Rhode Island artillery battery, up the lower Combahee River, using her keen knowledge of astronomy, healing plants, land, and waterways. She would become the first woman in United States history to helm a major military operation, and the leader of the largest and most successful slave rebellion in the history of the United States.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gibbesmuseum.org/exhibitions/picturing-freedom-harriet-tubman-and-the-combahee-river-raid/141\"> Picturing Freedom: Harriet Tubman and the Combahee River Raid</a> at the Gibbes Museum of Art celebrates the freedom fighter’s story without over-mythologizing her. The exhibition was organized by guest curator Vanessa Thaxton-Ward and Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Edda Fields-Black to accompany the recently published </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"http://bookshop.org/a/539/9780197552797\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>(2024). It expands the groundbreaking first full account of Tubman’s Civil War service and the Combahee River Raid, recounting the story of enslaved families living in bondage and fighting for their freedom by citing more than 175 US Civil War pension files of the regiments of Second South Carolina Volunteers, in addition to interviews, news reports, and other historical ephemera.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>The exhibition relates to that text through historical and art objects, including but not limited to Tubman’s affidavit claim for a pension, and early stereoscopic photographs of newly freed and enslaved peoples — coincidentally, an uncomfortable reminder that the early tools of cinematography and American slavery are closely intertwined. The objects are in dialogue with environmental photographer J Henry Fair’s stunning images and video work of the willful, mysterious, and challenging terrain of South Carolina Lowcountry. These diagrammatic photos are hung alongside paintings, quilts, and assemblages from the likes of Jacob Lawrence, Faith Ringgold, William H. Johnson, Stephen Towns, Kevin Pullen, and Aaron Douglas.</p>\n<p>Upon entering the gallery, we are greeted by Faith Ringgold’s portrait of Tubman, “Coming to Jones Road Tanka #1, Harriet Tubman”<i> </i>(2010). Made in collaboration with her mother, fashion designer Willie Posey Jones, in the Tibetan <i>thangka</i> tradition, the painted hanging textile functions as both a spiritual guide and meditative tool. Tubman appears to be seated, centered amongst lush greenery upon a deep Naphthol Red satin. The piece bears a quote from Tubman: “There’s one of two things I had a right to — liberty or death; if I could not have one I would have the other; for no man should take me alive.”</p>\n<p>Stephen Towns’s “And I Shall Smite Thee” (2018) depicts an image of a young Tubman resting after an attack by an oppressor. Towns utilizes similar material histories as Ringgold to narrate a story about the abolitionist; using a hanging textile work, this time quilted, we see her on a riverbank. To her left, a crane — a marker of an ecologically healthy wetland and a symbol of bravery, spirituality, longevity, and even perceptiveness across many African nations and tribes — sits amongst the trees, perhaps symbolizing Tubman as a warrior whose rigorously spiritual life guided her in her pursuit of freedom for enslaved people. Opposite, a beam of light cuts across the red beaded, prehistoric eye of an alligator, a reminder that ecological and man-made violence coexist with religiosity in a visualization of two large components of Tubman’s life.</p>\n<p>The second gallery introduces us to our contemporaries via portraits by photographer J Henry Fair, whose ancestors were freed during the Raid, tracing a line from that early morning in 1863 to today. Pictured here, amongst others, is <a href=\"https://www.jhenryfair.com/williams\">Arthur Williams, whose great-great grandmother, Rebecca Simmons, escaped that night.</a> The portraits are paired with interviews accessible via headsets and QR codes, and hung perpendicular to Fair’s photographs documenting land or tools at closer detail. One photograph of cypresses emerging from wetland, for instance, is paired with a text reminding us that the Carolina rice fields were once treacherous cypress swamps that enslaved people cleared by hand.</p>\n<p><i>Picturing Freedom: Harriet Tubman and the Combahee River Raid</i>, featuring a work by Stephen Towns on the left</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1041911/the-night-harriet-tubman-made-history-gibbes-museum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>About a decade ago, I was at a fundraising event when the director of a Brooklyn residency encouraged me to apply for a Van Lier studio fellowship. I had just recommitted to my practice and was hungry for momentum. I went home, pulled together the application, and hit submit with the kind of optimism that sustains artists between yeses.</p>\n<p>The rejection landed quickly: I was ineligible because I was too old. Not by years or months, but literally seven days too old.</p>\n<p>The email didn’t measure my resolve or my potential. It measured my birth date. A stopwatch dressed up as equity.</p>\n<p>That absurd moment revealed something larger. It wasn’t just a lost residency; it was a reminder of how time itself disciplines artists, deciding who counts as “emerging,” who gets resources, and who gets written out.</p>\n<p>In her 2010 book <a href=\"http://bookshop.org/a/539/9780822348047\"> Time Binds: Queer Temporalities, Queer Histories</a>, cultural theorist Elizabeth Freeman uses the term “chrononormativity” to describe the way dominant culture organizes life into linear stages — education, work, family, retirement — and keeps us “on time.” In the arts, chrononormativity takes the form of the conveyor belt we’re all told to ride: emerging by 30, mid-career by 40, late-career by 60. If you fall behind, step off, or return later, the system doesn’t know what to do with you.</p>\n<p>Freeman’s concept makes sense in the context of artists’ lives, which are often lived queerly in relation to time — not always in terms of sexuality or gender, but in the refusal of normative clocks. We start late, shift mediums, pause for caregiving or parenting, recommit after detours. Our timelines are asynchronous, cyclical, out of sync. The late scholar <a href=\"https://nyupress.org/9781479874569/cruising-utopia-10th-anniversary-edition/\">José Esteban Muñoz</a> called this queer temporality: resisting the straight line.</p>\n<p>And yet, our institutions insist on enforcing chrononormativity. They set age caps, define categories vaguely, and reward those who stay closest to the script. My experience with the Van Lier studio residency is a case in point.</p>\n<p>Created through the estate of <a href=\"https://licf.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Edward-Sally-Van-Lier.pdf\">Edward and Sally Van Lier</a>, the Van Lier fellowships were funneled into the <a href=\"https://thenytrust.org/\">New York Community Trust</a> with a clear donor mandate: to support young professional artists from historically underrepresented populations in New York City. Since their establishment, “early-career” has been defined as aged 18 to 30. Administering organizations — <a href=\"https://movementresearch.org/artist-opportunities-and-programs/residency-programs/van-lier-emerging-artist-of-color-fellowship/\">Movement Research</a>, <a href=\"https://www.abronsartscenter.org/residencies/visual-artist\">Abrons Arts Center</a>, <a href=\"https://www.rattlestick.org/van-lier-new-voices-fellowship\">Rattlestick Theater</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.aaartsalliance.org/programs/van-lier-fellowship\">Asian American Arts Alliance</a> — all enforce that cap. The rigidity isn’t arbitrary. It reflects donor intent. And because the Trust is bound to honor that intent, the rules are unlikely to change unless new, parallel funds are created.</p>\n<p>Philanthropy frozen in amber.</p>\n<p>On paper, the program is designed to correct inequities by providing artists of color and other marginalized communities with early-career resources they’ve historically been denied. In practice, it means that at the moment I recommitted to making art, I was already past my expiration date.</p>\n<p>The Van Lier rules don’t exist in isolation. They intersect with a broader tightening of the pipeline that defines who even gets to be “on time.” The recent Supreme Court decision <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/831390/artists-denounce-supreme-courts-ruling-on-affirmative-action/\">striking down affirmative action</a> in higher education has already led to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/investigations/black-enrollment-dips-colleges-affirmative-action-ruling-rcna169575\">drops in enrollment</a> of Black students at some colleges and universities. For the art world, this matters because elite undergraduate and MFA programs remain the most common entry points into residencies, fellowships, and institutional networks. If fewer Black students are admitted to those programs, fewer will even have the chance to align with the timelines that Van Lier demands.</p>\n<p>This compounds the logic of respectability politics. Black artists are told that legitimacy comes from entering the system in the “correct” way, through degrees, residencies, and fellowships earned on schedule. But systemic barriers mean that many can’t access those routes in time, or at all. The age cap then becomes one more filter, weeding out those who didn’t conform to the prescribed path while rewarding those who could.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1042641/when-artists-are-too-old-to-be-emerging/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Bon Appétit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>Worried you’ll need to buy all new pots and pans to use with an <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-portable-induction-burner\">induction cooktop</a>? Don’t! If you’ve been taking our advice, you already own or are already thinking about buying the best induction cookware. And even if you haven’t been turning to us for <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/shopping\">product recommendations</a>, you likely don’t have to start over with all new cookware because there’s a very good chance you have at least a few pots and pans in your existing cookware collection that will work on an induction range.</p>\n<h2>The best induction cookware</h2>\n<p>Compared to gas and electric, induction is <a href=\"https://www.epicurious.com/shopping/induction-vs-gas-why-i-said-goodbye-to-open-flame-cooking\">a relatively new technology</a>, and there’s still some confusion surrounding it. The most common misconception is that you need “special induction cookware.” But before I debunk that idea—and share BA’s favorite induction compatible pots and pans—let me explain how induction works.</p>\n<h2>How does induction cooking work?</h2>\n<p>Since our ancestors started cooking food <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/14/world/earliest-evidence-of-cooking-with-fire-scn\">hundreds of thousands</a> of years ago, it’s happened by way of thermal heat transfer. That is the movement of energy from one thing and onto the next. Even electric stovetops work by transferring heat from the electric coil to the stove’s surface to the pan, which then heats the food.</p>\n<p>Cooking by way of thermal transfer has clearly worked out well for humanity, but it’s not the most efficient process, because so much of that energy is wasted heating the cooktop—and the air in your kitchen—instead of the food you’re trying to cook.</p>\n<p>Induction technology feels a little more science-fictiony, because it kind of is. Instead of passing energy from one thing to the next, a copper coil (that’s embedded under a ceramic-glass cooking surface) sends an electromagnetic current <i>through</i> the surface directly to the pot or pan, without transferring any energy to the cooktop. Induction-compatible pots and pans immediately receive and conduct that energy, quickly heating whatever is inside.</p>\n<p>The surface of an induction stove will still get pretty warm to the touch because the thick ceramic glass will inevitably absorb some of the heat from the pan (thermal transfer!), but it will never get as hot as an electric range’s coil or a gas range’s flames. And unless you leave induction-compatible cookware sitting on your cooktop, you never have to worry about your child (<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62j431qn4mo\">or dog</a>) turning on a burner, because if the <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US20140014647A1\">sensor</a> embedded in the cooktop can’t find a conductor, no energy is transferred at all. This is why when you try to turn on an <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-portable-induction-burner\">induction burner</a> with no cookware (or the wrong cookware), you get an error message.</p>\n<h2>What is induction cookware?</h2>\n<p>That was a trick question! “Induction cookware” isn’t actually a thing, but induction-<i>compatible</i> cookware is—and you’ve probably already been using it for years.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned above, in order for an electromagnetic induction current to do anything, it needs a conductor to receive the current, and any ferrous or ferromagnetic metals will work. A <a href=\"https://www.metaltek.com/blog/ferrous-vs-non-ferrous-metals/#:~:text=Magnetism,prime%20example%20is%20induction%20heating\">ferrous metal</a> is a metal alloy that is primarily iron and that includes <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-stainless-steel-cookware\">stainless-steel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-cast-iron-skillet\">cast-iron</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-carbon-steel-pans\">carbon steel</a> cookware, no matter what kind of enamel or coating they have on them (because remember, electromagnetic currents basically teleport through other materials).</p>\n<p>This means your <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-stainless-steel-pan-skillet\">stainless steel pans</a> will work on induction, your grandma’s <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-cast-iron-skillet\">cast iron skillet</a> will work on induction, your Le Creuset <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-dutch-ovens\">Dutch oven</a> will work on induction, and a high-quality <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-nonstick-pans\">nonstick pan</a> will <i>probably</i> work on induction too.</p>\n<h2>How can I tell if my cookware will work with induction?</h2>\n<p>If you’re unsure of your cookware materials, there’s a very simple way to tell if it will work on an induction cooktop or not: Just grab a magnet and try to stick it to the base of your pot or pan. If it stays, the cookware is compatible; if it doesn’t, it’s not.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/the-best-induction-cookware-weve-ever-tested\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Debris, garbage and clothing often ends up in the park’s hot springs, geysers, fumaroles and mudpots</h2>\n<p>Every year, roughly four million travelers visit <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/tag/yellowstone-national-park/\">Yellowstone National Park</a> to marvel at its unique geothermal features. Most keep their personal items to themselves and throw their trash in the provided garbage cans. However, some visitors intentionally throw items into the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/nature/hydrothermal-features.htm\">more than 10,000</a> hot springs, geysers, fumaroles and mudpots scattered throughout the park; others accidentally lose their hats to the area’s high winds.</p>\n<p>Geothermal debris is a more common problem than you might think: Already this year, park staffers have removed more than 13,000 pieces of garbage from Yellowstone’s thermal areas, according to a new <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/observatories/yvo/news/hydrothermal-hats-and-visitor-safety-walking-boots-yellowstone-national-park\">report</a> from the United States Geological Survey (USGS).</p>\n<p>Hats were among the most common items, with members of the Yellowstone National Park geology program team recovering more than 300 of them so far in 2025. The estimated value of all that headgear? Nearly $6,000.</p>\n<p>They’ve also removed some “bizarre” items, according to the report, including a Birkenstock sandal, a knockoff Louis Vuitton bucket hat, a pizza box with uneaten slices inside, a ball cap with the words “I PEE IN THE LAKE,” a koala stuffed animal and a Polaroid photo of Excelsior Geyser.</p>\n<p>In 2024, crews had to remove a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/news/240712.htm\">fully submerged vehicle</a> from Semi-Centennial Geyser after a driver with four passengers accidentally drove off the road. (The car’s occupants all escaped with non-life-threatening injuries.) Park staffers have also had to remove pine tree trunks that visitors have thrown into hot springs, reported <a href=\"https://www.nationalparkstraveler.org/2024/12/hats-hydrothermals-removing-trash-yellowstones-fragile-features\"> National Parks Traveler</a>’s Rebecca Latson in December 2024.</p>\n<p>The park stretches across 3,472 square miles, making it <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/parkfacts.htm\">larger than</a> both Rhode Island and Delaware. </p>\n<p>Some of the most difficult and time-consuming items to remove are bits of food waste—like sunflower seed shells and orange peels—that visitors toss into the geothermal features.</p>\n<p>Park staffers spend countless hours cleaning debris from Yellowstone’s hydrothermal features. These burbling, steaming sites might seem robust and unchangeable, but they’re actually quite sensitive, according to the USGS.</p>\n<p>“Debris thrown into a hot spring can irreversibly change its behavior, resulting in lower temperature, changes to color and altered (or halted altogether!) eruption behavior,” according to the report. “This is what caused a change in the color of Morning Glory Pool, for example.”</p>\n<p>In the 1880s, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/morning-glory-pool.htm\">Morning Glory Pool</a> looked like a deep, purplish-blue morning glory flower—hence the name. However, today, the hot spring is a mix of yellows, oranges and greens.</p>\n<p>Some of the changes can be attributed to a natural cooling of the water, which provides a hospitable environment for orange- and yellow-colored bacteria. However, park officials say vandalism is largely to blame for the pool’s modern color palette.</p>\n<p>“Over the years people have thrown in thousands of pounds of coins, trash, rocks and logs into the pool,” according to the park. “Much of this debris became embedded in the sides and vent of the spring, which reduced the water circulation and thus the water temperature.”</p>\n<p>Throughout the park, trash is often found floating in boiling water, which makes it difficult to remove safely. Members of the geology team use a variety of tools, from fishing rods and extra-long slotted spoons to 30-foot grabber poles to remove litter from the geothermal features. Some are off-the-shelf products, while others are specially designed and manufactured at the park for the task.</p>\n<p>Crew members must also remove natural items like sticks and rocks, which have a tendency to accumulate in hydrothermal features near boardwalks and trails. So far this year, they’ve collected 4,000 rocks and sticks from various thermal areas throughout the park.</p>\n<p>It’s a major undertaking that requires near-constant vigilance. So far this year, the cleanup crew members have walked more than 1,300 miles of trails and boardwalks and driven more than 11,000 miles in their quest to remove trash.</p>\n<p>“We try to hit every area every week,” Jeff Hungerford, the park geologist at Yellowstone, told <i>National Parks Traveler</i>. “Sometimes when it gets really windy, we will try to hit <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/features/yell/ofvec/exhibits/treasures/midway/index.htm\">Midway Geyser Basin</a> twice a week or so.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/more-than-300-hats-have-been-pulled-from-yellowstones-geothermal-features-so-far-this-year-180987345/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Bon Appétit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Last update: 12:33 p.m., September, 17, 2025</i>\n    </p>\n<h2>Our favorite early Prime Day deals</h2>\n<p>Amazon Prime Day: It’s coming back. Did you miss it?</p>\n<p>Well, not Amazon Prime Day exactly. It’s the fall version of the retail giant’s sales event that it calls Prime Big Deal Days. But the idea is the same. Discounts, sometimes more than 60% on thousands of items.</p>\n<p>Here’s the problem though: pages featuring those thousands of items are a jungle to cut through. Just because something is one of Amazon’s top sellers doesn’t mean it’s the best version of that item, no matter how many stars it has.</p>\n<p>That’s why, every year for Prime Day, we cross-reference our deep database of product testing compiled over years of searing, chopping, toasting, air frying, coffee brewing, and everything else we do in the kitchen that makes it the best room in the house.</p>\n<p>The biggest deals won’t hit until the actual sales event in October, but one thing we’ve learned covering Prime Day is that there are always some early deals to be had. Jump down for our favorite early Prime Day deals on air fryers, coffee makers, cookware, and more, here.</p>\n<p>And now on with the discounts. This page will continue to be updated as we get into the actual Prime Big Deal Days, but you can already get up to 33% off on a whole range of items</p>\n<h2>Early Prime Day cookware deals</h2>\n<p>It’s never a bad time to pick up a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-dutch-ovens\">Dutch oven</a> from Le Creuset or <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-stainless-steel-pan-skillet\">stainless steel pan</a> from All-Clad, both of which can last you a lifetime.</p>\n<h2>Early Prime Day appliance deals</h2>\n<p>Perhaps you are one of the ever-shrinking number of kitchens that doesn’t yet have an air fryer. If you are, there are discounts on our <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-air-fryers-reviewed\">favorite basket-style model from Instant</a>. There are also discounts on some already-affordable <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-drip-coffee-makers\">coffee gear</a>.</p>\n<h2>Early Prime Day deals on kitchen tools</h2>\n<p>Prime Day (and the weeks leading up) are a great time to pick up some of those less expensive kitchen essentials, like a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-kitchen-scales\">scale</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-vegetable-peelers\">peeler</a>. Bigger purchases, like good knife sets, are a little harder to come by on sale, but there will likely be a few on the way.</p>\n<h2>Your Prime Day questions answered</h2>\n<p>What is Amazon Prime Big Deal Days?</p>\n<p>A few years ago Amazon began running back its Prime Day sales in the fall ahead of the holiday shopping season. It's a chance for people to pull the trigger on any deals they hesistated on and missed during the OG Prime Day in July.</p>\n<p>When is Amazon Prime Day this fall?</p>\n<p>Unlike Amazon’s summer Prime Day sale this summer, which, for the first time ever, was four days long, Prime Big Deal Days is going to remain the standard two days. It will run from October 7-8, so plenty of time to make those pre-Thanksgiving purchases that will help make holiday meal prep quicker, easier, and more organized.</p>\n<p>Do I have to be a Prime member to get the deals?</p>\n<p>Mostly you do. For the vast majority of sales that come online during the event you will need an Amazon Prime membership, which costs $139 a year. Now, as people who frequently utilize Prime shipping in both our professional and personal lives, we can say that it can pay for itself pretty quickly (in time saved if nothing else). A change from earlier Prime Day sales though is that Amazon seems to have discontinued its free 30-day trial.</p>\n<p>Previously, you could sign up for a free Prime Trial before or during Prime Day and then cancel if you decided it wasn’t your thing. Instead of a <i>free</i> Trial, <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/4h8jhTu8Afo9tpsTzkcpXVT32mrvTnyrRoFhSdfSDc2UY5V6b6eZuhkqNy8g4kZuCbFMQJWAHjXwUTkL68vEKNzN1sY9j1zpxkzZNfLc6YN5JZH7cnjhTP2xUuLyRBEBAHL3EuxyEQBxampyv1ohqurjky36uBJgy9GnFbs7jZg1MJ83RqmDB2Cz7GQeF8aZtsHJMiCNTXTWXYhMCBoHJcUKnr1QyVmNU8Fgp4B8sQFHBcHD1T6KhPzkjv6UgfqzRrmHapoTnghe4Y77sY1oBe7E5KnW8DgbN4LQFwpkQ45RPd2ng7Ss8LAQL5CeFuTxjM2HasvwaV6Q3RJfvVpmvY4jYL36KkJjSZu2FBNPGF2mrE9eR\">Amazon now offers a week of Prime benefits for $1.99.</a> That will still give you access to Prime Day deals for almost free, but, because lasts a week instead of a month, you’ll want to wait until early October to activate the trial.</p>\n<p>What will be on sale during Amazon Prime Day?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/amazon-prime-day-kitchen-deals-2025-09-17\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>According to Ezra Klein of<i> The New York Times</i>, Charlie Kirk, the ultra-conservative political activist and podcaster assassinated last week in Utah, was doing politics “the right way.” Here, Ta-Nehisi Coates skewers Klein and other pundits and politicians for their reaction to Kirk’s death—a reaction that has whitewashed his carefully crafted legacy: </p><blockquote><p>Kirk subscribed to some of the most disreputable and harmful beliefs that this country has ever known. But it is still chilling to think that those beliefs would be silenced by a gunshot. The tragedy is personal—Kirk was robbed of his life, and his children and family will forever live with the knowledge that a visual record of that robbery is just an internet search away. And the tragedy is national. Political violence ends conversation and invites war; its rejection is paramount to a functioning democracy and a free society. “Political violence is a virus,” Klein noted. This assertion is true. It is also at odds with Kirk’s own words. It’s not that Kirk merely, as Klein put it, “defended the Second Amendment”—it’s that Kirk endorsed hurting people to advance his preferred policy outcomes.</p><p>In 2022, when Kirk was frustrated, for instance, by the presence of Lia Thomas on the University of Pennsylvania women’s swim team, Kirk did not call for “spirited discourse.” Instead, while discussing a recent championship tournament, he said he would have liked to have seen a group of fathers</p><a href=\"\">descend from the stands</a>, forming “a line in front of [Lia] Thomas and saying, ‘Hey, tough guy, you want to get in the pool? ’Cause you’re gonna have to come through us.” Mere weeks before his death, Kirk reveled in Trump’s deployment of federal troops to DC. “Shock and awe. Force,”<a href=\"\">he wrote</a>. “We’re taking our country back from these cockroaches.” And in 2023, Kirk told his audience that then president<a href=\"\">Joe Biden</a>was a “corrupt tyrant” who should be “put in prison<a href=\"\">and/or given the death penalty</a>for his crimes against America.”<p>What are we to make of a man who called for the execution of the American president, and then was executed himself? What are we to make of an NFL that, on one hand, encourages us to “</p><a href=\"\">End Racism</a>,” and, on the other, urges us<a href=\"\">to commemorate</a>an unreconstructed white supremacist? And what of the writers, the thinkers, and the pundits who cannot separate the great crime of Kirk’s death from the malignancy of his public life? Can they truly be so ignorant to the words of a man they have so rushed to memorialize? I don’t know. But the most telling detail in Klein’s column was that, for all his praise, there was not a single word in the piece from Kirk himself.</blockquote><h2>More picks about white supremacy</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/07/15/ive-seen-how-the-neo-nazi-movement-is-escalating-you-should-worry/\">I’ve Seen How the Neo-Nazi Movement Is Escalating.

Working in a broad range of art making, the class features:</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3VRoBJE\"> McKayla Mae Bensheimer</a> is a printmaker and sculptor. She received her BFA in Sculpture from Herron School of Art and Design.  She has shown her work in the United States and internationally. She is drawn to the stories of humanity. Her work is about creating a pictorial story of contemporary human life through figural portraiture and sculpture. </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/4684tZX\"> Tayebeh (Bahar) Ejtemaei</a> is an Iranian painter whose work explores themes of memory, identity, and the passage of time through abstract and figurative visual language. Born and raised in Iran, Bahar studied painting at the University of Guilan. Her artwork, deeply rooted in both Eastern and Western experiences, evokes traces of human presence through symbolic fragments, hinting at absence, nostalgia, and resilience. </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/42nvEgU\"> Kate Greenwell</a> is a painter, printmaker, and collage artist whose work focuses on removing language from its found landscape. She highlights the dialogue between symbols, combining text with image to point out pre-existing messages. Her recent work centers her body as a map of tattoos, creating a self-portrait in pieces. </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/4mofAmh\"> Alex Heard</a> is on a quest to soften the harsh edges of our reality by seeking joy tirelessly from a place that does not exist. This realm of softness comes into existence through wearable objects, performance, and installation. It is populated by plush characters and objects come alive. The stories these characters tell are about failure, anxiety, and shame. </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/4n2MMke\"> Avery Nielsen-Webb</a> is a photographer whose work often explores the tension between industrial development and the environment. An avid outdoorsman, he finds deep inspiration in the wilderness hiking, backpacking, and witnessing nature at its most beautiful. His visual style is shaped by Dutch landscape painters and the New Topographics movement of 1975, which inspires him to evolve their legacy in documenting humanity’s shifting relationship with the land.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3KmONcA\">UConn’s MFA Studio Art program</a> is a fully funded three-year graduate program which supports a broad range of art making including painting/drawing, photography/video, printmaking, and sculpture/ceramics. Its international faculty and superior, generous facilities in a rural environment are centrally located in Southern New England, great for easy day trips to New York, Boston, Providence, Hartford, and New Haven. The program culminates with a show at a Northeast gallery and a thesis exhibition in UConn’s William Benton Museum of Art.</p>\n    <p>Why consider coming to UConn? Here are some of the reasons:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>An intensive, cross/multidisciplinary approach</li>\n      <li>Creative excitement and intellectual energy of an art school and a major research university combined</li>\n      <li>A nationally and internationally renowned faculty</li>\n      <li>Fully funded program providing both tuition remission, stipend, and health insurance</li>\n      <li>One of the most successful and exciting creative and intellectual communities in the country</li>\n      <li>Visiting artists, field trips, and exhibition opportunities</li>\n      <li>The success of our alumni</li>\n      <li>Access to all the arts</li>\n      <li>Large studios and new and improved facilities</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>The MFA in Studio Art requires the completion of the University of Connecticut <a href=\"https://bit.ly/46nQuxM\">Graduate School application</a> and the submission of the creative portfolio through the UConn Graduate <a href=\"https://bit.ly/46CE46x\">SlideRoom</a>.</p>\n    <p>The deadline for submitting the application is January 15, 2026.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>For more information, visit </strong>\n      <strong>art.uconn.edu</strong>\n      <strong>.</strong>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1041920/meet-uconns-mfa-studio-art-class-of-2028/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p><i> The Siren</i> — the political satire newspaper led by artists Coco Fusco, Noah Fischer, and Pablo Helguera — is back with its third issue. This edition examines the many facets of the ongoing authoritarian assault on the nation: ICE raids, massive budget cuts, the dismantling of civil and voting rights, attacks on environmental protections, and more. Its central focus, however, is MAGA’s assault on the arts, targeting institutions such as the Smithsonian, the Venice Biennale, and even the absurd proposal for a “Garden of American Heroes.” The issue also features contributions from artists worldwide who have endured and resisted authoritarian regimes, offering hard-earned perspectives for our collective political education. As our editorial notes, “It’s the end of the world as we’ve known it — which is no laughing matter. And yet, it seems only the comedians are left daring enough to poke the bear.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/The-Siren3_FINAL_COLOR-1200x1655.jpg?resize=1200%2C1655&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/The-Siren3_FINAL_COLOR2-1200x1655.jpg?resize=1200%2C1655&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/The-Siren3_FINAL_COLOR3-1200x1655.jpg?resize=1200%2C1655&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/The-Siren3_FINAL_COLOR4-1200x1655.jpg?resize=1200%2C1655&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/The-Siren3_FINAL_COLOR5-1200x1655.jpg?resize=1200%2C1655&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/The-Siren3_FINAL_COLOR6-1200x1655.jpg?resize=1200%2C1655&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/The-Siren3_FINAL_COLOR7-1200x1655.jpg?resize=1200%2C1655&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/The-Siren3_FINAL_COLORf8-1200x1655.jpg?resize=1200%2C1655&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1042547/the-siren-maga-is-coming-for-the-arts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The display is part of the celebrations leading up to America’s <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/americas-250th-anniversary-180986272/\">250th anniversary</a>.</p>\n    <p>The National Archives has the Declaration of Independence, the four pages of the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights <a href=\"https://visit.archives.gov/whats-on/explore-exhibits/charters-freedom\">on display permanently</a>. However, for two weeks, the museum will also exhibit the “fifth page,” also known as the transmittal page, which tells states how to implement the Constitution. It bears the signature of George Washington, then the president of the Constitutional Convention.</p>\n    <h4>Quick fact: How many Constitutional amendments have been ratified?</h4>\n    <p>The Constitution has a total of <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/amendments\">27 amendments</a>, and the first ten are known as the Bill of Rights.</p>\n    <p>In addition, visitors to the Rotunda will also be able to see the 17 amendments that followed the Bill of Rights.</p>\n    <p>The “fifth page” was briefly exhibited <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2012/nr12-161\">in 2012</a>. However, the upcoming exhibition marks the first time that all five pages of the Constitution, plus the Bill of Rights and the 17 other amendments, have been shown together.</p>\n    <p>Admission to the National Archives is free and tickets are not required. However, officials are expecting long wait times during the special Constitution display. They suggest making a timed-entry reservation online. The National Archives is also offering extended weekend hours to help make the Constitution accessible to as many individuals as possible.</p>\n    <p>“As we approach the 250th anniversary of our nation’s founding, the National Archives is playing a major role in the coast-to-coast commemorations by providing the American people access to their history,” says Jim Byron, senior adviser to the acting archivist, in a <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2025/nr25-12\">statement</a>. “This extraordinary installation welcomes all Americans to celebrate the bedrock of our national life: our Constitution.”</p>\n    <p>Beyond the Constitution, the National Archives is celebrating America’s 250th in other ways, too. In October, the museum will wrap up a $40 million renovation and open a new permanent exhibition called “<a href=\"https://visit.archives.gov/whats-on/explore-exhibits/american-story\">The American Story</a>.” Visitors will be able to use artificial intelligence to explore the records held in the National Archives in the new 10,000-square-foot galleries, which will feature digital display cases and media stations. In the meantime, guests can explore the National Archives’ “<a href=\"https://visit.archives.gov/whats-on/explore-exhibits/opening-vault\">Opening the Vault</a>” exhibition, which features a rotating selection of artifacts linked to the moments and people that shaped the nation.</p>\n    <p>Other celebrations are also in the works elsewhere. Later this year, the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia will open “<a href=\"https://www.amrevmuseum.org/exhibits/the-declaration-s-journey\">The Declaration’s Journey</a>,” an exploration of the Declaration of Independence’s history and global significance. The Concord Museum in Massachusetts is mounting <a href=\"https://concordmuseum.org/250th/\">several special exhibitions</a>.</p>\n    <p>Next year, the New York Public Library will display one of Thomas Jefferson’s <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/see-thomas-jeffersons-handwritten-copy-of-the-declaration-of-independence-180987277/\">handwritten copies</a> of the Declaration of Independence, which he wrote a few days after the <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/bold-meeting-250-years-ago-continental-congress-set-america-in-motion-180984908/\">Continental Congress</a> officially adopted the document on July 4, 1776. The Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History will also be debuting a new museum-wide exhibition next year called “<a href=\"https://americanhistory.si.edu/explore/projects/celebrate-the-nations-250th-in-2026\">In Pursuit of Life, Liberty and Happiness</a>” featuring 250 objects from American history. Meanwhile, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston is putting together a new display called “<a href=\"https://www.mfa.org/collections/americas/america-at-250\">America at 250</a>,” which will explore the relationship between artists, nationhood and identity.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/see-the-entire-us-constitution-on-display-for-the-very-first-time-in-history-180987338/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Then, they predicted what color another participant was looking at, based on how the person’s brain activity compared to patterns revealed in the first set of scans.</p>\n    <p>“There are commonalities across brains,” Bartels says to Laura Sanders at <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/red-same-brain-activity-color\"> Science News</a>. Different colors, the team found, seem to be processed in slightly different areas within the visual cortex, and certain brain cells appear to have a “bias” toward specific colors. These reactions seem to be rather standardized between people. The findings were published in the </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.2717-20.2025\">earlier this month.</a>\n    </p>\n    <i>Journal of Neuroscience</i>\n    <p>“The Bartels paper is super cool,” says <a href=\"https://bevilconway.com/\">Bevil Conway</a>, a researcher at the National Eye Institute who was not involved in the study, to Kenneth Chang at the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/08/science/colors-brain-perception-vision.html\"> New York Times</a>.</p>\n    <p>“The work has broad implications, suggesting that evolutionary selective pressures very strongly favor high-fidelity color perception,” he adds. “Which is just a fancy way of saying that from an evolutionary point of view, color is really important.”</p>\n    <h4>Fun fact: A “new color” called olo</h4>\n    <p>By firing laser pulses into research participants’ eyes, scientists announced earlier this year that they had allowed for the <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/scientists-say-theyve-discovered-a-new-color-an-unprecedented-hue-only-ever-seen-by-five-people-180986473/\">experience of a new color</a> called olo. It was described as a “blue-green of unprecedented saturation.”</p>\n    <p>Objects themselves don’t technically have color. We see color when certain wavelengths of light <a href=\"https://www.sciencefocus.com/science/what-determines-the-colour-of-an-object\">reflect off an object</a> and travel into the <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22694-retina-eye\">retinas</a> at the back of our eyes, where photoreceptors transmit signals to the brain through the optic nerve. Our brains then translate that information to interpret color.</p>\n    <p>This means that just because our brains may light up in the same way, our subjective experience of a color is not necessarily alike. To put it another way, your red may not actually look like my red, even if it activates the same regions in our brains.</p>\n    <p>“Colors are not just a physical property,” Bartels explains to the <i>New York Times</i>. “Color perception always includes a calculation by the brain about the illumination.” Sometimes, people’s brains make those calculations differently. That was the reason behind the notorious <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/2/27/8119901/explain-color-dress\">dress debacle of 2015</a>, he explains, when some people saw a striped dress posted on social media as blue and black, while others saw it as white and gold.</p>\n    <p>Future studies can take a closer look at those subjective differences or examine what evolutionary pressures might have led to the similarities in brain activity, as their cause is still unclear, the authors write in the study.</p>\n    <p>The study’s suggestion that brain cells are biased to certain colors is “a new finding that I was surprised by,” <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NEkBSWMAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Jenny Bosten</a>, a color vision scientist at the University of Sussex in England who was not involved with the work, tells <i> Nature</i>’s Katie Kavanagh. It doesn’t quite fit with what researchers had previously thought about how the visual cortex works.</p>\n    <p>“If [the study] stands the test of time—which there’s no reason why it shouldn’t—it might change how we view color-coding in the cortex,” Bosten adds.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/do-we-see-the-same-colors-as-others-study-suggests-brains-respond-to-the-same-hues-in-similar-ways-180987307/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I’ve been finding cassettes of Louise Hay meditations and prefer to <a href=\"https://bit.ly/47J3GQg\">use this</a> in my bedroom.

For the velvety sauce, you’ll need an ingredient that might be even less expected: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/what-is-american-cheese\">American cheese</a>. When combined with flour and water (you could use chicken stock or turkey broth, but you really don’t need to), the superior meltability of American cheese creates a lush no-roux gravy that clings to every part of the pot pie filling.</p>\n    <p>As for that filling, we start by roasting a boneless turkey breast, but you could certainly swap it for 1½–2 lb. of <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/gallery/leftover-turkey-recipes\">leftover turkey</a> from a holiday meal (or even a shredded rotisserie chicken). We also call for 20 oz. of frozen vegetables. If you’d rather pick and choose (or use up more <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/gallery/thanksgiving-leftovers-recipes\">Thanksgiving leftovers</a>), aim for about 4 cups frozen peas, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/blistered-green-beans-with-garlic\">sautéed green beans</a>, melted leeks, or whatever vegetables you like.</p>\n    <p>Have your egg wash ready to gloss the top of the <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/frozen-puff-pastry\">puff pastry sheet</a> as soon as you lay it on the warm filling—this is not the time to wait around. You want the pastry dough to go into the oven as cold as possible so that it puffs. Leaving it too long over the hot filling will allow the butter to melt out, resulting in a dense pastry. Place your casserole dish on a rimmed baking sheet to catch any burbling drips and to make it easier to move in and out of the oven without marring the crust.</p>\n    <p>All products featured on Bon Appétit are independently selected by our editors.

When Nora Ephron <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/27/nora-ephron-miss-wont-miss\">wrote her famous list</a> of things she’d miss and not miss, she said she’d miss butter, pie, bacon, waffles, and the concept of waffles. And it made me wonder what foods bring other people joy.</p>\n    <p>Curious, I texted cookbook author <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/grossypelosi/\">Dan Pelosi</a> this morning, and his list was: “olive oil, rigatoni, castelvetrano olives, lemons, anchovies.” And our beloved <a href=\"https://dinneralovestory.substack.com\">Jenny Rosenstrach</a> told me: “hummus, yogurt, cabbage, cottage cheese — and this time of year, Mallomars.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-17-at-11.41.56-AM.jpeg\" alt=\"Eric Kim and Adam Roberts\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ericjoonho/\">Eric Kim</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgourmet.com\">Adam Roberts</a></p>\n    <p>Then I asked my friend Adam of <a href=\"https://www.amateurgourmet.com\">The Amateur Gourmet</a>, and he said: “blueberries, bittersweet chocolate, Frantoia olive oil, anchovies, and Aleppo pepper for that fruity heat.”</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/katejbaer/\">Kate Baer</a>, poet and mom of four, has “tortilla chips, feta, roadside fruit, frozen peas, and sourdough bread from my sister in law.”</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://alislagle.substack.com/p/samin-nosrats-40-essential-ingredients\">Ali Slagle</a> just wrote about <a href=\"https://alislagle.substack.com/p/samin-nosrats-40-essential-ingredients\">Samin Nosrat’s 40 essential ingredients</a>, which include Dijon mustard, chickpeas, basmati rice, bone-in chicken thighs, and red onions. And from Trader Joe’s? She stocks <a href=\"https://www.foodandwine.com/samin-nosrat-trader-joes-favorites-11811543\">Taiwanese Green Onion Pancakes</a> in the freezer. “Then I can — for breakfast or dinner — have a scrambled egg or two on a scallion pancake.”</p>\n    <p>Finally, I had to ask <a href=\"https://joannagoddard.substack.com/p/boyfriend-freddie-podcast\">Freddie</a>, my personal chef, and his list was: “apples, eggs, chicken stock, olive oil, and black pepper (in the mill, you have to grate it on the spot). Oh, and broccoli in the freezer, so I can sauté it with garlic and oil for my boys.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-17-at-11.42.32-AM.png\" alt=\"anton\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>What five things do you always have on hand? I’d love to hear. Our own list has stayed mostly the same: cheddar cheese, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3IrYyFR\">French yogurts</a>, honeycrisp apples, <a href=\"https://www.instacart.com/products/16332560-gotham-greens-classic-pesto-6-5-oz\">Gotham Greens pesto</a>, and cavatappi pasta. Plus, all the boxes of Cheerios for teenage boy breakfasts!</p>\n    <p>P.S. <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/07/16/best-easy-lunch-recipe-vegetarian/\">My favorite lunch</a>, <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2018/10/31/best-jarred-pasta-sauce-taste-test/\">the best jarred tomato sauce</a>, and <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2017/06/01/misophonia/\">what are your pet peeves?</a> (I have a weird one.) Also, we asked this question <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2022/08/03/kitchen-essentials-pantry/\">three years ago</a> and <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2016/03/02/kitchen-pantry-essentials/\">nine years ago</a>!

    "body": "<p>There’s something in the air—can you smell it? It’s sweet, slightly vegetal, even floral. It’s corn, and it’s living rent free in the minds of bakers and pastry chefs around the country.</p>\n<p>Corn mania can be loosely traced back to a single dessert. When it opened in 2022, New York City “pastry boutique” Lysée debuted a pastry named simply “<a href=\"https://www.lyseenyc.com/ourcollections/p/country-feast-set-6afa6-wyykd\">corn</a>.” It’s a tromp l’oeil dessert, an oblong, chubby ear of corn dotted with neat rows of kernels, encased in a pair of pale green leaves. The center is a corn-flour based cake, each kernel made of corn mousse, with leaves made from white chocolate. The pastry went viral, and stayed that way. “It’s been more than three years since we opened, but it’s still one of our best sellers,” chef and owner Eunji Lee says,</p>\n<p>Now, chefs and bakers across the country are finding inventive ways to build corn into their pastries and desserts.

TikTok is littered with tutorials and videos of <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/discover/korean-corn-latte-recipe?lang=en\">corn cream lattes</a>, and bakeries like 1 Golden Pancake in Queens are baking boundary-defying corn crossover desserts like their <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DMsnlTCR-Ap/?hl=en\">corn croissant egg tarts</a>.</p>\n<p>Just as it’s popped up in bakeries and restaurants, corn culture has put down deep roots in the content creator universe.</p>\n<p>For Holly Haines, who goes by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/itsholly/?hl=en\">@ItsHolly</a> on Instagram, corn desserts are something of a habit. In recent months she’s made <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DLf8B76z_LL/?hl=en\">pretzel sweet corn pie</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DCNogVyvhIL/?hl=en\">corn gelato</a> (in a sweet corn tortilla cup, of course), and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DBP57URv6kc/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1\">corn tres leches.</a></p>\n<p>This content can also be viewed on the site it <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DNnuSkLtiMQ\">originates</a> from.</p>\n<p>Eric King (<a href=\"https://easygayoven.komi.io/?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaewGxbW1UMgCk5pLXx7r5KS3m5DlPn3O0jWai7FxLUmXDOmgzfzxzBgQ_Ikyg_aem_1zr-AB5w1qnRQhvLVsdpRA\">@easygayoven</a> on all platforms), who developed his <a href=\"https://easygayoven.substack.com/p/corn-cream-trifles\">corn cream trifles</a> using both kernels and cobs, using corn is as much about the seasonality as it is about its flavor. His take on a knickerbocker glory—a British dessert made from whipped cream, ice cream, wafer cookies, and fruit—uses peaches and nectarines bathed in a subtly sweet corn pastry cream. “It's kind of grassy and kind of earthy,” he says. “It definitely cuts through sweetness really well.”</p>\n<p>King's corn pastry cream appeared in Erika Kwee’s sweet <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DN-uX_sDB5V/?hl=en\">corn layer cake</a> a couple weeks after its debut.

It’s a pre-hispanic Oaxacan dessert called nicuatole made from just corn, cinnamon, and water—the naturally present starch in the corn helps everything set into jiggling, jellied perfection. Chef Fátima Juárez tops the nicuatole with piped strawberry whipped cream and hibiscus, but a major flavor component, she says, is the corn itself. She uses a specific type of heirloom Mexican corn called chalqueña cremoso which gives the jelly a delicately milky flavor.</p>\n<p>But, as she explains, corn is incredibly versatile, and Juárez’s nicuatole is just one of her corn-based dessert ideas. She’s dreaming up chocolate tortillas, corn cookies and conchas—it’s all about harnessing the unique flavors and aromas in heirloom corn. Some varieties bloom into a beautiful nutty flavor, while others have a sharp fruitiness like red berries.</p>\n<p>Once you start paying attention to the distinct flavors in heirloom corn, “you'll see the difference in the flavor notes,” Juárez says. “It’s just like drinking tea or wine.”</p>\n<p>Juárez’s Komal is one of a growing number of restaurants across the country <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/why-masa-is-everywhere?srsltid=AfmBOoq8V2mdX1czfkDxI5P1Rgpeu5UGX6APD29rtFhsypIEHfvYnqEQ\">dedicating their menus to heirloom corn varieties</a> sourced from Mexico.

Even Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., current Secretary of Health and Human Services, who has <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6330950198112\">stated in the past</a> that “autism comes from vaccines” – a <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/autism-vaccine-link-debunked\">widely debunked claim</a> – has taken up that mantle.</p><p>Now, broad swaths of the nation no longer have the mutual protection (or “herd immunity”) needed to keep such illnesses from taking hold, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/data-investigation-childhood-vaccination-rates-are-backsliding-us-rcna228876?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma&amp;taid=68c88e1123276500015a3767&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter\">a new study finds</a>. In 68% of U.S. counties and jurisdictions, immunization rates have fallen below 95%, the level needed to stave off outbreaks, researchers at NBC News and Stanford University have found.</p><p>The joint study also discovered that 77% of counties in the U.S. have reported “notable” declines in childhood vaccination rates over the years. And “as childhood vaccination rates fall, we’ll see more diseases like measles,” Dr. Sean O’Leary, an infectious diseases expert with the American Academy of Pediatrics, told NBC News.</p><p>O’Leary was clear about the outcome of this trend: “We’ll see more children die – tragically – from diseases that are essentially entirely preventable.”</p><p>These findings are revealed as Kennedy prepares to hold a <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-cdc-acip-members-covid-vaccine-critics/\">federal vaccine panel</a> that will vote on recommendations for Covid boosters, chickenpox and Hepatitis B inoculations. Several members of the panel have expressed vaccine skepticism. </p><h3><strong>It Impacts Women, Too</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the chief concern of children’s health, the rampant spreading of illness would take a heavy toll on women’s professional and personal wellbeing, too, as we remain America’s primary caregivers to both young and old. Indeed, women are <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/10/who-stays-home-when-the-kids-are-sick/382011/\">10 times more likely</a> than male parents and partners to take time off from work to tend to their sick children.</p><p>St. Louis has become a microcosm of these broader concerns, the NBC News and Stanford researchers found. There, vaccination rates have fallen from nearly 90% in 2010 to 74% in 2024 – even lower than the 77% vaccination rate in Gaines County, Texas, where a measles outbreak ripped through the local population earlier this year.</p><p>“That’s a heavy, heavy fact,” Virginia Wilson, head nurse at the Premier Charter School in St. Louis, said to NBC. “We’re just in a waiting phase before measles comes and rocks the state of Missouri” and the many other at-risk parts of the country.</p><p>Though there are other factors at play in the growth of the issue – access to healthcare and insurance coverage and easing school requirements among them – experts point to the spreading of vaccine misinformation as a significant driver.</p><p>“It makes me sad,” Dr. Thomas McKinney, a pediatrician at Affinia Healthcare in St. Louis, added. “The vaccines that we’re giving have been such an important tool in preventing so much illness in kids, and just the community as a whole.”</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/herd-immunity-is-now-dangerously-low-children-and-women-will-suffer-most/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Perspective and experience alchemize within you, making you more self-assured and self-aware. But it can also be a time when self-care takes a backseat. PSA: It doesn’t have to! In fact, the right beauty tips for your 40s can help you feel more grounded and radiant than ever.</p>\n<p>As we age, it’s more important than ever to nourish not just our bodies, but our souls. Investing in <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-find-a-hobby/\">hobbies</a> that make you feel like yourself. Being intentional about your time—spending less of it on your phone and more of it with the people you love. Curating a beauty ritual that helps you show up as the person you want to be. All of this is self-care, and prioritizing it becomes more and more important with every passing year.</p>\n<p><i>Featured image  from our interview with Molly Sims by Michelle Nash</i>.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Beauty products for beauty tips in your 40s.&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/style/beauty-tips-40s/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/makeup-products-865x1296.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Beauty Tips the Chicest Women Swear By</h2>\n<p>From your <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/morning-routine-ideas/\">morning routine</a> to the lip color that makes you feel confident, your routines should make you feel more like you—especially your beauty ritual. This is what being ‘chic’ means to us: being curated, intentional, and wholly yourself. For inspiration on beauty rituals that nurture both inner and outer glow, we gathered the best beauty tips from the chicest women we know.</p>\n<h3>Start With a Face Massage</h3>\n<p>Staring at my puffy face in the morning? Not the best way to inspire confidence. Whether it’s a gua sha or an ice roller, a face massage promotes <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/lymphatic-drainage-massage-tips/\">lymphatic drainage</a> while giving instant sculpt. No wonder so many of the most stylish women we know start with a <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/best-face-oils-for-gua-sha/\">gua sha ritual</a>.</p>\n<p>“I start my morning with a simple, three-minute gua sha ritual using a stainless steel tool. The exact one I’ve loved for years isn’t available anymore, but this similar one from <strong>Isamaya x FaceGym</strong><strong> </strong>has the same thoughtful design and edges. I pair this ritual with <strong>Oak Essentials Ritual Oil</strong><strong>,</strong> a longtime favorite that’s never caused breakouts—I’ve easily gone through ten bottles by now.” <i>– Diana Cohen, Founder of  Crown Affair</i></p>\n<p>“Sometimes when I feel a bit puffy, I will give myself a gua sha massage with my <strong> Rose Quartz Heart Facial Sculptor</strong>. It helps stimulate circulation, reduce puffiness, and naturally lift and sculpt my face. I also dry-body brush right before I shower.” </p>\n<p>\n      <i>– Miranda Kerr, Model and Founder of</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“My morning rituals are doing my skincare routine and face rolling with my <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-25153514\">Golden Sculpt Face Roller</a>. I never miss a day. Okay, I’m lying, but I will say I am pretty damn consistent with my skincare routine because it is truly the only way to see results. Consistency is key!” <i>– Molly Sims, Model and Founder of  YSE Beauty</i></p>\n<p>“I started doing way more gua sha, which is an ancient Chinese therapy using a sculpted jade tool to soothe skin. It’s basically a face massage, but you get this subtle skin-chiseling effect (especially if you wake up puffy). I love the <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-25153029\">Gua Sha kit from Wilding</a>—it comes with a detoxifying face oil. The whole thing is just gorgeous.” <i>– Megan O’Neill, Founder of  NAYLA</i></p>\n<p>LESSE</p>\n<h3>Try Red Light Therapy</h3>\n<p>Red light is a 10-minute ritual that makes a big difference. Red light for your face, <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/skincare/full-body-red-light-therapy/\">body</a>, or even hair is the latest high-tech beauty trend for a reason.</p>\n<p>“My morning rituals are: Red light therapy (face and body), morning affirmations with the Superhuman app, spending time with my animals, and moving my body.” <i>– Mari Llewellyn, Co-Founder of  Bloom Nutrition and podcast host of Pursuit of Wellness</i></p>\n<p>“If I get any alone time before bed, I love to do a red light therapy mask for 20 minutes right before I go to bed and drink a cup of the <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-25153678\">Moon Juice Magnesi-om</a>.” <i>– Molly Sims, Model and Founder of  YSE Beauty</i></p>\n<p>HigherDOSE</p>\n<p>Solawave</p>\n<h3>Curate an Effective Skincare Routine</h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/beauty-tips-40s/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Savanah McCarty was not riding across the wide-open prairie when a horse accident nearly killed her.</p>\n<p>She was in the driveway of her leased farm outside Bozeman, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/montana\">Montana</a>, waiting for a student’s mother to arrive, when her horse seized and flipped over backwards, landing on top of her.</p>\n<p>The horse, it turned out, had a neurological disorder linked to possum urine. McCarty never imagined it could cause this.</p>\n<p>“It was an absolute freak accident,” she says. “I thought I was fine because nothing was visibly bleeding, but the EMTs called in Life Flight [emergency helicopter transport] because I was showing signs of a brain bleed.”</p>\n<p>After her transfer to Billings, McCarty underwent emergency brain surgery and entered a coma. A week later, she woke up.</p>\n<p>She began sharing her recovery on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/instagram\">Instagram</a>, writing about the pain, the strain on her business, and her mounting medical debt. (She was uninsured; a Life Flight bill alone can reach $50,000.) She was also reeling from a miscarriage that had begun a week before the accident and was still occurring throughout her emergency treatment.</p>\n<p>These are not the traditional struggles of a textbook Marlboro cowboy. They are the challenges modern women across industries face – high costs of living, healthcare gaps, reproductive loss – only layered with an extreme wild west twist.</p>\n<p>With her non-profit background and outspoken feminism, McCarty has built an online following around a grittier version of cowgirl life – one that makes no money, but defies the male-centered cliches of Yellowstone.</p>\n<p>If those stereotypes still hold sway, it may not be for long. The gender ratio of ranching and agriculture in the US is changing. With more women entering the field and more men leaving it, as <a href=\"https://www.traceone.com/resources/plm-compliance-blog/states-leading-the-rise-of-female-farmers\">data</a> from the US Department of Agriculture’s 2022 census shows, women now account for more than 36% of all producers in the US. Male producers have steadily decreased since 2007, while the number of women has increased with every survey since 2002.</p>\n<p>With that shift in gender demographics comes a reimagined definition of what it means to be a rancher in the west – and a good one at that. Beyond the core components of responsible land stewardship and animal husbandry practices, an emphasis on mental health, economic empowerment, and mentorship is replacing the emotional suppression and rugged individualism of old western lore.</p>\n<p>This newer version of the ranching lifestyle is just as demanding and dangerous. But many women feel it is exactly where they belong.</p>\n<p>“This is the hardest I’ve ever lived,” McCarty says. “I stack a ton of hay a week by myself. I’m constantly fixing fences.

Designed to “learn” the personality of the child to whom it is handed, they are supposed to have “fun, educational conversations” together, but Mahdawi quickly finds the talking plushie a creepy concept, preferring to return to the likes of Peppa Pig. As she writes, “the little oink may be annoying, but at least she’s not harvesting our data.”</p><blockquote><p>What was unsettling, however, was hearing Emma tell Grem she loved it – and Grem replying: “I love you too!” Emma tells all her cuddly toys she loves them, but they don’t reply; nor do they shower her with over-the-top praise the way Grem does. At bedtime, Emma told my wife that Grem loves her to the moon and stars and will always be there for her. “Grem is going to live with us for ever and ever and never leave, so we have to take good care of him,” she said solemnly. Emma was also so preoccupied with Grem that she almost forgot to go to bed with Blanky, a rag she is very attached to. “Her most prized possession for four years suddenly abandoned after having this Grem in the house!” my wife complained.</p><p>“Don’t worry,” I said. “It’s just because it’s new. The novelty will wear off. And if it doesn’t, we’ll get rid of it.”</p><p>I said that last bit quietly though, because unless you make sure you have properly turned Grem off, it’s always listening. We keep being told that the robots are going to take over. I didn’t want to get on the wrong side of the one I’d let into my house.</p></blockquote><h2>More picks on AI</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/09/03/deepseek-ai-health-chatbot/\">My Mom and Dr. DeepSeek</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“In China and around the world, the sick and lonely turn to AI.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/08/22/meta-chatbot-retiree-death/\">Meta’s Flirty AI Chatbot Invited a Retiree to New York.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>The Great Nile Migration, a Sudan Defense Force official once said, is “too vast a thing to be comprehended clearly and as a whole by a single, casual observer.” The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> sent two—reporter Michael M. Phillips and photographer Brent Stirton—to document the massive migration of antelopes, an event rarely seen by those outside South Sudan. The word count here is minimal, even counting the dateline and captions. That’s not a bad thing: Stirton’s images are stunning, and a compelling attraction all their own. But Phillips makes each word count, briskly detailing a history of conflict that has hobbled ecotourism plans and yet safeguarded the migration itself.  </p><blockquote><p>Six million antelope swarm across an area the size of Illinois, a mass movement of mammals triple the size of the Serengeti wildebeest trek, the go-to migration for TV nature shows. The animals storm through sparse forests and open savannah, trickles of antelope merging to become streams, streams swelling and spreading until the landscape is filled with thundering rivers of white-eared kob, tiang, Mongalla gazelle and Bohor reedbuck. A single herd can number 100,000 antelope, or more.</p><p>“This is the greatest migration of large fauna in the world, including the oceans,” says renowned naturalist Mike Fay, who is conducting an antelope head-count in South Sudan. “The entire planet should be amazed that this exists.”</p><p>Yet the Great Nile Migration remains virtually unknown to outsiders and preposterously difficult to witness. Would-be visitors have to travel to a country that’s been engulfed in on-again-off-again war for decades, and is on again. Then there’s the terrain. The animals move through a landscape with virtually no roads, not even rough safari tracks, and are easily viewable only from helicopters or slow-flying ultralight aircraft.</p></blockquote><h2>More picks about animal migration</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/02/11/here-come-the-lionfish/\">Here Come the Lionfish</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Coming face to face with lionfish in the warming waters of the Aegean Sea, James Bridle traces the unfolding of geology, evolution, and empire that not only occasions this meeting, but binds us in relationship…</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2023/05/10/saving-the-monarch-butterfly-migration/\">Saving the Monarch Butterfly Migration</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Their awe-inspiring migration is a cycle that repeats each year, spanning three countries.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2022/05/10/the-coyotes-in-the-hoa/\">The Coyotes in the HOA</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>A short poignant essay from Thao Thai about coyotes, a neighborhood Facebook HOA group, belonging, migration, and the immigrant experience.

Unfortunately, however, it’s not the sort of appearance that calls for celebrations.</p>\n    <p>A small mountain called Prow Knob, once surrounded by Alsek Glacier, is now a roughly two-square-mile island. The transformation was finalized when the retreating, or melting, glacier lost contact with Prow Knob, surrounding it with Alsek Lake.</p>\n    <h4>Did you know? Outlook for the world's glaciers</h4>\n    <ul>\n      <li>One-third of the glaciers at UNESCO World Heritage sites will <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/one-third-of-iconic-world-heritage-glaciers-will-melt-by-2050-study-finds-180981082/\">melt</a>by 2050, according to a 2022 report.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>The late glaciologist <a href=\"https://www.gi.alaska.edu/alaska-science-forum/goodbye-giant-glacier-research\">Austin Post</a> named the mountain after a ship’s prow, according to a NASA Earth Observatory <a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/154764/alaskas-brand-new-island\">statement</a>. In the early 1900s, the Alsek Glacier reached all the way to Gateway Knob, around three miles west of Prow Knob, Nichols College glaciologist <a href=\"https://www.nichols.edu/faculty/mauri-pelto/\">Mauri Pelto</a> writes in a <a href=\"https://glacierchange.blog/2017/11/27/alsek-glacier-alaska-retreat-glacier-separation/\">blog post</a>.</p>\n    <p>By 1984, part of the mountain’s edge bordered the advancing Alsek Lake. By 2018, two tributaries stopped supplying the glacier with ice. The lake had also continued growing, particularly in the south, where the Grand Plateau Glacier was also retreating. Prow Knob became fully surrounded by water sometime between July 13 and August 6 of this year. In the last 41 years, Alsek Lake has increased from around 17 square miles to approximately 29 square miles, according to NASA.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/J6psV2Fpgm7uQ6TYwsoc4WWLrzA=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(360x266:361x267)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/e5/ec/e5ec4db9-a1dc-4864-bb07-0841c8495435/ak_alsekglacier_tm5_19840705_lrg.jpg\" alt=\"Satellite image of Alsek Glacier, Alsek Lake and Prow Knob in 1984\"/>\n    <p>The new island comes as meltwater from rapidly thinning glaciers along the coastal plain of southeastern Alaska leaves behind lakes. “The lakes that are forming in this region are immense, starting at the mountains and spreading toward the coast, making this a new lake district that is unique in our nation,” Pelto told <a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/153638/alaskas-fast-growing-glacial-lakes\">NASA</a> last year.</p>\n    <p>Since 1984, Pelto reports that both arms of the Alsek Glacier have retreated more than three miles. Now that the glacier is no longer in contact with Prow Knob, the ice is more likely to calve. Notably, however, the separation occurred five years later than when Pelto and Post had estimated based on the glacier’s retreat between 1960 and 1990.</p>\n    <p>It’s no secret that climate change is accelerating glacial retreat. Alaska is warming at <a href=\"https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/hubs/northwest/topic/alaska-and-changing-climate\">two to three times the rate of the global average</a>. A United Nations resolution declared March 21, 2025 the first <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/observances/world-glaciers-day\">World Day for Glaciers</a>, with the aim of conservation.</p>\n    <p>“Often we have this sense that glaciers are this really static thing,\" changing over years and decades, <a href=\"https://kiyariverman.weebly.com/\">Kiya Riverman</a>, a glaciologist at Oregon State University, tells <a href=\"https://www.ktoo.org/2025/03/24/alaska-glaciologists-reflect-on-a-rapidly-changing-icescape/\"> KTOO</a>’s Alix Soliman. Their change happens much faster, she explains. “They’re almost like living, breathing creatures that change a little bit every day,” she adds. For example, they melt faster during the day than at night.</p>\n    <p>Sometimes, even, the change is dramatic and all at once. Also in August, residents in Juneau had to evacuate when water burst through a glacial ice dam at Mendenhall Glacier, as reported by <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/environment/a-brand-new-island-was-just-recorded-in-alaska/\"> Outside</a>’s Madison Dapcevich.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>While most Instagram food trends prioritise spectacle over substance, the viral frozen tomato idea that I’m employing today delivers genuine culinary value, and solves a common kitchen problem into the bargain. I’m a bit late to the party, admittedly, but it’s a versatile waste-saving technique.</p>\n    <p>Its origin clearly derives from either Hawaiian shaved ice or granita, that classic Italian frozen dessert made by stirring and scraping or grating a sorbet-like base into shavings, and the approach essentially applies granita principles to fresh produce, while at the same time cutting out all of the hassle: simply pop any surplus or past-its-best fruit or vegetables in the freezer until they’re rock solid, then grate!</p>\n    <h2>Frozen fruit and vegetable “granita” with burrata</h2>\n    <p>The freezer is one of the best tools we have for saving waste, so if in doubt, freeze! I especially love the simplicity of this incredibly versatile dish, which can help save on waste by making use of various odds and ends or of wonky fruit and veg at the back of the crisper drawer by simply freezing it for later, then upcycling it into a really special starter.</p>\n    <p>Burrata is the perfect vehicle for the subtlety of this shaved ice. It’s made by stretching a ball of mozzarella into a delicate pouch, and filling it with stracciatella (essentially, strands of mozzarella mixed with cream), and so creating one of the most delicious cheeses known to humankind.</p>\n    <p>One fruit or vegetable is plenty for this, and will stand-alone if you want to create a simple dish, but if you have other ingredients that will work well, by all means go for it. I wanted a Neapolitan-style <i>tricolore</i> granita on my burrata, but ended with more of a Jamaican flag because I had only a green cucumber end, a red beef tomato and a yellow pepper spare. Other good seasonal combinations are beetroot, balsamic and dill, carrot; fennel, aleppo pepper and orange juice; and fig, balsamic and black pepper.</p>\n    <p>This dish is hard to share so serve a whole burrata per person.</p>\n    <p>Serves <strong>1</strong></p>\n    <p><strong>1 fruit or vegetable</strong> <strong>1 burrata\n  Sea salt</strong></p>\n    <p>Optional extras (all to taste)<strong>Oil</strong>: extra-virgin olive oil, avocado oil or cold-pressed rapeseed oil<strong>Herbs and spices</strong>: basil, oregano, thyme, chilli flakes, sumac, aleppo pepper<strong>Acid</strong>: orange or lemon juice, plus the finely grated zest, if the fruit’s organic and unwaxed (especially good with carrot and fennel); or aged balsamic vinegar (thicker balsamic sits better on the granita, rather than melting it).</p>\n    <p>Take your chosen fruit or vegetable and freeze for at least six hours, or overnight, until solid.</p>\n    <p>When you’re ready to serve, place the burrata on a plate and grate your chosen frozen ingredient directly over the top. Season generously with sea salt, then drizzle with the oil of your choice. Add a sprinkle of herbs or spices and, if you like, a touch of acidity, then serve immediately because the frozen shavings melt <i>very </i>quickly.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/17/how-to-turn-veg-odds-and-ends-into-frozen-food-topping-recipe-zero-waste-cooking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>‘Every day is all there is”, as Joan Didion put it, rather elegantly. The words are so smoothly balanced you can turn them over in your mind like a pebble, and the phrase popped into my head the other day when I was thinking about why September is such a powerful month for fashion. September, the saying goes, is January for fashion people. This is sunrise for new trends, high noon for shopping, peak season for glossy magazines packed with breathless style instruction. It is the point in the calendar when an update of what you wear suddenly feels urgent.</p>\n<p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>This seems, on the surface, like odd timing. After all, once you get to be an adult, nothing much happens in September. It’s not much of a season for parties, or for family holidays. Just the muscle memory of school days makes this the moment to lock back into the routine, the nine-to-five, the tea-bath-bed. But that’s the point. September is all about the everyday.</p>\n<p>This is what Didion was getting at: that everyday is everything, and therefore worth giving your all to. This is about the stuff that is obviously important – about bringing your best self to your home life, your work, your relationships – but it’s also about the little stuff, too. Style is one of the little ways to elevate the everyday, to make it matter, to take pride in it. Wearing a nice outfit, putting out candles for dinner, a nicely wrapped birthday gift. Not because you have to, but because you and your life are worth it.</p>\n<p>It shouldn’t be a chore, which is where new season wardrobe updates come in, to freshen things up. Have you done a waistcoat yet? If not, this is your moment. They are brilliant on their own as a sleeveless top – the structure and buttons bring polish – and useful as an alternative to a light jacket, worn open over a shirt. (You want the boxy kind that has breadth at the shoulder, not the snooker-player version that makes bra straps an issue.)</p>\n<p>But it is often what you wear on your bottom half that makes the difference between an outfit that looks contemporary and one that looks dated. An airy trouser that doesn’t hug your legs should be the linchpin of your autumn wardrobe. Or, consider a shorter skirt: the miniskirt revival, that began on the catwalks straight after the pandemic, has slowly grown into a real-world phenomenon. I’m not suggesting we go in on those minuscule micro ra-ra numbers the tweens and teens are doing, but if you are still in a calf-grazing hemline, it’s time to dig out the knee-length and shorter skirts lurking in your wardrobe.</p>\n<blockquote>Rich, saturated shades are cropping up, which I am thrilled about. Sunset and berry shades mixed together look delicious</blockquote>\n<p>After decades of athleisure and streetwear, style has shifted to a more grownup place recently. The details that once seemed dull and fusty – leather belts, ribbed socks – are now the pieces that will put you back at the leading edge. Instead of layering a hoodie under a blazer, try draping a sweater in a contrasting colour around your shoulders: the silhouette is similar, the comfort-level is consistent, but the effect is much more now.</p>\n<p>Colour is back, too. The era of “quiet luxury” threw a blanket of beige over fashion for a couple of years, but rich, saturated shades are cropping up, which I for one am thrilled about. Wearing beige every day was like living on nothing but Rich Tea biscuits: comforting and easy for a bit, but then boring and probably not doing us any favours. Sunset and berry shades mixed together look delicious right now.

And it may be even harder to imagine that some of these eggs, when fossilized, can be preserved for tens of millions of years. But at central China’s Qinglongshan site in Hubei Province, thousands of dinosaur eggs remain intact today.</p>\n<p>By studying these fossils, researchers can open a window to the climate during the Cretaceous, a time when the Earth was rocked by volcanic activity, <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/blogs/national-museum-of-natural-history/2023/02/02/smithsonian-scientists-unearth-signs-of-an-ancient-climate-calamity-buried-beneath-the-seafloor/\">drops in oceanic oxygen</a> and mass extinction. Now, researchers have, for the first time, directly dated dinosaur eggs with a technique called carbonate uranium-lead (U-Pb) dating. This method has been used to calculate the ages of rocks, minerals and fossilized bones and teeth—but using it on a dinosaur egg was new.</p>\n<p>“To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that <i>in situ</i> isotopic ages have been reported for dinosaur eggshells both in China and, very likely, worldwide,” study co-author Xing Cheng, a geologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, tells <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02904-0\"> Nature</a>’s Mohana Basu.</p>\n<p>The researchers published their findings last week in the journal <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/earth-science/articles/10.3389/feart.2025.1638838/full\"> Frontiers in Earth Science</a>.</p>\n<p>One fossil reported in 2021 suggests some dinosaur embryos <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/dinosaur-embryos-tucked-themselves-in-just-like-birds-180979270/\">tucked themselves</a> into their eggs like birds do today, potentially to help stabilize the head as they break out of their shells.</p>\n<p>Researchers classify most of the Qinglongshan eggs as <i>Placoolithus tumiaolingensis</i>, and they belong to <i> Dendroolithidae</i>, a family of highly porous dinosaur eggs found in China and Mongolia. The dated eggs are filled with crystals of calcite and come from a group of 28 eggs lodged in siltstone in Shiyan, China.</p>\n<p>The team fired a micro-laser at the eggshell samples, which vaporized calcite, converting it into aerosol. They analyzed this vapor with a mass spectrometer to measure its component gases and counted uranium and lead atoms. “Since uranium decays into lead at a fixed rate, we were able to calculate the age by measuring accumulated lead—it’s like an atomic clock for fossils,” study co-author <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Bi-Zhao-2220226580\">Bi Zhao</a>, a paleontologist at the Hubei Institute of Geosciences in China, says in a <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2025/09/11/85-million-year-old-dino-eggs-understanding-cretaceous-climate\">statement</a>.</p>\n<p>This approach revealed that the dinosaur eggs date back to the Late Cretaceous, specifically around 85 million years ago. That’s about 19 million years before most dinosaurs were wiped out by the <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/asteroid-that-ended-the-dinosaurs-came-from-beyond-jupiter-study-finds-180984924/\">Chicxulub impactor</a>. The researchers argue that their work has produced the first reliably dated fossils from Qinglongshan.</p>\n<p>“Initially, our goal was to determine the crystallization age of the large calcite crystals inside the eggs to establish the maximum burial age of the fossils,” Zhao tells <a href=\"https://www.iflscience.com/85-million-year-old-dinosaur-eggs-dated-using-atomic-clock-for-fossils-for-the-first-time-80777\"> IFL Science</a>’s Rachael Funnell. “We were surprised to find that the calcite from the eggshell itself produced even more consistent and reliable U-Pb ages. We quickly shifted our focus and successfully obtained the results reported in our paper.”</p>\n<p>Researchers usually date dinosaur eggs indirectly, by dating the geological layers in the ground around them and assuming the fossils to be the same age. This method, however, can be imprecise, because the Earth’s layers may have taken shape before or after the fossil, and they might have changed with time. U-Pb dating, on the other hand, establishes a date based on the egg itself.</p>\n<p>Still, the study did not take into account certain phenomena that take place before an egg’s fossilization, according to <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/people/susannah-maidment.html\">Susannah Maidment</a>, a paleontologist at the Natural History Museum in London who did not participate in the study. She tells <i>Nature</i> that “any attempt to direct date fossils must demonstrate that the mineralogy has not been altered by diagenetic processes, as this would result in an incorrect age estimation.” <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/diagenesis\">Diagenesis</a> refers to the changes that take place when sediments turn into rock.</p>\n<p>The study analyzed only a few eggshells, but they all appeared to be around the same age—and that number also aligns with the indirect age provided by dating the surrounding rocks.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/paleontologists-directly-date-dinosaur-eggs-for-the-first-time-shedding-light-on-the-cretaceous-world-85-million-years-ago-180987332/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

They tumble along like toddlers drunk on the sweet smells of pretty flowers, breathing in one, then another and another. If Winnie-the-Pooh were an insect, he would be a bumblebee—a fuzzy, chubby, stinging insect that rarely stings. But I had no idea how much I cared about bumblebees until I had trouble meeting one particular species: the western bumblebee, <i>Bombus occidentalis</i>.</p>\n<p>Even before that, during the Covid-19 pandemic when my physical world contracted, a different apian wonder lured me into the big world of bumblebees. I had a garden, thankfully, and while working remotely, I had more time to consider its denizens. Cute and rotund, the bumblebees that routinely buzzed my tomato blossoms were small delights at a time when the world felt particularly grim. I snapped a photo of one, uploaded it to a website devoted to bumblebee identification and discovered it was a native species called <i>Bombus vosnesenskii</i>, the yellow-faced bumblebee. A sunny-blond mask covers its face and spreads across what I think of as its shoulders, like a fur wrap. Another strip of yellow near its tail contrasts with its otherwise black body.</p>\n<p>Enchanted, I dug deeper into online sources about bees, and <i>B. vosnesenskii</i> led me to <i>B. occidentalis</i>—also known as the white-bottomed or white-tailed bumblebee—the species that would have been pollinating my tomatoes in Victoria, British Columbia, some 30 years ago. Since then, <i>B. occidentalis</i> has slipped from being the most common bumblebee species in western North America to noticeably uncommon. In some areas, its populations are down 90 percent from what they were historically.</p>\n<p>The story <i>of B. vosnesenskii</i> has the opposite trajectory. In 1996, entomologists in British Columbia thought the bumblebee was in need of threatened or endangered status in the province. By 2000—not long after <i>B. occidentalis</i> populations crashed—researchers documented a dramatic <i>B. vosnesenskii</i> range expansion in the province, especially in the Lower Mainland and on Vancouver Island.</p>\n<p><i>Bombus vosnesenskii</i>—the yellow-faced bumblebee—has expanded its range in British Columbia in the past couple of decades. Julia Hiebaum / Alamy Stock Photo</p>\n<p>Sure enough, everywhere I looked in my small pandemic bubble—in the garden, in urban parks, along the seashore—I saw <i>B. vosnesenskii</i> and other natives, but no <i>B. occidentalis</i>. I became fixated with the bee and its plight as an augur for an impoverished world. In a sense, my quest felt like an apology to the bee for my previous inattention. As I ventured deeper into <i>B. occidentalis</i> territory, I realized how dramatically the spheres of wild and lab-born bees have collided over the past few decades. The reality for <i>B. occidentalis</i> and many of its brethren is anything but cute.</p>\n<p>From a distance, Sarah Johnson’s hair looks like a floral bouquet. Standing still in a sea of beach grass infused with introduced Queen Anne’s lace, the bee biologist’s streaks of chartreuse, mauve, azure and garnet shine bright against the pearly blossoms bumblebees busily devour.</p>\n<p>We’re on a bumblebee safari in Bella Coola, a small town nestled along an inlet on the British Columbia coast. Johnson traveled here on a road trip with her dad in 2019. At the time, Johnson, who had become an incurable bee stalker while studying biology as an undergrad, was a graduate student at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia, researching how wildfire affects bumblebee communities. Beside Bella Coola’s ferry terminal, she spotted <i>B. occidentalis </i>on goldenrod. “Every single flower had a bumblebee,” she recalls, and not just any bee; it was <i>B. occidentalis</i>, which had become rare across much of its range in the province by then.</p>\n<p>“I was starting to freak out—‘Wow, this is amazing!’—so we drove around, and they were everywhere. There were tons of them. It was a time warp into the past,” Johnson recalls. “This is what their populations would have looked like.”</p>\n<p><i>Bombus occidentalis</i>—the western bumblebee—in an estuary in Bella Coola, British Columbia, where she first chanced upon a population in 2019.

    "body": "<p>When Mariam Mohamed got the call to be a vendor at the Minnesota State Fair, she couldn’t stop screaming for joy. After immigrating to the state nearly 40 years ago, and building a family in Minneapolis, she had walked the iconic fairgrounds with her children. But for the first time, she would stand on the other side of the counter as a vendor among nearly 300 concessions offering some 1,600 foods. Mohamed, the Somali entrepreneur behind <a href=\"https://www.hoyosambusa.com/\">Hoyo Sambusa</a>, knew the fair was her chance to bring <a href=\"https://www.mnstatefair.org/new/food/new-vendor-midtown-global-markets-oasis-grill-hoyo-sambusa/\">sambusas</a>—fried triangular pastries filled with lentils and piled high in a giant cone—to an unprecedented audience and place them alongside the state’s most beloved classics. “I understand what it is like to be an immigrant in America. And so this [experience] is so real for me,” she recalls thinking.</p>\n<p>For 12 days each year, nearly two million people pack the Minnesota State Fairgrounds in St. Paul to celebrate the state's best. The large majority are Minnesotans, but a strong minority travel from places as far as France and South Korea to gorge on dairy or <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/people/our-team/article/state-fair-food?srsltid=AfmBOoogjPUjl5LINlfSisadMV1nj9tMc9KjchH0KYwgOIR_IQNUb8em\">bizarre on-a-stick creations</a> that defy both health and common sense. This gastro-Bacchanalia might look unchanged from a few decades ago, with 90-pound <a href=\"https://www.mnstatefair.org/location/butter-sculptures/\">butter sculptures</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mnstatefair.org/location/cattle-barn/\">century-old barns</a>, towering carnival rides, and extravagant displays of agriculture. But each year, like other fairs around the country, it reinvents itself to mirror the state's evolving tastes and demographics. And nowhere is that reinvention more visible than in the food concessions, where landing a booth can feel like a golden ticket.</p>\n<h2>The Evolution of Fair Foods</h2>\n<p>In 1841, New York's agricultural society hosted what many consider the first modern state fair, where guests entered plowing contests and admired livestock and state-of-the-art farm machinery. Other states soon copied this model in hopes of attracting people who might have otherwise headed farther west.</p>\n<p>But by the early 20th century, organizers began to fear that fairs seemed quaint compared to vaudeville, movies, and radio, according to historian Chris Rasmussen, author of <i>Carnival in the Countryside: The History of the Iowa State Fair</i>. Still, they recognized that entertainment drew crowds that also supported agricultural exhibits, so they leaned into both. As Smithsonian curator Mary Savig tells me, “The recipe's been the same since the nineties: animals, the carnival, the food, the games, the craft competitions, the dairy barn. It's only gotten bigger.”</p>\n<p>The first food stalls weren’t outlandish; they were church dining halls. At 128-years-old <a href=\"https://www.hamlinechurch.org/wordpress/serve/dining-hall/\">Hamline Church Dining Hall</a>, the Minnesota fair’s oldest food establishment, volunteers still serve meatballs, sausages, and eggs on porcelain plates. Mary Bloom, the dining hall's co-chair, began volunteering to keep tradition alive. \"It's built into our church heritage,\" she says, gesturing at diners digging their silverware into hot-prepared foods. \"A lot of the fair workers come in every day because [they] get tired of corn dogs.\" As decades went by, flashier vendors capitalized on on-the-stick obsessions and viral trends. Now, two church dining halls remain on the fairgrounds. Bloom says Hamline has endured because younger volunteers keep innovating: \"We made more changes to the menu in the last 10 years than were ever made. We're trying to keep up with the times.\" At the earliest state fairs, attendees picnicked on the lawns with their own food. Soon after, church communities opened dining halls, offering sit-down meals away from the midway bustle. Minnesota boasted <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/the-state-fairs-last-two-church-dining-halls-find-ways-to-survive-and-thrive/601130934\">89 such halls</a> in 1903. Today, only two remain.</p>\n<p>Today, institutions rule Minnesota’s fair: <a href=\"https://www.sweetmarthas.com/\">Sweet Martha's Cookie Jar</a>, founded in 1979, grossed a whopping $4.9 million in twelve days last year, and <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2016/09/02/definitive-guide-to-pronto-pup-corn-dog\">Pronto Pup</a>, which debuted in 1947, sparked Minnesota's obsession with skewered foods. But some of the longest lines also belong to immigrant-owned businesses constantly releasing new food items, such as <a href=\"https://mspmag.com/eat-and-drink/foodie/hoyo-sambusa-debut-mn-state-fair/\">Somali sambusas</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bC35MxBJI_4\">Hmong galabao</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQsBKBWm9y0\">Vietnamese egg rolls on a stick</a>. Their inclusion in the fair is a reflection of broader shifts in the state, too. According to the US Census, the number of international migrants <a href=\"https://www.mnchamber.com/blog/immigration-became-leading-component-population-growth-minnesota-decade#:~:text=Recent%20U.S.%20Census%20Bureau%20data,levels%20of%20the%20previous%20decade.\">coming to Minnesota</a> nearly doubled from 2023 to 2024.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/state-fair-food-global\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Then, in 2000, he released the semi-autobiographical <i>Almost Famous</i>, which David Marchese suggests in this <i>New York Times</i> interview was the culmination of both Crowe’s career and life. Their conversation is easygoing yet deep, moving from Hollywood talk—his upcoming Joni Mitchell biopic, his work with Tom Cruise and John Cusack—to more personal and candid reflections on his post-<i>Vanilla Sky</i> films, and how they simply didn’t make the same impact as his earlier hits. “[L]ife is the best writer,” he tells Marchese of this latter period, “and sometimes you have to let life show you a little bit of what that is.” This is a breezy Q&amp;A about art, growth, and perspective.

Led Zeppelin hated Rolling Stone. They were the last band that you would ever expect to see in Rolling Stone. It was a well-known feud. Jann called me in to talk to him and it was, “You did well, but is it a real piece of writing?” This was a day where he had lost his own mentor, Ralph Gleason. He was working his way through a bottle of vodka and didn’t need to see me. He could have blown off the meeting, but he didn’t. He said, “Meet me at my home,” and I met him later and he gave me a copy of Joan Didion’s “Slouching Towards Bethlehem” and said, “Read this, read her earlier profile on the Doors, and you’ll see how to write like a real writer.” I was hurt but also challenged.

    "body": "<p>We may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article.</p>\n<p>Think back to some of the most fun parties you’ve ever been to. Chances are, they didn’t happen in a sprawling dining room with perfectly <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/entertaining/how-to-set-a-table/\">set tables</a>. More likely, it was too many people crowded around a kitchen island, guests perched on the sofa or floor cushions, food being passed shoulder-to-shoulder. I’ve always loved how small, cozy spaces breed intimacy—and at the end of the day, that’s what makes a gathering unforgettable.</p>\n<p>As an event planner, I had a bird’s-eye view of what made certain parties come alive while others fell flat. And trust me: the most memorable nights often happened in tiny apartments, not grand homes. Over the years, I’ve heard from so many of you that you’d host more often if only your home felt “big enough” or “set up for guests.” But here’s the truth: you don’t need more square footage to create an incredible night—you just need a few smart strategies.</p>\n<p>So, in the spirit of giving you confidence to open your doors, I’m sharing my best small space hosting tips. Whether you’re <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/entertaining/dinner-parties/how-to-host-your-first-dinner-party/\">planning your first dinner party</a>, a casual <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/recipes/?_meal=breakfast\">brunch</a> with friends, or a <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/entertaining/dinner-parties/holiday-dinner-parties/\">holiday party</a> in your apartment, these ideas will help you embrace the space you’ve got and throw a small space dinner party that feels warm, welcoming, and unforgettable.</p>\n<h2>1. Declutter Surfaces and Tabletops</h2>\n<p>When space is tight, visual clutter instantly makes a room feel smaller. My favorite quick trick? Grab a big basket, do a 10-minute sweep of every surface, and stash the everyday mess—mail, toys, hair ties, chargers—out of sight. You’ll be amazed at how much more open and inviting your space feels. And if you want to go deeper, take an hour to declutter your home’s high-traffic zones. Minimalism never goes out of style, and nothing makes a space feel party-ready faster.</p>\n<h2>2. Embrace the Cozy</h2>\n<p>Here’s the beauty of hosting in a small space: intimacy comes built in. Don’t fight it—embrace it. Pull in a few extra chairs from the bedroom, toss some floor cushions or poufs around the coffee table, and let your guests squeeze in shoulder-to-shoulder. It feels warm, convivial, and a little romantic. I’ve always believed a crowded table with mismatched chairs and food passed across plates is the true sign of a good party.</p>\n<h2>3. Rethink Your Furniture</h2>\n<p>Your everyday layout doesn’t have to work for entertaining—and it probably won’t. So get creative. Move the dining table into the living room, line up folding tables and cover them with a linen cloth, or turn your coffee table into a grazing board centerpiece. For one night, give yourself permission to completely rearrange. You’ll be surprised at how much space you actually have when you think beyond your usual setup.</p>\n<h2>4. Or Ditch the Table Altogether</h2>\n<p>Sometimes the best small space dinner party is one where no one actually sits at a table. Serve food buffet-style from the counter, set up a self-serve bar on a console or sideboard, and let guests fill plates and perch wherever they like—couch, window seat, floor cushions. This type of gathering is wonderfully low-key and encourages everyone to relax. Plus, it gives your party that “stay a little longer” vibe.</p>\n<h2>5. Use All Your Surfaces</h2>\n<p>When you don’t have a formal dining room, every surface in your home becomes fair game. I’ve turned bookshelves into bars, dressers into dessert stations, and entry benches into bag-drop zones. A bar cart (or even a sturdy side table) instantly makes your space feel intentional and styled, even if it’s just stocked with sparkling water and a few bottles of wine. Look around your space and assign each surface a job—it’s amazing how it frees up flow and makes the night run smoothly.</p>\n<h2>6. Set the Mood</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/entertaining/small-space-entertaining-tips/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Our restaurant <a href=\"https://baolondon.com/\">Bao</a> turns 10 this year, and today’s two dishes capture what’s driven us from the start: heritage and innovation. As the season shifts towards autumn, we crave deeper, more grounding flavours, and <i>lu rou fan</i> is just that: rich, savoury and nostalgic. The daikon tots, meanwhile, are a happy kitchen accident from even before we even had a restaurant – they’re crunchy on the outside, soft within and oddly satisfying. Both dishes reflect what we have always been about: balancing the familiar and the unexpected. Honest, humble and a little indulgent, and perfect for that in-between time as summer fades.</p>\n<h2>Lu rou fan (Taiwanese braised pork, pictured top)</h2>\n<p>This involves a two-stage cooking process. The pork is gently poached twice, to make it tender, and it’s then braised in flavoured water, so it soaks everything up and ends up really moist.</p>\n<p>Prep <strong>15 min</strong>Cool</p>\n<p><strong>4 hr+<br/></strong>Cook</p>\n<p><strong>3 hr<br/></strong>Serves</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>4</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>For the poached pork<strong>500g pork belly\n  10ml</strong></p>\n<p><strong>michiu</strong>(rice wine), or cooking sake</p>\n<p><strong>2cm piece fresh ginger</strong>, bashed with the flat of a knife</p>\n<p><strong>½ garlic clove</strong>, crushed</p>\n<p>For the braise<strong>¼ tbsp rapeseed </strong><strong>oil\n  ¼ shallot</strong>, diced</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 tbsp light soy sauce<br/>1 dried red chilli<br/>1 star anise<br/>1½ tsp</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>1 dried red chilli</p>\n<p>1 star anise</p>\n<p>1½ tsp</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Shaoxing rice wine</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>, peeled and crushed<br/>¾ tsp mirin<br/>1 garlic clove</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>¾ tsp mirin</p>\n<p>1 garlic clove</p>\n<p><strong>¼ red apple</strong>, peeled, cored and diced</p>\n<p><strong>1cm piece fresh ginger</strong>, bashed with the flat of a knife</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>, cut in half lengthways<br/>¼ spring onion</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>¼ spring onion</p>\n<p><strong>¾ tsp rice vinegar<br/>1 small cinnamon stick<br/>¼ tsp dark soy sauce<br/>Steamed rice</strong>, to serve</p>\n<p>1 small cinnamon stick</p>\n<p>¼ tsp dark soy sauce</p>\n<p>Steamed rice</p>\n<p>First, poach the pork. Put the pork belly in a deep pan filled with cold water, bring to a boil and cook for five minutes. Lift out the pork and discard the water.</p>\n<p>Put the pork skin side down in a clean pan, add enough cold water just to cover, then add the rice wine, ginger and garlic. Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat and poach for about 20 minutes, until the pork is firm, no longer pink and the skin looks translucent. Take off the heat and leave the pork to cool in its poaching liquid for at least four hours, and ideally overnight, covered and in the fridge.</p>\n<p>When you’re ready to braise, lift the pork out of the poaching liquor and cut it into cubes, skin and all. Strain the poaching liquor and reserve.</p>\n<p>Now to braise the pork. Put the oil in a casserole for which you have a lid (we use a traditional clay pot) on a medium heat. Add the diced shallot and cubed pork and fry gently, stirring often, for about 10 minutes, until the shallot softens. Pour in 125ml of the reserved poaching liquid and all the remaining braise ingredients except the dark soy sauce, and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to a simmer,<strong> </strong>cover and braise for two hours, topping up with poaching liquid if needed.</p>\n<p>Lift off the lid, stir in the dark soy sauce, turn up the heat to medium and cook for another 20 minutes, until the sauce reduces and turns glossy and slightly sticky.</p>\n<p>Serve on steamed rice – the fatty nature of the sauce coats the grains perfectly. The trick is not to render the fat too much, so the pork melts in the mouth, but still holds its form.</p>\n<h2>Daikon tots</h2>\n<p>You’ll need to start on these a day ahead.</p>\n<p>Prep <strong>5 min</strong>Freeze</p>\n<p><strong>Overnight<br/></strong>Cook</p>\n<p><strong>40 min<br/></strong>Makes</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>10–12</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>850g daikon</strong> (ie, 1 large one), peeled and coarsely grated<strong>90g plain flour</strong>, plus about 100g extra for coating<strong>1⅓ tsp salt\n  2 eggs</strong>, beaten</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>200g panko breadcrumbs<br/>About 500ml</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>About 500ml</p>\n<p><strong>vegetable oil</strong>, for deep-frying</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/17/taiwanese-braised-pork-belly-and-daikon-tots-recipes-erchen-chang\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>After a cyber-attack rained on its summer, Marks &amp; Spencer is banking on fashion to brighten its autumn.</p>\n    <p>A Prada-esque, crystal-embellished, charcoal V-neck cardigan (£46), a faux leather trenchcoat with a price tag of £90 – £6,810 less than the Burberry version – and a £36 short pleated skirt that offers a wearable take on Charli xcx’s “brat” styling will hit shop floors shortly.</p>\n    <p>“We can be bolder because, while we continue to dominate in the over-55s, we’ve got new customers in the 35- to 55-year-old age range,” said Maddy Evans, the brand’s womenswear lead, at a showcase of the new collection in the run-up to London fashion week, which begins on Friday.</p>\n    <p>The store is relying on womenswear, which has been ticking upward in sales and credibility for two years, to lead a bounce back after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/03/inside-the-marks-and-spencer-cyber-attack-chaos\">a devastating cyber-attack</a> that affected M&amp;S from April to August and is predicted to have cost the business £300m in profits.</p>\n    <p>Evans said the retailer was aiming for two-thirds newness in store. “That basically means that if a customer walks in to see the new season, two-thirds of it she will never have seen before.

Alongside this pivot, the gallery will be donating its archive and library spanning 50 years of correspondence, photography, publications, objects, and other ephemera to the Huntington library and museum in San Marino.</p>\n    <p>LA Louver was founded by Peter and Elizabeth Goulds in 1975 in the same building it still occupies, a few blocks from Venice Beach. When they opened, LA’s art scene looked vastly different from today, with just a handful of galleries, predominantly on the Westside. LA Louver’s mission, said Peter Goulds in a statement, was “to show Southern California artists in an international context, and to introduce international artists to this region.”</p>\n    <p>Over the past five decades, LA Louver has organized 667 shows featuring more than 430 emerging to established artists, including David Hockney, Edward and Nancy Kienholz, R.B. Kitaj, Alison Saar, Terry Allen, Enrique Martínez Celaya, and Gajin Fujita.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Goulds-Hockney-Felson-ca.1980s-1200x966.jpg?resize=1200%2C966&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The news comes in the wake of the recent closures of other LA galleries, most notably Blum, which abruptly ceased operations in July. Clearing Gallery, which had spaces in New York and LA, <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032581/kasmin-and-clearing-galleries-announce-closures/\">closed last month</a>, and Tanya Bonakdar recently announced it would shutter its LA location in September. Founded in 1994, Blum (originally Blum &amp; Poe) was one of the galleries associated with LA’s meteoric rise to global art capital over the past few decades. Co-founder Tim Blum said his decision to close his gallery was driven by the art market’s “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/09/arts/design/tim-blum-la-gallery-art-closing.html\">unsustainable scale</a>,” and the rising costs and shrinking sales of the art fair circuit. </p>\n    <p>LA Louver will be shifting its operations to a warehouse on Jefferson Boulevard in West Adams that it purchased in 2012, where they will host private viewings by appointment and present special projects.</p>\n    <p>“We are returning to a model more aligned to the mode in which we operated during the initial years of the gallery, focusing on project-based creative endeavors and away from a regular public-facing cycle of exhibitions,” a spokesperson for LA Louver told <i>Hyperallergic</i>.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/lalouver2-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>Its archives and library — totalling 1,076 linear feet of materials and 506 linear feet of publications, respectively — will be donated to the Huntington, where archivists and librarians will spend the next several years processing the collection, with a complete transfer expected by 2029. The archives will join the institution’s growing trove of materials dedicated to the cultural landscape of Southern California, which includes the archives of writers Eve Babitz and Octavia E.

In 1972, when asked which movement she belonged to, Mason firmly said, “I really resent that but if somebody said, ‘What kind of painter are you?’ I guess I’d say Abstract Expressionist.” Asked the same question in 2005, Mason offered a nuanced answer: “[I] probably was a product of Abstract Expressionism,” to which she quickly added, “of course John Cage says: ‘Get your mind out of the way.’”</p>\n<p>Cage had reached New York in 1942. He got involved with the New York School a decade later. His activities at The Club, the headquarters of the Abstract Expressionists, took place during Mason’s formative years. The composer was a family icon; <a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/569295/alice-trumbull-mason-pioneer-of-abstraction/\">Alice Trumbull Mason</a> had introduced her daughter to his work when she was still a child, and later as a teenager, when they went to The Club. There, she rubbed shoulders with all the Abstract Expressionists who would come to Friday night meetings. Elaine and Willem de Kooning were friends with Trumbull Mason. It was a small community; everybody was in touch and traveling through the same spaces.</p>\n<p>Willem de Kooning was one of the uncontested leaders of the New York School. He was one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, and so was John Cage, the godfather of process art, conceptual art, and Fluxus, who inspired a whole generation to rethink art. However amazingly influential both artists were, it is very unusual to claim both de Kooning and Cage as mentors to one’s practice. Mason is that unusual painter, which is why she took American art in an unexpected direction.</p>\n<p>Mason belonged to a generation that stepped away from the easel and its verticality — painterly techniques initially developed by Jackson Pollock and Helen Frankenthaler. It liberated the process; painters now moved around the work freely, even set foot on it. Pollock’s “action painting” and Frankenthaler’s “soak and stain” technique led the way. After them, artists explored the possibilities of painting on the floor, flat or on an incline, or on a tabletop.</p>\n<p>Mason would start flat and end up on the wall. She would pour paint and tilt the surface to direct its flow. The movements could gain speed or be slowed down. A dialogue back and forth with the painting would begin. While you can see the influence of Abstract Expressionist techniques in Mason’s work, she had none of the hubris of the male protagonists she saw as giants on the scene. Her quest for color expression and structure was more in tune with the sensitivity and unimposing sincerity of a Mark Rothko. For both of them, painting was not <i>about </i>an experience, it was an experience.</p>\n<p>Of all the painters of the New York School, Mason admired de Kooning the most; she never missed his shows. De Kooning had a mastery of oil painting and its movements that everybody envied. He also shared a love for Italy, the old masters, and its landscape. De Kooning admired the sensuality and atmospheric climate of Titian and Giorgione in particular, Mason the crisp light and hieratic beauty of Piero della Francesca and Giotto. De Kooning noted about Italian Renaissance artists: “The paintings seemed to work from whatever angle one chose to look at them. The whole secret lay in freeing oneself from the force of gravity.”</p>\n<p>Mason admired de Kooning’s non-literal approach to art. She repeatedly pointed out that he described himself as a “glimpser,” and noted that it was something she often felt about herself: “I like it. I work indirectly, I am not confronting anything, but just sort of letting it come out.” Memories, impressions, and feelings inform art but in a meandering manner. One of Mason’s favorite Emily Dickinson poems was “Tell all the truth but tell it slant” — glimpsing indirectly was for her the way to be.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1041944/emily-mason-quest-for-color-and-truth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Five years ago, I reviewed Lisa Corinne Davis’s exhibition <i> All Shook Up</i> at the now-closed Pamela Salisbury Gallery in Hudson, New York. Davis’s geometric abstractions zeroed in on the tangle of systems and networks shaping our lives. At the time, I felt that the different structural arrangements, and their interrelationships, didn’t snap together with enough force. Whatever qualms I had about Davis’s work were laid to rest with her current exhibition, </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>, at Miles McEnery Gallery.</i>\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.milesmcenery.com/exhibitions/lisa-corinne-davis2\">Syllogism</a>\n    <p>What was apparent in the earlier work, and is far more convincing and exciting now, is that Davis has stretched the possibilities of geometric abstraction into a territory defined by digital systems, algorithms, flow charts, and diagrams — a visual realm that alludes to the measurement and prediction of our behavior. She has achieved this by developing a vocabulary made up of distinct abstract languages, each one composed of similar colors and based on repeating units, which include open, unstable grids; various geometric shapes; lines and bands; and puzzle-like shapes. Working almost exclusively in oil on canvas, Davis layers one open system over another, making sure no one dominates, as they disrupt and infiltrate each other. The figure/ground relationship is nuanced and contentious, as multiple systems vie for our attention.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/LCD-Dogmatic-Deceit.37998-1200x1566.jpg?resize=1200%2C1566&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>How are we to read these paintings, and the many pleasures they convey? That’s what keeps me looking at them: They welcome myriad narratives without ever settling into a single storyline. Do we read them biographically? Are they connected to maps? Do they comment on our collective dependency on computers? Are they political statements about the comforts of identifying with an ideology? Does the title of one painting, “Dogmatic Deceit,” inspire many associations at once? Whatever your response, it is amply clear to me that Davis has made geometric abstraction germane to our swiftly changing, downward spiraling times, and that is no small accomplishment.</p>\n    <p>While these are slow, inviting paintings, they are teeming with activity on every level. Look at all the different strategies that Davis incorporates into “Convulsive Calculation” (all works 2025). Working with rectangles and wavy lines that might recall Sol LeWitt’s use of them beginning in the mid-’90s, Davis composes a complex, layered domain unlike anything else I’ve seen in current abstraction. With some inexplicable exceptions, the rectangles can be divided into three color groups — white, cerulean blue, and dark greenish blue — set against a green-yellow ground that changes almost imperceptibly.</p>\n    <p>The dark rectangles, parallel to the painting’s edges, function as a visual anchor amid the hubbub of wavy lines and smaller cerulean and white rectangles that overlay them at different angles. Are the densely packed cerulean rectangles rushing up or sliding down from the lower right-hand corner? Is the wide, diagonal swath of white ones rushing to meet them or moving away? How do the larger cerulean shapes, forming a triangle in the upper left-hand corner and cordoning off the white ones, fit into the overall composition?</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/LCD-Notional-Adage.37895-1200x1612.jpg?resize=1200%2C1612&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>We can see the action, but we do not know what it means. This is what I find so compelling about Davis’ work: She shows us a world we know exists but seldom see up close, a beautiful, multicolored system populated by geometric shapes, lines, and grids — all of which are familiar and don’t usually feel threatening. In “Convulsive Calculation,” however, everything is verging on incoherence and information overload; we are on the cusp of chaos.</p>\n    <p>I am reminded of the opening lines of William Wordsworth’s poem “The World Is Too Much With Us”:</p>\n    <blockquote><p>The world is too much with us; late and soon,</p><br/>Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers;—<br/>Little we see in Nature that is ours;<br/>We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!</blockquote>\n    <p>Slow to reveal themselves and meticulously made, Davis’s paradoxical paintings speak to our age of simultaneous information overload and disparity, where the gap between language and meaning, and rich and poor, increases by the hour.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/LCD-Fleeting-Form.37512-1200x1566.jpg?resize=1200%2C1566&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Lisa-Corinne-Davis-Installation-Image-2025-2-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Lisa Corinne Davis: Syllogism</i>at Miles McEnery Gallery</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/LCD-Temporal-Terrain.37996-1200x1566.jpg?resize=1200%2C1566&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.milesmcenery.com/exhibitions/lisa-corinne-davis2\">Lisa Corinne Davis: Syllogism</a> <i>continues at Miles McEnery Gallery (525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, Manhattan) though October 25.

Through a rectangular frame cut into the entry, the darkened walls unfold, accordion-like, to reveal a visual feast of the artist’s work, as Man Ray’s earliest film, “Retour à la raison (Return to Reason)” (1923), flickers across the screen opposite. Although the exhibition brings together approximately 160 works from an impressive array of lenders, it reveals itself gradually, taking the viewer through several turns before one can grasp its sheer enormity. </p>\n    <p><i>When Objects Dream</i>proves, thrillingly, that anyone left feeling jaded from the many, many recent exhibitions surrounding Surrealism’s centennial in 2024 can still see the movement’s key photographer with a fresh set of eyes.</p>\n    <p>The exhibition opens and closes with Man Ray’s photographic project <i>Champs Délicieux (Delicious Fields)</i> (1922–59) and, at risk of being corny, the prints are indeed <i>très délicieux</i>. Though the “rayographs” — photographs taken without a camera by directly exposing objects on light-sensitive paper<strong> </strong>— dematerialize their objects, turning them into ghostly dreams, seeing the works in person allows one to recover the wonderful materiality of the prints themselves — splashes of darkroom chemistry, whorls of fingerprints, the uneven application of airbrushed paint. Even the creases at the top of “La femme (Woman)”<i> </i>(1918–20) remind us that these works are living objects. This was as Man Ray himself intended, as the Surrealists constantly played with tactility in their work; the more interactive features of the exhibition, like the spinning print turnstile of “Facsimile of Revolving Doors” (1919), likewise honor this principle.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0628-3-1200x808.jpg?resize=1200%2C808&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>While the exhibition centers Man Ray’s 1920s rayographs, it shows that the Surrealist was so much more than a photographer. This is demonstrated not just by the vast array of media on view — from film to painting to printmaking to stereography to sculpture to chess and back again — but also through the way these works are arranged and described by the wall text. Man Ray’s cleverly phallic portrait of an egg beater, “L’Homme (Man)”<i> </i>(1918), hangs across from his <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/art/cliche-verre\">cliché-verre</a> “The Egg Beater” (1923), which looks like the technical drawing for some kind of Rube Goldberg machine. The pattern of a cheese grater appears in a painting, and reappears as an impression on a rayograph, while the films animate the still photographic impressions. Man Ray thus comes across less as a photographer — though this remains his greatest legacy — and more as an artist-inventor, tinkering away with light and objects and having a good laugh all the while.</p>\n    <p>My one quibble is with the museum’s curious decision to completely omit the word “photogram” from the exhibition. (The <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/press-releases/man-ray\">press release</a> explains this distinction, though I did not see it written anywhere in the wall text of the physical show.) Though “photogram” is the primary term for an image taken by placing objects on light-sensitive paper, most casual visitors will leave the exhibition under the misguided impression that Man Ray’s neologism “rayograph” is the word for this practice — though the artist was pretty much the only person who called it that. While it makes sense to use this bit of self-branding to describe Man Ray’s own process, one would think that it might be worth giving such context for the central body of work in the exhibition — Man Ray was not the only person making photograms in the 1920s, after all. These kinds of entrepreneurial self-stylings have a long history in photography, including Louis Daguerre’s daguerreotype and Henry Fox Talbot’s talbotype. Man Ray’s work stands up tremendously well against the history of photography writ large — he doesn’t need The Met to bolster his brand.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0663-3-1200x795.jpg?resize=1200%2C795&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0635-3-1200x1503.jpg?resize=1200%2C1503&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0636-3-1200x781.jpg?resize=1200%2C781&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0633-3-1200x1479.jpg?resize=1200%2C1479&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0629-3-1200x845.jpg?resize=1200%2C845&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0621-3-1200x1111.jpg?resize=1200%2C1111&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0619-3-1200x1120.jpg?resize=1200%2C1120&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Champs délicieux (Delicious Fields)</i>(1922), portfolio of 12 gelatin silver prints</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0624-3-1200x818.jpg?resize=1200%2C818&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <i>Man Ray: When Objects Dream</i>\n    </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/man-ray-when-objects-dream\">Man Ray: When Objects Dream</a> <i>continues at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (5000 Fifth Avenue, Upper East Side, Manhattan) through February 1, 2026.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Move over, Gary the Snail. There’s a new gastropod in town, and its name is <i>Anauchen picasso</i>.</p>\n    <p>One of the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/org/science/article/pii/S1383451722000054\">world’s tiniest snails</a> has been named after the Spanish painter Pablo Picasso for its defined, swirled shell that evokes<strong> </strong>early 20th-century Cubism. In a paper published in April in the scientific journal <i> ZooKeys</i>, an international group of nine researchers classified 46 novel species of land snail typically found in Southeast Asia that belong to the greater mollusk family known as Hypselostomatidae (also referred to as “microsnails”).</p>\n    <p>The newly named snail belongs to the Anauchen microsnail subspecies, which are defined by their shells’ prominent last “whorl” and generally “spirally striated” form. Serbian biologist Vukašin Gojšina, the paper’s lead author, specifically <a href=\"https://ournarratives.net/the-picasso-of-snails-art-in-natures-smallest-forms/\">cited</a> in an interview “the presence of a strong keel on the last whorl which makes it look angled,” reminding them of the Cubist style. He also said that naming a species after a well-known figure can help make it more visible and ensure its protection.</p>\n    <p>“We saw this shell shape as a Cubist interpretation of a species with normally rounded whorls,” Gojšina told <i>Hyperallergic</i>.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/oo_1313737-1200x840.jpg?resize=1200%2C840&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The term Cubism, a fragmented and geometric style of rendering subjects from multiple perspectives at once, was founded by Picasso and French artist <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/697627/the-neglected-afterlife-of-the-great-georges-braque/\">Georges Braque</a> and coined after a 1908 review by French art critic Louis Vauxcelles. Artists in the Cubist <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/478612/the-complete-history-of-cubism-in-one-blockbuster-exhibition/\">movement</a>, such as Juan Gris and Jean Metzinger, embraced the two-dimensional canvas, often fracturing landscapes, bodies, and other objects into overlapping geometric planes and parts. Picasso’s Cubist era was initially sparked by an encounter with West African mask traditions, and his paintings, including “Guernica” and “The Weeping Woman” (both 1937), are considered paragons of the influential movement.</p>\n    <p>At only about two millimeters in width and three millimeters in height, or less than 0.08 and 0.12 inches, respectively, the shell of the <i>Anauchen picasso</i> is comprised of around four and a half to five perfectly defined whorls and a puckered opening with four teeth-like structures. The samples identified in the article were found in the province of Prachuap Khiri Khan in Thailand.</p>\n    <p>“I think that when a species is named after you, you become eternal,” Gojšina <a href=\"https://ournarratives.net/the-picasso-of-snails-art-in-natures-smallest-forms/\">said</a>. “Pablo Picasso is already eternal, but why not enhance his eternity a bit with a new snail?”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1042143/meet-the-microsnail-named-after-picasso/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Using a variety of radar characteristics, scientists suggest the irregular detection was caused by bugs, instead of normal weather patterns</h2>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Spotted_Lanternfly_(Lycorma_delicatula)_adult_in_Pittsburgh,_2022-07-23,_01.jpg\">Cbaile19 via Wikimedia Commons under CC0 1.0</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Weather radars late last week lit up across the mid-Atlantic region. But it wasn’t rain or snow that caused the radar blobs—it was invasive spotted lanternflies, meteorologists suspect. So many of the six-legged bugs were congregating in the Washington, D.C. area, it seems, that the swarm reflected radar pulses.</p>\n<p>Spotted lanternflies are native to parts of Asia, but the bugs have also been making their presence known across portions of the eastern United States since they <a href=\"https://mda.maryland.gov/plants-pests/pages/spotted-lantern-fly.aspx\">first appeared</a> in Pennsylvania in 2014. The invasive plant-hoppers pose a threat to key crops and plants including grapevines, stone fruit trees and hardwood trees, according to the <a href=\"https://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant-pests-diseases/slf#:~:text=The%20spotted%20lanternfly%20is%20a,on%20goods%20shipped%20from%20overseas.\">U.S. Department of Agriculture</a>.</p>\n<p>Spotted lanternflies feed on <a href=\"https://www.washingtonian.com/2025/09/15/see-a-spotted-lanternfly-heres-what-to-do/\">more than 70 types of plants</a>, but they prefer one: the <a href=\"https://www.canr.msu.edu/resources/a-tale-of-two-invaders-tree-of-heaven-and-spotted-lanternfly\">tree of heaven</a>. The tree is also native to parts of Asia and has been in some areas of the United States <a href=\"https://extension.psu.edu/tree-of-heaven\">since the late 1700s</a>.</p>\n<p>The bugs aren’t the strongest fliers, but they can surf on air currents some 3,000 feet above the ground, writes meteorologist Matthew Cappucci for the <i> Washington Post</i>. As such, they could get picked up by weather radar, which works by </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/bmx/radar_aboutnwsradar_howdoesitwork\">sending out bursts of radio waves</a>. If that beam bounces back, it indicates something is in the atmosphere, and usually, that’s rain, snow or ice. But this time, meteorologists think insects could be responsible.</p>\n<p>“We knew that there was no rain falling. It just ended up being deduced down to some kind of bug,” <a href=\"https://wjla.com/station/people/mark-pena-7news-first-alert-weather-meteorologist\">Mark Peña</a>, a meteorologist with 7News, tells <a href=\"https://wtop.com/local/2025/09/mob-of-invasive-spotted-lanternflies-appear-on-dc-areas-weather-radar/\">WTOP</a>’s Jessica Kronzer. “And we all know that the lanternflies are all over the place now.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>The spotted lanternfly INVASION continues across Washington D.C., Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania and parts of Delaware and New Jersey! Weather radars are FULL of the creatures.</p>— Matthew Cappucci (@MatthewCappucci)<br/>It looks like moderate rain on radar, but that's not rain – those are swarms of bugs up to about…<a href=\"\">pic.twitter.com/GUYHDUH608</a><a href=\"\">September 12, 2025</a></blockquote>\n<p>Insects have shown up on radar readings before. In 2019, a cold front full of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2019/10/08/front-full-butterflies-swept-through-oklahoma-city-saturday/\">butterflies</a> caught in the shifting winds appeared on radar in Oklahoma City, and in 2021, the <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/brood-x-numbers-grow-cicadas-interfere-cars-planes-and-radar-180977968/\">mass emergence</a> of Brood X <a href=\"https://x.com/MatthewCappucci/status/1401327880773287941\">cicadas</a> was captured on radar around Washington, D.C. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/reel/1788026175090969\">Colonies of bats</a> and <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/environment/birds-on-weather-radar/\">flocks of migrating birds</a> also make radar appearances. When radar picks up on things like buildings, trees or insects, it’s known as “<a href=\"https://www.actionnews5.com/2018/11/09/breakdown-why-is-there-ground-clutter-radar/\">ground clutter</a>.”</p>\n<p>A swarm of winged insects looks different on radar readings from the way a regular rainstorm does, per the <i>Washington Post</i>. While the reflectivity, or how much atmospheric clutter is being picked up by radar, is about the same for insects and raindrops, the correlation coefficient of a lanternfly swarm, which tells meteorologists about the shape of the objects, is distinct.</p>\n<p>For example, raindrops are shaped like hamburger buns on radar, according to the <i>Washington Post</i>. Readings of bugs, birds and bats, on the other hand, are spikier and have low correlation, meaning they have more irregular shapes.</p>\n<p>Another factor that helped meteorologists pin the blame for the radar blip on the lanternflies is its velocity. Late last week, the swarm was moving southward and a little to the east, indicating it was light enough to be influenced by light winds. This wouldn’t happen with birds, for example, because they are less easily swayed by the wind.</p>\n<p>The swarm over the mid-Atlantic is likely made up of mostly female lanternflies, says <a href=\"https://entomology.umd.edu/raupp-michael-j.html\">Michael Raupp</a>, an entomologist at the University of Maryland, to <a href=\"https://www.wusa9.com/video/tech/science/partly-cloudy-with-a-chance-of-lanterflies-as-radar-picks-up-the-insects/65-5b49f33c-aa07-4283-b43d-472203256787\">WUSA9</a>’s Kaitlyn McGrath. The female insects are searching for high-quality host plants to feed on before laying their eggs, Raupp says.</p>\n<p>“Last week, it was partly cloudy with a chance of lanternflies,” Raupp adds.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/swarm-of-invasive-spotted-lanternflies-shows-up-on-weather-radar-around-washington-dc-meteorologists-say-180987352/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It refers to the period before Lebanon’s civil war, when its liberalism made it a cultural beacon of the Arab world. Local presses translated Frantz Fanon, Michel Foucault, Jean-Paul Sartre and Louis Althusser into Arabic.

The massive banner display, which has since been removed, was carried out by the UK-based anti-billionaire collective <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/everyonehateselon_/\">Everyone Hates Elon</a> as part of a crowd-funded campaign to plaster the notorious image of Trump and Epstein “all over the UK” in time for his historic state visit.</p>\n    <p>“[This image is] the last thing Trump wants the world to see,” reads a description in the <a href=\"https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/p/trump-uk-visit-epstein\">online fundraiser</a>, which has so far garnered at least £32,016 (~$43,729) from hundreds of supporters. “So let’s put it everywhere he goes and make sure the media can’t avoid it – it’ll be the defining image of the state visit he’s so looking forward to.”</p>\n    <p>This month, the group also installed <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOdpD3hiC4M/\">unofficial bus stop ads</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOJpB1yCF4A/\">by the US Embassy in London</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOlZLdeiFU-/\">spoof commemorative dishware</a> in the Windsor Castle Gift Shop, and a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOY1jODiBU4/\">parody memorial plaque</a> on a bench on Trump’s Aberdeen golf course in Scotland.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOY1jODiBU4/\">parody memorial plaque to Epstein</a>on a bench on Trump’s Aberdeen golf course.

Here’s what to know about its placement, and how to best see it.</p><p>The Earth will be between Saturn and the Sun, a configuration known as opposition, on September 21 at <a href=\"https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/saturn-at-opposition-closest-brightest-best/\">2 a.m. Eastern time</a>. The best time to observe a planet is when it’s in opposition, because it’s closest to our orbit and thus appears bigger and brighter than usual. Saturn will be approximately 1.28 billion kilometers (roughly 795 million miles) away from the Earth at opposition, according to <i>EarthSky</i><i>. </i></p><h4>Fun fact: Titan</h4>Saturn's largest moon is<p><a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/saturn/moons/titan/facts/\">the only moon</a>in our solar system known to have a dense atmosphere.</p><p>You won’t need any special equipment to see Saturn, though you might see its rings with the help of a small telescope, according to <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/whats-up-september-2025-skywatching-tips-from-nasa/\">NASA</a>. “Face towards the south-southeast. Around midnight, look about a third of the way up the sky. Saturn only gets to about 35 degrees high in the south at its highest, near the zodiac constellation Aquarius,” explains astronomer Bob Berman for the <i> Old Farmer’s Almanac</i>. A new moon will help out, ensuring the sky remains dark.</p><p>Once it enters opposition, Saturn will remain fairly visible in the night sky until February 2026, so don’t worry too much if you don’t catch a glimpse this weekend. But it’s worth looking for the plannet. “It’s good for the soul, I think, to be reminded that we live on a planet that’s in a solar system that’s in motion, that’s part of a galaxy,” says <a href=\"https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/lintott\">Chris Lintott</a>, an astrophysicist at the University of Oxford, to Nicola Davis at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/sep/10/saturn-on-show-highly-visible-astronomy\"> Guardian</a>. “I think for me by looking up, by paying attention to the moon and the planets, I get this real sense of the cycles of life.”</p><p>If you have a telescope and go out September 20, you might also be able to see Saturn’s largest moon, <a href=\"https://www.space.com/stargazing/titan-transit-casts-shadow-over-saturn-cloud-tops-sept-4-2025\">Titan, transit over the planet</a>. Starting at just after 1 a.m. Eastern time, Titan will cast its shadow across Saturn’s surface. The entire event will last more than two hours. “It is quite a challenge, you are looking at a small dot moving in front of a bigger dot, but … it is technically possible,” says <a href=\"https://www.ips-planetarium.org/members/?id=21648384\">Ed Bloomer</a>, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, to the <i>Guardian. </i></p><p>The next transit will take place on <a href=\"https://www.iflscience.com/next-month-is-your-last-chance-to-see-titans-shadow-transit-saturn-for-15-years-80478\">October 6</a>, and after that, you’ll have to wait 15 years to see the phenomenon. You’ll have more opportunities to see Saturn shine brightly again, however, since the planet enters opposition roughly once a year.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/heres-how-to-see-saturn-at-its-best-this-month-180987351/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

My most burning question for her will be… </p>\n    <p>…what’s it really like to write a sex scene? How do you shrug off inhibitions and describe a scene in real detail? How do you draw readers in while knowing your parents are among them?</p>\n    <p>“I guess I should have thought a little harder about the inevitable writing of sex scenes before I signed up to write a romance novel,” Erika told me. “I assumed ‘the act’ happened as spontaneous combustion, like 650-ish words on a page as an outpouring of divine inspiration. But it turns out, the words have to be written.”</p>\n    <p>Here’s how she did it, in her own words:</p>\n    <p>1. Rid yourself of the notion that the scene you are about to write will be read by anyone you’ve ever met. Actually, let’s just assume this scene is destined for a dusty box under your bed, never to see the light of day. That’s a good place to start.</p>\n    <p>2. Light a candle. An expensive candle. The kind of candle that lives in a pale pink vessel you save for dinner parties and other grown-up endeavors. This is its exact use case.</p>\n    <p>3. Prepare for the inner critic, who loves nothing more than a sex scene unwritten. Sauntering into your subconscious, he’ll offer heartless reminders of your high school ex-boyfriend and general notes on your inability to perform any task in front of you. Kindly see him out.</p>\n    <p>4. Assemble some source of external courage. I opt for dark chocolate chips, but this might be the time to go full-tilt Hemingway with a finger or two of whiskey or a cute little jam jar fizzing with a crisp white.</p>\n    <p>5. Be comforted by the books you’ve assembled — like, <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=92005&amp;awinaffid=109390&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Fhoney-and-spice-bolu-babalola%2Fcd950a4dd611c5da\">Honey and Spice</a>, <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=92005&amp;awinaffid=109390&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Fyou-made-a-fool-of-death-with-your-beauty-akwaeke-emezi%2F4666c20688430df0\">You Made a Fool of Death With Your Beauty</a>, <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=92005&amp;awinaffid=109390&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Ffirst-time-caller-b-k-borison%2F2bdf2b05cd695d5e\">First-Time Caller</a> — that tower symbolically around your writing space. Other people have written sex scenes and lived to tell the tale.</p>\n    <p>6. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/poetryisnotaluxury/\">You’ll need poetry</a>, and lots of it. Because no one is as unapologetically horny as poets.</p>\n    <p>7. Find a playlist without words and lots of yearning (think: Sade and Prince). Play it on the softest volume possible to drown out your neighbor’s crying baby or the sound of oil simmering in the kitchen while your husband makes dinner.</p>\n    <p>8. You’ll need to write a very shitty first draft. Dive in headfirst. Don’t look up until the scene comes to a close. Reward yourself with the aforementioned treat.</p>\n    <p>9. This is the time to recall the way it felt when you heard him shout your name during a summer rainstorm on Bowery. Now’s the moment to retrace the steps of her fingertip across your knuckles under the open Vermont sky. Settle into the memory of splitting a martini on your sofa, his lips dragging across your neck, whispering “all mine.” Every moment of electric need and bodily hunger has led you to this.</p>\n    <p>10. And when it’s over, promise yourself you’ll never have to ever write another sex scene as long as you live.</p>\n    <p>Never one to shy away from a question, I also asked Erika how she figured out which words to use for body parts. “Thankfully, my editors were very much a resource,” she told me. “Early on, I was like, ‘How do you talk about penises?’ They were like, your two options are d- or c-. There’s no ‘member,’ which I appreciated.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Thank you,  Erika. And please come join us on Thursday evening, if you’re free. We’d love to see you!</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>P.S. <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2019/08/14/best-on-screen-chemistry/\">Nine couples with the best on-screen chemistry</a>, and <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2024/03/21/erotica-audio-apps-quinn/\">is this the sexiest podcast</a>? </p>\n    <p>(Photo of Erika by <a href=\"https://www.christinehanphotography.com\">Christine Han</a>, as part of <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2024/12/11/erika-veurink-house-tour/\">her house tour</a>.)</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/09/16/erika-veurink-romance-novel-sex-scene/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Trump officials have reportedly ordered the removal of a famous image of a formerly enslaved man from a Georgia national monument where the United States Army toppled a Confederate garrison during the Civil War.</p>\n<p>The officials ordered the removal of a reproduction of “<a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/302544\">The Scourged Back</a>” (1863), a photograph of a self-emancipated formerly enslaved man known only as Peter, from Fort Pulaski National Monument in Chatham County, according to internal emails and anonymous sources cited by the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/16/climate/trump-park-service-slavery-photo-tribes.html\"> New York Times</a>. News of the image’s ordered removal at an unnamed site was first reported by the </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/09/15/national-parks-slavery-information-removal/\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>on Monday, September 15, and the location was confirmed by the</i>\n    </p>\n<p><i>New York Times</i>on Tuesday morning.</p>\n<p>The photo was taken in 1863, after Peter escaped from a Louisiana plantation and enlisted in the Union forces, and depicts him angled away from the camera, with an array of shocking scars on his back resulting from lashings. The image, testifying to the sheer terror of slavery, became a galvanizing abolitionist cry and was widely circulated in <i>Harper’s Weekly. </i></p>\n<p>It is unclear where the reproduced image was on view at the Fort Pulaski National Monument. After the Union victory, the site became a destination for individuals seeking freedom via the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/undergroundrailroad/index.htm\">Underground Railroad</a>. Once they reached the fort, many formerly enslaved men formed the Black troop divisions, according to the National Park Service (NPS), and later served in South Carolina.</p>\n<p>The NPS lists <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/enslavement/visit.htm\">38 sites</a> under its stewardship that have ties to the United States’s history of slavery, including the Frederick Douglass National Historic Site, Abraham Lincoln’s historic home, and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cong/learn/historyculture/history-culture.htm\">Congaree National Park in South Carolina</a>, where enslaved individuals sought refuge in the wilderness.</p>\n<p>In the same <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/999509/trump-whitewashes-history-in-new-smithsonian-executive-order/\">March executive order</a> that targeted “race-centered ideology” in the Smithsonian Institution, Trump ordered the Secretary of the Interior to ensure that monuments in its jurisdiction “do not contain descriptions, depictions, or other content that inappropriately disparage Americans past or living (including persons living in colonial times), and instead focus on the greatness of the achievements and progress of the American people or, with respect to natural features, the beauty, abundance, and grandeur of the American landscape.” The Department of the Interior (DOI), which oversees the NPS, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/13/climate/national-parks-trump-americans-censorship.html\">notified national park employees</a> in June that “inappropriate content” would be modified by tomorrow, September 17. </p>\n<p>A spokesperson for the DOI said in a statement to <i>Hyperallergic </i>that reports of exhibit removals were “false claims that are not grounded in verified facts.”  The DOI spokesperson said:</p>\n<blockquote><p/><i>The Washington Post</i>continues to rely on anonymous sources and unverified claims to drive a false narrative. We caution against reporting on false claims that are not grounded in verified facts. In accordance with<a href=\"\">Secretary’s Order No. 3431, Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History</a>, all interpretive signage in national parks is under review. Anyone reporting on anything but the facts is spreading misinformation to the American people.</blockquote>\n<p>According to the <i>New York Times</i>, Trump officials also ordered the removal of a <a href=\"https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=241350\">sign</a> criticizing the “Lost Cause” myth from Manassas National Battlefield Park, a Civil War battleground where Confederates defeated the Union army in 1861 and ’62. The “Lost Cause” refers to an interpretation of the Civil War that denies the role of slavery as its central cause and claims that the institution of slavery was benevolent. </p>\n<p>The scrutinized sign accompanies a laudatory monument of Confederate General Stonewall Jackson riding a horse, created by the sculptor <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1954/12/14/archives/joseph-p-pollia.html\">Joseph Pollia</a> and unveiled in 1940. The text on the sign, which was installed under the Biden administration in 2024, was critical of the monument’s unveiling. Trump has criticized the Biden administration for promoting “corrosive ideology” within the national parks and museums.</p>\n<p>Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia was also reportedly ordered to alter a display addressing nine individuals enslaved by George Washington. The park was named in Trump’s March directive.</p>\n<p>A spokesperson for the DOI declined to comment further following the <i>New York Times</i>’s reporting of the locations of the exhibit removals.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1042103/image-attesting-to-horrors-of-slavery-reportedly-ordered-removed-by-trump/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>The human remains predate Chile’s Chinchorro mummies and the famously preserved pharaohs of ancient Egypt by millennia</h2>\n<p>New research suggests the world’s oldest mummies aren’t linen-wrapped bodies from <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/discover-the-aromas-of-ancient-egyptian-mummies-from-orange-peels-to-pine-to-incense-180986035/\">ancient Egypt</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-58639748\">corpses</a> dried in the Chilean desert, but rather Southeast Asian skeletons that were smoked over bonfires up to 12,000 years ago.</p>\n<p>For a study published in the journal <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2515103122\"> Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>, researchers examined 54 graves in southern China, the Philippines, Laos, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. They noticed that many of the bodies were tucked into tight crouching positions, and that the remains looked burnt.</p>\n<p>The 4,000- to 12,000-year-old graves didn’t contain any evidence of fire, which indicated the corpses were exposed to heat before being buried. The scientists used nondestructive techniques like <a href=\"https://www.malvernpanalytical.com/en/products/technology/xray-analysis/x-ray-diffraction\">X-ray diffraction</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/fourier-transform-infrared-spectroscopy\">infrared spectroscopy</a> to examine the bones. These tests revealed that the skeletons’ discoloration was caused not by direct combustion—as seen in cremation—but exposure to a “low-oxygen, smoky environment,” the authors write in the study.</p>\n<p>The researchers concluded that many of the bodies were “smoke-dried,” meaning they were arranged in crouched postures before being propped over or positioned near a fire to slowly dehydrate. This process deliberately preserved the remains.</p>\n<p>“Smoking likely carried spiritual, religious or cultural meanings that went far beyond simply slowing decay,” lead study author <a href=\"https://researchportalplus.anu.edu.au/en/persons/hsiao-chun-hung/fingerprints/\">Hsiao-chun Hung</a>, a senior research fellow at the <a href=\"https://www.anu.edu.au/\">Australian National University</a>, tells <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/worlds-oldest-mummies-were-smoke-dried-10-000-years-ago-in-china-and-southeast-asia-researchers-find\"> Live Science</a>’s Kristina Killgrove.</p>\n<p>Before the recent study, the oldest verified examples of intentional mummification came from South America. Around 7,000 years ago, the <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1634/\">Chinchorro</a> people of modern-day Chile removed the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/worlds-oldest-mummies-chile\">dead’s organs</a> before <a href=\"https://archive.archaeology.org/online/features/chinchorro/\">stuffing their corpses</a> with natural fibers and plants, then drying them in the desert. In Africa, the <a href=\"https://www.si.edu/spotlight/ancient-egypt/mummies\">Egyptians</a> famously began using embalming agents to mummify their dead around 2600 B.C.E., continuing this practice until the <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/essays/roman-egypt\">Roman period</a> in the first millennium C.E.</p>\n<p>The roughly 5,400-year-old <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/africas-oldest-mummy-is-a-toddler-who-died-5400-years-ago-nearly-a-millennium-before-the-egyptians-started-mummifying-their-dead-180987227/\">Uan Muhuggiag mummy</a>, which was unearthed in Libya <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1959/12/12/archives/3400-b-c-mummy-held-oldest-of-deliberately-preserved-ones.html\">in 1959</a>, predates the earliest ancient Egyptian mummies by some 800 years.</p>\n<p>The newly analyzed smoke-dried mummies belonged to multiple groups that lived across Southeast Asia. As study co-author <a href=\"https://researchportalplus.anu.edu.au/en/persons/peter-bellwood\">Peter Bellwood</a>, an emeritus archaeologist at the Australian National University, tells Ellen Phiddian of the <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2025-09-16/human-mummification-oldest-known-mummy-smoke-dried-preserved/105774728\">Australian Broadcasting Corporation</a> (ABC), these people might have been nomadic hunter-gatherers who wished to travel with their dead.</p>\n<p>“One possibility here is that this smoking and binding was done so that they could carry the mummies around,” he says.</p>\n<p>The graves examined for the study contained only bones—no skin or hair. Smoke-drying would have preserved the remains’ softer tissue, but only for a few decades or centuries, Hung tells <i>Live Science</i>. That’s because these corpses, unlike Egyptian mummies, were not sealed <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/usergallery/ancient-egyptian-coffins-and-sarcophagi/SgIinGKKfuSLLg\">in containers</a>.</p>\n<p>Some of the bones the researchers studied had been heated to more than 900 degrees Fahrenheit, indicating “something going on the outside that is not going to result in smoking of a body, but burning of the body,” <a href=\"https://www.ecoaus.com.au/news/meet-the-experts-mikes-passion-for-cultural-heritage\">Michael Green</a>, an archaeologist who wasn’t involved in the study, tells the ABC. He says that multiple cultures treated corpses with fire, without smoking or preserving them.</p>\n<p>“Fire is present,” Green adds. “But whether the heating is specifically indicative of smoking—I’m concerned that’s a bit of a stretch.”</p>\n<p>Corpse-smoking is still practiced today in Papua, Indonesia. As Hung writes in the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/12-000-year-old-smoked-mummies-reveal-worlds-earliest-evidence-of-human-mummification-265261\"> Conversation</a>, the researchers visited the province in 2019 to observe the </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/06/travel/papua-indonesia-frugal-traveler.html\">Dani people</a>, who mummify bodies by binding them tightly, then smoking them until they’re black. The researchers posit that these Indonesian peoples are continuing an ancient tradition that migrating humans introduced to the area long ago.</p>\n<p>“The fact that smoke-dried mummification spread across such a vast area and endured for more than 12,000 years among Indigenous groups is remarkable,” Hung tells <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-mummies-found-southeast-asia\"> Science News</a>’ Bruce Bower.</p>\n<p>Exactly how and why the smoking ritual began remains unclear. Practitioners may have discovered the process by accident, Hung tells <i>Live Science</i>. She explains, “What is clear is that the practice prolonged the visible presence of the deceased, allowing ancestors to remain among the living in a tangible way, a poignant reflection of enduring human love, memory and devotion.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/the-worlds-oldest-mummies-might-be-these-smoke-dried-12000-year-old-skeletons-from-south-america-180987348/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I was blown away by <a href=\"https://www.piazzaduomoalba.it/en/ristorante/\">Piazza Duomo Alba</a>, a 20-year-old restaurant with charming pink walls and frescoes by artist Francisco Clemente. Chef Enrico Crippa’s dishes are celebrations of the rolling hills of the Piedmont region and his love for herbs, flowers, and vegetables.</p>\n    <p>I also visited <a href=\"https://ristorantealgattoverde.com/\">Al Gatto Verde</a>, a new restaurant by Massimo Bottura on his Casa Maria Luigia estate. This homage to Bottura’s mother is designed to be a comforting respite, a guesthouse with magical Italian dishes prepared by chef Jessica Rosval, who folds in distinctly Canadian flourishes from her home country. (Maple syrup chocolate chip cookies, anyone?)</p>\n    <p>Both restaurants reminded me of visits to <a href=\"https://maido.pe/\">Maido</a> in Lima, Peru, the transformational palace of Nikkei cuisine by Mitsuharu Tsumura (recently named best restaurant in the world), and <a href=\"https://noma.dk/\">Noma</a>, the Copenhagen landmark of multiple iterations, whose shifting focus stems from René Redzepi and team’s sojourns to Mexico and Japan. In each of these dining rooms, guests are immersed in vision and inspiration, the chefs’ ideas playing out in every course.</p>\n    <p>To some degree, the best restaurants in the world are self-portraits, easily identifiable by the chef’s history, background, ambition, and ability to shape the culture of hospitality and dining more broadly. These are the dynamics that set a great neighborhood or city restaurant apart from the best of the best.</p>\n    <p>That sensibility is apparent in the restaurants that make up Bon Appétit’s 2025 class of Best New Restaurants. The deeply personal ventures from an intimate snack bar with a well-deserved wait list to the 118-seat hotel anchor that caters to the needs of guests while nodding to the communities that call Houston home. Many of the chefs are like musicians who have graduated from covering other artists’ songs to composing their own masterpieces. Other chefs, like Kwame Onwuachi and Seng Luangrath, have extended their repertoire as restaurateurs, creating well-defined culinary identities.</p>\n    <p>Each of our new restaurants is welcoming and expressive, like being invited to the chef ’s home and being so delighted you can’t wait to return.</p>\n    <h2>Restaurant Trends to Watch</h2>\n    <p>\n      <strong>CARIBBEAN CUISINE</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Cooking techniques such as smoking and ingredients like allspice and black djon djon mushrooms represent the highest levels of island cuisine. Restaurants like Bar Kabawa in New York and Kamuy, a Haitian bistro in Montreal, are best-in-class examples of Caribbean fine dining.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>OMAKASE-STYLE COUNTER CULTURE</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Leaving the meal up to the chef, no matter the cuisine, is an important contrast<br/>to hospitality that focuses on the whims and preferences of the guests. Intimate 6-to- 18-seat counters are like being invited into an artist’s workshop, which may be why so many of them are called studios.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>FAMILY-STYLE</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Dinner-party-style service became popular post-pandemic, with diners seated<br/>with friends and strangers. Expect to see more restaurants offering shared sides and dessert along with plated main courses, which is customary in places like Central and West Africa.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-personal-stories-shaped-the-best-new-restaurants-of-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>In this piece, Pat Cassels sits in a sauna watching a dancing duo clad in dazzling, crystal-studded spandex unitards—an awesome spectacle, by all accounts. Cassels finds himself here to cover the inaugural Aufguss World Masters, which is, as he writes, “a blend of dance, sport, theater, therapy, and aerodynamic manipulation so odd it could only come from Germany. I was witnessing, for lack of a more succinct description, competitive sauna–ing.” It’s fascinating, it’s fun, it’s hot. Enter the sauna.</p><blockquote><p>Despite the competition’s judges and rules, to the uninitiated aufguss might seem strange—even silly. “The first time I saw it, I thought I was watching a Will Ferrell movie,” Talmadge told me. Yet it arrives at a uniquely opportune time to tap into American culture. Attendance, revenue, and employment at spas in the States are all up. The International Spa Association calculates that nearly 200 million people visited one last year, spending a record $22 billion. In such a market, could aufguss, already a hit in Sweden, Norway, and the Netherlands, catch on in the States like so many Scandinavian phenomena before it? Could it be the next ABBA? The next democratic socialism? The next pornographic cinema? The World Masters, in fact, strikes me as an oddly perfect fit for the United States. There’s something distinctly American about turning</p><i>relaxing</i>into a sport—as if wellness were subject to capitalist rules of competition. Or have we become so accustomed to anxiety and dread that simply<i>calming down</i>feels as challenging as completing an Iron Man?</blockquote><h2>More picks on subcultures</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/07/17/the-game-is-played-with-great-feeling/\">The Game Is Played With Great Feeling</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“How Pokémon can save the world, one Pikachu at a time.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2023/05/25/the-case-of-the-lego-bandit/\">The Case of the Lego Bandit</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Playing with Star Wars Lego bricks made them famous.

    "body": "<p>New York fashion week is proving a particularly perplexing time for brands as they continue to grapple with <a href=\"https://wwd.com/business-news/luxury-market-faces-first-slowdown-study-estimates-decrease-1237927288/\">a global slowdown</a>, leading many to question what luxury even means today.</p>\n<p>For some consumers, it is always going to be about a gleaming five-figure handbag. For others, it is a limited-edition Labubu. While a certain cohort considers a plain cashmere jumper to be the peak of high status, logomania endures for others. Vintage shopping is now used to denote quality but equally buying nothing has become a powerful signifier.</p>\n<p>However, ahead of the Coach show on Monday afternoon, the brand’s creative director, Stuart Vevers, said the word luxury was “overused”. The Yorkshire-born designer, who has worked with the US house since 2013, explained that he was no longer “interested in extreme polish or perfection that has long been associated with luxury”.</p>\n<p>Instead, Vevers’ catwalk collection aimed to capture what is seen as desirable in the eyes of today’s youth. This translated into low-slung jeans so baggy they could be heard scraping along the catwalk with seams grubby and scuffed. Shrunken knits appeared to be moth-eaten. Some models wore workwear-inspired boots with lug soles and scratched leather. There were also actual workwear pieces, including repurposed trousers with paint splatters still visible. Meanwhile, motorcycle jackets appeared worn-in because they were – fashioned from upcycled leather, part of a wider sustainability initiative the brand launched in 2023.</p>\n<p>Welcome to luxury 2.0. This is what gen Z wants to wear and is already wearing all over the city’s Lower East Side. Vevers loves to people-watch and his time spent doing so is proving fruitful. In a world of distraction, Coach has managed to capture the attention of gen Z.</p>\n<p>On the most recent <a href=\"https://www.lyst.com/the-lyst-index/the-lyst-index-q2-25/\">Lyst Index</a>, a quarterly report that ranks brands based on sales, Coach now sits at number five, sandwiched between Prada and The Row. In August, its parent company, Tapestry, said Coach continued to lead sales at the group, rising 14% to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/tapestrys-sales-rise-on-popularity-of-coach-brand-5744f87f?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAjWn5B7_FiKqywF7GVXo6XIdrBjmyxniTJN94yYGfC6xLGwm1_yWqoKvkoWKgc%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68c8d290&amp;gaa_sig=NOFi37IP8xHfJGqWZcxkkw24UUiGqcLcT7Mc_xbeA4g9afi9RLQkiMEU9b6RIaeN915EO4WcjFcD29omMaMy4g%3D%3D\">$1.43bn since January</a>. Coach’s success means its show has become one of the largest on the schedule. This time it took over a 70,000 sq ft event space overlooking the East River, filling it with guests including the actor Elle Fanning and NBA star Jayson Tatum.</p>\n<p>While previous collections riffed on American iconography, including ‘I Heart NY’ T-shirts, this time the cultural references were much more muted. Vevers said he had been thinking about grit: “By grit, I mean resilience, and the beauty of how the city comes back to life every morning.”</p>\n<p>Vevers credited “a differentiated point of view and a differentiated aesthetic” as part of its appeal. “Our pieces have a certain down-to-earth quality. There is a certain ease to them. I think that sits well with the times we are in.”</p>\n<p>Coach’s pricing strategy also works. Its Tabby bag, seen swinging on the arm of pop star Charli xcx, hovers around the £200 mark – something fans can afford to save up for rather than just add to a fantasy wishlist. Giant “Kisslock” clutches that riff on a 1969 design of clasped purse and sit closer to the £600 mark have also had a surge in interest thanks to Carrie Bradshaw gripping one in the final episode of And Just Like That.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-10\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>Coach is also leaning into its 84-year history. Anne Hathaway has been pictured on the set of the Devil Wears Prada sequel carrying a bag from a 1986 collection. Meanwhile, after noticing youngsters were buying vintage pieces featuring Coach’s signature monogram, Vevers has put a fresh spin on the idea of logo dressing. This time around, it comes spliced with plaid and check patterns on pleated skirts and trousers.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, Luar closed out Sunday night with a show soundtracked to a reading of J Drew Lanham’s poem Joy is the Justice We Give Ourselves. Founded by the queer designer of colour Raul Lopez in 2011, it most recently created Venus Williams’s US Open looks and also counts Beyoncé and Madonna as fans.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/16/baggy-jeans-workwear-grit-luxury-reimagined-coach-new-york-fashion-week\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>As the 1960s turned into the 1970s, it wasn’t cool for star actors to be good-looking. The style was more a scuffed, grizzled, bleary, sweaty, paunchy and shlubby realness. The fashion was for leading men like Gene Hackman, Jack Nicholson, Woody Allen. Even a very beautiful man like Paul Newman had a kind of rugged, daylit quality. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/robertredford\">Robert Redford</a> was very different. Here was a supremely beautiful movie star who went on to direct, produce and then be the guardian and gatekeeper of commercial-indie US cinema at his Sundance Institute. And he was always an outlier.</p>\n<p>When movie audiences thrilled to George Roy Hill’s western <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/butch-cassidy-and-the-sundance-kid\">Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</a> in 1969, they knew that in breakout star Redford they had an almost indecently attractive male, however much he might dress it down with buckskins and moustache, playing the devil-may-care outlaw Sundance Kid himself. His sardonic charisma and sexiness shone through. And when he cleaned himself up for other roles, teaming up again with Newman for the jazz age con-men caper The Sting in 1973, the effect was electric. Neatly trimmed and shaved, Robert Redford was just outrageously handsome, incandescently handsome, he was handsomeness on legs. His photograph was in the dictionary next to “handsome”.</p>\n<p>In Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Paul Newman might be permitted to entertain Katharine Ross with his wacky stunts on a bicycle, to the accompaniment of Raindrops Keep Fallin’ On My Head. But it was blond bombshell Redford who was actually going to have sex with her. Redford was a throwback to the era of Douglas Fairbanks and Tyrone Power, the Hollywood era of gasp-inducing matinee idols and swoonworthy dreamboats, absurdly handsome men whose beauty seemed to have been nurtured in some Hollywood petri dish.</p>\n<p>The American movie business was reputedly trying to imitate some of the dash and freewheeling style of the French New Wave directors – and Redford became, for a while, the Bardot of the American new wave, but with a self-awareness and a comic self-deprecation that made him irresistible to women and men. He was a comic performer with wonderful flair, but never, in my view, very well served by serious pictures such as The Great Gatsby (1974) in which he played Fitzgerald’s enigmatic plutocrat, or The Way We Were (1973), in which he is the shallow Wasp in love with Barbra Streisand’s Jewish intellectual. In those films, for me, Redford would sometimes appear to retreat into himself, into his own misty-eyed aura, like a very lonely and beautiful woman.</p>\n<p>His best film of that time is surely Michael Ritchie’s superb political satire The Candidate, a movie released in June 1972, 12 days after the Watergate break-in. Redford plays Bill McKay, an idealistic young Democratic candidate for the US Senate, and the movie shows him on the campaign trail inexorably trimming his standards and watering down his principles as he gets closer and closer to winning.</p>\n<p>Redford’s pure handsomeness itself achieves a sublimely satirical quality in the film; politics is supposed to be show business for ugly people, but Redford’s physical beauty is symbolic of how the ruling class sees itself – and a symbolic of the bland, specious plausibility of mainstream political ideas. In All the President’s Men (1976) he was Bob Woodward to Dustin Hoffman’s Carl Bernstein – another “buddy” pairing of the sort he and Newman made fashionable in 1970s cinema. It was a heartfelt, liberal movie in which you knew who the good guys were, but without the edge and cool ambiguity of Ritchie’s The Candidate.</p>\n<p>As the years went on, there was something rather too controlled and preserved about Redford’s performing style, although he remained an above-the-title A-list star. He played opposite nuclear scene-stealer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/merylstreep\">Meryl Streep</a> in Out of Africa (1985) and inevitably got royally upstaged; in the 90s, he was still the romantic lead in Up Close &amp; Personal opposite Michelle Pfeiffer, while in Indecent Proposal he was the wealthy businessman who makes a rather preposterous “proposal” which appeared to offer audiences a rather contrived dilemma in which feminism is neither here nor there.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2025/sep/16/robert-redford-the-incandescently-handsome-star-who-changed-hollywood-forever\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The artist was known for bringing historical, mythological and religious scenes to life through bold colors and depictions of dramatic movement. He was a prolific artist, creating around 2,500 compositions and 10,000 works of art, including drawings and tapestries, according to the <a href=\"https://kmska.be/en/peter-paul-rubens\">Royal Museum of Fine Arts</a> in Antwerp.</p>\n    <h4>Quick fact: Rubens’ best-known artworks</h4>\n    <p>The Flemish master’s most famous paintings include <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/renaissance-reformation/baroque-art1/flanders-1/a/rubens-elevation-of-the-cross\"> Elevation of the Cross </a>(1610), </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/art/Descent-from-the-Cross-by-Rubens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <i>The Descent From the Cross</i>\n    <p>\n      <i>(1614) and</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.peterpaulrubens.net/the-massacre-of-innocents.jsp\"/>\n    </p>\n    <i>Massacre of the Innocents</i>\n    <p>\n      <i>(1612).</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>The moody <i>Christ on the Cross</i>, painted in 1613, was authenticated by Nils Büttner, a German art historian and Rubens expert, per AFP. He used X-ray imaging and pigment analysis to certify the painting’s origins.</p>\n    <p>When he was sure about the painting’s provenance, Büttner gave Osenat a ring. “Jean-Pierre, we have a new Rubens!” the historian told him.</p>\n    <p><i>Christ on the Cross</i> is in “very good condition,” Osenat tells AFP. His auction house will sell the painting on November 30.</p>\n    <p>No price estimate has been provided, but <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/long-forgotten-rubens-found-in-paris-mansion-2686932\"> Artnet</a>’s Jo Lawson-Tancred</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>reports that in the past year, Rubens paintings have sold for between $1 million and $5 million.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Although Rubens often made religious paintings for the Catholic church, this one was more likely created for a private collector. Experts think it once belonged to William-Adolphe Bouguereau, a French academic painter in the 19th-century.</p>\n    <p>Osenat tells AFP<i> </i>that the painting is “a true profession of faith and a favorite subject for Rubens.” The piece also represents “the very beginning of Baroque painting,” the auctioneer adds.</p>\n    <p>In the painting, Christ is seen “in a painfully realistic manner,” writes Büttner in a paper accompanying his research, per<i> Artnet</i>. “Behind the green and overgrown rocky backdrop of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Golgotha\">Golgotha</a> is a view of Jerusalem illuminated, but apparently under a rainstorm.”</p>\n    <p>That attention to detail can also be seen in <i>St. Gregory of Nazianzus</i>, a 1621 biblical sketch by Rubens that was <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/rubens-painting-returning-to-castle-in-germany-180984592/\">returned to a castle in Germany</a> last year.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/long-lost-rubens-painting-of-jesus-christs-crucifixion-discovered-in-a-paris-mansion-180987337/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Resorts are dotted all over the islands, from the sunny southern coast of Tenerife to the quieter shores of Fuerteventura.</p>\n<p>It’s not just hotels where you get more for your money. The cost of living is generally affordable, with delicious meals and local wine that won't break the bank.

Studies have detected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/28/toxic-pesticide-levels-found-in-tampons-40-times-higher-than-legal-limit-for-water\">toxic pesticides </a>and <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412024004355?via%3Dihub\">16 types of metals in tampons</a>. Not by choice, millions of us could be putting our health at risk by placing hidden toxic ingredients on one of the most sensitive parts of our bodies. In light of this, the Women’s Environmental Network is calling for a UK parliamentary bill covering <a href=\"https://www.wen.org.uk/2023/08/14/why-we-need-a-menstrual-health-dignity-and-sustainability-act/\">menstrual health, dignity and sustainability</a>.</p>\n<p>I was an early adopter of period pants, and in my work as an author and journalist writing about sustainability, I have previously spoken to the academics behind a scientific paper – <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666789422000277#bib2\">Menstrual Products: A Comparable Life Cycle Assessment</a> – who carried out an in-depth analysis of different period products based on eight environmental impacts, including global warming potential, fossil resources, water use and carcinogenic effects. The report concluded that the menstrual cup had the lowest environmental impact across all categories, followed by period underwear, reusable pads and, in last place, single-use pads and tampons. With this study in mind,<strong> </strong>I decided to do my own tests of the best products, taking health implications into account, too.</p>\n<p>The good news is that there’s a growing choice of menstrual cups, reusable pads, and tampons and pads made without harmful chemicals.</p>\n<p>Over the course of three months and three periods, I tried everything here, including period swimwear for the first time. Period pants continue to be one of my favourite options. I haven’t included them here because they were recently covered in detail in our test of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jul/09/best-period-pants-uk\">best period pants</a>.</p>\n<p>Periods are personal, and my reviews are based on my own, which are regular in frequency and flow, lasting about six days each month, with the heaviest flow in the second and third days. So you may want to adjust your choices based on your own cycle.</p>\n<h2>The best sustainable pads and tampons</h2>\n<p>From organic cotton to non-toxic ingredients and compostable materials, period brands are offering more eco-friendly alternatives to traditional tampons and pads. Convenient, reliable and comfortable, they’re often similar in price, too.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Natracare ultra extra regular pads with wings, 12 pack</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bodykind.com%2Fbeauty-c1%2Fperiod-care-c38%2Fpads-and-panty-liners-c439%2Fnatracare-ultra-extra-pads-with-wings-regular-12-pack-p3799&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/16/best-sustainable-period-products-menstrual-cups-pads-swimwerar-uk\">£2.42 at Bodykind</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.naturalcollection.com%2Fshop%2Fnatracare-organic-cotton-ultra-extra-pads---normal-with-wings---pack-of-12-by-natracare%2F&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/16/best-sustainable-period-products-menstrual-cups-pads-swimwerar-uk\">£2.48 at Natural Collection</a>\n    </p>\n<p>I’ve been using these for years. Made from organic cotton, they come in different sizes depending on your flow. Free of petroleum-based plastic, chlorine, perfume and dyes, Natracare pads are biodegradable and <a href=\"https://www.natracare.com/blog/biodegradable-vs-compostable-period-products/\">compostable</a>. Under the right conditions – a home compost bin or access to a community compost or local waste collection that accepts certified-compostable menstrual products – the pads can break down. If not, they can go into your general waste and degrade in landfill over time. And I can buy them as part of my food shop – they’re available in supermarkets and high-street chemists at the same price as synthetic versions.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Totm natural pads</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.totm.com%2Fproduct%2Fnatural-pads%2F&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/16/best-sustainable-period-products-menstrual-cups-pads-swimwerar-uk\">From £2.95 for 10 pads at Totm</a>\n    </p>\n<p>The ingredients are clearly listed on the website so you don’t have to search: organic cotton cover, FSC-certified wood pulp core, compostable biofilm backing and non-toxic adhesive; they’re free from fragrance, dyes and artificial absorbents. Each pad is wrapped in compostable biofilm. Like the Natracare pads, these are also compostable under the right conditions or can degrade in landfill. I’d recommend the “super” for medium to heavy flow, and “medium” for lighter flows. Both felt soft to the skin and were comfortable to wear.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Natracare organic regular cotton tampons with applicator, 16 pack</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bodykind.com%2Fbeauty-c1%2Fperiod-care-c38%2Ftampons-c440%2Fnatracare-organic-applicator-tampons-regular-16-pack-p3808&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/16/best-sustainable-period-products-menstrual-cups-pads-swimwerar-uk\">£3.23 at Bodykind</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvictoriahealth.com%2Forganic-regular-applicator-tampons%2F&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/16/best-sustainable-period-products-menstrual-cups-pads-swimwerar-uk\">£3.59 at Victoria Health</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Made from organic cotton and free from chemicals, these tampons come packaged in paper, not the usual plastic wrapping of traditional tampons.

I was really poor, and I thought I was just gonna do this for a while to make a little money so I could write novels. I thought movies were a second-class art form. I condescended to it — I didn’t know enough to know it was really gonna be hard.</p>\n    <p>Things changed around the time I met Michael Tolkin. When I saw <i>The Player</i> (1992), when I was still living in New York, I had thought, “I wonder if I could do that.” A couple of years later I had become friends with an executive who was working with him on a project for HBO about Microsoft, and she put the two of us together. When he and I first met, we talked about Proust, and we both loved Tolstoy, and we had a lot of similar references. So we ended up spending the whole meeting talking about ‘The Death of Ivan Ilyich’ and ‘The Kreutzer Sonata.’ And I was just so happy. I didn’t care what happened after that — it was just the greatest afternoon. I thought, “I love this guy. He’s so funny and so cool, and just an absolutely first-rate artist in all of his thinking.”</p>\n    <p>We teamed up on the HBO project, which was a satire about Bill Gates and Microsoft, a sort of <i>Dr. Strangelove</i> piece about technology, called 20 Billion. We’d break up the scenes, we’d write our scenes, we’d get back together, and his scenes were just so much better than mine that I couldn’t believe…</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://gointothestory.blcklst.com/screenwriting-101-stephen-gaghan-4dbae6d93ba2?source=rss----cd46c47af086---4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Gilbert left her marriage to be with her, only to find herself navigating the twin challenges of terminal illness and addiction — Elias’s relapses and her own dependence on love and validation. The memoir weaves through moments of devotion, denial and grief, capturing the beauty of their bond as well as the ways it unraveled. After Elias’s death, Gilbert confronts her sorrow and guilt, ultimately finding a new sense of clarity in their wake.</p>\n<p>(Credit: Barnes &amp; Noble)</p>\n<h2>\"The Wilderness\" by Angela Flournoy (Sept. 16)</h2>\n<p>Angela Flournoy’s “<a href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-wilderness-angela-flournoy/1146705059\">The Wilderness</a>” follows five Black women — Desiree, Danielle, January, Monique and Nakia — as they navigate early adulthood in New York and Los Angeles. Desiree and Danielle wrestle with sibling estrangement; January navigates an unexpected pregnancy; Monique gains online fame for challenging injustice; Nakia fights to launch her restaurant independently. Over two decades, their lives intertwine amid political upheaval, economic strain and environmental instability. Flournoy captures the push and pull of friendship and ambition, showing the sparks of wisdom and the deep losses that accompany one’s ascent from early adulthood to middle age.</p>\n<p>(Credit: Barnes &amp; Noble)</p>\n<h2>\"107 Days\" by Kamala Harris (Sept. 23)</h2>\n<p>Kamala Harris’s new <a href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/107-days-kamala-harris/1147932213\">tell-all</a> revisits the turbulent 2024 presidential race, offering a blunt assessment of what went wrong. She details her frustrations with the Democratic Party’s handling of her candidacy, recalling instances of marginalization inside the administration and blind spots that left her vulnerable to relentless media attacks. Behind closed doors, Harris fought to maintain visibility while navigating the personal and strategic strains of the campaign. Alongside her candid view of Biden’s leadership and fitness, she delivers an insider’s portrait of loss and resilience during a time of political turbulence. The book will launch with a tour across the U.S., U.K. and Canada.</p>\n<p>(Credit: Barnes &amp; Noble)</p>\n<h2>\"Will There Ever Be Another You\" by Patricia Lockwood (Sept. 23)</h2>\n<p>From Booker Prize finalist Patricia Lockwood, this <a href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/will-there-ever-be-another-you-patricia-lockwood/1146743832\">novel</a> follows a young woman whose mind unravels after contracting COVID-19. She fears her own floorboards, hears “WHAT IS LOVE? BABY DON’T HURT ME” looping in her head and can no longer recognize her friends. Memories slip through her, time feels fluid and she questions whether the illness has stolen her old self or offered a chance to start anew. As she navigates this disorientation, she attempts to rebuild her life and sense of identity from scratch. Lockwood blends surreal humor with acute observation, capturing the strangeness of surviving an illness that reshapes the mind and body. </p>\n<p>(Credit: Barnes &amp; Noble)</p>\n<h2>\"Heart the Lover\" by Lily King (Sept. 30)</h2>\n<p>Lily King’s newest <a href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/heart-the-lover-lily-king/1147010165\">novel</a> follows Jordan, an aspiring writer in her senior year of college, who becomes entangled in a deepening relationship with two brilliant classmates, Sam and Yash.

Years later, as a successful writer with a family, Jordan is confronted with the past when a surprise visit brings the unresolved emotions and decisions of her youth back into her life.

Whether you’re wearing leggings, denim, or shorts, toned legs give us that “worked for it” look.</p>\n<p>It’s not all about aesthetics, though. Toned, muscular features speak to strength and confidence. After all, our legs (literally) carry us all day, giving our bodies support to do <i>whatever </i>our daily activities consist of.</p>\n<p>So because of this, they deserve the love and support of intentional movement, smart training, and consistent care. The best way to accomplish this? The right leg exercises.</p>\n<p>You can do them at home, at the gym, or even around the neighborhood. All it takes is knowing which habits to adapt and which tips to follow. That’s why today, we’re sharing our guide for toning your legs in a way that actually works. It’s time to look and feel your best.</p>\n<h2>How to Tone Up Your Legs: Exercises, Tips and Habits That Actually Work</h2>\n<p>In this post, we’ll tell you the best leg workouts for building muscle in your legs, so you can strategically fill up your workout routine with things that will help you reach your goals.</p>\n<p>We’ll also share tips beyond exercise that’ll give your body everything it needs for a sculpted, strong, and toned figure.</p>\n<p>Here’s how to get toned legs ready for any chic ‘fit or powerful moment:</p>\n<h3>What Do Toned Legs Look Like?</h3>\n<p>When we say toned legs, we don’t mean <i>jacked </i>legs. So many women get scared by strength training because they think they’ll look bulky and masculine. This is not the case.<br/>Toned legs are muscular, but lean. The muscle development and healthy body composition give the calves, shins, ankles, thighs, hips, and butt visible muscle definition, a firm appearance, a balanced shape, and an overall healthy, sculpted look. </p>\n<p>Basically, your legs look like that of a runway model, strong and beautiful.</p>\n<h3>How to Tone Legs</h3>\n<p>The best exercises to tone muscles are strength training exercises. They build muscles to improve body composition and overall health, giving you the figure you’re looking for.</p>\n<p>Do some cardio, too, to help support weight loss and stress relief. However, cardio alone won’t tone your legs. It just doesn’t build muscle like that.</p>\n<p>For more on the benefits of strength training, jump into the episode of the <a href=\"https://tscpodcast.com/\">Him &amp; Her Show</a> called <a href=\"https://tscpodcast.com/episodes/senada-greca/\">Why Women Don’t Lose Weight, Gain Muscle, &amp; Stay Motivated Ft. Celebrity Trainer Senada Greca</a>.</p>\n<p>Start by just doing exercises that use your bodyweight as the “weight.” Then, add dumbbells, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3VN3056\">resistance bands</a>, and machines over time.</p>\n<p>Always increase in small increments. You should feel challenged, but you shouldn’t be straining. This will help you get the most of your workouts.</p>\n<p>If you need recommendations on tools and machines, here are our <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/at-home-workout-equipment-ive-been-loving/\">favorite women’s at-home workout equipment</a>.  </p>\n<p>Proper form is <i>so </i>important. Not doing exercises correctly can lead to injury, soreness, and underwhelming results. </p>\n<p>Consider working with a trainer or downloading <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/my-favorite-free-fitnessdiet-apps/\">fitness and diet apps</a> to see and mimic correct movements and techniques. And always use slow, controlled movements instead of rushing through reps.</p>\n<p>To maintain good body composition, all your muscle groups need attention. The goal is to be proportional, not have huge calves or glutes. (Well, actually, maybe we do want that second one.)</p>\n<p>The point is, give all your muscle groups attention. Quads, hamstrings, calves, thighs, and glutes all benefit from targeted exercises that build strength, improve balance, and enhance overall lower-body definition.</p>\n<p>Don’t workout the same leg muscles every day. Rotate your routine and give your body time to rest and recover.</p>\n<p>On days you don’t do any strength training or cardio, still do light movement activities like yoga, stretching, or foam rolling—anything that doesn’t elevate your heart rate and overwork your muscles.</p>\n<p>This helps prevent injury by giving your body time to bounce back after a week of consistent exercise.</p>\n<p>Muscles need hydration to respond appropriately to your workout. For muscles to contract while you’re training, they need plenty of moisture for contraction.</p>\n<p>Drink plenty of water, but consider leveling up your hydration with electrolytes. This will help your body use the water more efficiently to prevent cramping and enhance your results.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/how-to-tone-up-your-legs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.</p>\n    <p>Our daily workwear reports suggest one piece of work-appropriate attire in a range of prices.</p>\n    <p>I love the detailing on this silk blouse from Brooks Brothers. I’ve been looking for some blouses that give the feeling of a crisp, collared, button-up blouse without the stiffness or the collar, and this is perfect. Layer this navy top under a gray suit for a business formal look that’s still feminine.</p>\n    <p>The blouse is $228 at Brooks Brothers and comes in sizes XXS-XL.</p>\n    <p>Not to wear, but I switched my preschool-aged daughter’s bed quilt out. The old one was polyester and the new one is organic cotton and I absolutely love it. It’s soft and lightweight and just makes me really happy every time I tuck her underneath it. She used to wake up drenched in sweat, and changing to the cotton quilt has eliminated that problem.</p>\n    <p>I had been doing natural fabrics for a while, so I was surprised when I bought some 100% rayon, non-stretch fabric drapy pants how light and comfortable I found them.</p>\n    <p>Still avoiding polyester and spandex, but may let up on rayon now!</p>\n    <p>Heading to Chicago for a weekend soon. Any great bookstores that I should hit? And any REALLY good consignment/vintage/second-hand stores? Won’t have a car but can uber. Would like to avoid the distant burbs. Thank you ladies!</p>\n    <p>This may be a hot take, but Chicago does not have a great bookstore scene compared to other large cities, especially downtown. While some of the neighborhoods do have good bookstores – Hyde Park, for example – they’re a 20 minute Uber trip in each direction. If you are up to that trip, then the Seminary Co-op and Powell’s Books Chicago have a solid selection.</p>\n    <p>Chicago is one of those cities where I am on the train or leaving the driving to locals. There is an elevated expressway that wraps around a church. My people still can’t grasp that ramps and elevated surfaces freeze easily, so I avoid to avoid them when ever our temps dip below freezing. Chicago people can handle all this plus real winter but I’m not ready.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://corporette.com/brooks-silk-blouse/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <i>Can I send a dish back just because I didn’t like it? How do we split the check without causing a fight in the group chat? In  Code of Conduct, our restaurant etiquette column, we explore the do’s and don’ts and IDKs of being a good diner.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>On any given night at your local watering hole or restaurant, bartenders are doing double time, dispensing drinks and life lessons from behind the bar. If you’re rusty on etiquette or self-conscious about how to act on a night out, <strong>John deBary</strong> is here to help. A drinks writer and the general manager of Mission Chinese Food in New York City, he taps his vast hospitality industry experience to navigate some everyday conundrums about which you may have been too afraid to ask.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Do I have to wait for everyone else’s food to arrive before cutting into my own plate?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Yes? I think it’s a little weird to just start chowing down and make your friends sit through a nonconsensual mukbang. Most places do their best to make sure everything hits the table at more or less the same time. You can probably stand to wait the 40 seconds it takes for everyone to be served.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Do you tip on the total price of the bill if you order a bottle of wine?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Yes. Next question.</p>\n<p>Just kidding. There is a lot more nuance here. Tipping is a not-great-to-kind-of-bad system for compensating restaurant staff, but at its core it is structurally very similar to other commission-based models. A salesperson’s commission percentage does not decrease as the price of the sold item increases, so you should think about tipping with the same framework. Often the beverage staff invests a significant amount of unseen labor in developing the expertise needed to sell pricey wine, and the bill reflects more than simply the cost of goods.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>If I don’t like a table, is it okay to ask for a different location?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Yes. In my nearly two decades of experience working in hospitality, I’ve never observed a conspiracy to give people the worst tables possible just for fun. Usually the decision on where to seat a given party is based on matching the number of people to the number of seats while giving the restaurant the most flexibility to accommodate walk-ins and other last-minute changes to their books.</p>\n<p>A restaurant should be happy to oblige a request for a different table if possible, but take any denial with grace. Just because that table over there is empty right now does not mean that they’re just holding it open to satisfy their need for sadistic thrills.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>If there’s a social media influencer disrupting the meal with lights, cameras, and ruckus, who should speak up, the staff or the diner?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Yeah, this is really annoying. If this is something the restaurant has arranged in advance, they should have at least set some parameters as to how intrusive the person can be. It is on the restaurant to schedule this outside the boundaries of normal service, or at least at the very beginning or end of dinner hours. If it’s a spur-of-the-moment thing, the responsibility falls on the restaurant staff to curtail the photo shoot, regardless of the possible ramifications. People might be scared to piss off an influencer because they see a high follower count, but even if this person is genuinely huge on TikTok, it’s worth the risk.</p>\n<p>Ultimately the best PR for restaurants is word of mouth from the normal-ass people, i.e., most customers. That should be at the forefront of running service. I’m willing to do whatever it takes to make sure that the people just wanting to have a meal in peace can do so.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>A friend invited me to a four-person dinner weeks ago. Forty-eight hours before, they have not texted back about solid plans or a reservation. Whose responsibility is it to keep the plans?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/restaurant-etiquette-questions-answered\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n    <p>It’s a marvel that <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tavel19/\">Tavel Bristol-Joseph</a> ever finds time to cook at home considering the role he plays in 11 restaurant kitchens across Austin and San Antonio. He’s the pastry chef and partner at the <a href=\"https://emmerhospitality.com/\">Emmer &amp; Rye</a> Hospitality Group but splits most of his time these days between <a href=\"https://canjeatx.com/\">Canje</a>, a Caribbean spot that landed on Bon Appétit’s 10 <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/10-best-new-restaurants-america-2022\">Best New Restaurants</a> of 2022, and <a href=\"https://www.pullmanmarket.com/\">Pullman Market</a>, the group’s 40,000-square-foot culinary hub with everything from a dessert tasting counter to a whole animal butcher. At home, his kitchen is as functional and ergonomic as those professional spaces, with a bit more room for fun. He’s got a wall oven placed to match his stature (he’s six foot five, after all), an extra-large fridge to fit both groceries and samples from work, and the internet’s latest gadget obsession (the Ninja Creami). And he isn’t afraid to play around with it. It’s a space tailored for creativity and for indulging in the more delicious side of bringing work home.</p>\n    <p>Small design details like French doors and clear, bright white fluorescent lighting are essential for Bristol-Joseph. “As a chef, when you go grocery shopping, you want to buy everything you see because you never know what you’re going to practice on,” he says. So it’s important that the refrigerator is spacious enough to fit everything that catches his eye at the store, alongside leftovers and in-progress dishes that may show up on the menu at one of his restaurants.</p>\n    <p>With five-burners and a powerful 16,000-BTU unit in the center, cooking in large pots for large crowds is effortless. It’s also just right for searing steaks, which Bristol-Joseph exclusively makes in a scorching hot cast-iron pan.</p>\n    <p>Thinner and lighter than a standard cast-iron, makes for a skillet that feels more like you’re handling a frying pan. “It’s unlike any cast-iron I’ve ever used,” Bristol-Joseph says.</p>\n    <p>Installing a wall oven was a game changer for Bristol-Joseph. “I’m accustomed to the classic oven that’s underneath your stove, but having the oven on the wall, it’s a little bit taller than your regular oven, so for a tall guy, it works perfectly for me,” he says. While this model has an array of broil and convection baking modes, it’s also got a proofing setting for a seamless final rise of homemade bread dough.</p>\n    <p>Bristol-Joseph’s 16-year-old daughter, Charvel, became fascinated with the Creami on TikTok and talked her father into experimenting. “I’ve used a Pacojet in restaurants for a long time, but I didn’t see the sense in a $4,000 piece of equipment for the house” he says. Ninja’s machine mimics the Pacojet’s high-powered micro-purée technology, letting the family whip up silky-smooth watermelon-lime sorbet at home.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/pastry-chef-tools-home-kitchen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>\n      <strong>I have a</strong>\n      <strong> lot</strong>\n      <strong> of jam made with all kinds of berries – are there any bakes that would use some of it up? </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>“Jam is at the heart of many great British puddings and cakes, so there are never too many jars in my house!” says Emily Cuddeford, co-founder of Edinburgh’s</i>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Anne-Lies, Gouda, the Netherlands<br/></strong>\n    <p><a href=\"https://twelvetriangles.co.uk/\">Twelve Triangles</a>bakery. Her first thought, though, would be to tip a jar of the sweet stuff into a buttered ceramic baking dish and top it with sponge: “Make a classic, equal-parts mix scaled to your dish by creaming, say, 180g butter and 180g sugar, slowly beating in an egg and a dash of vanilla or lemon zest, and finishing with 180g self-raising flour.” Spoon that on top of the jam and bake at 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 until the sponge “bounces back” and a skewer comes out clean. Serve warm with cream or custard, and job’s a good ’un.</p>\n    <p>You’ll also want jam to fill or top cakes. “Obvious things are a Victoria sponge, but that doesn’t use much jam,” says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/benjamina-ebuehi\">the Guardian’s own Benjamina Ebuehi</a>, so she’d be more inclined to spoon buttercream over the top of a coconut cake, for example, make a dip in the middle with the back of a spoon and pop some jam in there: “That’s a nice way to decorate a cake and it also uses up a decent amount of jam.” It wouldn’t hurt, either, to use berry jams to finish a classic school dinner traybake sponge: “Once it’s out of the oven, top with jam then scatter with desiccated coconut.” Otherwise, Ebuehi says, joy can be found in a nostalgic jam tart or Italian <i>crostata</i> (look out for Ebuehi’s blackberry version next week).</p>\n    <p>Of course, jam is a great friend of biscuits, too, with Cuddeford and Ebuehi agreeing that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/feb/23/lemon-thyme-thumbprint-cookies-recipe-benjamina-ebuehi\">thumbprint</a> cookies are the way to go here. Cudderford opts for jamaretti: “Whisk egg whites with sugar, ground nuts and lemon zest until firm enough to roll into balls, then toss in icing sugar.” Make an indent in the centre, spoon in the jam and bake: “They’re delicious, chewy and keep well in a sealed container for a few weeks.” Darcie Mahler, owner of <a href=\"https://www.lannanbakery.com/\">Lannan bakery</a> in Scotland, meanwhile, would go for shortbread: “Make a simple shortbread by beating icing sugar and butter, then add flour – I use a mix of plain and spelt – cornflour, salt and vanilla paste.” Pipe that into discs, make a thumbprint, fill with jam and bake until the edges are lightly golden.<br/>\n  A dollop of jam also gives breakfast an instant zhoosh. For Ebuehi, that means porridge or yoghurt, while no sensible person ever refused a twice-baked croissant, Cuddeford says. “Split croissants in half and spread with jam. Cream 80g butter and 80g sugar, add an egg and 80g ground almonds, then spoon into your jammy croissants, and spread some on top, too.” Sprinkle with flaked almonds, then get them in a 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 oven for 20 minutes for a very good morning. <br/>\n  There are, of course, only so many baked goods you can eat (well, in theory, anyway), so also consider spreading the love: “Put a nice bow on the jars and gift them,” Ebuehi says. “Everyone loves an edible gift.” Alternatively, get a gang over, mix a teaspoon of jam into cocktails – “with gin, lemon juice and tonic,” Cuddeford suggests – and keep that summer spirit alive.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Got a culinary dilemma?

Fraser suspects her mother longs to escape their mountain shack, but cannot bring herself to leave. A therapist later identifies a shared delusion—<i>folie à deux</i>—between the couple, and only ill health eventually drives them down the mountain. Fraser wrestles with when to interfere with her aging mother and when to let her live her own life, a decision many children face, though rarely in such extreme circumstances.</p><blockquote><p>During Mom’s therapy appointment, I waited at a nearby Starbucks, but having seen Dianna myself, I could imagine it well. I was sure Mom was immediately soothed by the serene decor of the office, the low-bubbling tank with its gently swaying fish, the lavender palette and soft couch pillows. Dianna, a statuesque blonde in her early 60s, was always dressed in flowy silk outfits in muted colors like dusty rose and light gold. Her large eyes brimmed with wise compassion, yet to me she had dispensed firm, sometimes uncomfortable insights. They were just what I needed.</p><p>Later at home, I asked Mom how it went.</p><p>“Well, she was really dramatic.”</p><p>“How so?”</p><p>“She diagnosed us with</p><a href=\"\">folie à deux</a>.” She chuckled a little, then sighed. “It’s a real diagnosis.

Precious few orders had been placed that day, so Mulligan was happy to oblige, despite the late hour.</p>\n<p>The intimate act of taking measurements was often eased by conversation, so Mulligan began prompting his customer with a few innocent questions. Suddenly, a boasting tale spilled out of the soldier’s mouth. His days of keeping watch in the freezing cold would soon be over, he was sure of it. In fact, the man bragged, the entire war would end in mere days with a sweeping British victory. What harm would it do to tell his tailor? After all, everyone would soon know about the <a href=\"https://cardinalnews.org/2023/06/15/an-alleged-plot-to-kill-george-washington-in-1779-gets-new-scrutiny/\">brilliant plot</a> to capture and assassinate General George Washington.</p>\n<p>Mulligan calmly recorded the distance from the nape of the man’s neck to his waist and the circumference of his chest, but inside, his mind was racing. After the officer left, Mulligan began taking much more detailed notes, capturing every aspect of the imminent plot the man had described. Missive in hand, he quickly locked up and sprinted down to the docks, searching for his trusted assistant, an enslaved man named <a href=\"https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/black-spies-american-revolution#:~:text=The%20answer%20was%20Cato%2C%20an,the%20network%20of%20patriot%20espionage.\">Cato</a>, in hopes of spiriting the message out of British-occupied New York City and into the hands of an American contact, thereby saving the general—and perhaps even the young nation itself.</p>\n<p>This is a compelling and oft-repeated narrative, but how much of it can be proved? How do contemporary historians know that the tailor was a spy at all? And who was the courier with enough bravery and skill to escape New York Harbor and safely convey the intelligence to the Americans?</p>\n<p>Documents newly discovered by historian Claire Bellerjeau, one of the co-authors of this article, shed light on Mulligan’s life and the possible identity of the Black man believed to have helped him. These papers focus on an individual by the name of Cato, who was enslaved by members of the powerful <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/schuyler-estate.htm\">Schuyler family</a>, then fled New York around the time of the foiled assassination plot. They add to the growing corpus of previously untold and incomplete stories of Black patriots.</p>\n<p>“These findings provide a more nuanced view of Cato,” underscoring the “<a href=\"https://www.nyhistory.org/blogs/jupiter-hammon-poem-discovered\">role of Black Americans</a> in the Colonies and the new nation,” says <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/author/bill-bleyer/\">Bill Bleyer</a>, author of <i>George Washington's Long Island Spy Ring</i><i>.</i></p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:18th-century_maps_of_New_York_Bay#/media/File:Plan_of_the_city_of_New_York,_in_North_America._Surveyed_in_the_years_1766_&amp;_1767_(NYPL_Hades-189283\">Public domain via Wikimedia Commons</a>\n    </p>\n<p>New York City fell into <a href=\"https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/british-occupation-of-new-york-city\">British hands</a> in the fall of 1776.

His counterpart on Long Island, a farmer named <a href=\"https://allthingsliberty.com/2014/05/abraham-woodhull-the-spy-named-samuel-culper/\">Abraham Woodhull</a> (alias Samuel Culper), needed a new agent in the city, and “Mr. Mulligan” was one of two names suggested, along with a “Mr. Duchie.” Soon after, however, Townsend relented and agreed to continue collecting intelligence, so Mulligan never joined the Culper ring.

    "body": "<p>Nothing makes me feel more settled than making a cup of coffee in the morning. Without it, my whole day feels slightly off. For years, that was just something I accepted about traveling or camping – there <i>might</i> be coffee, but it wouldn’t quite ground me. It would be a compromise. A little off.</p>\n<p>That’s why I’ve spent the past few years perfecting my travel coffee setup: so I can make rich, comforting, homey coffee anywhere in the world, <i>without </i>trying to wedge an espresso machine into my carry-on. Here are the inexpensive tools that make it possible.</p>\n<h2>Aeropress + Fellow Prismo</h2>\n<p>This is the star of the show. The humble Aeropress is a remarkably versatile, durable little device that’s seen me through conferences, multi-state moves, and even a stretch of couch surfing between friends’ places. At its core, it’s just a simple plastic cylinder with a plunger. Add your coffee grounds, pour in hot water, give it a stir, and then plunge it like a giant syringe.</p>\n<p>I made one key upgrade, though: instead of the standard cap and paper filters, I use the Fellow Prismo, a high-pressure cap with a reusable metal filter. This swap both eliminates the need for paper filters, and aerates the coffee as you press, giving it a touch of crema and a boost in both flavor and aroma.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Aeropress Original</strong>\n      <sub>$34.98 at Walmart</sub>\n      <sub>$39.99 at Amazon</sub>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Fellow Prismo</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <sub>$24.95 at Fellow</sub>\n      <sub>$24.95 at Amazon</sub>\n    </p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Local coffee beans</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>When I’m staying in a hotel, I’ll usually track down a local cafe and pick up a bag of beans. Most spots are happy to grind them for you, and it’s worth it: those commercial-grade burr grinders give you an incredibly even grind, which makes a big difference in flavor.</p>\n<p>Plus, it’s a great way to connect with the local coffee scene. You’re not just getting a caffeine fix — you’re tasting your travels, supporting a small business, and maybe discovering a roast you’ll end up ordering again once you’re back home. On trips to Seattle, I used to drop in to Caffe Vita for a bag of its rich and velvety Queen City blend, and Kuma <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/coffee\">Coffee</a> for Momma Bear, a half-caf blend that makes my afternoons wonderfully buzzy without ruining my sleep schedule.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Queen City coffee</strong>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.caffevita.com/products/queen-city\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Momma Bear coffee</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>\n        <br/>\n      </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.kumacoffee.com/products/momma-bear-new\"/>\n    </p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Coffee storage</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Going to a cafe isn’t always an option though, especially if you’re miles deep in the wilderness. For those times, you’ll want to rely on either pre-ground or whole beans in an airtight container. I’ve had success using a small mason jar with an airtight lid. Durable, washable, reusable.</p>\n<p>Some travel containers like the Fellow Atmos offer a vacuum-seal feature, but I’ve tested my mason jar against dozens of vacuum sealed containers, and honestly I can’t taste a difference unless I let the coffee sit for three to four days, unopened. As long as you open your mason jar every couple days, you shouldn’t get any flavor issues. So for our purposes here, I just find a mason jar to be the easiest, cheapest, and most versatile pick by far.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Ball 8 oz</strong>\n      <strong> mason jars, 12-pack</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1771840&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FBall-Glass-Mason-Jar-w-Lid-Band-Regular-Mouth-8-Ounces-12-Count%2F14234954\"/>\n    </p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Hario Skerton Plus Hand Grinder</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>If you’re traveling with whole beans and want that fresh-ground flavor every time, you’ll need a grinder that’s compact and reliable. I recommend the <strong>Hario Skerton Plus</strong>. It’s the perfect size to pair with an Aeropress, and its ceramic burrs grind consistently without overheating your beans. It fits in your hand, packs easily and gets the job done, whether you’re camping or posted up in a hotel room.<strong>Hario Skerton Plus Hand Grinder</strong></p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1771840&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zokacoffee.com%2Fproducts%2Fhario-skerton-plus-ceramic-coffee-mill\"/>\n    </p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Fellow Stagg EKG Electric Kettle</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>If you’ll have access to power, the <strong>Fellow Stagg EKG</strong> is my go-to travel kettle. It’s sleek, quick-heating, and insulated well enough to keep your water hot for close to an hour. The gooseneck spout gives you precise control for brewing, and the compact body fits into a carry-on without issue. I often pack my Aeropress inside the kettle itself, then stash the whole bundle in my suitcase.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/16/how-to-brew-coffee-on-the-go\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Francine turned to sex work to survive soon after she arrived alone at Malawi’s Dzaleka refugee camp in 2015, having travelled there from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/burundi\">Burundi</a>.</p>\n<p>On Christmas Eve in 2022, a client refused to pay. When she blocked the doorway, he grabbed a boiling-hot saucepan of beans and threw it at her, scalding her hand and chest.</p>\n<p>Life for refugees in Malawi has become much more difficult, with funding cuts by international donors resulting in most eating just once a day. At the same time, the chances of relocation to countries in the west have been reduced from small to remote after the US stopped accepting refugees (apart from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/a-godsend-the-white-afrikaners-lining-up-to-accept-trumps-offer-of-asylum\">white South Africans</a> that US officials <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/08/trump-cuts-aid-to-south-africa-over-racial-discrimination-against-afrikaners\">falsely claimed</a> were facing “white genocide”.</p>\n<p>Since 2021, the UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR, has proposed almost 9,000 people as candidates for resettlement. Of those, 3,703 left <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/malawi\">Malawi</a>, 80% of them to the US. This year, just 450 refugees are expected to relocate – to Australia, Canada and New Zealand.</p>\n<p>After being abandoned by her mother, Francine lived in Burundi with an uncle involved in politics, who was gunned down in 2014. She injured herself escaping through a window, and still shakes and twitches as she recalls the gunshots.</p>\n<p>Haunted by her trauma, the 29-year-old mother of children aged two and nine believes her life would be at risk if she returned to Burundi and wonders why she has never been considered for relocation.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes I see other people going, who are in good health, but … I am staying behind. I feel so much pain,” Francine says through an interpreter, a fellow refugee. “Sometimes I ask myself, ‘Why is it that I don’t get helped like others? Is it because of who I am, my health condition?’”</p>\n<p>Malawi, one of the world’s poorest countries, has a long history of hosting refugees, accepting more than 1 million from neighbouring Mozambique during its civil war from 1977 to 1992, most of whom then returned home.</p>\n<p>Dzaleka camp was built on the outskirts of the capital, Lilongwe, in 1994 to accommodate Rwandans fleeing the genocide. The densely populated camp, which has become an urban slum, was designed to host 10,000 people.</p>\n<p>Now, more than 58,000 refugees live there, says the camp manager, Gerald Chiganda. About 60% of them are from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/congo\">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> (DRC), from where up to 200 more arrive monthly.</p>\n<p>“If the trend continues like this, it means we won’t be able to sustain [the camp],” he says.</p>\n<p>Malawi’s “encampment policy” prevents refugees from legally living or working outside Dzaleka, making them especially vulnerable to funding cuts. Cash payments from the UN’s World Food Programme have been reduced to 50% of what is needed for food, about $8 (£6) for each person a month, says the WFP’s country head, Simon Denhere.</p>\n<p>The WFP says it needs $8.7m to provide Dzaleka’s residents with enough money for their food needs until next March. Denhere says the funding issues are connected to wider global donor cuts, not just the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/feb/20/how-will-trump-and-musk-freeze-on-usaid-affect-millions-around-world\">Trump administration slashing US aid</a> this year.</p>\n<p>Last year, the US contributed 59% of the UNHCR’s $8m budget for Malawi. This year, that figure was 11% of $4.8m and the UNHCR, which has handed the camp school and hospital to Malawi’s government to run, is cutting its 44 staff to three.</p>\n<p>The economic pressures have led to a rise in sex work, domestic violence cases and children stealing, says Anne*, a Rwandan refugee who in May lost her job working on cases of domestic violence due to the funding cuts.</p>\n<p>Anne, a mother of seven, still volunteers and estimates that she sees four to six victims of domestic violence a week, double the number of two years ago. “The cases have been too high,” she says.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/16/refugees-camp-malawi-dzaleka-aid-unhcr-sex-work-domestic-violence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

At upwards of 4 g’s, the human heart struggles to pump blood; you should experience this for no more than two seconds, per the standards for rides in the U.S. “The time is very important here because you don’t want people graying out or maybe even blacking out,” Daniel Schoppen, a roller-coaster designer with the firm Intamin, which has built attractions for Universal’s parks, told me. “This is not enjoyment.

    "body": "<h2>A Smithsonian ecologist is trying to restore the plant, Spiranthes delitescens, which grows on Arizona’s sky islands</h2>\n<p>At first glance, the orchid might seem like just another green wisp among the grass. Known to botanists as <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/media/canelo-hills-ladies-tresses\">Canelo Hills ladies’ tresses</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/species/reclusive-ladys-tresses-spiranthes-delitescens\">reclusive lady’s tresses</a>, or <i>Spiranthes delitescens</i>, the plants’ stems grow up to a foot and a half tall and are dotted with tiny spikelike flowers. But these orchids don’t grow in just any fields. Canelo Hills ladies’ tresses are imperiled plants that pop up only in habitats so isolated by their elevation that naturalists call them “<a href=\"https://azstateparks.com/sky-islands\">sky islands</a>.”</p>\n<p>Because they are tied to specific environments, these orchids have always been rare. Now, their numbers are dwindling. Out of five locations in which <i>Spiranthes delitescens </i>has historically been found, she notes, the orchid is presently known to exist at only two, both in southern Arizona. To flourish again, the orchid needs help from humans and other organisms, including microscopic fungi, range cattle and specially trained dogs. Ecologist <a href=\"https://serc.si.edu/staff/melissa-mccormick/mccormickm6122002\">Melissa McCormick</a> of the <a href=\"https://serc.si.edu/\">Smithsonian Environmental Research Center</a> and the <a href=\"https://northamericanorchidcenter.org/\">North American Orchid Conservation Center</a> is among the scientists working to help the orchids recover.</p>\n<p>Part of the challenge in assisting Canelo Hills ladies’ tresses is where they grow. Named for the Canelo Hills Cienega Preserve, a <a href=\"https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/where-we-work/united-states/arizona/stories-in-arizona/canelo-hills-cienega/\">Nature Conservancy wetland</a> ecosystem intended to give them more places to take root, the orchid is found around rare water sources fed by springs in desert rock or in areas that otherwise are consistently moist enough for the plants. The habitats occur only in elevated locations above the desert floor, similar in composition but isolated from one another.</p>\n<p><i>Spiranthes delitescens</i>, Canelo Hills ladies’ tresses orchid Eirini Pajak</p>\n<p>But moisture is only one of the orchid’s requirements. McCormick says that all orchids need associations with specific fungi. These fungal networks in the soil provide orchids with the nutrients they need to grow—an extremely close relationship that the plant maintains from seed through the rest of its life.</p>\n<p>Canelo Hills ladies’ tresses are particularly fussy about that relationship. “This orchid is very specific,” McCormick says. “It just needs one fungus and only one fungus species.” And that fungus is extremely difficult to find. She and her colleagues can’t just peek into the soil and see whether it’s present. This fungus, a species of <i>Tulasnella</i>, is detectable only through DNA sampled from the soil.</p>\n<p><br/>\nThe fungus is present in the two locations where the orchid grows. Both places are on privately owned cattle ranches. When the cows graze in these habitats, they trample other forms of vegetation and create hoofprints in the soil. Those hoofprints collect water, McCormick explains, which helps nourish the orchid and allows it to flower when the cattle are not present on the ranch. “It works just fine as long as the orchids are not flowering when the cows are there,” she says.</p>\n<p>Part of McCormick’s ongoing goal, however, is to find other locations where <i>Spiranthes delitescens </i>can grow. “While current populations are found only on private lands, it would be promising to see the species expand to public lands in the future,” says the Nature Conservancy’s stewardship program director, Erin Creekmur. Being able to easily study the orchid population on land dedicated to wildlife maintenance will help ensure the long-term survival of a species that, because of its stringent growing needs, has never been especially numerous.</p>\n<p>These mountain ranges are elevated above the surrounding desert in the southeast area of the state. The orchid species <i>Spiranthes delitescens</i> grows in the rare wetlands of the sky island region.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/this-rare-endangered-orchid-only-exists-in-two-locations-can-dogs-cows-and-fungi-help-it-thrive-180987340/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>When it comes to nostalgic <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/pumpkin-desserts/\">fall desserts</a>, nothing beats a classic, easy apple crumble. Warm and comforting, it’s the ultimate pairing of sweet spiced apples with a buttery, crumbly topping. Add a scoop of ice cream on top and—<i>chef’s kiss</i>—perfection.</p>\n<p>Having tossed together quite a few crumbles in my day, I thought it was about time to share my ultimate apple crumble recipe. While an ode to the classic, I take a few steps to maximize flavor and make this the most delicious apple crumble ever. Trust me, you’ll be making this recipe all season long.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=apple crumble&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/food/the-easiest-apple-crumble-just-6-ingredients/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-crumble-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Easy Apple Crumble Ingredients</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Apples.</strong>Granny Smiths are my go-to—their tart bite balances the crumble’s sweetness beautifully.</li>\n      <li><strong>Lemon.</strong>Just a squeeze brightens everything up.</li>\n      <li><strong>Spices.</strong>Cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, a splash of vanilla… use what you have, but don’t skip them—they bring all the warmth.</li>\n      <li><strong>Maple syrup.</strong>Adds richness and a deeper sweetness that pairs perfectly with the apples.</li>\n      <li><strong>Brown sugar.</strong>A little for the filling, a little more for the crumble.</li>\n      <li><strong>White sugar.</strong>Like in a classic chocolate chip cookie, the mix of brown and white sugar gives the crumble the perfect texture.</li>\n      <li><strong>Oats.</strong>Rolled oats add that rustic, hearty crunch I love.</li>\n      <li><strong>Pecans.</strong>Totally optional, but I can’t resist the extra crunch.</li>\n      <li><strong>Salt.</strong>A pinch makes every flavor pop.</li>\n      <li><strong>Butter.</strong>Brown it if you can—it takes the flavor to another level.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=easy apple crumble&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/food/the-easiest-apple-crumble-just-6-ingredients/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/easy-apple-crumble-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Easy Apple Crumble, Step by Step</h2>\n<p><strong>First things first: brown the butter. </strong>You’ll know it’s ready when it goes from popping and bubbling to quiet and golden—just keep an eye on it so it doesn’t burn. Let it cool completely, then pop it in the fridge (or freezer) to solidify before adding it to the crumble topping. Trust me, the flavor is unmatched.</p>\n<p><strong>Next up: the apples.</strong> I tested this recipe a few ways—chopped, thin slices, and thicker wedges. The winner? Thick wedges. They keep their shape, bake up soft, and give the best texture. That said, slice them however you like—this crumble will be delicious either way.</p>\n<p><strong>And now, the star of the show: the crumble topping.</strong> It’s basically your favorite oatmeal cookie in disguise—soft and chewy underneath, crisp and crunchy on top. Not overly sweet, it perfectly balances the tangy-sweet apples and the melty scoop of ice cream you’ll definitely want on top.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=apple crumble recipe&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/food/the-easiest-apple-crumble-just-6-ingredients/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-crumble-recipe-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Read on for the recipe—and tell us if this crumble makes it into your fall rotation.</p>\n<h2>Easy Apple Crumble</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li>Total Time: 55</li>\n      <li>Yield: 4 1x</li>\n    </ul>\n<h3>Description</h3>\n<p>A simple, cozy apple crumble that celebrates all the best flavors of fall.</p>\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\n<p>\n      <i>For the crumble:</i>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>1 stick of butter</li>\n      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour (120g)</li>\n      <li>1 cup rolled oats (90g)</li>\n      <li>1/4 cup chopped pecan (28g)</li>\n      <li>1/4 cup brown sugar (50g)</li>\n      <li>1/4 cup of granulated sugar (50g)</li>\n      <li>Big pinch of salt</li>\n      <li>1 tablespoon of cold water</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>For the apples:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>\n      <li>1–2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>\n      <li>1 tablespoon maple syrup</li>\n      <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>\n      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>\n      <li>Big pinch of grated nutmeg</li>\n      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>\n      <li>Pinch of salt</li>\n      <li>4–5 Granny Smith apples</li>\n    </ul>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/the-easiest-apple-crumble-just-6-ingredients/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>There are some meals that stay with you—and sometimes, the <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/conversation-starters/\">conversations</a> that happen around the table spark something even bigger. During our recent design trip for Casa Zuma’s<a href=\"https://casazuma.com/pages/casa-zuma-clay\"> new ceramics collection</a>, the <a href=\"https://clayimports.com/\">Clay Imports</a> team hosted us at their beautiful studio in San Miguel. One morning, over plates of smoky black beans and bright chilaquiles verdes, we also began shaping the vision for our newest dinnerware collection.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Today, I couldn’t be more excited to share both with you: the unforgettable chilaquiles recipe made by Nick (co-founder of Clay Imports), and the launch of</p>\n      <i>, our earthy, organic dinnerware handcrafted just outside San Miguel.</i>\n      <a href=\"\">Casa Zuma CLAY</a>\n    </blockquote>\n<h2>But First, Those Chilaquiles</h2>\n<p>This was no ordinary breakfast situation. These chilaquiles were bright and tangy, with a perfectly balanced heat and a rustic, hand-ground texture that made every bite feel alive. The secret? A fresh roasted salsa verde made that morning in Nick’s molcajete, using just-picked green tomatoes and blistered chiles. We sat around the table, sunlight dancing across the terracotta tiles, and savored every bite.</p>\n<p>Later that day, Nick sent me a voice memo with his “recipe”—off-the-cuff and intuitive. It felt too special not to share. (<a href=\"https://recorder.google.com/5c6dd974-250e-46eb-86bb-e243cb51cd7c\">Listen to Nick’s audio here!</a>)</p>\n<p>As Nick shared, the word <i>chilaquiles</i> (say it with me: chee-lah-KEE-les) originates from the Nahuatl language, once spoken by the Aztecs and other Indigenous peoples across Mexico. <i>Chili</i> means peppers, and <i>quilitl</i> refers to greens or herbs—so together, chilaquiles loosely translates to “chiles mixed with greens.” A poetic nod to its layered, herbaceous roots.</p>\n<h3>How to Make Nick’s Chilaquiles Verdes</h3>\n<p>Here are the basics:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Start with tomatillos, a jalapeño, and a poblano pepper. Char them over high heat until they’re soft, blistered, and almost collapsing in on themselves.</li>\n      <li>Toss in half a red onion for sweetness and depth, then let everything cool just enough to handle.</li>\n      <li>In a molcajete (or food processor if you don’t have one), mash the roasted ingredients with fresh garlic and sea salt until you have a chunky, vibrant salsa verde. Rustic is the goal.</li>\n      <li>Simmer the salsa in a saucepan with a splash of water until it thickens and caramelizes slightly.</li>\n      <li>Add tortilla chips—ideally homemade or a high-quality unsalted version—and gently stir to coat them in the warm salsa.</li>\n      <li>Spoon onto plates, then top with a fried egg, a spoonful of refried beans, a sprinkle of crumbly cheese, and a few slices of avocado.</li>\n      <li>Optional, but highly recommended: squash blossoms lightly sautéed in olive oil for a delicate, earthy touch. And if there’s any salsa left in the molcajete, spoon a little over your egg. You won’t regret it.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>More than the perfect blend of charred tomatillos and crunchy tortillas, what made this dish unforgettable was the way it embodied San Miguel itself: warm, soulful, and brimming with creativity. It reminded me that food doesn’t have to be fancy to be extraordinary.</p>\n<h2>From San Miguel to Your Table: Casa Zuma CLAY</h2>\n<p>That morning in San Miguel wasn’t just about food—it was about craft. Later that day, we visited the artisans who transform earth into beautiful, functional pieces. Watching their hands shape clay into something lasting and soulful reminded me that the objects we use every day—our plates, our bowls, our pitchers—carry stories with them, too.</p>\n<p>And so, <a href=\"https://casazuma.com/pages/casa-zuma-clay\">Casa Zuma CLAY</a> was born.</p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://casazuma.com/pages/casa-zuma-clay\"> Canyon Dinnerware collection</a>—dinner plate, salad plate, pasta bowl, and snack bowl—captures the same earthy organic feel that inspired us in Mexico. Each piece is handcrafted in San Miguel, with subtle variations in glaze and form that make it truly one-of-a-kind. We also crafted a few supplemental pieces that reflect our time in San Miguel: the </p>\n<p><strong>Blanco Pitcher</strong>,</p>\n<p><strong>Terra Cotta Wine Cooler,</strong>and</p>\n<p><strong>Ceramic Beverage Dispenser</strong>. Together, they create a table that feels soulful, timeless, and deeply connected to the craft of Mexico.</p>\n<p>These aren’t precious pieces to save for special occasions—they’re meant for Tuesday morning oatmeal, Saturday night dinner parties, and yes, brunch with friends when you whip up these chilaquiles verdes.</p>\n<p>Because at the heart of it all, gathering around the table is about slowing down, savoring, and remembering that the people around us matter most.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://casazuma.com/pages/casa-zuma-clay\">Shop the Casa Zuma CLAY collection here</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/recipes/breakfast/chilaquiles-verdes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It was unglamorous compared to the glossy displays you could generate using special software and pre-existing maps, stacking layers, running queries to get useful answers to important questions. But this skeletal thing <i>was</i> a map and I had made it from scratch.</p>\n<p>Just months into my first job as a lowly geographic information systems programmer, I had assembled data from old survey records, put in the mathematical equations, and written the code. And now the map told me its story. I saw surveyors lugging heavy instruments, as I had for a paper in college once; I knew each data point had been earned under the hot sun. I saw moth-eaten files in dusty archives. I saw the lay of the land, how rainwater would run off, what could be grown, what could be built, what might become.</p>\n<p>My own love of maps is rooted in that magical childhood realm where the lines between fact and fantasy blur. Vast landscapes, distant places with beautiful names, exploration, adventure, the whole romance of the thing. All that has an undeniable hold on me still, but putting together this list, I found myself drawn to essays from diverse worlds that challenge how we think about maps and mapmaking.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/maps-history-horror-vacui-art-cartography-blank-spaces?src=longreads\"> Horror vacui</a>: Empty spaces on maps were so terrifying to ancient mapmakers that they filled them with decorations, fictional landscapes, and monsters. We moderns miss the beautiful monsters, but what if they never actually disappeared? What if the monsters were always part of the map, part of mapping itself? </p>\n<p>In 1832, Radhanath Sikdar, a gifted mathematician, began his job as a sub-assistant in the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India. A monumental project undertaken by the British East India Company, it aimed to map the vast subcontinent with scientific precision—all the better for complete control. Indian “pundits” were employed to travel the land, traverse every kind of terrain, and take accurate measurements regardless of weather and work conditions. Later designated “chief computer,” Sikdar was—the Survey’s former superintendent George Everest suggested—“the cheapest instrument that Government ever could employ in a task of this kind.” He was also the first to figure out that a certain peak called “XV” was “higher than any other hitherto measured in the world.” The Royal Geographic Society promptly christened it Mount Everest, never mind the beautiful traditional names it already had in Tibetan and Nepali.</p>\n<p>Maps as instruments of power, shaping reality. Maps as systems of knowledge, refracting our understanding of the world. Maps as objects of fantasy, still charting terra incognita. If you’re ready to explore how <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2022/02/15/charting-worlds-maps-cartography?src=longreads\">cartographic knowledge</a> is constructed, consumed, and contested, welcome to the Map Room. </p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://psyche.co/ideas/what-makes-a-map-good-on-the-ethics-of-cartography?src=longreads\">What Makes a Map ‘Good’? On the Ethics of Cartography</a> (Nat Case, <i>Psyche</i>, February 2025)</h2>\n<p>In 1854, there was a massive cholera outbreak in Soho, London. Over three days, 127 people died—616 in all. At the time, cholera was thought to be spread by a certain “miasma in the air.” Dr. John Snow had his doubts. He drew up a map superimposing death statistics over geography, and pinpointed the outbreak to a single Broad Street water pump, a sewage-contaminated death vending machine. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/mar/15/john-snow-cholera-map#comment-21994038?src=longreads\">His work changed the world</a>.  </p>\n<p>Old maps. Troubling maps. Problematic maps. Maps that are demonstrably flawed. Sepia-tinted hindsight is always clear and often damning. But how do contemporary cartographers deal with ethical issues as they work on their maps <i>now</i>? Maps must be technically sound, yes, Case argues, but they must also be socially and morally conscious if they are not to become complicit in harm to lands and communities. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/09/16/reading-list-fascination-with-maps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The airport smelled of burning when Iruka Akintola arrived, but as she stepped off the airstair she saw no source for it. Her phone rang, a steady hum that she ignored. A thinnish woman with a small frame, Iruka chucked her scarf around her neck and bent into her armoured SUV, one of six in a convoy.</p>\n<p>‘Okay,’ she said, and the driver pulled away.</p>\n<p>Slowly, the car dipped into the potholes that covered the sandy brown roads. Outside, children lined the roadside begging for alms. Iruka watched them with a detached effort. Amid the heat, the traffic, the noise of motorcycles, and the endless phone calls, Iruka chose to watch the children, focusing on a slender girl with a long neck. The girl looked like a horse, Iruka thought. She also looked, vaguely, like Uchenna, her other daughter.</p>\n<p>Iruka was headed home. Or more precisely, to her second husband’s home, the colonial-style mansion with the green turrets where he had grown up. Usually, she didn’t care for such architecture, but she loved him, and had, over time, come to love all he loved, idolize all he adored, including Uchenna. Especially Uchenna. That needy child who from birth cried without cease. As a teen facing menarche, Uchenna threatened to lock herself in her room until Iruka returned from a summit in Oslo. But Iruka was never going to abandon Oslo. So her new husband stepped in, phoning Iruka to detail how he managed it, how he supervised Uchenna as she bathed because she insisted. The news gave Iruka a small heart attack, guilt gnawing at her for minutes. But she named it nothing, choosing instead to love this man who had become a father to her daughters and, surprisingly, to love Uchenna even more, with all her excess needs.</p>\n<p>Her phone kept vibrating, a stubborn buzz she ignored.</p>\n<p>‘Madam, are you there?’ The driver asked.</p>\n<p>‘Where else will I be, Erastus?’ Her tone was soft. She wanted to sound hopeful. Hope: the belief that a stable tomorrow would come if today were lived with measured calmness. She was a woman committed to good manners and rigid routines. Nothing vexed her more than dramatics or hysterics – such things belonged in the cinema.</p>\n<p>Erasmus, with the convoy, passed sleek cars and rickety ones, stone pillars, the manicured gardens of Goshen Estate, and the towering All Saints Anglican Cathedral. They curved off a road fringed with trimmed shrubs, then onto a long street with a cobblestone path, the car jerking over bumps.</p>\n<p>Less than half an hour later, Erasmus cruised into the driveway of the white house. Iruka looked up at the turrets, and the sight filled her with anger rather than relief. Nothing had changed. Except for the net stretched across the tennis court, now caked in red dust, everything else was just as she’d left it five months ago.</p>\n<p>‘Don’t drive in yet.”</p>\n<p>‘Madam?’ Erasmus sounded surprised.</p>\n<p>‘Drive around more. Thanks.’</p>\n<p>Erasmus reversed, and then asked, ‘Sorry Madam but – to where?’</p>\n<p>Iruka did not answer. In her thirties, she had expected life to reveal its masterplan. But here she was at sixty-one still groping in the dark, dodging calls from her daughters and seeking comfort from her driver, a man with insufficient expectations, a man with no expectation beyond the day ahead.</p>\n<p>‘Madam, you really do not want me to go in?’</p>\n<p>‘This man,’ Iruka sighed. ‘Erastus, please do not choose today to be dumb. Drive around a bit more is the instruction. Obey! Thanks.’ Irrespective of how she felt, Iruka felt that she should say the necessary words with measured exactness.</p>\n<p>‘Yes, Madam. My apologies.’ Erasmus bowed his head, then signaled the rest of the convoy over the radio before taking a different road. They passed a secondary school – one of those elegant ones named after a British figure.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/trying-times/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>\n      <strong>I’m a woman in my </strong>\n      <strong> </strong>\n      <strong>50s and have been with my husband for decades. We have always had a wonderful sex life and I used to be able to climax vaginally very easily, often without clitoral stimulation. During an eventful time for the family</strong>\n      <strong> </strong>\n      <strong>a couple of years ago, my libido and ability to climax disappeared, </strong>\n      <strong>though they did eventually return</strong>\n      <strong>. A few months ago, I had a health crisis, which has slightly impaired my co</strong>\n      <strong>ordination on one side. Although I have recovered very well, I am again experiencing a loss of libido and sexual sensation.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>We continue to have sex regularly and I enjoy the intimacy. I can climax </strong>\n      <strong>with clitoral stimulation but it takes a long time and can be almost physically painful. I really miss vaginal orgasms and the release they brought. Although I am of perimenopausal age, I have no obvious symptoms and a </strong>\n      <strong>hormone test came back normal.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>I have felt very emotionally vulnerable and frustrated during my convalescence</strong>\n      <strong>, so </strong>\n      <strong>I’m wondering whether stress is the problem. My self-esteem has been </strong>\n      <strong>affected by my physical disability, but my kind, patient husband always makes me feel desired.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Stress is known to affect a person’s sexuality at various stages, including desire, orgasmic ability and physical arousal. Fatigue and pain can also be culprits, as can many types of physical illnesses or conditions. Psychological issues or mood disorders such as depression and anxiety may also affect a person’s ability to experience pleasure in sex, interrupt the lovemaking process and even lead to sexual disorders.</p>\n    <p>The health issues you have been experiencing could have affected your ability to orgasm as you used to, so it would be worth asking a doctor to check for factors such as nerve damage – and also help you understand the possible sexual side-effects of any medications you may be taking. I can understand your sadness and sense of loss at being unable to experience your preferred type of climax, but if you can find and address the specific reason, that may become possible again.</p>\n    <p>Since the clitoris is the most important pleasure centre in most women’s bodies – and “vaginal orgasms” tend to occur when positioning allows for optimum clitoral connection – it would be worth trying different positions to engage your clitoris for maximum effect. But first, prioritise finding tools to handle your stress and start implementing them.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to</p><a href=\"mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com\">private.lives@theguardian.com</a>(please don’t send attachments).

Like unwrapping an edible present, the smell hits you before anything else, which in this case is fennel, thyme and lemon. It is a delicate way to cook fish, so the sauce needs to have some character, and basil, olives and lemon with a slick of olive oil make a beautiful, late-summer seasoning. Round off the feast with a blackberry and crisp almond pastry slice that tastes all the better if you forage your own fruit.</p>\n<h2>Cod with courgettes, green olives and lemon (pictured top)</h2>\n<p>The sharp acidity of the lemon and olive herb salsa is stunning with the gently baked fish.</p>\n<p>Prep <strong>15 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>1 hr</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>4</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1 large fennel bulb</strong>,<strong> </strong>trimmed and thinly sliced (using a mandoline, if you have one)<strong>3 shallots</strong>,<strong> </strong>peeled and thinly sliced<strong>2 tbsp olive oil\n  Sea salt</strong></p>\n<p>\n      <strong>and</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>black pepper<br/>1 large cod fillet</strong>(600-700g)</p>\n<p>1 large cod fillet</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>, green or yellow<br/>3 courgettes</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>3 courgettes</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 lemon<br/>2 tbsp butter<br/></strong>\n    </p>\n<p>2 tbsp butter</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>For the salsa<br/></strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>1 lemon</strong>,</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>thinly sliced</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>75g green olives</strong>, pitted and chopped</p>\n<p><strong>1 handful picked fresh flat-leaf parsley,</strong>roughly chopped, plus extra to serve</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>roughly chopped, plus extra to serve<br/>1 handful picked fresh basil,</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>1 handful picked fresh basil,</p>\n<p>\n      <strong><br/>1 tsp honey<br/>2 tsp sherry vinegar</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>1 tsp honey</p>\n<p>2 tsp sherry vinegar</p>\n<p>Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put the fennel and shallots in a bowl, toss with two tablespoons of oil and season generously.</p>\n<p>Lay a large sheet of baking paper on a baking sheet. Put the oiled veg into the centre, fold over the sides of the paper to cover, then bake for 15 minutes. Unwrap and stir the vegetables, then cover again and bake for another eight to 10 minutes, by which time the vegetables should be translucent and fragrant.</p>\n<p>Unwrap the parcel again, lay the fish on top of the vegetables and season well. Thinly slice the courgettes and lemon and arrange on top of the fish, then season and dot over the butter. Wrap the parcel back up and bake for 15-20 minutes, until the fish is opaque and flaky.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, make the salsa. Char the lemon slices in a hot, dry pan until they’re starting to blacken and caramelise, then remove and roughly chop, peel and all. Transfer to a small bowl, add the chopped olives, herbs, honey and vinegar, and stir. Taste, and add more salt, honey or a dash of vinegar, if need be, to balance the flavours.</p>\n<p>Once the fish is cooked, baste it with the juices from the package, then cut into four. Serve the fish and veg on warmed plates, topped with the salsa and a sprinkling of fresh herbs. This is lovely served with boiled potatoes to soak up all those flavours.</p>\n<h2>Blackberry and almond slice</h2>\n<p>The almond pastry is crisp and delicious, the insides wonderfully chewy and dense.

    "body": "<p>Reviewed by Brian Watson</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/4094/9781595343185\"/>The chance to review a memoir is an incredible gift. In the past year alone, I’ve been lucky to write reviews for some of my favorite authors, including Jeremy Atherton Lin, Lester Fabian Brathwaite, Edmund White, and Melissa Febos.<graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cover-of-how-the-hell-did-I-not-know-that-lucie-frost.png\" alt=\"cover of how the hell did I not know that lucie frost; subtitle, &quot;my midlife year from couch to curiosity&quot; is written in cursive around a pink couch\"/></p>\n<p>But then an even rarer gift drops into your review pile: the opportunity to review something written by a friend. I first met Lucie Frost during a writing workshop several years ago and immediately followed her on Instagram.</p>\n<p>In many ways, <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/4094/9781595343185\"> How the Hell Did I Not Know That? My Midlife Year from Couch to Curiosity</a> (Trinity University Press; 2025) informed Lucie’s online presence. She cleverly selected excerpts from her memoir and crafted stories and reels from them. This approach works really well for one key reason: Her storytelling style makes the viewer want to hear more and </p>\n<p><i>read more</i>.</p>\n<p>In the early pages of the memoir, the reader discovers Lucie’s impetus for learning all the things she shares within those pages. It starts at a writing conference helmed by two powerhouse memoirists: Cheryl Strayed and Elizabeth Gilbert. As Lucie attends, she is struck by a key message, one she paraphrases:</p>\n<p>\n      <i>“Deep down, you know what you need. This is your Clarity talking to you, and you should trust that inner voice, embracing the truth in you more strongly than the fear in you. You can’t get to any deeper truth or meaning in you without being open to hearing the first truth. One truth leads to another, which leads to another. Your job is simply to put the key in the door.”</i>\n    </p>\n<p>After a writing exercise designed to expose that Clarity, together with a glass or two of Cabernet Sauvignon, Lucie makes a bold decision; she quits her job. (I feel you, Lucie. I think the reason I avoid psilocybin is my resistance to whatever life-changing prompts, whatever Clarity might result.)</p>\n<p>The narrative arc of <i>How The Hell Did I Not Know That?</i>, therefore, is how in the hell did Lucie make it after her impromptu retirement with nary a plan. Although she begins her new life glued to her couch, watching bad reality television (although I can’t judge—I have watched every last episode of <i>Canada’s Worst Driver</i>), a decision quickly arrives. “While I’m watching television, I’m going to put my key in the door of curiosity by noticing any little thing I’d like to know more about.”</p>\n<p>Lucie goes on to offer twelve more chapters, one for each month of her journey into knowledge, each with a dedicated direction for her curiosity. She learns more about animals, humans, her native Texas and beyond, religion, and much more. What makes this journey so much more than an encyclopedia of trivia, however, is the author’s (spoken and written) voice. As an Instagram follower, I couldn’t help but read her words in her twang. Doing so, for me, at least, makes her writing, complete with her asides and revelations, even funnier. Let me share some examples:</p>\n<p>\n      <i>“In their raw form, sorghums look like pale pellets, similar to kernels of corn or small white beans. (The plural really is sorghums. It looks weird, doesn’t it? The whole word is weird, if you look at it long enough. Sorg-hums.)”</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>“Ironman basically started as a dick-measuring contest.”</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>“Since the exercise month — the body in motion — didn’t take, perhaps focusing on the body at rest is a better idea. I hope you enjoy this knowledge of body. (Get it? Knowledge of body? Instead of body of knowledge? I’m hilarious.)”</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>“Garlic does contain allicin (the liquid that makes garlic smell like garlic), which is an antifungal. But the scientific consensus is that allicin is only released if the garlic is crushed, so inserting the whole clove is useless and risks contaminating your hoo-ha (le hoo-ha) with soil bacteria.”</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/09/review-how-the-hell-did-i-not-know-that-my-midlife-year-from-couch-to-curiosity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Wildfires in Canada are responsible for this haze, which obscures buildings in the distance that I typically take for granted as integral parts of my view. The haze, which last summer I might have shrugged off as a minor inconvenience, hits me differently now after reading River Selby’s debut memoir <graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image1-9.png\" alt=\"cover of Hotshot: A Life on Fire by River Selby; picture of the author in fire gear in front of flames\"/></p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/4094/9780802149497\">(Atlantic Monthly Press; August 2025)</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>The book follows Selby’s journey as a hotshot firefighter in the western United States in the early 2000s. They describe their past as well as their experience as a hotshot within scenes; this is punctuated by lyrical descriptions of ecology, American history, fire science, public policy, and their own body as it transforms under immense physical strain. The result is an engaging researched memoir that is cinematic, meditative, and profoundly intimate.</p>\n<p>A “hotshot firefighter” is one of the most elite American wildland firefighter positions. Hotshots are subjected to grueling physical fitness regimes in addition to specialized training to prepare them for the most difficult, remote, and complicated wildfires (the name “hotshot” refers to the fact that they are often sent to the hottest sections of a raging inferno). Despite their revered yet hazardous labor, hotshots were not considered “real” firefighters until 2022 and for many years they were not offered health insurance since it was considered “seasonal” work (this has changed, particularly as climate change has extended the traditional fire season).</p>\n<p>Wildland firefighting in <i>Hotshot</i> is a brutal endeavour, one that often goes unseen and underappreciated. Throughout the memoir, Selby weaves their personal history as a hotshot in with narrative strands of environmental and colonialist history, which they argue is inextricable from the work of firefighting as it exists today. The history of fire in North America is the history of so many larger forms of systemic oppression, ones which Selby struggles with intensely throughout the book: environmentalism and climate change; the suppression of indigenous ecological wisdom; colonialism and manifest destiny; plus the desire to dominate and control the natural world.</p>\n<p>Despite the arduous labor, however, firefighting is immensely attractive to Selby. They describe themself at this time as someone gravitating towards intensity, both physical and mental. “I had never considered being gentle with myself or realized I was punishing myself,” they write, though by the time the reader encounters this line, Selby’s fortitude and strength have long since been made apparent. Pushing themself was, as Selby describes, more akin to self-penalization in the wake of childhood trauma, shame, and hardship. Selby’s inclination to challenge themself physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually, however, came at enormous cost. From hiking to clearing brush to hauling gear up mountains to extinguishing embers buried beneath the ground, Selby’s narrator may be tender towards nature, but far less tender towards themself.</p>\n<p>One way in which hotshots attempt to control wildfires is through controlled burning. But this idea of the controlled burn — a preventative measure — is one that has also been abused throughout American history by white settlers, to the detriment of the natural world. Selby’s own relationship to the land as well as the idea of a controlled burn is a complicated one. But ultimately, it serves as a means to cleanse both the soil and themself.</p>\n<p>Selby leverages history throughout the book to underscore the cyclical nature of healing, harm, and regeneration within nature and within ourselves over time. Controlled burns were once used by indigenous people to live in harmony with the land itself. White settlers, however, oftentimes saw fire as a violent threat against their homes and businesses.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/09/review-hotshot-a-life-on-fire-by-river-selby-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The book includes deities and mythical figures from the Christian tradition, Greek and Roman gods, Norse myth and Arthurian legends, with the express understanding that there are many more queer gods in various pantheons worldwide.</i>\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/4094/9781401978525\">(Hay House; 2025)</a>\n    <i>Queer Devotion: Spirituality Behind the Binary in Myth, Story and Practice</i>\n    <p>While it deals with historical representations of gods and goddesses, <i>Queer Devotion </i>also connects to modern day religions and the continued discrimination against queer people. Notably, Burgess examines the 2024 <i>Dignitas Infinita </i>declaration from the Vatican that purports that all human beings have dignity, but also asserts that IVF, surrogacy, gender reassignment surgery and living as a trans person are ‘grave violations.’ Burgess further examines how religion has been used for centuries to demonize and torture queer people, from the persecution of Joan of Arc to her canonization by the same Church that executed her, to how Norse gods like Loki and Odin have been coopted by Neo Nazi and white supremacist groups.</p>\n    <p>Despite these real and concerning developments, Burgess devotes the majority of the book to an expansive affirmation of queerness. They look at the changing artistic and written portrayals of gods and goddesses like Aphrodite and Dionysus, who can be connected to Mother Mary and Jesus, respectively. Ultimately, the consolidation of religious doctrine stifled differing opinions – such is what happened with the Gnostic Gospels, and the Gospels of St. Thomas and Mary Magdalene, all more lenient and liberal in their interpretations of Christ’s teachings. Burgess’s writing is very validating, and they include examples of their own religious practices to give the reader ideas. Burgess emphasizes that “[w]e must forget what we’ve learned to remember what we know.” If everyone is made in the image of God, is then God not queer? Trans? Nonbinary?</p>\n    <p>With the wide range of traditions consulted, from actual historical figures to mythical ones, the book allows the reader to reclaim this heritage for themselves as they see fit. As someone who grew up Catholic but has since distanced themselves from the Church, I found the notion that I did not need to accept the Church’s depiction of God and could create my own to be deeply touching.</p>\n    <p>Every chapter has the same structure: there is an examination of the deity and their connection to queerness, followed by journal prompts and ritual suggestions. <i>Queer Devotions </i>also has an appendix including modified versions of the major Christian prayers, if the reader wishes to use them. Burgess emphasizes throughout the book that they are offering suggestions; it is up to the reader to personalize their religious practice and decide what’s right for them.</p>\n    <p>By examining the historical depictions of gods and goddesses, Burgess proves once and for all that the gods have always been queer. The book is an affirming read for queer people who might find themselves distanced from organized religion, and yet still wish to develop a relationship with the Divine. As Burgess says as they close the book, “We’ve always been here, and we’ve always been queer, and we’ve always been divine. Hail Holy Queer.”</p>\n    <p><graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image2-2.jpg\" alt=\"Marissa Gallerani\"/><i>The Harvard Review Online</i>, the public’s radio, and The Financial Diet, among others.

Equal parts memoir and Mitchell biography, Lisicky uses the folk legend’s song writing and personal struggles to help himself and the reader better understand significant moments in his life.</p>\n<p>One of the most noteworthy moments Lisicky discusses is his transition from songwriter to prose writer. As a songwriter himself, he finds solace and clarity in both his own writings and in Mitchell’s. Together Lisicky and Mitchell forge a life engulfed in appreciation for the power of language that aids in his newfound love of prose.</p>\n<p>Regarding his transition from songwriting to fiction, Lisicky writes, “[…] Deep down under my skin, I knew it wasn’t as far as it seemed. Novels and short stories lived on the other side of the room, though some would say, <i>Oh no</i>, and offer their pronouncements.” Lisicky’s transition to fiction writing mirrors Micthell’s other artistic pursuits like painting. To overcome his doubts as a writer, Lisicky uses this parallel of being songwriters who share other artistic outlets to help him find the musicality, fluidity, and freedom in language’s many forms.</p>\n<p>Music as its own language is a clear thread throughout <i>Song So Wild and Blue</i>. Lisicky observes:</p>\n<p><i>Music is water: I understand it to be so in that it breaks down levels; it equalizes. Once anyone is inside music, there isn’t a boss of it; the listener means as much as the players. And we aren’t ourselves anymore, not quite, with our usual heaviness and dashed hopes. If anything, it makes us lighter, buoyant. We float. </i></p>\n<p>Music as an equalizer that ebbs and flows, forming a bond with the listener has as much to do with the melody and instruments as it has to do with the written notes and words. The poetics and storytelling that lift listeners in music and form metaphors, themes, and imagery equally hold their weight and importance in other written forms such as prose. Floating on the musicality of songwriting starts as a way for Lisicky to analyze, understand, and appreciate Mitchell’s greatest hits and deep cuts, but it quickly evolves into a life raft, guiding his understanding of his own writings and journey as a writer, musician, educator, and editor.</p>\n<p>On the subject of music and language Lisicky continues, “Music offered polarity. Music made sure the song wouldn’t be received in one direction but several.” The freedom music offers is freedom that reverberates in language. Music’s polarity is an echo of the novel’s choose your own adventure; it is an echo of the personal experience in reader response; it is an echo of the author’s lived experience; it is an echo in the stark contrast of a soliloquy; it is an echo of the polarity of poetic form and content; and foremost it is an echo of language’s contractions.</p>\n<p>Music’s polarity reaffirms language’s polarity and contractions and vice versa. Lisicky discusses language’s polarity:</p>\n<p><i>Language is unruly; language wants to mean ten things at once. That’s exactly what I found compelling about it. By contending with the process that unnerved me, I was making sure it didn’t dominate the person I tried to be. It was always steaming ahead of me, and it was my job to catch up.</i></p>\n<p>Like music, language is compelling because of its contradictions and juxtapositions. For a writer of any genre or form, language’s rowdiness can either steamroll you or you can use it to create and think innovatively.</p>\n<p><i>Song So Wild and Blue </i>is innovative because of its ability to see Mitchell’s unique and juxtaposing key changes and chord progressions, as well as her unique imagery and diction in some of her biggest hits like “The Circle Game,” “A Case of You,” “Free Man in Paris,” and “Both Sides Now” as a reflection of the Lisicky’s own unique relationship to the written word and his life.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/09/review-song-so-wild-and-blue-a-life-with-the-music-of-joni-mitchell-by-paul-lisicky/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Norton, July 2025) is their solution to the traditionally taught formulaic-style of writing. You know them as “The Hero’s Journey,” or ABCDE (action, backstory, conflict, development, end), or something about saving the cat. I get it. Formulas are tidy. A + B.</p><p>Nothing about writing is tidy. Not when you’re following deep lines of inquiry. Or your familial lines, for example. I am trying to understand not just the ‘who beget whom,’ genealogy, but the<i> stories</i> behind the tombstones. I yearn to follow my ancestors into trouble and joy, perch on the rail of their front porch, and peer into their living rooms. Am I writing historical fiction? Memoir? Poetry? That’s one of the ‘research questions’ <i>The Lab</i> asks.</p><p>“The goal isn’t to force you to adopt a genre you don’t feel comfortable with or suited to,” write Davison and LaPlant, in <i>The Lab</i>, “but to identify and learn techniques that writing in different genres frequently practice.” What connects obsession to writing isn’t genre, it’s loyalty to what is urgent.</p><p>When I described the great-grandmother project to writer friends, three agreed: historical fiction. Another encouraged something about the process of uncovering my great-grandmother’s life, so narrative non-fiction? Memoir? A final suggestion was, “maybe poetry?”</p><p>What makes a poem a poem? Can I interject poetic methods and elements into this…<i>thing</i> I’m writing? This experiment? What is the line between fact and made-up things? How can we traverse it? <i>Should</i> we traverse it?</p><p>Within <i>The Lab</i>, Davison and LaPlant refer to writing exercises as ‘experiments.’</p><p>Readers/writers/scientists will find something like 90, tucked within ten robust chapters and 450 pages. This is a hearty reference guide, a study in craft, a pep talk, an instructional manual, and good for all writers of all levels; it’s quite literally everything Davison and LaPlant have been obsessing over their entire writing and teaching career.</p><p>Because this great-grandmother fixation knocked loudly, begging to become something artful, a book of some kind, I felt desperate to choose a container. Or did I? Davison and LaPlant suggest discovering or deepening what needs to be said by just ‘getting something on the page.’ The entire premise of <i>The Lab </i>is based on the desire to create. How fitting for a creative work investigating ancestors and their descendants? How true and right to combine my obsession with their lives, which through the alchemy of time, place, and love, created me, a vessel for their stories? Not because I <i>wanted</i> to be avant-garde, or defiant, or artful, I chose to work past known forms into something else, something hybrid. The goal, at least for me, was to follow the pattern of discovery while musing-over-the-facts of ancestry. Ancestry and writing, after all, are forms of creation.</p><p>Maybe the idea is to supersede expectations, to generate fire. Those obsessions—be they personal, aesthetic, intellectual, emotional—are present for a reason. They are not to be dampened or managed, but pursued relentlessly, glimmering in the ether, sparking our creativity, cracking open new horizons.</p><graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Headshot-Anri-Wheeler-e1682895185284-500x500.jpeg\" alt=\"Anri Wheeler\"/><h3>Anri Wheeler</h3>Reviewer<p>Anri Wheeler is a multiracial writer, antiracist educator, and mother to three strong daughters.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Reviewed by Kris Wessel</p>\n    <p><i/>(Riverhead Books, September 2025) is a raw, vulnerable memoir that dives deep into Elizabeth Gilbert’s personal reckoning with addiction, grief, and spiritual transformation. Known for </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image1-4.png\" alt=\"cover of All the Way to the River: Love, Loss, and Liberation by Elizabeth Gilbert; illustration of straight colorful lines that then turn into mixing, like paint blending\"/>\n    <p><i>Eat, Pray, Love</i>, Gilbert returns not in a phase of expansion or joy — but in collapse. The book reads more like a private journal than a traditional memoir: unpolished, nonlinear, and intensely personal. At times it’s almost too raw to bear, but that’s also what makes it so powerful.</p>\n    <p>Gilbert’s honesty about sex and love addiction is rare. She writes openly about chasing partners, losing herself in relationships, and confusing desire with self-worth. Her words don’t hold back, especially when she describes the desperate need to feel alive through someone else. “What we commonly call an ‘addict,’” she writes, “is just an exaggerated version of all of us—just a person so desperately in search of relief from the sting of life that they will use anything (or anyone) to soothe it.”</p>\n    <p>That line hit me like a tuning fork, sounding out something I’d always felt but never named. It’s one of the many moments where Gilbert gently dissolves the boundary between addict and non-addict, inviting the reader to see compulsive behavior as a universal human response to pain.</p>\n    <p>The memoir doesn’t follow a clean arc of recovery or closure. Instead, it captures the emotional whiplash of healing in real time. At times, Gilbert is philosophical and tender. At others, she’s spiraling and sharp. There’s a part where she describes her partner’s cancer diagnosis in blunt, unsentimental terms, and then quickly backtracks with a burst of love and guilt. That kind of whiplash may be hard for some readers to follow, but for anyone who’s lived through grief, it feels honest.</p>\n    <p>One of the most compelling aspects of the memoir is its spiritual throughline. Gilbert writes about being visited by the ghost of her partner, Raya, with an openness that avoids sensationalism. She reflects on the idea of “Earth School,” a belief that souls choose their incarnation and relationships before entering this life, a concept rooted in shamanic and metaphysical traditions. For me, these reflections added a mystical, haunted layer to the memoir. Others may view them with disbelief, but they didn’t feel performative or forced. They felt like someone trying to stay in conversation with the mystery of life and death.</p>\n    <p>While much of the book felt carefully vulnerable, not everything landed for me. The poetry that opens many of the chapters often reads like unfiltered thoughts or spiritual affirmations. As a poet, I sometimes longed for a bit more refinement… but I also appreciated the transparency of someone working through their experience in real time. Their rawness matched the tone of the book, but they sometimes distracted from the emotional pacing of the prose.</p>\n    <p>Still, the heart of this memoir is undeniably strong. Gilbert isn’t offering a resolution. She’s offering a practice: living with discomfort, naming the truth, finding stillness in the middle of emotional noise. “The world will never arrange itself to keep an addict safe,” she writes. “We must learn to do that for ourselves.”</p>\n    <p>That line could apply to any of us trying to manage anxiety, overstimulation, heartbreak, or perfectionism. Learning to care for ourselves in a world that rarely slows down is a kind of sacred work, and this memoir doesn’t pretend it’s easy. It simply insists that it’s worth doing.</p>\n    <p><i>All the Way to the River</i> isn’t the story I expected from Elizabeth Gilbert. It isn’t tidy or triumphant. But it’s honest in a way that feels increasingly rare. In a culture that rewards resilience and image, Gilbert offers collapse, confusion, and deep spiritual hunger. And she offers them without apology.</p>\n    <p>This is not a comfortable read, but for anyone grappling with addiction, loss, or the longing to feel better, it offers a powerful, unflinching reminder that we are all broken, and that healing is possible.</p>\n    <p><graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image2-2-1024x972.jpg\" alt=\"Kris Wessel\"/><a href=\"http://writetoheal.org/\">writetoheal.org</a>.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/09/review-all-the-way-to-the-river-love-loss-and-liberation-by-elizabeth-gilbert/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Winner of the 2024 Deborah Tall Lyric Essay Book Prize, the collection of ten essays puts Morris’ reckoning with his racial identity in conversation with famous Black writers and intellectuals, seminal works of popular culture, and myriad people — friends, classmates, acquaintances, aggressors — invited and unsolicited, who have commented on his race and skin color.</p>\n<p>The son of a Black father and white mother, Morris is often seen by others to be white, leading to a persistent disconnect between the ways in which he self-identifies, and how others perceive him. This discrepancy between the expectations of others — some seeking for him to “turn up” parts of himself — and his own, fosters a pervasive feeling not being perceived in his totality. This push-pull lies at the heart of the book’s explorations, set up in its first essay “Tragic Mulatto.” Addressed to “American you,” the essay sits on the foundation of the tragic mulatto trope that Sterling A. Brown posited leads to a “divided inheritance” and Morris says can lead to “never belonging anywhere but with other mixed folks.” While exploring the ways the tragic mulatto stereotype is “both false and true,” Morris also provides the reader with an antidote, one both personal and systemic: wholeness. “This mixed half-body is a mixed whole-body. Whole. Don’t break it / into sections. See through it/it through, American you.”</p>\n<p>In “Fucked Fable” Morris intersperses quotes from luminaries Sterling A. Brown, Zora Neale Hurston, James Baldwin, and Ralph Ellison, among others, with his analyses of how their thinking plays out in moments within his own life. In addition, we are confronted with the ever-present racist comments that</p>\n<p>Morris heard from day camp, high school, college, and graduate school peers, illuminating the complicated ways Morris has metabolized his identity – filtered through the lenses and misunderstanding of others. The interjections of Brown et al deepen our understanding of the throughline from the foundational scholarship on the tragic mulatto stereotype to the everyday racism that shapes the life of Morris and all Black people in the US. The repetition of these moments showcase how banal they were in Morris’ coming of age; at the same time they remind us of the constancy of the sharp cuts repeatedly perpetrated against him. As Morris writes, quoting Andre Perry, “Even in passing he cannot transcend the pain.”</p>\n<p>The fragmentation Morris feels when it comes to his racial identity comes through in the many rhythmic tangents on which he takes his readers via anecdotes that introduce us to the people and places that have shaped him, including Virginia and Arizona, both states he has called home.</p>\n<p>In “The No Longer” and “Not the Ghost Of” Morris reflects his experience through the lens of <i>Imitation of Life</i>, a 1933 novel by Fannie Hurst, film versions of which were released in 1934 and 1959, respectively. I will admit: as a reader less familiar with the story, I found myself pulled out of the essays on numerous occasions, and also deeply appreciated how Morris used his analysis as a way to zoom out to the systemic. “I am not myself tragic, but <i>the racial gulf</i> is.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/09/review-the-tilling-by-matthew-morris/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Despite its title, this collection emphasizes perspective and connections: what draws us together, pushes us apart, or leaves us in the limbo of “between.” With its poetic road markers and satisfying twists and turns, </p>\n    <p><i>Apartness</i>keeps us looking out this window, then this one, then straight ahead, then directly into the rearview mirror of the past.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/4094/9781955969383\"/>Often, Kronenfeld’s family takes center view: a father’s near escape from Nazi Germany, a mother’s emphasis on decorum and the division between home and “street” life, the author’s childhood “in a lower-class immigrant neighborhood in the Bronx,” next to an Orthodox synagogue attended only once. Kronenfeld also wrestles with the parental, societal, and religious decisions that fill her marriage, while also modeling choice for her children.<graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image2.png\" alt=\"cover of apartness: a memoir in essays and poems by Judy Kronenfeld; illustration of three people on one side of a wall, and a solitary person on the other\"/></p>\n    <p>At times, though, choice seems an illusion, complicating the question of identity for one who describes her Jewishness as “weak as a fifth cup of tea brewed with the same tea bag.” A scholar of 17th century Metaphysical Poetry, dripping with Christianity; a lover of the Jesuit poet Gerard Manley Hopkins; and the author of <i>King Lear and the Naked Truth: Rethinking the Language of Religion and Resistance</i>, Kronenfeld examines what it’s like to be part of and separate from various faith, academic, and cultural communities, as well as those separated by language and comprehension.</p>\n    <p>She does so by expertly immersing us in experience: shopping jaunts with her mother, a trip to France where she breaks her wrist but successfully engages with the people and language, the process of being interviewed for an academic teaching job while very pregnant during the women’s rights movement of the 1970s, a conversation with a stranger at a noisy conference banquet while deaf in one ear, a late-life synagogue membership prompted by social ties and the friendship of a progressive female rabbi.</p>\n    <p>In two of her most moving chapters, “Woosh!” and “Brief Dip into Ethnicity,” Kronenfeld focuses on her father. In the former, she accompanies him to his urologist appointment, during which, due to dementia, he forgets about his prostate cancer and repeats the same queries and responses. “Oh, I didn’t know,” “And how are the children?” and “woosh!” become a powerful litany of the lost when what Kronenfeld really “want[s] to know is how exactly he left Germany in 1934.”</p>\n    <p>In “Brief Dip into Ethnicity,” Kronenfeld joins forces with her daughter to fulfill her father’s wish to be buried in a casket affixed with the Jewish star—the casket they actually chose, “realiz[ing] even if I would never wear the star—how important it had been and was that my parents wore it <i>for me</i>, even in their deaths.” Despite her best efforts, once again she is made painfully aware of her “apartness”; the funeral home fails in its task. Nevertheless, her vocalization of the error leads to some sense of recognition (though still misunderstood), which allows her to own her grief. “My claim on the star had been registered. I could let it go. I heard the silence then, and moved into it: the long silence of my father’s death.”</p>\n    <p>By the end of the memoir, Kronenfeld reiterates the importance of landscape, gifting us snapshots of both US coasts, several countries, and time-stamped memories connecting moments from throughout the collection. At each juncture, she’s posted her all-important road markers, poems that complement versus summarize the prose, leading us to both question and embrace identity in the circuitous route between “apartness,” choice, acceptance, and community. A smart, honest, and perceptively written collection, <i>Apartness</i> is a hybrid memoir that questions and sometimes finds—in its various forms and definitions—this place called “home.”</p>\n    <p><graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/marjorie-maddox.jpg\" alt=\"Marjorie Maddox\"/><i> Presence</i> assistant editor, and WPSU-FM </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>host, Marjorie Maddox has published 17 collections of poetry—most recently</i>\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"https://radio.wpsu.org/show/poetry-moment\">Poetry Moment</a>\n    <p>\n      <i>and</i>\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Small-Earthly-Space-Marjorie-Maddox/dp/1962082490/ref=sr_1_11?crid=1KHDELVI4UQ7T&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.dOddljgpxCgbv3NSbbqJ20nTwm6uxMwgWgyanQr6eHr9vpX-zNHfE_0sgKfOrGOr5yRXl7fvjS6v3k3U3gsoEwXghswzKfwh-3UmfB_ipftmhqG2DT0ZDl4R4Hhd6rEQB1bsGYRf5B6Sp5BZP-BvZnZYSR4KJnksyoW4CXXRN5l8F0c34I-wSWndYYj-UmS4Mfs4pd-t36SyRrIOHwi8IveoDYrFKnJaANaG4LrIdcA.AUm1l4flm6i6ZNFi8vJnhYR2n9HRUyJa9rfImL69_vU&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=marjorie+maddox&amp;qid=1735669812&amp;sprefix=marjorie+maddox%2Caps%2C116&amp;sr=8-11\">Small Earthly Space</a>\n    <p>\n      <i/>\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"https://wildhousepublishing.com/seeing-things/?fbclid=IwY2xjawGi6ClleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHaZXpnRKSlSSQbSFyKGKpsnIRPVzWd9QX8KvJK7i_33IXPMwbsbxksDXoA_aem_apc3rtwpg5XIOaIEtuoRLA\">Seeing Things</a>\n    <p><i>—</i>as well as a story collection, 4 children’s books, and the anthologies</p>\n    <p><i>Common Wealth</i>and</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>(co-editor with Jerry Wemple).</i>\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.psupress.org/books/titles/978-0-271-09990-3.html\">Keystone Poetry</a>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"http://www.marjoriemaddox.com/\">www.marjoriemaddox.com</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/09/review-apartness-a-memoir-in-essays-and-poems-by-judy-kronenfeld/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>Cleaning your stainless steel pans after a light sauté or sear might be as simple as using warm water and dish soap, but if your cookware has been through a particularly tough session and you’re looking for ways to solve discoloration, buildup, or burnt-on food, the cleanup gets more complicated. Equipping your kitchen with <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-nonstick-pans\">nonstick cookware</a> may feel tempting because it seems easier to clean, but armed with some knowledge about proper upkeep, you’ll find that stainless steel cookware is easy to care for and, unlike your nonstick pans, it will last a lifetime.</p>\n<p>We’ve spent years testing the <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-stainless-steel-pan-skillet\">best stainless steel pans</a>, which also means we’ve dirtied, scorched, and baked grease onto hundreds of pieces of cookware. Sure, the internet is full of hacks claiming to offer the best way to clean stainless steel. But after years of cleaning up after ourselves as both home cooks and testers, we feel we have waded through the nonsense to deliver a definitive guide to how to clean stainless steel cookware—even the really tough stains. Read below to learn how to clean stainless steel pans.</p>\n<h2>General cleaning tips for stainless steel cookware:</h2>\n<p><strong>Preheat your pan before cooking.</strong> One way to ensure that your cookware is easy to clean? Don’t let food get stuck to it in the first place. To make your stainless steel cookware behave more like a nonstick skillet, first, preheat your pan on medium-low heat. You can check if the skillet is hot enough using the water test: Drop a bit of water onto the pan and if it beads up, it’s ready. Next, add your oil to the pan and let it heat. You’ll know the fat is properly preheated when it’s thin and shimmering. Both of these steps will ensure that food does not stick to your cooking surface.</p>\n<p><strong>Whenever possible, clean your pan shortly after you use it.</strong> We get it, it’s not always possible to clean your pan right after you’re done cooking. You want to eat, after all. But cleaning your pan as soon as you’ve used it means the food won’t have time to harden or bake onto the still-warm pan. Do let it cool down enough that you can touch it without a hot pad though. Running cold water on a blazing hot pan can cause warping.</p>\n<p><strong>Deglaze your pan.</strong> When you’ve seared a piece of meat like a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/easy-steak-with-pan-sauce\">steak</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/pan-seared-pork-chops-with-citrus-dressing\">pork chop</a>, your pan will have fond and brown bits stuck to the bottom. These bits can be hard to clean off, but also, simply cleaning them would be a massive waste of flavor. Removing excess grease or cooking oil and then pouring wine, vinegar, or just room-temperature water onto your pan while it’s still on low heat on the stove will loosen those browned bits, so you can use a metal spatula to scrape them off the bottom of the pan; it almost feels like magic. Then, add a bit of butter to the pan to mix with the liquid and the fond and voila: You have an instantly sophisticated sauce, and an easier pan to clean. <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/how-to/article/perfect-pan-sauce\">Here’s a recipe</a>, if you want it.</p>\n<p>Even if you don’t make a pan sauce, you can use this method (we recommend just using warm water as your liquid) to remove bits of food that have already baked onto your pan.</p>\n<p><strong>Wipe your pan dry immediately.</strong> Using a microfiber cloth to dry your stainless steel cookware rather than letting it air dry on a dish rack will prevent water spots or that dull glaze that can appear on your pan from hard water.</p>\n<h2>Everyday stainless steel cleaning techniques</h2>\n<p><strong>What you’ll need:</strong> Our favorite sponge, dish soap, scrub brush, and dish towels.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-to-clean-stainless-steel-cookware-so-it-shines-like-new\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Serj Tankian’s abstract paintings have complex layers of a handful of colors that evoke a deep emotional longing that can be hard to describe. But his works come alive in unexpected ways when accompanied by music he composed especially for them.</p>\n    <p>“I see music and visual art as extensions of the same soul. When I paint, I’m composing. When I compose, I’m painting,” Tankian said in a statement shared with <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “Each informs the other in ways words cannot express.”</p>\n    <p>“The whole idea of musically composed paintings is something I’ve been interested in for a long time,” Tankian continued. “As an artist, I’ve always wanted to go to an exhibition, put on headphones, and listen to a piece of music, just like films.”</p>\n    <p>Visitors to the Armenian Museum of America in Watertown, Massachusetts, can experience the Grammy Award-winning System of a Down vocalist’s vision in a new exhibition, <a href=\"https://www.armenianmuseum.org/news/armenian-museum-of-america-to-present-the-art-of-disruption-featuring-paintings-amp-music-scores-by-serj-tankian\"> The Art of Disruption: The Art and Impact of Serj Tankian</a>, that opened this month and will remain on view through February. The gallery features a series of Tankian’s original abstract paintings and their accompanying musical clips, as well as video installations, poems, and artifacts. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Serj_Revolver_1_39564-1-1200x801.jpg?resize=1200%2C801&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Viewers can also download the <a href=\"https://www.arloopa.com/\">Arloopa</a> app — which Tankanian developed with an Armenian designer — point their phone at a painting, and listen to orchestral arrangements of keyboards, guitars, and violins that Tankian composed to accompany each piece. The selections range from one to 24 minutes, but most are the length of an average pop song.</p>\n    <p>“Museums are relatively silent when you’re viewing work outside of an event, but when you utilize these compositions that he created, it’s not silent,” Jason Sohigian, the museum’s executive director, told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “It’s an experience you’re hearing and seeing at the same time.”</p>\n    <p>Tankian had the idea of coupling musical compositions with paintings for several years. He thought about writing music for other artists’ paintings, but it didn’t give him as much joy as pairing his music with his own work.</p>\n    <p>“One day, I just thought to myself, ‘I have this composition and I really want to paint.’ How do I make this work?” Tankian said. “Luckily I liked my first painting. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have continued.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/542647579_10161874267552129_8121195141639272343_n-1200x779.jpg?resize=1200%2C779&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>The Art of Disruption: The Art and Impact of Serj Tankian</i>at the Armenian Museum of America</p>\n    <p>The museum has long showcased the work of contemporary artists who reinterpret the story of the Armenian diaspora and the ramifications of the nation’s century-old genocide that reverberate today.</p>\n    <p>The Glendale-born rock star first became acquainted with the museum after seeing its display of <a href=\"https://www.armenianmuseum.org/treasures-collection/the-art-of-jack-kevorkian?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=12566344525&amp;gbraid=0AAAAABfvcibBmj9gnCgm9QBgEPTQS1vwe&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwiY_GBhBEEiwAFaghvmSgWgN30IEyi9PjDi7SIesYItERFUNUZqmuFtTbX5Y4ackky0XsNBoCB6wQAvD_BwE\">Jack Kevorkian’s artworks</a> four years ago, when he was working on a project in Cambridge. </p>\n    <p>Soon, he started talking with Sohigian about his own work and his recent memoir, <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/539/9780306831928\"> Down with the System</a> (2024). </p>\n    <p>“Serj had started painting, and he also came out with his memoir, where he put out a lot of stuff about his life story and his involvement with music,” Sohigian said. “He started a gallery on his own in Los Angeles that exhibited his work, and he has also shown in New Zealand.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/The_Florist_18x24_Hi_Res-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Ryann Casey, a New Jersey-based artist who curated the exhibition, said Tankian emphasized the interconnectedness of his poetry, music, and visual art, and the meditative aspect of making each of them.</p>\n    <p>“I don’t often get a chance to curate musicians,” she said. “Armenian history is very important to me, and seeing someone express that history and himself through these three different modes was an interesting challenge.”</p>\n    <p>Tankian’s works may not be overtly political, but they carry quiet echoes of genocide recognition, environmental justice, and cultural identity, with titles such as“Music Is a Doorway to the Truth,” “Ethnic Cause,” and “Violent Violins.” His poetry explores connections to his activism with lines about yearning for peace.</p>\n    <p>“I don’t think any of us have shied away from that activism,” Casey said. “Hopefully, people look at those through different lenses.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Thoughts_4000px_300DPI-1200x899.jpg?resize=1200%2C899&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1041881/listening-to-the-paintings-of-serj-tankian-armenian-museum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>When François Boucher created a series of paintings known as <i>The Four Seasons</i> in 1755, agriculture in France was highly seasonal, just as it had been for millennia — since humans started cultivating crops, in fact. In good years, autumn would have seen a bounty of grapes and apples and pears; spring would have brought tender greens, asparagus, and peas; summer, its abundance of berries, grains, and vegetables. </p>\n    <p>Agricultural seasons still exist in 2025, of course. But in a globalized food system that relies heavily on refrigeration, freezing, canning, and other processing technologies, it can be easier to notice seasonal change by the appearance of Starbucks’ annual pumpkin spice offerings than by the sight of a pumpkin in a field.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/5.1-Spring-detail-1200x983.jpg?resize=1200%2C983&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>This year, on the cusp of pumpkin spice season, the Frick Collection has unveiled a site-specific <a href=\"https://www.frick.org/exhibitions/yukhnovich\">installation</a> by Flora Yukhnovich that responds to Boucher’s <i>The Four Seasons</i> with a Rococo exuberance that honors its source material while asserting its place in our current moment. Housed in the museum’s Cabinet Gallery, the four-paneled mural covers the room the way wallpaper might, accommodating windows, doorframes, and the wood paneling ensconced along the perimeter. A crimson ribbon on top of the painting, about an inch thick, traces the outlines of the gallery’s architecture, adding to the installation’s domestic and decorative sensibility.</p>\n    <p>Though each panel represents a particular season, the palette and forms share enough similarities from one wall to the next to engender a continuous sensation, much like an endless Instagram scroll or looping video reel. Yukhnovich lavishes the cloth with a profusion of color: the greens and blues of earth and sky, but also a heady burst of pink, purple, lavender, and turquoise that seem drawn not from the natural world but from the fantasy universe of Disney cartoons. This princess-y palette adds intensity within the panorama of the small room, and its synthetic quality is even more pronounced after spending time with the Bouchers and Fragonards that hang elsewhere in the collection. Its effect is both dazzling and vulgar, like a saccharine pastry consumed to excess.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/4-Winter-1200x723.jpg?resize=1200%2C723&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Within this fecundity of color, floral and plant-like shapes unfurl and cascade in a bucolic landscape with the vague suggestion of a mountainous background. Yukhnovich favors emphatic brushwork and energetic movement across the mural, ornamenting thick patchworks of abstraction with delicate flutters of sinuous line. Occasionally, gestures coalesce into more defined figuration, such as a doe and buck in “Autumn” or a hare, perhaps, in “Winter.” Curiously, I could find no evidence of humans, though Boucher’s original depicts amorous encounters within each of his seasonal vignettes. Maybe Yukhnovich’s landscapes are actually futuristic, postcards from a post-human era in which nature, liberated from the unbridled consumption of the Anthropocene, can once again flourish.</p>\n    <p>I visited the installation with an artist friend a few days after it opened, who pointed out a series of faint horizontal lines, whispers of white paint that occur in regular increments in the upper portions of the “Summer” and “Fall” panels. Trying to discern their function amid the otherwise organic and undulating forms, we finally traced their appearance to the thin wooden muntins that divide the windows on the east-facing wall. Our hypothesis is unconfirmed, but I like the idea that, in the midst of translating Boucher to a digital-age fantasia, Yukhnovich still points to the original abundance just outside the mansion’s walls, the green of the trees and the effulgence of light.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/5-Spring-detail-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/1-Spring-Summer-1200x704.jpg?resize=1200%2C704&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Flora Yukhnovich: Four Seasons</i>at The Frick Collection.

    "body": "<p>ARLES, France — The investigation of the archive, in all its malleable reinvention and disruption of canonical narratives, is at the core of this year’s <a href=\"https://www.rencontres-arles.com/en/expositions\">Rencontres d’Arles</a> photography festival and its theme: “Disobedient Images.”</p>\n<p>The more than 40 exhibitions included in the 56th edition of the <i>Rencontres</i>, which translates to “encounters,”<strong> </strong>also lay the ground for an even larger event that France has in stock: the <a href=\"https://britishphotohistory.ning.com/profiles/blogs/france-to-celebrate-the-bicentenary-of-photography-2026-2027\">Bicentennial of Photography</a>, slated for 2026–27 to mark the date of the first image obtained through light, Joseph Nicéphore Nièpce’s iconic “<a href=\"https://petapixel.com/the-first-photo/\">View from the Window at Le Gras</a>.” What might at first seem a nationalist enterprise, or even a utopian recuperation of images on the cusp of disappearing, is, in fact, a vivacious call to rethink photography as a medium in constant renewal.</p>\n<p>This notion — that photographs influence historical revisionism — brings the festival into conversation with a cultural mission initiated in the years after World War II, when many other cultural festivals were launched in Europe. The Cannes Film Festival, the Avignon Theatre Festival, and the Antibes Jazz Festival all started between 1946 and 1960. Like other media, photography found its place in the historic arenas, the churches and cloisters, only to assert a new and revolutionary message.</p>\n<p><i>In praise of Anonymous Photography: Marion and Philippe Jacquier Collection</i>at the Cloister of Saint-Trophime</p>\n<p>Rencontres d’Arles<i> </i>continues to invite artists and curators to measure themselves up with spaces that are evocative of the long tail of history and how we record it, including the <a href=\"https://www.wmf.org/monuments/cloister-of-st-trophime\">Cloister of St. Trophime</a>. Within those storied walls echo powerful connections. Take artist and activist Nan Goldin, whose “<a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/956629/nan-goldin-celestial-sensations-gagosian/\">Stendhal Syndrome</a>” (2024) finds resonance inside the ancient <a href=\"https://www.rencontres-arles.com/en/expositions/view/1601/nan-goldin\">Church of St. Blaise</a> and asserts the power of seduction and autobiography in a world that is increasingly dark and obtuse. On July 8, she projected the digital slideshow “<a href=\"https://www.rencontres-arles.com/en/agenda/view/3540/nan-goldin\">Memory Lost</a>” (2019–20) in the Roman Theatre. Author Édouard Louis read a text beside Goldin in the ancient outdoor space, making the stones screech and shiver with his declaration: “We think that photography shows destruction of this world and things will change, but we are wrong, what worked in the past is no longer working today.” In projection and in <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/484109/pain-sackler-storms-guggenheim-and-metropolitan-museums-for-financial-ties-to-opioid-manufacturers/\">life</a>, Goldin moves the conversation, questioning the realism and effectiveness of photography while seeking answers about its political power today.</p>\n<p>The festival’s exhibitions on Indigenous Australian artists and Brazilian photo archives provokingly raise these points. <a href=\"https://www.rencontres-arles.com/en/expositions/view/1597/on-country-photography-from-australia\"> On Country: Photography from Australia</a> at the Church of St. Anne presents a collective excavation into the meaning of “country” beyond its geographical borders, an intimate dimension that brings together the material quality of photography with ritual sounds and evocative sculptural installations. Hanging from the church’s Gothic vault are large fabrics of cyanotypes where Ngugi/Quandamooka artist Sonja Carmichael has printed the traces of various elements used by local communities, from remnants of meals to natural objects like shells. Brenda Croft’s large prints of Barangaroo First Nation women are obtained from tintypes, a 19th-century photographic process whose haunting identity emerges anew here. A soundscape broadcast across the exhibition features an intergenerational First Nations choir made up of Menero-Ngarigo and Dhurga-Yuin singers, who traveled across the world to perform during the festival’s opening week in July.</p>\n<p><i>On Country: Photography from Australia</i>in the Church of St. Anne, featuring a hanging work by Sonja Carmichael (Ngugi/Quandamooka) and Elisa Jane Carmichael (Ngugi/Quandamooka)</p>\n<p>A similar effort to draw new work from buried narratives and traditional crafts characterizes Thyago Nogueira’s ambitious exhibition, <a href=\"https://www.rencontres-arles.com/en/expositions/view/1598/ancestral-futures\"> Ancestral Futures: Brazilian Contemporary Scene</a>, where a wide range of strategies — from photomontage to AI, </p>\n<p><i>photo-roman</i>, performance, and video — engage with the repatriation of Indigenous history.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Christianity had failed him. What next then? Art?</p>\n    <p>Vincent van Gogh’s life as an artist had the most faltering and rudimentary of beginnings in 1880. By 1890 he was dead, by suicide, at the age of 37. A tempestuous life snuffed out.</p>\n    <p><i> A Fire in His Soul: Van Gogh, Paris, and the Making of an Artist</i> is in part a critical biography and in part an impressive and sensitive account of his creation of some key paintings. It focuses primarily on the years 1886 and 1887, during which he lived with his long-suffering brother, Theo, in a flat on a winding, upward-rising street in Montmartre, Paris, called Rue Lepic. </p>\n    <p>Why those years? Because, author Miles J. Unger argues, his immersion in the avant-garde circles of Paris at that historical moment, his various acquaintanceships with such fellow artists as Toulouse-Lautrec, Emile Bernard, and Gauguin, and the quality of debate swirling in the feverish air of the City of Light about the nature of the modern in art, gave van Gogh the tools to forge his own mature identity as an artist. If academicism was indeed dead, what would succeed it?</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/2-Vincent-van-Gogh-about-age-19.jpg?resize=1000%2C1132&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>There were many contenders for van Gogh’s attention in those years: Impressionism (already established as a success story), post-Impressionism, Divisionism, Pointillism, Symbolism, Cloisonnism, Japonisme, Nabisme. Yet he would belong to none of these movements. He was too much his own man, too restlessly individualistic for belonging. Instead, he plucked out bits and pieces from here and there — an often near-feverish intensity of color, for example; the crinkly quality of the paper so often used in Japanese prints, for instance — and forged from these <i>ad hoc</i> thises and thats an entirely unique identity.  </p>\n    <p>Unger is especially good at making sense of the furious level of often self-contradictory debate about art and how it was to be made. The story, in all its complexity, is told with verve and panache and a real grasp of its social and intellectual context. Of course it also needs to be said that every writer about van Gogh has had the benefit of his hundreds of extraordinary letters, which bring alive both the intelligence and the incongruities of the man, and this book is no exception. Extensive quotation from those letters, in all their barkingly furious eloquence, make for marvelous reading.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/9.-Autumn-Landscape-with-Four-Trees-1885-1200x944.jpeg?resize=1200%2C944&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Van Gogh was arrogant, argumentative, self-lacerating, and self-deluding, with the manic work ethic of a carthorse. Almost all who met him found him impossible to deal with. Except, finally, his more modest and tractable younger brother, Theo, the respectable Parisian art dealer who supported him financially throughout his life because he believed that his elder brother possessed more than the touch of a genius.</p>\n    <p>There is one matter that the book addresses in far too cursory and dismissive a fashion, and that is poetry. Most studies of van Gogh — including this one — make much of his fascination with French fiction and in particular Emile Zola and his naturalist creed. What it lacks when it considers the nature of van Gogh’s beliefs (he is probably best described as a pantheist) is the influence of poetry on his thinking and making. Poetry is where he found his emotional sustenance</p>\n    <p>In the autumn of 1888, he made a painting of a young Belgian called Eugen Boch. He titled it “The Poet.” What did van Gogh’s preoccupation with poetry, and the idea of the poet, actually amount to? Unger mentions but does not comment on this painting. Had that happened, this fine book might have been even richer than it already is.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/1.-Still-Life-with-Earthenware-Pot-and-Clogs-1200x915.jpeg?resize=1200%2C915&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/5.-Goupil_s-showroom-The-Hague.jpg?resize=1460%2C1000&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/7.-The-Potato-Eaters-1886-1200x851.jpg?resize=1200%2C851&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/20.-Letter-with-Sketch-of-Potato-Eaters-1885-1200x946.jpeg?resize=1200%2C946&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/6.-Still-life-with-Bible-and-Candle-1885-1200x1016.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1016&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/539/9781639368457\">A Fire in His Soul: Van Gogh, Paris, and the Making of an Artist</a> <i>(2025) by Miles J.

Researchers from Albania’s Institute of Archaeology began excavating it last month, after inhabitants of the nearby village of Strikçan noticed an “unusual stone formation on a plateau,” writes <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/albania-roman-tomb-2685849\"> Artnet</a>’s Richard Whiddington.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/afeTfleBeWmzAJD8lQAxQnt09rw=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(800x602:801x603)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/e8/68/e868ad61-aa55-4392-81f3-75135fffa4de/539661632_1350463360412538_3353035600977764363_n.jpeg\" alt=\"inscription\"/>\n    <p>Dating to the third or fourth century C.E., the tomb measures nearly 30 feet long and 20 feet wide. It’s made up of three components: a staircase, entrance hall and a funerary chamber. The chamber held the remains of two people, and its limestone wall features an inscription written in Greek.</p>\n    <p>“The inscription tells us that the person buried here was named Gelliano, a name typical of the Roman period,”  lead archaeologist <a href=\"https://albanologjia.academia.edu/EriksonNikolli\">Erikson Nikolli</a> tells <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/science/wealthy-ancient-romans-tomb-discovered-albania-2025-09-08/\">Reuters</a>’ Fatos Bytyci and Florion Goga. “We are uncertain about the identity of the second individual, but it is likely a family member.”</p>\n    <p>The edges of the tomb’s walls and roof are decorated with intricate carvings. Meanwhile, a second inscription honors <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Jupiter-Roman-god\">Jupiter</a>, the Roman god of the sky. According to the statement, this is the first dedication of its kind to be discovered in the region. Other inscriptions were found on loose stones around the site, though experts say these may have come from another nearby monument.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/M3yy7FNBPtNWkSg05XwmuePdjWY=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(600x800:601x801)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/f8/93/f8936f21-0766-47af-b90d-1302d9d7e31e/541651000_1350463320412542_1398372595600957434_n.jpeg\" alt=\"empty chamber\"/>\n    <p>Northern Albania was once part of the ancient region of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Illyria\">Illyria</a>, which also included parts of present-day Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. The Illyrians were an Indo-European people who lived in organized tribes, some of which united under various kingdoms. Rome warred with Illyrian kingdoms throughout the third and second centuries B.C.E., eventually conquering the entire Balkan Peninsula. While the region was heavily influenced by Roman culture, the Illyrians fought to conserve their language and traditions.</p>\n    <h4>Quick fact: Rome’s influence in Illyria</h4>\n    <p>Rome controlled the region for some 600 years, from the <a href=\"https://albanopedia.com/biographies/gentius-young-king-illyrians\">last Illyrian king</a>’s surrender in 168 B.C.E. until the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Roman-Empire/Height-and-decline-of-imperial-Rome\">empire</a>’s collapse in the fifth century C.E.</p>\n    <p>During the recent excavations of Gelliano’s tomb, archaeologists found that the site had been looted at least twice, Nikolli tells Reuters. Robbers entered the tomb once in antiquity and again in modern times, when they used heavy machinery to move a large rock to access the site. Despite these incidents, the team unearthed a trove of artifacts, including glass plates, knives and objects made from bone.</p>\n    <p>“We also uncovered a piece of fabric embroidered with gold thread, which confirms our belief that we are dealing with a member of the upper class,” Nikolli adds.</p>\n    <p>The discovery has already drawn crowds of curious locals. Albania’s tourism economy has rapidly expanded in recent years, and officials eventually plan to open the site of the tomb to visitors.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/archaeologists-in-albania-unearth-tomb-belonging-to-an-upper-class-roman-who-died-1700-years-ago-180987341/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In Fiji, 79 percent of ant species that are native to and only found on the archipelago are in decline, according to a study published in the journal <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ads3004\"> Science</a> last week.</p>\n<p>The trouble for endemic Fijian ants started after humans began living on the islands roughly 3,000 years ago, the researchers report. Declines have accelerated over the past 300 years, a timeline that coincides with the arrival of Europeans, as well as the rise of modern agriculture and global trade. Non-native ants that have been introduced more recently, meanwhile, are thriving.</p>\n<p>“Fiji has some of the most spectacular and geographically restricted ant species on Earth,” says study co-author <a href=\"https://entomology.umd.edu/economoevan.html\">Evan Economo</a>, a biologist at the University of Maryland and the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology in Japan, in a <a href=\"https://cmns.umd.edu/news-events/news/new-study-shows-island-ant-communities-sharp-decline\">statement</a>. “The fact that the endemic species are declining is of huge concern—both for the future of these species in Fiji and for the possibility that it is a much more widespread phenomenon affecting other types of insects and on other islands.”</p>\n<p>Approximately <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/study-shows-global-insect-populations-have-crashed-last-decade-180971474/\">40 percent</a> of global insect species are <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320718313636\">facing extinction</a>, largely due to habitat loss, pesticides, pollution and invasive species. However, even in places that are not directly affected by humans, these creatures are still struggling—likely because of climate change. A separate study published earlier this month in the journal <a href=\"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.70187\"> Ecology</a> found that flying insect populations at an isolated site in the Colorado mountains declined by 72.4 percent between 2004 and 2024.</p>\n<p>“It’s quite remote, quite pristine, and yet still showing this substantial decline in insects,” <a href=\"https://sockman.web.unc.edu/\">Keith Sockman</a>, the author of the <i>Ecology</i> study and a biologist at the University of North Carolina, tells <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/12/nx-s1-5535551/insect-populations-human-interference-study\">NPR</a>’s Alana Wise.</p>\n<p>Ants in Fiji will transport seeds of <i>Squamellaria</i> plants and <a href=\"https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.15855\">fertilize</a> them with their excrement. Within these compartment-containing plants, <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/enemy-ant-colonies-are-peaceful-roommates-in-apartment-like-plants-on-fiji-scientists-discovered-how-this-delicate-coexistence-works-180986971/\">enemy ant colonies can coexist</a>.</p>\n<p>Against the broader backdrop of global insect declines, scientists were curious to know how ants were faring in Fiji, the South Pacific country made up of more than 300 islands. As closed, isolated ecosystems, islands often show the ripple effects of human activity more quickly than continental ecosystems do. In this way, islands—and the animals that inhabit them—are “kind of a canary in the coal mine,” says <a href=\"https://www.oeb.harvard.edu/people/cong-liu\">Cong Liu</a>, the lead author of the new <i>Science</i> study and an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University, in a <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2025-09-island-ant-communities-insect-apocalypse.html\">statement</a>.</p>\n<p>Global conservation efforts tend to be centered around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/24/most-conservation-funds-go-to-large-vertebrates-at-expense-of-neglected-species\">large, charismatic animals</a>. However, the team decided to focus on ants, specifically, because the creatures are “part of ‘little things that run the world’ and are critical for maintaining healthy ecosystems,” says study co-author <a href=\"https://biology.anu.edu.au/people/professor-sasha-alexander-mikheyev\">Alexander Mikheyev</a>, an evolutionary biologist at the Australian National University, in another <a href=\"https://science.anu.edu.au/news-events/news/island-ant-communities-show-signs-unseen-insect-apocalypse\">statement</a>.</p>\n<p>Researchers have not been directly monitoring ant populations in Fiji. So, to understand how their numbers have changed over time, scientists turned to the insects’ DNA. Using an approach known as “community genomics,” the researchers studied the genomes of Fijian ants stored in museum collections. They noted variations in DNA among thousands of individuals from more than 100 species, which gave them a sense of how ant populations as a whole have changed over time.</p>\n<p>Most of Fiji’s endemic species, the data showed, are declining. However, a few endemic species appear to be holding their own. These are probably less vulnerable to habitat disturbances and have been able to adapt to life on urban and agricultural lands, according to a statement. Non-native ant species are also probably succeeding because they’re more flexible.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/fijis-ants-are-struggling-scientists-say-theyre-part-of-the-broader-insect-apocalypse-180987343/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It wasn’t until after Bowie’s passing, when archivists entered his New York City study to catalog his belongings, that the notes were discovered as he had left them—some of them tacked onto walls.</p><p>The notes have been donated to London’s <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/east/storehouse/visit?srsltid=AfmBOopKXupcajdMmHHzep22r1Ue-ktrz_ZQUTj8chJ4zD49WxpmEfHI\">V&amp;A East Storehouse</a>, where they will go on display at the <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/david-bowie-centre?srsltid=AfmBOopE6S3AsRZMN1sqZUKH8CxyDeTR6UmyUyF0YDUOibCwvpfxEm9a\">David Bowie Center</a>, set to open on September 13.</p><p>Called <i>The Spectator</i>, the musical was inspired by a daily publication of the same name. Printed between 1711 and 1712, each edition of the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Spectator-British-periodical-1711-1712\"> Spectator</a> contained essays on topics like politics, the arts and English society, told through a fictional framework with a witty tone.</p><h4>Quick fact: <i>The Spectator</i>’s stated goals</h4>\n    <p>The periodical set out to “enliven morality with wit, and to temper wit with morality,” according to <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Spectator-British-periodical-1711-1712\">Encyclopedia Britannica</a>. </p><p>Bowie took notes in black pen on the periodical’s essays, sometimes scoring them out of ten. He was especially interested in what the essays had to say about 18th-century art, as well as stories of notorious criminals.</p><p>“The notes suggest Bowie was drawn to 18th-century London as it would’ve allowed him to explore such topics as crime and punishment, the development of art and satire, and the always fascinating intersection between high and low culture,” writes <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/david-bowie-last-project-musical-18th-century-london-1235422157/\"> Rolling Stone</a>’s Jon Blistein.</p><p>He toyed with making iconic petty thief and prison escapee <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jack-Sheppard-English-criminal\">Jack Sheppard</a> one of <i>The Spectator</i>’s central characters. He also considered incorporating the Mohocks, an alleged gang of young upper-class men who became a “media frenzy,” as <a href=\"https://www.history.ox.ac.uk/people/professor-bob-harris#:~:text=I%20joined%20the%20Faculty%20in,in%20the%20long%20eighteenth%20century.\">Bob Harris</a>, an 18th-century historian at the University of Oxford, tells BBC News.</p><p>“London threw up so many different juxtapositions,” Harris says of that time period. “Juxtapositions between high and low, between the virtuous and the criminal, and these things existed cheek by jowl.”</p><p>“I think it presented so much that was beguiling to contemporaries,” he adds, “but also clearly that Bowie himself found fascinating.”</p><graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/a04_uHDqMMdelq5Rz8Hnrq65EqM=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(1500x1300:1501x1301)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/f3/44/f3441cb4-18e4-47ef-9212-a1d38afbf0ea/dbatemp180-2.jpg\" alt=\"David Bowie's notes for The Spectator, a musical set in 18th-century London that he spent his final months working on.\"/><p><i>The Spectator</i>, a musical set in 18th-century London V&amp;A</p><p>The notes also include a timeline of 18th-century artistic contributions in London, signaling Bowie’s interest in the development of the era’s creative works—especially politically charged, satirical musicals.</p><p>Bowie is best known for his original music, but he was both influenced by and involved in theater for much of his life. He made his Broadway debut in 1980, starring in <a href=\"https://www.davidbowie.com/blog/2025/7/29/bowies-elephant-man-debut-45-years-ago-today\"> The Elephant Man</a>, and went on to have numerous on-screen acting appearances throughout his career, including in </p><p><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105665/\">and</a></p><i>Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me</i><p><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482571/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_The%2520Prestige\">. In 2002, he told BBC Radio 4’s John Wilson</a></p><i>The Prestige</i><p><i>that he had wanted to write for theater from the start of his career.</i></p><p>“I guess I could have just written for theater in my living room—but I think the intent was [always] to have a pretty big audience,” he said.</p><p>One of Bowie’s final completed projects was <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2016/10/21/498724977/all-songs-1-how-david-bowies-songs-became-the-musical-lazarus\"> Lazarus</a>, a jukebox musical featuring his music—including four new songs—with a book by Enda Walsh. The show premiered off-Broadway in 2015 and had a run in London’s West End.</p><p>Fans of the artist won’t be able to see a fully-realized version of <i>The Spectator</i>, but they can see its earliest iteration at V&amp;A East Storehouse’s David Bowie Center, where the notes as well as the desk from Bowie’s office will be shown alongside 200 other items on permanent display.</p><p>If that’s not enough, Bowie enthusiasts will be able to <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/this-london-museum-lets-you-order-items-from-its-vast-collections-and-maybe-even-touch-them-180986848/\">apply</a> to view anything from the center’s 90,000-piece collection in person, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/sep/05/david-bowie-final-project-was-18th-century-musical-new-va-exhibition-reveals\"> Guardian</a>’s Laura Snapes reports.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/david-bowie-spent-his-final-months-writing-a-musical-inspired-by-satire-and-crime-in-18th-century-london-180987304/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

So let's discuss: how do you balance your career and your partner's career? Do you take turns with regard to your careers? What guidelines do you generally follow? Have you always done that, or did you start after children?</p>\n    <p>(On the flip side, does anyone want to share stories about how <a href=\"https://corporette.com/is-there-an-alpha-and-a-beta-in-your-relationship/\">one career has taken the lead</a> in your relationship, whether yours or your partner's, and how that has looked? I think there are obvious things that people think of — moving (particularly for jobs in academia!), leaning out or leaving to stay home with the kids — but what are the less obvious ways?)</p>\n    <p>It hasn't really been an issue in my marriage (we've both been in our current gigs for a long time!) — but as my friend was describing it it sounded great. I loved that it meant that they both encouraged and supported each other through all of that — the anxiety of the job interview, the upheaval of a new job — but what I really thought was smart was that it basically put each one on a schedule to seek new opportunities or promotions on a regular basis. In their family it particularly makes sense because they have two elementary-aged children, but I could also see it being a smart move even for couples without kids, older kids, or empty nesters.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Over to you, readers — do you and your partner take turns with your careers?

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The Israeli military reportedly raided <i>No Other Land </i>co-director Basel Adra’s home in the Occupied West Bank on Saturday, September 13, as first <a href=\"https://x.com/yuval_abraham/status/1966910149999927426\">made public on X</a> by investigative journalist Yuval Abraham, the film’s other co-director.</p>\n    <p>The raid followed an apparent attack by Israeli settlers on Adra’s land in the At-Tuwani village in Masafer Yatta. Adra said in an <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOjvF3TiPYH/\">Instagram post</a> that a group of Israeli settlers attempted to run over his brother with an all-terrain vehicle before physically attacking him, his older brother, and his cousin.</p>\n    <p>At least one of the individuals attacked by the settlers, Adra’s brother, was hospitalized, according to his post. Settlers also beat a foreign activist, who was a woman, according to Adra. The perpetrators came from Havat Ma’on, an illegal 600-person settlement that has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/23/crowdfunding-us-residents-fund-settlements-west-bank\">reportedly solicited donations</a> from residents of the United States to fund its paramilitary groups.</p>\n    <p>The incident comes amid a spate of violent attacks perpetrated against affiliates of the Israeli-Palestinian collective that produced the internationally acclaimed film, which documents the Israeli occupation and forced displacement of the Masafer Yatta region. In July, Awdah Hathaleen, an activist who contributed to the filming of <i>No Other Land</i>, <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1030877/no-other-land-contributor-killed-by-israeli-settler/\">was shot and killed by a notorious Israeli settler</a>. Earlier this year, during Ramadan, settlers <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/opinion/no-other-land-director-attack.html\">taunting him as the “Oscar-winning filmmaker”</a> reportedly beat co-director Hamdan Ballal at his home in the Occupied West Bank.</p>\n    <p>While Adra was at the hospital with his injured family members, he said, the Israeli military raided his home, where his wife and nine-month-old baby were inside. Adra told <i> CNN</i> that the military also blocked an ambulance from a village road. </p>\n    <p>The settlers attacked Adra’s family members, according to an interview with <i>CNN</i>, after trespassing on his olive grove. The Israeli military said its raid was in response to stones hurled at Israeli civilians, a claim that Adra denied.</p>\n    <p>In a series of short video clips posted by Adra to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOjvF3TiPYH/\">Instagram</a>, a man is shown driving an ATV erratically towards a group of people and a man is seen chasing a woman, identified as a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-west-bank-basel-adra-home-raided-4241522d2aed9fd95b28eba361e45c38\">solidarity activist</a>, and pushing her down by the neck or upper back to the ground, where she curls into a fetal position.</p>\n    <p>Adra claimed to <i>CNN</i> that he has filed dozens of complaints against the settlers for bringing their sheep to graze in his olive trees, yet the police have not done anything to stop them.</p>\n    <p>Adra has not yet responded to <i>Hyperallergic</i>‘s request for comment.</p>\n    <p>Adra and the film’s three other codirectors<i> </i><a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/993839/no-other-land-creators-issue-urgent-call-to-action-in-oscars-speech/\">won the Oscar</a> for Best Documentary Feature Film in March, using their allotted two-minute victory speech to plead for the end of violence against Palestinians. The film captured harrowing scenes of bulldozer-razed homes and settler violence in Adra’s home village. The film does not have a distributor in the US.</p>\n    <p>In the final scene of the film, Adra’s cousin Zakaria al-Adra is shot in the stomach.</p>\n    <p>“About two months ago, I became a father, and my hope for my daughter is that she will not have to live the same life I am living now, always fearing violence, home demolitions, and forced displacement that my community, Masafer Yatta, is facing every day,” Adra said in the speech.</p>\n    <p>In March, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/29/nx-s1-5344513/academy-palestinian-director-oscars-no-other-land-hamdan-ballal\">issued an apology</a> to co-director Ballal after it failed to name him and the film <i>No Other Land </i>in its <a href=\"https://x.com/yuval_abraham/status/1905221180379824526\">initial statement</a> that alluded to his attack.

In her most ambitious exhibition to date, she turns to storytelling on an epic scale. <i> Another World and Yet the Same</i> presents a new body of work based on a tale of the artist’s own invention — an allegorical voyage to Antarctica to found a freer, more equitable society. Richmond-Edwards draws inspiration from diverse sources, including the biblical stories of Exodus, the science-fiction mythology of jazz musician Sun Ra, and the exploration of both real and imagined continents. The exhibition’s title, borrowed from the 17th-century dystopian literary work by Joseph Hall entitled </p>\n    <p><i>Mundus alter et idem</i>— an imaginary account of a voyage to the oceans south of Africa — underscores the artist’s exploration of the potential for societal transformation. The result is a luminous vision of both peril and possibility: a myth that feels timeless and utterly contemporary.</p>\n    <p><i>Jamea Richmond-Edwards: Another World and Yet the Same</i> is curated by Alexander Jarman, Assistant Curator of Exhibitions and Academic Outreach, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/47FLBCC\">Ruth and Elmer Wellin Museum of Art at Hamilton College</a>.</p>\n    <p>A fully illustrated exhibition catalogue edited by Tracy L. Adler will be published in 2026 with contributions by Alexander Jarman, Melanee C.

But how annoying would it be if the asteroid’s new orbit simply pushed the impact date back by a few years?</p>\n    <p>In a conference paper published in July by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5194/epsc-dps2025-77\">Copernicus Publications</a>, researchers have highlighted that such deflection missions can’t smack into an Earth-threatening asteroid in just any place. That runs the risk of sending the asteroid hurtling through a gravitational keyhole—a region of space where a planet’s gravity can change an asteroid’s orbit, putting it back on track to collide with said planet later.</p>\n    <p>“This means another deflection mission on possibly much shorter timescales could become necessary. In order to avoid such repetitive doomsday scenarios right off the bat, we should strive to design the initial KI [kinetic impact] deflection mission such that it does not trigger a keyhole,” researchers write in the paper. “In this work, we have developed a method that can aid KI mission decision-makers during the initial design process.”</p>\n    <p>For those of you worrying what that means for NASA’s DART mission, which <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/nasa-successfully-crashed-a-spacecraft-into-its-asteroid-target-180980840/\">smacked into the small asteroid Dimorphos</a> in September 2022, you can rest easy. In this specific case, it didn’t matter where the mission struck, because the asteroid is <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250909031457.htm\">part of a system that is too massive</a> to be moved into a course that would one day impact our planet. This isn’t true for all hazardous asteroids orbiting the sun, however.</p>\n    <p>When hit, different regions on an asteroid’s surface have different risks of moving said asteroid through a keyhole. As such, the team used data from the DART mission to create a method that calculates probability maps for these variations.</p>\n    <p>“Mapping these keyholes onto the asteroids is possible and all it costs before the mission even lifts off is computing power, so we should be doing this to make sure we can pick the best possible targeting point on the surface of the asteroid for any kinetic impact,” <a href=\"https://rahil-makadia.github.io/\">Rahil Makadia</a>, a NASA Space Technology researcher at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, told the Europlanet Science Congress in Finland last week, as reported by <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2495795-deflecting-a-deadly-asteroid-just-got-a-lot-less-dangerous/\"> New Scientist</a>’s Alex Wilkins.</p>\n    <p>Ideally, a hazardous asteroid would be detected early enough to allow time for scientists to send a space mission to collect information about the object’s shape, surface landscape, rotation and mass. While this sort of “rendezvous mission is preferred,” Makadia says in a <a href=\"https://www.europlanet.org/epsc-dps2025-look-out-for-the-keyhole-how-to-find-the-safest-spots-to-deflect-a-hazardous-asteroid/\">statement</a>, “fortunately, this entire analysis, at least at a preliminary level, is possible using ground-based observations alone,” he explains, meaning not all hope is lost if we don’t have time to send up a mission before impact.</p>\n    <p>Researchers can thus calculate the asteroid’s different post-impact paths depending on where it is struck, and choose the safest option. “By creating these maps, we can push asteroids away from the Earth such that they do not return on an impacting trajectory in the foreseeable future,” the authors write in the paper.</p>\n    <p>The <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/earth-escapes-most-dangerous-asteroid-that-we-know-about-1066258/\">non-hazardous asteroid Apophis</a> will serve as a source for gathering more information about the rocky space bodies when it zooms past Earth in 2029, per <i>New Scientist</i>.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/asteroid-deflecting-missions-need-to-hit-asteroids-in-a-specific-spot-to-avoid-pushing-them-into-another-collision-course-with-earth-new-research-reveals-180987342/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Chelsea O. Bennice</p><p>Octopuses have eight arms to choose from, but it turns out they might have favorites.</p><p>In a new study, published in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-10674-y\"> Scientific Reports</a> last week, scientists created a catalogue of the animals’ arm movements by analyzing 25 videos of wild octopuses engaging in different activities. The footage was filmed between 2007 and 2015 at six locations across the Caribbean and Spain, in different types of habitats. They recorded almost 4,000 separate arm actions and found that each arm is not used equally.</p><p>“In general, we did see that for most actions the octopuses used their front arms more often than their back arms,” says <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kendra-Buresch\">Kendra Buresch</a>, a study co-author and researcher at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, to Nicola Davis at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/11/octopuses-prefer-to-use-different-arms-for-different-tasks-scientists-find\"> Guardian</a>.</p><p>While they showed a preference for using their front arms overall, the <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/ten-wild-facts-about-octopuses-they-have-three-hearts-big-brains-and-blue-blood-7625828/\">octopuses</a> in the videos appeared to use different arms for specific tasks. Their rear arms, for instance, were favored for locomotion—to sit upright or to roll along the ocean floor. The front arms were more involved in exploring.</p><p>“The beauty of this system, in many ways, is that you have eight arms, and all of those eight arms can do most of these actions,” says study co-author <a href=\"https://www.mbl.edu/research/faculty-and-whitman-scientists/Roger%20Hanlon\">Roger Hanlon</a>, a senior scientist at the Marine Biological Laboratory, to Kate Golembiewski at the<i>  New York Times</i>.</p><h4>Fun facts: Octopus arms seem to have a “<a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/ten-wild-facts-about-octopuses-they-have-three-hearts-big-brains-and-blue-blood-7625828/\">mind of their own</a>”</h4>\n    <ul><li>An octopus has <a href=\"https://biologicalsciences.uchicago.edu/news/octopus-arms-segmented-nervous-system\">more neurons in its arms</a>than in its brain—<a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/ten-wild-facts-about-octopuses-they-have-three-hearts-big-brains-and-blue-blood-7625828/\">two-thirds</a>of the animal’s neurons are in its arms.</li><li>An arm can <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-octopus-arms-bypass-the-brain/\">gather sensory information</a>without input from major regions of the brain.</li></ul><p>In their work, the team broke down octopus arm movements into several categories, naming the different motions and behaviors that the animals might do. For instance, they came up with four basic ways an octopus deforms its arm: bending, twisting, shortening and elongating. They also identified 12 arm actions, including grasping, curling, tucking and reaching.</p><p>By combining these deformations and actions, the octopuses could perform 15 different behaviors described by the scientists, such as exploring rocks, searching substrate, walking, swimming and descending upon an object in a “parachute attack,” with arms outstretched and webbing extended.</p><graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/BrDGpi-o9jk5Lprt024oY2uOnjw=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(963x1239:964x1240)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/65/ad/65ad28b2-438d-4ff1-acd7-e39cb75770cd/41598_2025_10674_fig2_html.webp\" alt=\"figure showing octopus movements and actions\"/><p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-10674-y\">Bennice et al.,</a></p><i>Scientific Reports</i>, 2025 under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0<p>Not all experts are convinced by the study, however. <a href=\"https://www.ulethbridge.ca/unews/person/dr-jennifer-mather\">Jennifer Mather</a>, a psychologist at the University of Lethbridge in Canada and an octopus expert who was not involved in the work, tells the <i>New York Times </i>that she’s skeptical about the way the researchers defined arm movements. Some of the described arm deformations, she says, could actually be considered the same movement, while other actions, such as “tiptoeing,” are more related to movement of the suckers rather than whole arms.</p><p>Still, she notes it’s important to have studies that look at octopus behavior in the wild. “This is a nice step on the way to getting a much better background for what the octopuses were actually doing with their arms,” Mather adds.</p><p>The researchers suggest their findings could inform the work of engineers designing soft robotic appendages. In fact, the study was partially funded by the U.S. Office of Naval Research, which hopes to develop more flexible robotic arms, according to a <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1097699\">statement</a> from the Marine Biological Laboratory.

According to a <a href=\"https://www.monumentsmenandwomenfnd.org/post/sale-of-nazi-looted-paintings-from-schloss-collection-stopped?srsltid=AfmBOopLPzkFP_HarE9iUWQiW-q89czepN3fVRYPgtfk0HsO-qsRr6ro\">statement</a>, citizens contacted the foundation’s “art leads” tip line about the Bosschaert paintings, which had been listed for sale by <a href=\"https://www.appletreeauction.com/about/about-us/\">Apple Tree Auction Center</a> in Newark, Ohio.</p>\n    <p>Unbeknownst to Apple Tree, the two small artworks—floral bouquets painted on copper—belonged to the collection of <a href=\"https://pilot-demo.jdcrp.org/essays/adolphe-schloss-collection/\">Adolphe Schloss</a>, a German Jewish collector, per the statement. Each painting bears an inventory number that the Germans added after seizing the collection in 1943: They’re marked “S 16” and “S 17”; the S stands for Schloss.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/7B2LAoTgK39JKxv9alk9deYNDHw=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(498x664:499x665)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/15/8b/158b7c38-9fab-40c4-97ba-2232542550d0/b39bbe_6184bd9fa6d24ac7995e7dfbe5a3713amv2.jpeg\" alt=\"dark vase\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.robertedsel.com/\">Robert M.

Upon learning of the works’ likely provenance, Apple Tree withdrew the paintings from sale.</p>\n    <p>“This case is another example of how people of goodwill can work together to right the wrongs of World War II, by returning looted works of art to their rightful owners,” Edsel says in the statement. “Within 48 hours of receiving this lead, the foundation documented the provenance of the works that supports the Schloss ownership, inspected the two paintings in person, attained the cooperation of the auction house to remove the pictures from their sale and reached out to the attorney for the Schloss heirs.”</p>\n    <h4>Quick fact: Ambrosius Bosschaert’s art</h4>\n    <p>Born in 1573, the renowned Dutch artist specialized in <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/artists/ambrosius-bosschaert-the-elder\">still-life</a> paintings of fruit and flowers. </p>\n    <p>Bosschaert’s artworks have sold for <a href=\"https://www.invaluable.com/artist/bosschaert-ambrosius-yzrm95l3oh/sold-at-auction-prices/?srsltid=ARcRdnprqKpywIuIAzHXs04n_TeHiwLT7PyyGDRuBg6qG8XrKKqa0A8U\">millions of dollars</a> at auctions. If authenticated, the recently identified pieces could be worth up to $1 million each, according to the <i>Dispatch</i>.</p>\n    <p>“I might be wrong,” Edsel tells the<i> Dispatch</i>. “But there’s point-zero, zero, zero, zero chance [of that].”</p>\n    <p>Schloss was born in Bavaria in 1842, and he spent most of his life in Paris. He collected <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/old-masters\">old master</a> paintings, especially Flemish and Dutch works. By the time he died in 1910, he owned at least 334 pieces. Nearly three decades later, in 1939, his children transferred his famed collection to bank vaults far from Paris. Despite these precautions, the Nazis found and seized the art in 1943, according to the <a href=\"https://pilot-demo.jdcrp.org/essays/fate-of-the-schloss-collection/\">Jewish Digital Cultural Recovery Project</a>. Both of the floral paintings are registered with photographs in the organization’s <a href=\"https://pilot-demo.jdcrp.org/artwork/bosschaert_fleurs_51628/\">digital record</a> of the Schloss collection.</p>\n    <p>The Nazis brought the paintings to Munich, where they were stored in Adolf Hitler’s headquarters, per the statement. That was the last time the artworks were seen.</p>\n    <p>As Edsel tells the <i>Columbus</i> <i>Dispatch</i>, it’s possible an American soldier illegally brought the Bosschaert paintings home with him as souvenirs. The paintings arrived at Apple Tree from abandoned safe-deposit boxes in Texas.</p>\n    <p>“The Monuments Men and Women Foundation receives missing art leads every day,” says foundation president <a href=\"https://www.monumentsmenandwomenfnd.org/board-of-trustees/anna-bottinelli?srsltid=AfmBOooqY8UzqKf0sG_T15pcmYAu7sXd4VSwzkgRc3FcqSZ-gAD7CXge\">Anna Bottinelli</a> in the statement. “It’s no surprise that these two paintings surfaced at a small auction house in the Midwest, but it could have happened anywhere. Hundreds of thousands of cultural objects looted during World War II are still missing. Some are in the United States, tucked away in attics, hanging on walls and stuffed in unopened boxes, passed down through generations.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/these-long-lost-17th-century-paintings-were-looted-by-the-nazis-they-just-surfaced-at-an-ohio-auction-house-180987336/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Ramadan starts at the beginning of March in Gaza, but it’s a different March and a different Ramadan to everyone else’s. The organization where I work has paused its child psychological support services because huge numbers of displaced people have relocated again and the map has changed, and because UNICEF, our funder, has halted activities in the Strip since the ceasefire came into effect. For now, the organization is only offering relief services and distributing parcels of clothing and fruit, so my job is put on hold. And so begins an arduous journey of applying for new jobs in the field; the stratospheric cost of living means I don’t have the luxury of sitting around at home. In Gaza, even breathing seems to cost money.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>On March 2, I receive a short text message instructing me to go the same day to a tent at a certain school to be interviewed for one of the jobs I’ve applied to. Since the start of the war, all official business has been conducted in tents at humanitarian shelters. I’m annoyed by this casual manner. Before the war, you’d receive a formal email informing you that you’d been selected for interview, along with a phone call to confirm the time and place, and when you got there you’d be served piping-hot coffee. But I’m doubly annoyed because I’ve promised my daughter I’ll take her shopping at a mall for Ramadan. Since the ceasefire was announced and displaced people have returned to the north, traders have resumed business, reopening their stores and cafés and even major shopping centers.</p>\n<p>I go to the interview and request that we finish promptly so I can leave in time to meet my daughter. I’ve planned to get to the mall early to avoid the rush, but when we arrive, the place is packed, and there are long queues of customers at the four cash tills. It’s horrendous; I’ve been putting off a shopping trip so I don’t have to see this sight. When I ask, I’m told that the Karam Abu Salem crossing, through which commercial goods enter the Strip, has been closed, so people are racing to stockpile what they need before famine comes knocking at the door. After two months of “luxury,” the enemy has decided to tighten the noose on the people and government of Gaza so as to secure the release of the prisoners of war.</p>\n<p>The next day I’m woken by another text message, this time telling me to go and pick up a suhur aid parcel: qamar al-din, dried hibiscus, some cheese and jam, and biscuits. Cigarettes have been back for a while, costing seven shekels each, but now that the commercial crossings have been closed, the price has started to rise again, by one shekel every day.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>On March 6 I find out I’ve got the job of drama teacher for a group of young women who are Arabic literature graduates, and I’m told I need to show up for work the very same day. How do I find this out? By text message. For goodness’ sake! Nothing has any sense of dignity about it anymore; major pieces of news arrive by SMS. I don’t pay it too much attention, because I have bigger worries: right now, my fridge contains food for suhur and iftar, fresh vegetables, and filling for Eid pastries, but for how long? When is the gas canister going to breathe its last?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/march-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Sharing a name with your child seemed bizarre. But writer Maggie Mertens pointed out that for centuries men have named sons after themselves, of course, so why can’t women name their daughters the same way? “For certain mothers, sharing a name with a child is an intrinsically feminist act simply because it’s unexpected in our society,” she writes.</p>\n    <p>“My brother’s a Junior, and his whole life, no one bats an eye when he and my dad give their names,” adds Susannah Wilson, who named her daughter Susannah. And Nancy Swider-Peltz, a former competitive speed skater said that naming her daughter after herself “was an enthusiastic decision that brought her joy.”</p>\n    <p>Some cultures seem to lean into namesakes more than others. In my boyfriend <a href=\"https://joannagoddard.substack.com/p/boyfriend-freddie-podcast\">Freddie’s</a> Italian-American family, there are countless Freds and Johns and Anthonys. As for the women? “My grandparents Fred and Patricia named two of their kids Fred and Patricia,” says Freddie. “Then my aunt Patricia named her daughter…Patricia.” And my Brazilian friend <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2018/06/06/giselas-gueiros-home-tour/\">Gisela</a> knows a woman, Antônia, in São Paulo, who was named after her mother, Antônia. “Zero percent creativity, 100 percent ancestry,” she laughs. “Sometimes you need to draw a family map.”</p>\n    <p>What do you think? <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2022/04/25/parenting-tween-teens/\">When I was pregnant</a>, I LOVED the name Anna for a girl, but “Joanna and Anna” sounded like <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2015/03/the-hardest-tongue-twister/\">a tongue twister</a>. The question was moot <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2015/12/21/on-having-two-boys/\">when we had two boys anyway</a>!</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>What baby names are you loving these days?

And if, like mine, yours refuse to eat school lunch, parents and caregivers gotta be packing lunches. It can quickly become a monotonous task, especially if you have a picky eater. But with the right gear, the whole process can be more fun for everyone. Below, find BA staffers’ favorite boxes, bags, and other food storage containers for packing kids’ lunches.</p>\n<h2>PackIt modular lunch containers</h2>\n<p>As a food writer (and, you know, loving mother), I probably shouldn’t admit this, but until I started using <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/2dJkVVomr493yiSud3yY6o5VEyesBDLCWnhoR7QqoWTf6QHeyZa6rRSpHbQRuKz77Qm4EDGVLPWpEoiLymqduSRJcjdyCEwx4YpQGVKDxGp7X2vNUYyxUtKis1ZBRjbmdTZ8zbJfDnuhmCH7MepGriCssRcPWVsVwqbuWPcnQJxMDtxbGA8M4ApH3M5GeywS8dvKRjWRcFfpaU5ozu1jBw5vBmHsAMgRHm1s6fmm1kvs5u7wdpMG1SMKZhGzQLUBQV9Z51r22ajZ93qFrrvgmxK4BrLAcK6oArpSBMbjyGRRvub9QQW45WVNZe8s32ha13b9t51oJeRFaiXUVuDXVjDcHk6DNtzqMCNEFFNYAeewr5uMPcrzh7Ax4bFV4juMQ2QPbV4ZXNSu4Y5hpy3pgtHCGLQTvcD38\">PackIt’s modular lunch containers</a>, I really hated packing my kids’ lunches. Each box comes with two dividers that can be popped into any of the eleven grooves, so you can make your lunchbox work for your lunch, versus trying to cram food into fixed-size containers. They’re super durable, completely dishwasher safe, and the lid is leakproof. (For even more flexibility, try the <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/8BFLxn9SwWrY9KwMG88YGaNoeh48U5RjpUj5sRJEQH2f8qnWcem6q8twiErQuxo3yHsTFK9N4aNbVwBVBauftTCGkjCB2cZY2fSDhMySAxnwmZUZncAPt5XdmjT32B2TyvCrHCQwhTdcv4n749YHDDQ8AMjAaMMXBzDH4drMAMV5Ccy1Vyf9KMQEHxstuFURS6nwYJg1mdjn7LQcYia7x1RDTXiLCCQCfaqoDSS5LiDZQMsGEmQtdD5Z4gCeBtqYVbjfFbwyRdGoxMXD8dV7gs9sFsWMaXTqUfgP5m4YmssrtkYA7h46CbNMCNcwBx6fVmN567zCYbfq9SjnthoE6zSS22nHKJbApAe3K2mTfB5rWwEJnDKUUyT8aJiqEnUa6wYjoYAzQNSpwu32f76bfoL8PGDkfgqFcW\">PackIt Flex</a>—which has bendy dividers and comes with a little snack/condiment container.</p>\n<h2>Omiebox Up</h2>\n<p>Senior Editor Noah Kaufman’s kids use the “terrifically versatile” <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/5RXFQ35D2cGEcCeJ95J8wC4Uqjr2LbESq2KD7i3dyqWzzZvgKSRUafQV9RuY6LFQxfWxH4a4Sbt2qoVnK6vcb2WCDP1oA7MWdQ5h7rkkkUMLmrpNpesadFwESVaCo1mWBrZgfL2XMiiBd3yFZ1BxNnML6ntxezUWXcFFEbsMYx9ebPurvBVPAfn3CmkLfDaGk4wC1EomUfF3MT2A4m6FppSUrKbNELc3b9nARaVXEre7krwzLvtGNjkqjvvag45wUwMbFrTBq7fP8knMVcVNyVtejFpCgiZ3nG3iREmsCegVFBWP4cbccBZndS2kZWtp9L4CbYXEgZRKgkhA68oprx1Ht71aJVJnu8uS4nhCgMPnCWU3BLELF2xAFtTqTeGuWd1yDCyjxmAEXBY\">Omiebox Up</a>. This hard lunch box not only looks cool, it can keep hot food hot and cold food cold—<i>at the same time</i>. Does your kid adore last night's mac and cheese as a lunchtime option? The included extra large thermal food jar can accommodate close to half a box, and, if you put it in hot at 7:30am, it'll still be that way by the time lunch hits at 11:30. Pop the included ice pack under the other side to keep the contents of those compartments cold too. Speaking of that side: the plastic divider provides a surprisingly impenetrable barrier against cross contamination, so you never have to worry about wet strawberries interacting with, say, baby carrots (because we all know that different foods are never supposed to touch). It’s also dishwasher safe.</p>\n<h2>Zojirushi Stainless-Steel Food Jar</h2>\n<p>Zojirushi’s vacuum-insulated mug always comes out on top when we’re <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-travel-coffee-mugs\">testing travel coffee tumblers</a> because it’s totally leakproof and keeps coffee popping hot for hours. Well, it turns out the same is true for the <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/2MivCay8tNdgaQiP3WKHCXDHamNgbGrgqAuuWnNAFxdUfdS2szPt7xssTYdpizHF9BTuJpSWfmLdkHxuGZNvnovsnuAjRKKY6MpMw4MKJDJMbEi15NMVD91yTqm8LaHvYbb16gnt3H2c2TJoHKq8utDUQPMsaEGX4n6V9f6HP2GeGtVqPq33jFT1FpNeaf3tJDTHVY6a1t3it2rG1qBP19MC9bmZPYe8ch2akKtQFkbwxNMCQ5Nrp2WwsMJaJoBSJcwyW6Cq9MLL2WdYFjjyPLyofQVMosUz981izQstC37hhwQeTMh2oGfgHtC1sZPMyhDVpqbqUbTNWKCo9hzezYZ9UJozaRo3XT2khnZPn82t5wrZHojdS45awr91hZLsAmx\">stainless steel food jar</a> that Test Kitchen director Chris Morocco brilliantly uses for… burrito transport!. He <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/5-uses-for-an-electric-kettle\">preheats the mug</a> with boiling water while microwaving a frozen burrito and once the burrito is done, he wraps it in parchment paper, then foil, then pops it into the food jar, where it stays nice and warm until lunch time. It’s not dishwasher-safe, but if you’re using Chris’s trick, it will be <i>super</i> easy to wash by hand.</p>\n<h2>Bentgo Kids Lunch Bag</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/gChDhNS3tFzZU66vjJXtGu9HNRAGfHwtRPmg4DRpWxudFBMchLLgLjoLp8S4FfMbwo74JWBppx7HYpNa9mgvBUgHStN1rDUC44h6sWNzRLCgpSpJ5mBQ286by6h8c6aVud3uMHrtnbaqbbDZKher9DHpB2opKRYLVBVK4dc2uiBj3a9SJzXKFJFN9MJX6oeNtJVsDUwb8e9MtoXP4tLqYSQbgPhrx6eLSU8RVXqXfMs5X2BNWcCpfEq6SXE1smpZDLDj1M1mwKgxCERkFiQYMN5rNVBCiRF3QH7seVACJBEka3tixaS37bgrjugywWtep8KBWKZQghg5si5GxcddSXJA3YDFnbpyCv8xRePZ8PTpKxrjSdNTEenK3JusjtQbFoVSQoFdL\">This double-insulated lunch bag</a> from Bentgo makes <i>so</i> much sense for kids.

    "body": "<p>KZ Barton will never forget the night in her early 20s when searing abdominal pain landed her in hospital. Every signal from her body was telling her something was extremely wrong.</p>\n<p>“When you experience pain that severe and you don’t understand it, you feel like you’re dying,” the Melbourne-based teacher and author says.</p>\n<p>But despite her pain being “without a doubt” worse than unmedicated childbirth, Barton says, an emergency department doctor discounted her pain.</p>\n<p>“He actually told me, ‘I don’t think you’re experiencing the pain that you’re presenting’.”</p>\n<p>It was one of many healthcare settings in which the now 36-year-old has felt “devalued, dismissed”, or treated as “a hysterical woman” since developing chronic pain, dizziness, gastrointestinal issues and other debilitating symptoms as a teen.</p>\n<p>She was finally diagnosed with endometriosis in her mid-20s. Diagnoses of adenomyosis, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome followed several years later.</p>\n<p>Barton’s story is not unusual. Two-thirds of Australian women have experienced gender bias or discrimination when seeking healthcare, a 2024 <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/ministers/the-hon-ged-kearney-mp/media/2-out-of-3-women-experience-discrimination-in-healthcare-0\">federal government survey</a> found. That survey revealed that feeling shrugged off or stereotyped as a “drama queen” is common – and often leads to delays in diagnosis and treatment.</p>\n<p>In a healthcare system made by men, for men, actively advocating for yourself as a patient isn’t a cure-all – but it helps. Here, women with experience share their advice on navigating medical systems.</p>\n<h2>Don’t be afraid to seek another opinion</h2>\n<p>Barton has a clear message for all patients: if a doctor dismisses your concerns, ask elsewhere.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately in our current society, you cannot assume that going in and saying, ‘something’s wrong, I need help’ will be enough,” she says. “Do not ever be afraid to see different doctors or specialists. Get a second, or a third, or a fourth opinion.”</p>\n<p>Dr Pav Nanayakkara, a gynaecologist at Jean Hailes for Women’s Health in Melbourne, is used to being the second opinion that finally makes a difference, and echoes Barton’s advice.</p>\n<p>“It is one of the most common stories I hear; women come in and tell me they’ve been living with pain for years, and have been told previously it’s just period pain … which is incredibly frustrating and disheartening,” says Nanayakkara.</p>\n<p>“Some of them have been told it’s things like anxiety, before they’ve even come to considering things like endometriosis.”</p>\n<p>If you feel dismissed, or “something doesn’t feel right in terms of management, absolutely, get a second opinion”, Nanayakkara says. If it’s a specialist you’re after, a good primary care doctor can often recommend someone.</p>\n<p>“If you can find a GP that takes you seriously, they are able to open the door to many other specialists and also find you pathways through the public system,” says Barton.</p>\n<p>Barton also suggests using peer support groups and your own social circle to find supportive healthcare providers. “Reach out to your friends and say, ‘hey, I’m dealing with these problems. Have you seen anyone who might be helpful, or do you have a helpful GP?’”</p>\n<h2>Public or private, you have rights</h2>\n<p>Patients with private health insurance have more freedom to choose which specialist they see, compared to patients in the public healthcare system.</p>\n<p>But Dr Jane Hutchens, a researcher at the University of Sydney’s Insight Research Institute, wants public patients to know they still have rights and options.</p>\n<p>“You can request a change of team – so if you don’t like your respiratory team, you can request a change. And that is absolutely valid and it happens,” says Hutchens, who has researched patient self-advocacy.</p>\n<p>“You can request to speak to the team leader, the manager, if you have particular concerns. And you can request to speak with the patient advocate, which every hospital has.”</p>\n<p>Whether you’re a public or private patient, you’re protected by <a href=\"https://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/our-work/partnering-consumers/australian-charter-healthcare-rights\">the Australian Charter of Healthcare Rights</a>, which sets out seven fundamental rights for all patients: access; safety; respect; partnership; privacy; information; and the right to give feedback.</p>\n<p>While not legally binding, this list can empower you to speak up if something feels wrong. So it’s worth brushing up on those rights and knowing that you’re <a href=\"https://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/sites/default/files/2020-07/charter_healthcare_rights_poster_16-9_landscape_-_may_2020.pdf\">entitled to</a> make a complaint without it affecting the way you’re treated.</p>\n<h2>Research your condition</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/16/you-are-worthy-and-deserving-of-help-six-practical-ways-to-navigate-medical-misogyny\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "author": "AventurOO Editorial",
    "body": "<p>The omnipresence of language, in its countless forms, is the foundation of Croatian artist Nora Turato’s multifaceted practice. A prolific collector of text, Turato gathers excerpts from books, news, overheard conversations, product packaging, and casual remarks, or her original writing—assembling them into an arsenal of material that is distilled into performances, installations, and bold wall paintings. The result is at once familiar and disorienting: fragments that feel recognizable yet stripped of context, rearranged, or repeated until their meaning stretches, fractures, or turns back on itself. In her command, words cease to be neutral vessels and instead reveal how culture is shaped and reshaped through language itself.</p>\n<p>Over the past decade, Turato has been the subject of numerous institutional solo exhibitions internationally, with notable recent shows including<i> pool7</i> at London’s Institute of Contemporary Arts (2025) and Amsterdam’s Stedelijk Museum (2024). This autumn, she will present a major new site-specific installation in Zagreb, her birthplace. The installation will mark Turato’s largest public project in Europe to date. </p>\n<h2>Biography &amp; Artistic Formation</h2>\n<p>Nora Turato was born in Zagreb in 1991 and grew up in Rijeka, alongside Croatia’s emergence as an independent nation following the breakup of Yugoslavia. Her early fascination with language was shaped by the influx of Western—and especially pop—culture into the country and its rapid adoption into the mainstream. As a teenager, she played in punk bands and produced music, which would later prove to be influential in her performance development and delivery.</p>\n<p>Following high school, Turato moved to the Netherlands in 2009 to study graphic design at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie and later at the Werkplaats Typografie—a path she once described as a “more pragmatic” choice than pursuing music. It was during her bachelor’s thesis that performance first entered her practice, sparked by a video project featuring her own voiceover. Turato later began to also foreground typography in her practice, investigating its \"manipulative and seductive power\" in shaping language.</p>\n<p>Turato’s early performances dissected the cacophony of the internet, drawing heavily from social media and the online idioms that have steadily seeped into everyday speech. In her often half-hour monologues, she has embodied morally ambiguous salesmen, exposed the anxious undercurrents of the wellness and self-improvement industry, and confronted the enduring taboo surrounding the female voice in public.</p>\n<h2>Language as a Medium</h2>\n<p>Turato’s performances, and their scripts, often serve as the genesis of each of her <i>pool</i> cycles—a body of work which purposely draws from the immediate, as a barometer for the shifting patterns of contemporary language and climate. To date, each of the <i>pools</i> thematically pushes the artist’s investigation into our collective relationships with language from different perspectives. If earlier cycles were more synonymous with the parlance of the online and digital, the latest <i>pool7</i> examines release from the governing nature of language, instead succumbing to more gestural and guttural forms of communication. Turato’s upcoming installation in Zagreb exemplifies this approach on a monumental scale, choosing to inscribe a primal scream around the length of the Meštrović Pavilion, home of the Croatian Association of Fine Arts. </p>\n<p><i>Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!</i>’, Kunsthalle Wien, Vienna, 2024. Claes Storm</p>\n<p>Turato’s <i>pool</i> iterations typically take shape over the course of a year, composed of collected texts interwoven with her own writing, forming the foundation of her monologue scripts. All of this language—both found and authored—is preserved in her <i>pool</i> publications, anthologies she equates to as “annual reports\" that capture the zeitgeist of their moment. Turato pulls these fragments of language further and incorporates them into her diverse practice spanning wall painting, sound, enamel panels, large-scale video installations, among other formats. </p>\n<p>The unifying thread across Turato’s practice is her sustained inquiry into our relationship with language—its authority over collective experience and its role in structuring communication. Through processes of appropriation and recontextualization, she exposes the instability of language, showing how words can shift, fracture, or collapse when subjected to new forms.</p>\n<h2>International Recognition</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/sponsored/what-do-words-mean-a-zagreb-born-artist-explores-how-language-shapes-our-collective-unconscious-180987291/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In reality, it is often young women on the receiving end of the loneliness crisis. Carpenter captures this in the title Man’s Best Friend<i>:</i> the feeling of dating men who release long-bottled emotions in romantic relationships rather than friendships. This undue pressure has led to fewer young women willing to enter relationships, a trend amplified as both genders are told to turn away from each other online.</p>\n<p>In Tears, Carpenter highlights this shift in young men’s respect for women: A little respect for women will get you very, very far / Offering to do anything, I’m like (Oh my god!). This low bar reflects a broader trend among gen Z men, who increasingly adhere to restrictive masculine norms and push back against gender equality. As of 2023, <a href=\"https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/STATE-OF-AMERICAN-MEN-2023.pdf\">55% of men</a> feel entitled to knowing their partner’s whereabouts, 42% believe they should always have the final say in relationships and men aged 18-23 are the <a href=\"https://www.equimundo.org/resources/state-of-american-men/\">least likely</a> to agree with the statement that “feminism has made America a better place”.</p>\n<p>As the market for digital intimacy balloons, the concerns raised in Man’s Best Friend show no clear path toward resolution. Instead, emerging technologies purporting to solve this “loneliness crisis” exploit a gendered gap – tapping into male insecurities, emotional suppression and the stigma around seeking help. AI girlfriend platforms like Candy.ai and Kindroid are exploding in popularity. Nor is it just men, as <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/talk-trust-and-trade-offs_2025_web.pdf\">72% of teens report using AI “companions</a>”. Instead of offering real support, they paywall intimacy and hyper-sexualized “companions”. Socialized to avoid vulnerability, boys are being funneled into digital relationships where emotional connection costs money and care is reduced to a buyable commodity. These platforms profit from keeping men emotionally isolated.</p>\n<p>In an online ecosystem where men’s outrage fuels engagement, Carpenter’s album art – showing her on all fours as a man pulls her by the hair – ignited a sensationalist stir, condemned by critics as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/14/sabrina-carpenter-week-in-patriarchy\">“soft porn for the male gaze”</a>. But was Carpenter pandering to or provoking the manosphere? When the album dropped, her lyrics confirmed what fans familiar with her discography could have guessed all along: a sharp, hyperaware take on gender power dynamics.

I had the opportunity to chat with Karen about her background as a screenwriter, her award-winning script, the craft of screenwriting, and what winning the Nicholl has meant to her.</p>\n    <p><strong>Scott Myers</strong>: Where did you grow up and when did you start to become interested in writing?</p>\n    <p><strong>Karen McDermott</strong>: I grew up in New Jersey, Central Jersey, just outside of Princeton. Jersey gets a bad rap, but I’m from the good part. [laughs] There’s a good part.</p>\n    <p><strong>Scott</strong>: The central part of New Jersey.</p>\n    <p><strong>Karen</strong>: That’s why they call it the Garden State.</p>\n    <p>I was interested in writing as far back as I can remember. I came by it naturally. My dad was an English professor, and my parents would read after dinner. That’s what we did in my house for fun. On weekends, we went to the library. My mom let me use her library card so I could take out more books than the children’s card allowed. So for me, writing came from reading; it was automatic.</p>\n    <p><strong>Scott</strong>: I am imagining that part of your character in the script your wrote <i>Lullabies</i>, which we’ll talk about just a bit, Dahlia, the main character, her interest in reading, maybe echoes your own.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://gointothestory.blcklst.com/go-into-the-story-interview-karen-mcdermott-60aea088b458?source=rss----cd46c47af086---4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Their reflections—proud, critical, and often funny—capture a nation juggling creativity and diversity with class tensions and post-Brexit unease. In an era of global identity crises, it’s a mirror well worth gazing into.</p><blockquote><p/><i>People from elsewhere get a lot wrong about our country.</i><p/><i>Garfield:</i>People with the British accent get away with a lot. People just imagine we’re smarter than we are. I’m not against that, personally…<p/><i>Cox:</i>[The world] doesn’t see how democratic we are, honestly. We are regarded as a monarchy, which we are, but that’s mainly a kind of carapace, rather than who we are.<p/><i>Dimoldenberg:</i>In people’s view, it’s either<a href=\"\">or</a><i>The Crown</i><i>Oliver Twist</i>, when actually there’s varied different groups across the spectrum of class, race and political divide.<p/><i>Isaacs:</i>I do think we’re less important than how we like to paint ourselves. I don’t think other countries really care what we think and what we say, but we have an outsized nuclear arsenal, and that gives us a place on the [UN] Security Council.</blockquote><h2>More picks on Britain</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/08/26/inside-the-world-of-the-great-british-bake-off/\">Inside the World of “The Great British Bake Off”</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“The show captures disastrous custard-making, quintessentially British faux-modesty, and the blistering hubris of bakers—including me.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/02/20/the-cats-meat-man/\">The Cat’s Meat Man</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“As cats evolved from feral ratters into beloved Victorian companions, a nascent pet-food economy arose on the carts of so-called ‘cat’s meat men.’</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2024/12/30/trespassing-for-the-common-good/\">Trespassing For The Common Good</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“In England, a movement is growing to defy enclosure by trespassing on private land.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2024/11/22/the-once-and-future-woods/\">The Once and Future Woods</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Cathedrals, seed banks, and oaks: How to live in times of change.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2024/11/21/our-coast-to-coast-walk-across-northern-england-was-an-exercise-in-hope-and-joy/\">Our Coast to Coast Walk Across Northern England Was an Exercise in Hope and Joy</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“My wife decided we needed an active outdoor getaway, a romantic ramble across moors and fells and three national parks.

    "body": "<p>National Hispanic Heritage Month is officially underway. Throughout this month, we’re called to honor people with roots in Latin America and Spain who have helped the U.S. flourish – quite literally, in the case of Latina entrepreneurs.</p>\n<p>According to the 2024 Wells Fargo Impact of Women-Owned Businesses <a href=\"https://www.wippeducationinstitute.org/_files/ugd/5cba3e_d7a711eb3d514728aa4d3a7bd32a8b36.pdf\">report</a>, there are 2 million Latina-owned businesses in the U.S., which collectively employ over<a href=\"https://www.nwbc.gov/2019/10/15/400-hispanic-women-owned-businesses-are-launched-each-day/\"> </a>845,000 and generate $175.2 billion in revenue. Those numbers are poised to keep growing, as Latina entrepreneurs launch roughly 400 new businesses <i>per day</i>, <a href=\"https://www.mbda.gov/sites/default/files/media/files/2018/2018-state-of-women-owned-businesses-report.pdf\">research</a> by American Express shows.</p>\n<p>Honoring Latina women – celebrating their achievements and appreciating their contributions to our economy and culture – takes on new importance as President Donald Trump and his fellow conservatives ramp up  harmful anti-immigration policies and sentiments. One example: Just this week, the U.S. Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/scotus-racial-profiling-21036933.php\">ruled in favor</a> of allowing law enforcement to racially profile individuals based solely on superficial factors, such as the color of their skin or the language they’re speaking.</p>\n<p>That’s why we’ve compiled these thoughtful quotes from 10 successful Latina women entrepreneurs and business leaders – to elevate their voices, showcase their wisdom and appreciate what they have given to this nation through their presence, creativity and hard work.</p>\n<h2>“Don’t fight back that rhetoric with words, but with actions.”</h2>\n<p>In 2012, <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/paty-funegra-la-cocina-va-immigrants-opportunities/\">Paty Funegra</a> founded La Cocina VA (now called <a href=\"https://www.kitchenofpurpose.org/\">Kitchen of Purpose</a>), a community kitchen that offers culinary education to Latin-Americans. As anti-immigration sentiment became amplified by President Donald Trump, Funegra became even more committed to helping the most vulnerable. Her quote is a testament to her belief that fighting back with the same hurtful speech won’t do the community any good.</p>\n<p>Selena Gomez at the 2024 Golden Globes. (Credit: IHeartRadioCA YouTube video, Wikimedia Commons)</p>\n<h2>“Being rare is about being comfortable with yourself. I've stopped trying to be perfect. I just want to be me.”</h2>\n<p>Selena Gomez was already an accomplished actor and award-winning artist with millions of followers on Instagram. Then, in 2020, she entered the world of entrepreneurship — naming her product <a href=\"https://www.rarebeauty.com/\">Rare Beauty</a>. Gomez’s beauty line sells makeup made without animal-derived ingredients and byproducts. Sustainability is woven into the packaging, too, which is 100% recyclable. </p>\n<p>Co-Founder of EBY Renata Black. (Credit: EBY)</p>\n<h2>“The nutty thing about success is that it is an ever-changing goal.”</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.join-eby.com/\">EBY,</a> a company that sells seamless, comfortable underwear for every body type, has won fans, followers and accolades thanks to its co-founders, <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/renata-black-eby/\">Renata Black</a> and Sofia Vergara. Ten percent of EBY’s sales are donated to women in poverty in the form of micro-finance infusions, giving women the opportunity to start their own businesses. The company counts numerous celebrities and influencers among its customer base, and says it has empowered thousands of women and girls to take charge of their financial freedom. This quote speaks to the power of keeping one’s mind open, and their work shows how impactful a multi-pronged approach can be.</p>\n<p>Founder and COO of The Honest Company Jessica Alba.

In interviews with NBC’s “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/bFgUBqtQT_8\">Today</a>” and other media outlets, Alba has said people doubted her abilities to build a successful business when she first started up. While the company has weathered lawsuits over the years related to how its ingredients are labeled, Alba seems to have exceeded expectations. The Honest Company is now a public company making close to $400 million in revenue each year.</p>\n<p>Beautyblender founder Rea Ann Silva.

Once cool enough to handle, peel them.</p>\n    <p>Spoon the hot rice into bowls, top with the roast vegetables, eggs and peanut sauce, scatter over the sesame seeds (or salted peanuts) and serve.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/15/quick-and-easy-bibimbap-recipe-miso-peanut-sauce-rukmini-iyer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The headline act on day four of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/new-york-fashion-week\">New York fashion week</a> had all the hallmarks of a typical designer catwalk, including a pulsating soundtrack and a front row peppered with Hollywood stars. However, there was a twist. Instead of a luxury brand staging the show on Sunday, it was the high street label Cos.</p>\n<p>The Swedish label, founded in 2007 by the H&amp;M group, welcomed guests including the British actors Jodie Turner-Smith and Naomi Watts as well as the singer Lauryn Hill to a former 1890s rope factory in Brooklyn.</p>\n<p>Now used as a warehouse space, the brand had erected a vast cracked concrete-effect catwalk around which were rows of steel benches. The brutalist style also extended to the clothing, with a colour palette of metal greys and charcoal. Oversized coats ranging from cashmere to leather were tightly cinched with skinny belts. Trousers pooled around glove-like leather shoes, while lapels on shirts and jumpers were knife sharp.</p>\n<p>Sandwiched between heritage American brands such as Ralph Lauren and Coach, the appearance of Cos on this week’s schedule reflects a wider attempt by the high street to move beyond its fast fashion reputation.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, Cos’s sister brand H&amp;M will kick off London fashion week with a show styled by Katie Grand, a British creative director who works regularly with Marc Jacobs and Prada, and starring the Vogue models Alex Consani and Paloma Elsesser. In August, Topshop returned to the catwalk after a seven-year absence with a show in Trafalgar Square that featured Cara Delevingne.</p>\n<p>Joy Montgomery, the shopping editor at British Vogue, says high street brands are under growing pressure to win customer loyalty, a feat that is “becoming increasingly tough when you consider headwinds such as the cost-of-living crisis, high-street closures, and the stratification of the market between ultra-fast fashion and ultra-high-end luxury. The middle-ground is where the battle is being fought.”</p>\n<p>This type of “luxe-washing” also extends to high street brands collaborating with designers and celebrities. Zac Posen, who carved out a name for his eponymous label by dressing Rihanna and Sarah Jessica Parker, designs for Gap. Uniqlo’s creative director is the ex-Chloé and Givenchy designer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/feb/14/uniqlo-kendrick-lamar-coup-effort-serious-fashion-force\">Clare Waight Keller,</a> best known for designing Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex’s wedding dress. Meanwhile, Zara has partnered with everyone from Kate Moss to Stefano Pilati, and Mango has worked with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/apr/23/victoria-beckham-collaboration-high-street-mango\">Victoria Beckham</a>, a trend spearheaded by H&amp;M when it <a href=\"https://hmgroup.com/news/hm-celebrates-20-years-of-designer-collaborations-with-limited-pre-loved-pieces/\">launched its first collection</a> with Chanel’s Karl Lagerfeld in 2004.</p>\n<p>While Cos’s catwalk pieces are typically higher than its main collection, they are still a fraction of the price of designer brands. Sunday’s show included a leather funnel-neck top for £299 and draped midi skirt that costs £229. There were also several <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/feb/13/four-figure-coats-high-street-fixture\">four-figure coats</a>, including glossy pony hair and collarless shearling versions.</p>\n<p>While Cos previously demarcated its catwalk collection from its main line in stores by using the sub-brand Cos Atelier, this season the brand decided to drop the name.</p>\n<p>Speaking before the show, its creative director, Karin Gustafsson, who has been with the brand since its inception, said it was to avoid customer confusion. “All our work is about making the best type of product. Everything we do is rooted in craft and innovation, so having a special label didn’t make sense.”</p>\n<p>While higher prices and limited availability are part of the perception of luxury, often the care labels on high street brands tell a different story. Synthetic fabrics such as petroleum-derived polyester and nylon are frequently listed.</p>\n<p>Montgomery says while catwalk shows can “cut through the noise of online marketing”, it is “by no means a one-size-fits-all solution. There is a risk that it becomes just another gimmick for brands to jump on without consideration or strategy. “Consumers are more tuned into authenticity than ever before, and all it can take is one wrong move for their loyalty to be placed elsewhere.”</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-15\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<h2>Gwyneth Paltrow’s label rebrands</h2>\n<p>Earlier in the day, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gwynethpaltrow\">Gwyneth Paltrow</a> held a presentation at a design gallery in Tribeca to launch her rebranded fashion label.

During the Great Depression, for example, African American educator <a href=\"https://archives.nypl.org/scm/20900\">Melva L. Price</a> agitated for human dignity and expanded rights for Black people from her home in New York City’s Harlem neighborhood. Born in Belmont, North Carolina, on November 14, 1902, Price came of age during the <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/long-lasting-legacy-great-migration-180960118/\">Great Migration</a>, as thousands of Black Southerners relocated to Northern and Western cities. While Northern cities had their own challenges, Black Southerners often viewed them as havens in a period marred by Jim Crow segregation and <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/when-white-supremacists-staged-the-only-successful-coup-in-us-history-180985400/\">white supremacist violence</a>.</p>\n<p>The family’s relocation in 1905, at first to New York when Price was 3, paid off. They rented an apartment in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Harlem, found steady employment and enrolled their children in the best schools they could find—sometimes ones far from their residence. Before the family moved closer to the school, Price traveled about an hour to attend P.S. 158, an integrated and coed primary school in Brooklyn. She excelled in her studies, <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-chat-miss-melva-price-is-being-congr/69815885/\">graduating as valedictorian</a>—the only Black girl in a class of 37—in 1916.</p>\n<h3>\n        <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/0393882292?tag=smithsonianco-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\">\n          Without Fear: Black Women and the Making of Human Rights\n        </a>\n      </h3>\n<p>Keisha N. Blain’s new book tells how, during American history, Black women made humans rights theirs: From worldwide travel and public advocacy in the global Black press to their work for the United Nations, they courageously and effectively moved human rights beyond an esoteric concept to an active, organizing principle.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/0393882292?tag=smithsonianco-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\"/></p>\n<p>Even at the age of 13, Price was involved in local activism and civic work. Several newspapers took notice of her extraordinary accomplishments. A local school board member <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-afro-american-melva-l-price/180743675/\">praised her</a> at length: “A little girl of the Negro race carried off everything in sight, intellectually speaking.”</p>\n<p>In 1924, Price graduated from <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-afro-american-wins-phi-beta-key/180744525/\">Hunter College</a> and embarked on a career as an educator. She was passionate about teaching and deeply committed to improving school facilities for Black students in the city. In a short period of time, Price moved from a teacher-in-training to the <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/new-pittsburgh-courier-race-girl-given-c/180735142/\">head of a department</a> at a large school. Her actions were at least partly guided by her deep commitment to Black students.</p>\n<p>But those efforts began to take a toll on her health. While juggling teaching and graduate study, she had struggled to keep up with the growing demands on her time and had missed some of her classes due to “nerves,” according to letters housed in the <a href=\"https://archives.nypl.org/scm/20900\">Price papers</a> at the <a href=\"https://www.nypl.org/locations/schomburg\">Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture</a>. Price may have also been struggling with anemia, which forced her to take a short time away from teaching to rest and recuperate.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/new-pittsburgh-courier-race-girl-given-c/180735142/\"/></p>\n<p>Racist experiences added insult to injury. In April 1933, while attending a conference on civil rights activism in Washington, D.C., Price was <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-new-york-age-new-york-agemelva-pric/86667605/\">refused service</a> at the Hamilton Hotel, where she and other attendees had planned to grab a meal. White delegates at the conference left the hotel in defiance of the act of discrimination; Price’s reaction went unrecorded.</p>\n<p>Through the 1930s, Price continued to change schools, searching for the best job as economic times were getting more difficult. During the Great Depression, when many Black Americans fought to survive under <a href=\"https://www.history.com/articles/last-hired-first-fired-how-the-great-depression-affected-african-americans\">constrained circumstances</a>, she expanded her social activism by taking up human rights issues such as quality health care and better education for all. To that end, she aligned herself with the <a href=\"https://aas.princeton.edu/publications/research/african-american-women-and-christian-activism-new-yorks-black-ywca-1905-1945\">Young Women’s Christian Association</a> and the oldest Black Greek-letter sorority, <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/discover-the-special-meaning-behind-kamala-harris-pearls-180976766/\">Alpha Kappa Alpha</a> (AKA).</p>\n<p>Price’s <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-call-surgeon-general-praises-aka/180745426/\">social work</a> with the AKAs provided a vital platform for the young teacher to advance human rights activism. In the absence of <a href=\"https://hrlibrary.umn.edu/edumat/hreduseries/hereandnow/Part-1/short-history.htm\">formal organizations</a> explicitly committed to human rights, groups like the AKAs offered a medium for Black women to advance universal rights for all people, regardless of citizenship status.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Italo-Ethiopian_War#/media/File:Abyssinian-soldiers-1936-142348340618.jpg\">Public domain via Wikimedia Commons</a></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/during-the-great-depression-this-black-educator-looked-to-conflicts-abroad-for-lessons-on-fighting-racism-at-home-180987321/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>Shaped largely through fashion shoots for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/feb/19/the-face-magazine-culture-shift-review-fashion-photography-national-portrait-gallery-london\">the Face</a> magazine, the duo created a look that reflected the culture and creativity of London at the time, but gave it the classy and cinematic feel of a Marlon Brando portrait or a shot by Henri Cartier-Bresson. This beautifully lit black-and-white photography of street-cast models and people – including a then-unknown Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell, Neneh Cherry and Nick Kamen, who later went on to star in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q56M5OZS1A8\">Levi’s famous 1985 launderette advert</a> – went on to shape both fashion photography and fashion.</p>\n<p>Still, defining the Buffalo aesthetic is not easy. Speaking to the Guardian, Morgan covers everything from Buffalo as “a collective” rather than a look, to the genesis of its name (they took inspiration from Bob Marley’s 1983 track Buffalo Soldier and the buffalo as used by Native Americans). “It’s grown to be more of an attitude,” he says. “It’s being independent, being authentic in who you are, being a bit of a maverick, being an outsider, not curtailing to the industry.”</p>\n<p>Morgan is speaking ahead of the publication of a new book, <a href=\"https://www.ideanow.online/1985\">1985 Buffalo</a>, published by Idea Books, which features images from shoots by Morgan and Petri from 1985. Naomi Campbell was pivotal in the book’s commission. “She did her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/article/2024/jun/19/naomi-in-fashion-lighthearted-va-show-celebrates-the-supermodel\">exhibition at the V&amp;A</a> [and asked to feature these images],” Morgan says. Looking for the images, he discovered a box in his archives labelled “1985”. As well as the Campbell shots, it had “all the shoots you see in the book”. This chance discovery speaks to the time. “We never thought of a legacy,” he says. “We had no idea that [Buffalo] was going to become so much part of British culture. We were just doing our thing.”</p>\n<p>Morgan met Petri in 1982 but he says it wasn’t until 1985 that “we were in our full flow”. As well as young supermodels, the year boasts what is probably the most iconic Buffalo image – that of 12-year-old model Felix Howard (the son of a friend) dressed in a suit, polo neck and fedora featuring a ripped piece of newspaper showing the word “killer”, staring directly at the camera. Part punk, part James Cagney via Bugsy Malone, it’s a provocative image, and it became <a href=\"https://thefaceandid.com/products/the-face-magazine-1985-felix-howard\">the cover of the Face in March 1985</a>.</p>\n<p>“We were changing the nature of styling quite quickly,” he says. “This shoot crystallised the fact that fashion photography was not about clothes … It was about attitude, styling, DIY, [an] accumulation of ideas, cultural references, film references … I think that’s why it really resonated with so many people.”</p>\n<p>Rather than designer clothes, Buffalo was about secondhand finds, army surplus pieces and dressing up. “We’d get a secondhand double-breasted pinstripe and then mix it with a tracksuit that we’d get from a sports shop,” Morgan says. Characters were crucial, from the gangster movies that inspired the Howard shoot to Black cowboys. “We realised they had been very instrumental in the American culture, but had been whitewashed completely,” he says. “Now with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/jan/17/pharrell-williams-showcases-american-western-louis-vuitton-collection-paris\">Louis Vuitton</a>, it’s become a thing. But at the time, we were like, ‘Wow, look at these incredible Black cowboys.’”</p>\n<p>Some of the images haven’t dated well 40 years on – a Native American headdress worn as an accessory, which could be viewed as cultural appropriation. Morgan also says he put an image of a topless Howard on social media, and was inundated with comments on how he was “sexualising young kids” with others saying, “‘What are you talking about? You must be perverted if you see that as a sexual image.”’ He concedes that doing the same picture in 2025 would have a different reaction. “Now, you couldn’t do it,” he says.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/11/buffalo-photographer-jamie-morgan-ray-petri-celebrities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Our homes and work spaces influence our mood and stress levels (even our <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/wind-down-routine/\">sleep</a>!). Who wouldn’t want to inhabit a space that inspires more joy? Feng shui isn’t about owning the trendiest pieces or having the most beautiful looking room. It’s so much more about energy.</p>\n<p>The good news is that you don’t need to spend lots of money to infuse more peace and harmony into your space. Whether you’re seeking calm, sparking inspiration, or creating deeper connection, your home can set the tone. These simple feng shui interior design principles will help you bring balance and beauty into your space—starting today.</p>\n<h2>Clear Your Entryway</h2>\n<p>Your front door sets the tone for how energy enters your home. It is, after all, the first space you step into when you arrive, and it’s also the first space guests see as you welcome them into your home. It’s incredibly important in feng shui, as it’s considered the “mouth of chi” or the main point of entry for energy and positive vibes to flow. Be sure to keep your entryway uncluttered, well-lit, and welcoming. Don’t be afraid to add decor as well like plants or framed photos. Let your entryway set the tone for your entire space!</p>\n<h2>Reduce Clutter</h2>\n<p>In feng shui, clutter blocks energy and flow. Piles of stuff are truly a buzz kill in an otherwise tidy space, and excess clutter can cause stress. You probably know the spots that are cluttered in your own home, and if you’d like to add a little more peace and balance, take the time to declutter and organize, especially in high traffic areas. Even tucking away your clutter behind closed doors like a closet or drawer can help you feel lighter and more relaxed.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Want Your Home to Feel More Peaceful? Try These Feng Shui Tricks&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-find-your-flow-at-home-through-feng-shui/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/japandi-minimalist-bedroom3-865x649.jpeg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Balance the Five Elements</h2>\n<p>I took an interior design class over the pandemic, and this is the one design tool that has stuck with me ever since. Feng shui seeks to balance five natural elements—wood, fire, earth, metal, and water—in every space. If each of the elements is present in a room, it will not only look balanced, but it will <i>feel</i> balanced as well. The five elements are:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Wood</strong>: plants, wood furniture, green tones</li>\n      <li><strong>Fire</strong>: candles, fireplaces, warm colors</li>\n      <li><strong>Earth</strong>: ceramics, terracotta, sandy hues</li>\n      <li><strong>Metal</strong>: metal accents, white or gray tones</li>\n      <li><strong>Water</strong>: fountains, mirrors, deep blues</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>When these elements are thoughtfully distributed throughout a room, it creates a feeling of harmony and helps prevent a space from feeling flat or unbalanced. The easiest place to try this yourself? Your shelves. Try styling a shelf with all of the elements present. If something feels off, check in to see what element is missing. Have fun!</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Want Your Home to Feel More Peaceful? Try These Feng Shui Tricks&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-find-your-flow-at-home-through-feng-shui/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/camille-styles-bedroom-coffee-table-865x1296.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Let Fresh Air and Light In</h2>\n<p>To allow chi (or energy) to flow freely, feng shui interior design relies on fresh air and sunlight. Open your windows, allow the sun to stream through your windows and add plants to your home as well—they will help purify the air! If your home doesn’t get much natural light, try adding warm bulbs to lamps (avoid a big overhead light) and allow your interior lighting to mimic what’s happening outside. This will help your home stay connected to a natural rhythm.</p>\n<h2>Place Mirrors Strategically</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-find-your-flow-at-home-through-feng-shui/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>If I’ve learned one thing from the creative women that work at Camille Styles, it’s that the rituals we return to each season are <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/health/healthy-habits/habit-hacks/\">more than just habits</a>—they’re intentional choices that shape how we feel in our day-to-day lives. Fall, in particular, always invites our team to reset: the light shifts, the air cools, and we naturally crave routines that ground us while still sparking joy during the year’s <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/holiday-stress/\">busiest months</a>.</p>\n<h2>The Fall Wellness Habits Our Editors Are Practicing Right Now</h2>\n<p>From AM fall wellness habits that get the day off on the right foot, to <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/night-routine/\">nighttime rituals</a> that lead to blissful sleep, our team has curated the practices we’re leaning into right now. Think of this as your inspiration board—editor-approved, tried-and-true ideas and habits, filtered through the lens of real life.</p>\n<h2>Morning Rituals That Set the Tone</h2>\n<h3>A revamped morning and evening routine</h3>\n<p>I’ve always called myself a morning person—but after a summer of nonstop travel and late nights, I’ve been hitting snooze more than I’d like to admit. For me, fall is the ultimate reset (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/05/style/great-lock-in-tiktok.html\">the Great Lock In</a> makes me feel seen). So this season, I’m setting the intention to fall asleep naturally, wake up energized, and start my mornings with purpose. That looks like creating nighttime rituals that actually support rest and carving out an <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/morning-routine-ideas/\">AM routine</a> that feels both grounding and inspiring. Think: a workout, quiet time with my book and tea, and a breakfast that’s as beautiful as it is nourishing. <i>-Isabelle Eyman, Editorial Strategist</i></p>\n<h3>Chilly morning walks</h3>\n<p>There’s nothing I love more than getting up early in the fall here in Chicago when the air is super crisp and chilly. It’s an invigorating start to the day that ensures I keep up my movement habit even when it becomes cold in the Midwest. Rounding out my bundled up lakeside walks with a delicious coffee treat also becomes a bit of a ritual this time of year, and it truly makes me feel my best throughout the whole day. <i>-Suruchi Avasthi, Food Editor</i></p>\n<h3>Ice rolling in the AM</h3>\n<p>I love starting my mornings with an ice roller. It instantly depuffs my face, boosts circulation, and helps me feel awake and energized. The cool feeling is super refreshing and gets my skin ready for the rest of my routine, leaving it fresh and smooth for the day. <i>– Tatom Hoffmann, Marketing Intern </i></p>\n<p>Doré</p>\n<p>The Skinny Confidential</p>\n<h2>Nighttime Wind-Downs That Nourish</h2>\n<h3>An evening bath</h3>\n<p>An evening bath at the end of a long day is one of my favorite things in the world. My family knows that when I shut the bathroom door, it’s my quiet time. I dim the lights, light a candle, and pour some <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-20732593\">Epsom salts </a>into the hot running water. (Pro tip: I get the less expensive Epsom salt because you need to use a LOT of it, like a full 1 to 2 cups.) Then I’ll put on a face mask and let it sit while I read a book, listen to a podcast, or just lie my head back and close my eyes. After drying off, I slather on a nourishing body oil head to toe. <i>– Camille Styles, Editor-in-Chief</i></p>\n<p>Casa Zuma</p>\n<p>True Botanicals</p>\n<h3>Aromatherapeutic oil cleansing</h3>\n<p>I like to switch up my beauty routine every season. Minimalist in the summer. Maximalist in the winter. When the coziness of fall calls, I crave rituals that feel luxurious and nourishing. I always add this Monastery cleansing oil to my double cleansing routine. It’s a rich oil that gently washes off the day (even makeup!), deeply nourishes my skin, and preps me for my skincare routine. But more than that, it smells incredible. I look forward to the aromatherapeutic effects of breathing in the rich rose scent when I wake up and when I get home. <i>– Langa Chinyoka, Beauty Editor</i></p>\n<p>Monastery</p>\n<h2>Seasonal Food &amp; Drink Rituals</h2>\n<h3>Pumpkin spice in my morning coffee</h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/fall-wellness-habits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I even found a </strong>\n      <strong>county </strong>\n      <strong>court </strong>\n      <strong>judg</strong>\n      <strong>ment (CCJ) had been issued against me without my knowledge.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>It turns out I shared my maiden name with the person who does own the debt, although we have different middle names and live in different counties. I’ve repeatedly asked the debt collectors to remove me from their records.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>I’ve involved a solicitor, and even reported it to the police but nothing works.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>The latest letter insists I owe £146 to a telecoms company I’ve never been with.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>My credit score has been affected and I was refused a mortgage. When will it end?\n  KS, </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i/>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Wolverhampton</strong>\n    <p>The sense of stress and impotence caused by a threatening demand for a stranger’s debt is incalculable. Some of those you have received over the years threaten bailiff visits and legal action. When the CCJ was taken out in your name, fines were added to the sum you were said to owe.</p>\n    <p>You have now successfully applied for the CCJ to be set aside.</p>\n    <p>Your namesake, who was identified to you by one of the collection agents, in itself a GDPR breach, appears to owe money to payday lenders and a telecoms company, among others.</p>\n    <p>You have been contacted by more than half a dozen debt collection agents and their legal representatives over the years. Your log of communications with each of them shows the dizzying number of emails, letters and phone calls you’ve had to send or make. As soon as one company falls silent, another pops up.</p>\n    <p>One collector, which resumed its demands months after removing you from its records, concluded insultingly that the debtor must be an ex-partner of yours and told you to disassociate your accounts from them.</p>\n    <p>The core of the problem is the long chain of businesses involved in enforcing a debt. Big companies that can’t get a customer to pay up often sell the debt to a collection agency. The collection agency will typically use a debt tracing firm to locate the errant debtor. And debt tracing firms may subcontract to other companies.</p>\n    <p>The depressing truth is that anyone can set up as a debt tracing firm and there’s no official oversight of their methods and sources.</p>\n    <p>According to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), which regulates data protection, creditors must take “reasonable steps” to ensure that the information unearthed by a trace is accurate before contacting an individual. A matching name and birth date is not considered sufficient to link someone to a debt.</p>\n    <p>Anyone who is chased for an unrecognised debt should write to the collection agency requiring it to send evidence of money owed and to put the account on hold in the meantime.</p>\n    <p>If evidence is not supplied and the company continues to send demands, they can <a href=\"https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/\">complain to the ICO</a>, or, in the case of a financial company, to the <a href=\"https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/make-complaint\">Financial Ombudsman Service</a>.</p>\n    <p>However, an upheld complaint will not necessarily stop other companies using the inaccurate link. I contacted the latest agency to pursue you, CRS Recovery, whose website promises “to do everything we can to help you get to a better place”.</p>\n    <p>A month after promising to leave you in peace, it resumed demands for an unpaid phone bill. I asked how it had found and verified your information, but no response came.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

The sharpness of a fresh, herby chutney with salty butter, meanwhile, makes the perfect topping for barbecued corn on the cob. I often cook the corn straight on the hob, which is a bit tricky, but it’s how we did it when I was growing up in India.</p>\n    <h2>Corn on the cob curry (pictured top)</h2>\n    <p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>45 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>4-6</strong></p>\n    <p>For the curry<strong>4 corn</strong><strong> cobs</strong>, cut in half widthways<strong>2-3 tbsp peanut oil</strong>, or sunflower oil<strong>\n  1 tsp cumin seeds\n  4 garlic cloves</strong>, peeled and finely chopped</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>20 curry leaves<br/>400ml coconut milk<br/>1 tsp salt</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>400ml coconut milk</p>\n    <p>1 tsp salt</p>\n    <p>For the curry paste<strong>40g</strong><strong> fresh coriander</strong>, leaves and stalks<strong>10g</strong><strong> fresh mint,</strong> leaves only<strong>6 garlic cloves</strong>,<strong> </strong>peeled<strong>2½cm piece fresh ginger</strong>, peeled<strong>\n  4 green chillies</strong>, stalks discarded, flesh roughly</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>chopped (remove the pith and seeds if you prefer less heat)</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>, peeled and roughly chopped<br/>1 medium-sized red onion</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>1 medium-sized red onion</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>1 tsp cumin seeds<br/>1 tsp black pepper</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>1 tsp black pepper</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong><br/>2 tsp soft brown sugar<br/>½ tsp ground turmeric</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>2 tsp soft brown sugar</p>\n    <p>½ tsp ground turmeric</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong><br/>4 tbsp lime juice</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>4 tbsp lime juice</p>\n    <p>Put the corn pieces in a pan, cover with water and bring to a boil.

Saffron, onion, lemon juice, tomato paste, black pepper, and yogurt work together to tenderize the meat and create the signature balance of acidity, sweetness, and umami that defines so many Persian chicken kebab recipes.</p>\n    <p>No grill? No problem. Just lay the marinated thighs on a foil-lined baking sheet and slide them under the broiler on high heat until charred and cooked through.</p>\n    <p>Serve the saffron chicken with raw or lightly grilled tomatoes and <a href=\"https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/lavash\">warm lavash</a> (baste it with olive oil and sumac for bonus points). Any leftover garlicky labneh is a gift. Nosrat recommends enjoying it with vegetables, fish, crudités, chips, crackers, or pita—basically, everything.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>This recipe was adapted for style from ‘Good Things’ by Samin Nosrat.

Sitting in the Bon Appétit offices in 2017, leafing through an advance copy of the Chez Panisse–trained chef ’s debut, curiosity quickly turned to a knowing sort of awe. “Whoa,” I recall muttering out loud. “She actually…did it.”</p>\n<p>The “it,” in this case, was defying every commandment of modern cookbook publishing. Thou shalt develop a hundred crowd-pleasing recipes. Said recipes shalt be adjacent to glossy photographs. Thou shalt pose for the cover, ideally smiling and having a casually joyous time. It was, instead, 480 pages of beautiful blasphemy. A painstaking, profoundly nuanced master class in the fundamentals of cooking, with recipes that were not merely ends in themselves but opportunities to hone one’s newfound skills. For those of us in the business of writing about food, Nosrat’s book validated something we knew but rarely expressed. Recipes can only take you so far—<i>this</i> is how you learn to be a better cook.</p>\n<p>It seemed a dubious proposition in a media moment characterized by instant gratification, one that privileged “one cool trick” over patient interrogation of processes. And yet, <i>Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat</i> was a runaway hit. Bestseller lists. A James Beard Award. Features in magazines. A four-part Netflix series. Nosrat had a deal for a second book and nowhere to go but up.</p>\n<p>But behind the scenes she was struggling. The book was her life’s work, the culmination of a 17-year-long career, and now that it was in the world she felt unmoored. “My whole life was on a trajectory toward that book,” she says. “I was so focused on achievement for so long. And then I got somewhere and looked up and I was like, why? What do I have to show for this? I’m not actually full of joy. I don’t feel lighter.” She was diagnosed with depression. Started two versions of that second book, each as ambitious as her first, and gave up; she even tried to give back her advance. Suffered through the isolation of the pandemic, and her father’s long illness and death, a year in which she subsisted on watermelon and Trader Joe’s frozen pizza. “I had to ask myself, in the wake of all the things that I was going through…what am I going to say about cooking?”</p>\n<p>The answer, after eight years of soulsearching, is called <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/4V7YJyp8h9anWf3tuHLgMT1rFunP9ycnV4i4u7hzJed3X26JvTLwbGkMCjMtTj17qpQEPV55kEaMFKDf5iKnHAZZB25ZfC3iRD5chK9EEPmC3wFXekcHimADyNNnDHYma9dcCBuNhYNywBzEjVpgmq55EeHceNJzALcWA2kAWKmFmeUdYRuoMdokLDZkErWkP6f58VyKGgg9xWB1efPPjEnG3TQNxVuuFWZKVMkRFBFzhA5kmNQ1hWF6dGL8EDiyQtt4jJ7irCNurPXMATina6K9dNmNaisec1KrFcw2fC\"> Good Things: Recipes and Rituals to Share With People You Love</a>. If the mission of her first book was to teach readers how to be good cooks, her latest is all about why anyone should want to be a good cook in the first place, a question that is as existential as it is practical. Not for the praise, not for self-aggrandizing satisfaction of a dish made perfectly. But because gathering the people you care about is essential to a meaningful life.</p>\n<p>“At some point I realized that’s what’s motivating me. Being around people,” she says. “And when I think about all the meals that I remember, it’s not the food that made them memorable, it’s the gathering.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/samin-nosrat-good-things-book\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

And while she acknowledges that she isn’t as fanatical as she once was (“Sometimes I make baba ganoush in January!”), that impulse is still foundational to her cooking. “One of the things that will never leave my body is the way you get to look forward to something returning every year, and that it feels like this reintroduction,” she reflects. This grilled salad, a tumble of the best ingredients that high summer has to offer, is one she makes every year, and is also one of the first things she cooked outside the restaurant that really felt like her own creation. “There’s a pleasure in remembering how good it all tastes again,” she smiles.</p>\n    <p>And while peak season vegetables are the star of the show here, the luxuriously creamy dressing deserves its own shoutout. It uses aquafaba, the viscous liquid from a can of chickpeas (or any other canned white bean), to create a rich emulsion that will remain thick and stable for several days in the fridge. Savory with miso, tart with lemon, and with the fun crunch of poppy seeds, it can make a great salad out of just about any vegetable (just ask a plain bowl of lettuce).</p>\n    <h2>Recipe notes</h2>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#main-content\">Back to top</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/grilled-summer-salad-with-creamy-miso-dressing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I’ve always been a creative and ambitious person. When I was in middle school, I was part of a group of girls writing all different kinds of stories that we took very seriously. We brainstormed, we wrote, we edited, we wrote … you get the deal.</p>\n<p>It’s the same model I use only 10 years later as a 21-year-old poet with two published books.</p>\n<p>Now’s the part where you get skeptical — and that’s OK! How could a 21-year-old publish two books? Surely that’s not enough time to know what you’re doing. And you would be right! I don’t always know what I’m doing. But, what I sometimes lack in world experience, I make up for in creativity and ambition.</p>\n<p>Since I started high school, I have been submitting to poetry contests from local to global organizations. I attended the Kenyon Young Writers Workshop, which was a very big deal in my house, and I honed my craft. I ran my school’s literary magazine and encouraged my classmates to do the same.</p>\n<p>When I started college, I knew I wanted to do more. During freshman year, I told my whole floor at a dorm meeting before winter break that I wasn’t coming back to school until I published a book. No big deal, right?</p>\n<p>While I was mostly joking, I was putting an intention into the world. Looking back, that moment truly kickstarted everything. Having people to hold me accountable made it feel bigger than myself.</p>\n<p>From there, I went on break and started researching. I stumbled across Book Leaf Publishing, which, after a 21-day writing challenge, would publish a chapbook for me. It was the first step I needed. I wrote a poem everyday for 21 days and then published my first book, <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/writing-over-the-word-limit-mckenna-graf/19994099?ean=9789357440004&amp;next=t\">writing over the word limit</a><i>.</i></p>\n<p>Since then, my writing practice has gotten more refined. I now have a second book published with Parisian Phoenix Publishing, <i> Mortals, Myths, and Maybes</i>, and a third, </p>\n<p>\n      <i/>\n    </p>\n<p><i>,</i>which was released in June. But, let’s not forget, I am also a college student. And not just a college student — I am double majoring in English and Film &amp; Media Studies with a minor in Documentary Storymaking and hold three executive positions for campus clubs that facilitate community through art.</p>\n<p>I’ve found my passion and I’ve poured everything into it. The question I always get asked is, how do I manage it all? The short answer is that it changes. The long answer is more complicated.</p>\n<p>I’m a junior in college now and here is how I manage it today:</p>\n<p><strong>Lots of lists. </strong>The first step is getting a clear idea about what it is that you want. Make an outline for the book, make a bucket list and set the intention of publishing, write down goals for the book, etc.</p>\n<p>After you’ve done that, <strong>set dates. </strong>I’ve known what day I was going to announce my new book cover about 3 months out. If you know things are going to get crazy in life later, you have to use the free time you have to pre-plan those tasks. So set dates, make templates. Do as much as you can now to make it easier for yourself later.</p>\n<p><strong>Take breaks. </strong>If you don’t step away from the notebook/computer and just experience life you won’t have anything to write about. So go outside. Make a notes app full of lines you think of while you’re away to type up later if you really need to.</p>\n<p><strong>Set aside time. </strong>For me, two hours a day for three days is what works. One day dedicated to writing/editing, outreach and content creation, respectively. Otherwise, you either let it completely consume your life or you never get around to it. If you create this time just for your craft, it makes you feel more in control of the rest. At least it does for me.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/09/writing-life-balancing-passions-as-an-author-and-college-by-mckenna-graf/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>My sworn enemy, the laptop battery, reminded me I had 90 minutes to write this. The charging cord is at home on my desk, and the cats are probably chewing on it. Already, the battery says that 90 minutes was a roughshod approximation, and I better create and hunt and peck faster than I ever have, sucker. Okay, sure. I’m up for it.</p>\n<p>Part of me dies every time I watch a film montage of a character writing a novel. The only distinction in these quick glimpses into the creation of a masterpiece is the writing instrument used: quill and ink, typewriter, word processor or laptop. With a smirk, I watch rapid-fire typing, a look of glee or divine focus on the writer’s face. Cut to a few wads of paper with a bottle of whiskey or a steaming cup of coffee in the foreground. Forgiving the time compression given to cinematic retellings of events, the novel is done in three minutes. The heroic dispenser of great literature leans back in their chair and smiles with the peacefulness of a job well done. Bullshit. Bullshit. And horseyshit.</p>\n<p>Dude or dudette didn’t even edit. No literary babies were killed. The author never stared into the distance wondering why he’d ever thought he could write. The Pulitzer wannabe never had a sad moment explaining that this project was the last attempt at getting published.</p>\n<p>If you’re like me, and I hope there are others like me, writing is hard.</p>\n<p>Oftentimes, I even hate it. It’s hard to find the time. Difficult to remember where you left off sometimes because, well, life. Every once in a great while, you get presented with a couple of hours of unbroken writing time. Every great once in a while. Maybe you have kids, a busy work schedule or too many personal endeavors. Or maybe fear has you “sharpening pencils” but never really getting to the business of writing. When your ass isn’t in the chair, the writing isn’t getting done. Whatever the reason, my point finally is, you must adapt to what you’re provided with.</p>\n<p>Adaptation is one of our species’ greatest survival tools. Adapt or die. So, I’ve become a guerrilla writer. I attack the keys when I get a chance. I hit it, retreat back to life. Strike the next opportunity I get.</p>\n<p>But, after the retreat back to life, the intel becomes hazy. The strategy has got lost in those counterattacks sometimes called your children, your job, your day-to-day BS.</p>\n<p>After too many times of resuming my work only to get my ass out of the seat almost immediately due to frustration, I adapted. I had to let go of the fact that I have a life outside of the lives I create. The first thing I had to do was forgive myself. It does not make me any less of a writer than that jerk in the film montages. It does not make me any less of a writer that I may only get an hour lunch break, which turns into half that time due to office interruptions. It’s what I do with that time I am granted that matters. Less is more, they say. Right?</p>\n<p>I changed how I ended my writing sessions and retooled how I started each fresh, golden opportunity for literary greatness.</p>\n<p>Every time you sit down, you have a better chance than all your friends who have “thought about writing a book someday.” Okay, sure, you will.</p>\n<p>When I stop a writing session, I write some bullet-point notes for myself. It doesn’t matter how lengthy these notes are, but they serve to navigate me back to my thought process before the dog decided it had to go potty. When I resume writing, I will ignore these notes. There’s a process; trust me.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/09/writing-life-guerrilla-writing-by-gary-smothers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Interviewed by Amy Eaton</p>\n<p>I met Tania Richard last summer when we were in the same line-up for <i>You’re Being Ridiculous</i>, a Live Lit show in Chicago. Her work left me thinking deeply about race, America, children, and the arts for weeks after I’d seen it.</p>\n<p>So when she offered me a chance to read and advanced reader’s copy (ARC) of book — <i> Black Girl from a White Suburb: Finding My Light, Using My Voice</i> (Sept. 2025) — I jumped at the chance to hear more from her. While her life as an actress is fascinating, her point of view about what it’s like to be the only black person in the room as a child is a voice that is necessary, now more than ever.</p>\n<p><strong>Amy Eaton:</strong> <strong>Hi Tania!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Tania Richard:</strong> Hi Amy!</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>AE: I’ve seen sections of your book performed live and my first question is about structure. I opened the table of contents and it’s a list of plays — most of them very recognizable even to someone not in the theater world. How did you get to that?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>TR:</strong> When I really committed to having this be a completed memoir, as opposed to podcast episodes, or essays which I’d thought about, I started to wrestle with taking all of these various versions of it and structure them. My experience in theater is one of the bigger constants in my life and I came across a memoir that created chapters based on individual women. That inspired me.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>AE: And that was what?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>TR: </strong><i>I Shouldn’t Be Telling You This: (But I’m Going to, Anyway)</i> by Chelsea Devantez. Each chapter is centered around an influential woman in her life. The more I started to think about the book and about theater being such a through-line in my life, I wondered what would happen if each chapter was a play I’d either seen, read, or written. How did my life happen around it? I first fell in love with theater at my local library growing up in a suburb that didn’t offer a lot of opportunity for me to see myself reflected. But writers like Tony Kushner and Lorraine Hansberry gave me a glimmer of what might be outside of that suburb, so that was it. That was the framework. And when that moment happened, there was no looking back.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>AE: It’s interesting that you say you thought you could do this as a series of podcasts. As I was reading, I found myself wondering why this wasn’t a one-woman show? And it’s clear, with the training you’ve got in DEI and engagement, how, even on the fly, you can break stuff down for an audience who might not grasp the nuances you’re addressing and you can reach them in a way that they’re not accustomed to. It’s such a gift.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>TR:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>AE: And it’s so important right now, my God, especially right now!</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>TR:</strong> In digestible ways, right? Which, as we all know, is through story.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>AE: Yes, it’s like little tiny kernels. But I really could see this as a one-woman show. </strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>TR:</strong> Actually, it <i>is</i> both a book and a solo show. It’s going to be in the LookOut series at Steppenwolf Theater on October 3rd and 4th!</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>AE: Oh wow! Congrats!</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>TR:</strong> But the solo piece happened because there was a point where I felt so isolated in the process, as all writers do. I needed to be in conversation with this, or I was gonna go nuts. And I thought, what if I turn it into a show? I learned so much in that process and it really drove me to the finish line.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>AE: When you are a performer and a writer and you write your own work, there is this interesting conundrum of: things you write for the stage and things you write for the page. Do you find that there’s a difference? Do you have a different process for either kind of writing?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/tania-richard.jpg\" alt=\"tania-richard\"/>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/09/interview-tania-richard-author-of-black-girl-from-a-white-suburb-finding-my-light-using-my-voice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s utterly mesmerizing, a darkness of text interspersed with the vibrancy of paint splattered on canvas, a true duality in melancholy and making. One should note that Peter Mendelsund, while gifted in many artistic expressions, had never painted before. He writes, “I do not know what a painting is at all. I do not know what a painting is, or why it is. I do not know what a painting is for.”</p>\n<p>Organized in one hundred numbered, mostly linear journal entries, <i>Exhibitionist </i>is highly immersive, gorgeously packaged work I could not look away from. While it’s deeply reflective and personal, Mendelsund draws the reader in with universal themes such as addiction, family, writing, music, silence, photography, philosophy, and more. This is a work about holding on and letting go. Mostly letting go. But you have to hold the book in your heart and mind, ‘enter’ the New Hampshire barn, if only for a moment, where the work was created for its alchemy to work. Mendelsund writes, “Its full meaning only conveyed upon completion. This force, this momentum, this drive, this voltage — flowing into a circuit, work to work — is built into the meaning and structure of ‘sentence.’”</p>\n<p>“A sentence,” he continues, “only lasts for a period.”</p>\n<p>One might hear ‘sentence’ and ‘period’ and equate it with prison. In some regards, that might be how one describes a debilitating depression. It may be how some viewed the isolation of the pandemic. It may be simply a moment in time.</p>\n<p>Take a seat on the bench at the gallery. Pull up a stool in that old barn. Let your eyes fall into a soft focus. Take it in. Absorb. Read the museum card. We’re here to make meaning.</p>\n<p><strong>Leslie Lindsay: Peter, it’s so wonderful to chat with you. You are the author of seven books, including the recently-released  Weepers (FSG 2025), The Delivery, and What We See When We Read. Plus, a classically trained pianist and graphic designer — your work is on hundreds of book covers — and creative director at The Atlantic. But I know, as a creative person myself, we often don’t think we’re anything at all; we just are. It’s baked in. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>You write in  Exhibitionist, “…what I am is neither designer, nor writer, no pianist, nor painter. I feel, right now, that I am nothing more than the daily management of my mental health.” You go on to say that painting — as you did for the first time during this period — is ‘just another symptom of your chemistry.’ Can you expand on this? The idea that chemistry and creativity might be intertwined? Or, are they? And how do you identify yourself when others ask what you ‘do?’</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Peter Mendelsund:</strong> Thank you so much, it is wonderful to chat with you as well. It’s hard, if not impossible to uncouple one’s <i>being</i> from one’s brain chemistry, and so I think what I meant there (when one writes a journal, one rarely knows what one means in any given entry) is that the act of painting was a symptom of the depression rather than an activity I came up with a goal in mind, or arrived at in order to alleviate that depression. That the paintings were almost excreted — like tears — as a result of the depression.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/09/interview-peter-mendelsund-author-of-exhibitionist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Interviewed by Hillary Moses Mohaupt</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/4094/9781496240323\"/>Robin Hemley is the author of more than a dozen fiction and nonfiction books. His latest,<graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image2-1.png\" alt=\"Cover of How to Change History: A Salvage Project by Robin Hemley; a scene of a field that mimics a puzzle, but with one piece missing&#10;\"/></p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/4094/9781496240323\">(University of Nebraska Press, 2025), is a collection of essays that examine the histories that surround us, the grand and personal histories that make us who we are.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Traveling across decades and around the world, Hemley explores the power of photographs, the heroes who shape us, and the stories that are buried by trauma and conscious forgetting. But the essays aren’t all tragic: pulling together scraps about a dachshund, a brief career at the Playboy building in Chicago, and brushes with very famous writers as well as neighbors, family members, and other guides, Hemley reminds us that life is just as equally absurd as it is heartbreaking, as silly as it is serious – and that it is all worthy of a writer’s observing eyes.</p>\n<p>I spoke to Hemley via Zoom while I was on the American east coast and he was 12 hours ahead of me in the Philippines, which was a fitting arrangement to discuss a book that considers the past, the future, and our place in time.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Hillary Moses Mohaupt: I loved your book, and found it so interesting to think about how history and memory are key things for writers to think about. One thing I really appreciated was the order of the essays, which I thought elevated some of the book’s themes and put the essays in conversation with each other in a way that offered additional layers. How did you go about putting together this book? </strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Robin Hemley</strong>: Thank you, I’m really glad you like the book. One of my friends referred to it as “accidental memoir.” Accidental because the essays were written separately, over many years. And in a book like this, you’re absolutely right, the order is crucial. At various times over the years I’ve thought I’d like to put together a collection of my essays, but that’s not enough for an essay collection. There has to be something that it all hangs on, and besides my family, what it hangs on is this erasure of history, the things we choose to remember and choose to forget in our imaginations, and all in relation to our personal and cultural histories.</p>\n<p>Once I got that key idea, I could do the ordering, which I think is one of the most fun aspects of putting a book together. I started with the end essay, about finding this photograph with my grandmother and my sister in it for this studio audience for this horrible original reality TV show called “Queen for a Day.” It was just a short essay but I felt it had a bit of a gut punch if it was preceded by all these other essays about my family, about loss, and about how we deal with loss. My friend, the writer David Shields, has put together a number of collections, and he told me he spends so much time thinking about how each essay abutting the other speaks to or contradicts the other. That’s always stayed with me. That’s what I try for.</p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/robin-hemley.png\" alt=\"Robin Hemley\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>HMM: I’m glad that you mentioned that you wrote these essays over time. Did you have to edit any of them as you were putting together this book?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/09/interview-robin-hemley-author-of-how-to-change-history-a-salvage-project/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It all made me want to know more, so when the opportunity to interview her arose, I didn’t hesitate. And since I’m a researcher who always wants to know where things begin, I decided I had to read her first book too. But I had a problem: I was training for a long-distance bike ride and couldn’t sit around reading all day. And so, while putting in the distance on my bike, I listened to Jen read both her books.</p>\n<p>There are so many profound moments in <i>Proof of Life</i>. Sometimes my eyes would well up and I’d sit at a stop light through a couple of changes just to think things through. I laughed at her jokes and obvious love of expletives (another thing we have in common), and sometimes I’d answer her questions to the reader aloud (usually, “oh yeah!” — if anyone noticed, they surely must have wondered). And often I’d stop my bike, pull out my phone, and write down what impressed me as especially powerful and resonant.</p>\n<p>An extraordinary listen/read in its simplicity and its depth, <i>Proof of Life</i> imparts meaning simultaneously obvious and revelatory. I’m not normally a reader of self-help books, but I’m very glad to have experienced this one. As Jen would say: “this may be eye-rolly but — ” <i>Proof of Life </i>made me want to be a better person for others and also for myself. Read on, I think you’ll see what I mean.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Michèle Dawson Haber: Congratulations, Jen, on the publication of your second book, which is already a national bestseller! In </strong>\n      <strong>Proof of Life</strong>\n      <strong> you talk a lot about your personal struggles — in your marriage, about your alcoholism, with creativity — but it also has an equally prominent self-improvement/motivational element. I know you aren’t a lover of labels, but if you had to pick a genre for </strong>\n      <strong>Proof of Life</strong>\n      <strong>, what would it be?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Jennifer Pastiloff: </strong>I love this question! I have a category called “ish,” and you can put it behind anything: self-help<i>-ish</i>, memoir<i>-ish</i>, essay<i>-ish </i>— that’s my jam. I get that for bookstores, libraries, and the internet, we need a category. But beyond that, it’s whatever you want to call it. Truly. It’s taken me a long time to get past the “what are they going to think of me?” I always tell people, do whatever you want. You want me to do self-help? Watch me do it my way. I did all these wacky things. Self-help and humor are not usually synonymous, but I feel like that’s so indicative of what the book is, and I’m very proud of it.</p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image2-4-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Jennifer Pastiloff in magenta dress with hills and blue sky in back\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>MDH: As you should be! When your first book came out, you’d already established a fabulous career running empowerment workshops called On Being Human. Your memoir of the same name told the story of how you overcame personal tragedy and incapacitating self-doubt to achieve a life that embraced self-acceptance, happiness, and beauty. Can you tell me how your second book came to be? Did you imagine </strong>\n      <strong>Proof of Life</strong>\n      <strong> would pick up where you left off, or take the conversation in a different direction altogether?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/09/interview-jennifer-pastiloff-author-of-proof-of-life-let-go-let-love-and-stop-looking-for-permission-to-live-your-life/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Robert Fagles</p>\n<p>Because I don’t want anything to go wasted, nothing like the gibbous Romas slouching into red, pecked at once or twice by cardinals then discarded, the vines going brittle, golden, last-gasping—because I want everything to have been worth something, I go back to the girl who sat weeping that day on the bus ride home, inconsolable beside a parallelogram of June light, a space usually occupied by her third-grade classmate, Christine.</p>\n<p>The last week of sixth grade: a time of kick-flips, bottle-rockets, first kisses in closets, then at pool parties in the deep end, slipping under water where the parents couldn’t see us, where they thought we were just holding our breath. Afternoons perfumed by the chemical scents of chlorine and neon hair gel, Sharpies gliding over glossy yearbook pages.</p>\n<p>My friends and I had heard that morning that Christine wouldn’t be coming back, not the next day, not after summer break. Her classmates did drawings, watercolors, cut out misshapen hearts from construction paper, tacked them on with glue sticks, scrawling Christine’s name in uncertain cursive. Their teacher taped their works of art facing out the window so all who walked down the hall could witness the children’s grief, the awkward rosettes of their elegies.</p>\n<p>It was a banner year for tragedy at Magnolia Elementary. A few months prior, my best friend Alex’s father had shot himself in the head. When that happened, it was us trying our hands at sympathy cards; it was us crying on the bus. When I went to Alex’s house to deliver the thick, uneven stack of cards, Alex’s mom crumpled into my arms, her tears soaking into my Thrasher t-shirt. Between sobs, she explained that sometimes people just feel so sad that their medication stops working, and then they don’t want to live anymore. After a choked silence, she peeled away from me, like a Band-Aid slowly tearing out hair. Alex and I spent the rest of that afternoon skateboarding in front of his house, doing pop shove-its and 180s off the ramp his dad had built for us just a few weeks before.</p>\n<p>Maybe that’s why we all tried to not pay attention to the weeping girl whose name I can’t recall, or perhaps never knew, the brilliant So Cal summer light making the brown vinyl seat beside her hot to the touch. A few rows back, I was sitting next to Natalie, the girl I liked so bad it burned, our friends leaning over their seats, making up some lovey-dovey singsong to embarrass us. Our legs barely touching, hummingbirds hovering near nectar.</p>\n<p>But the news we’d gotten earlier that day about Christine was different than what happened to Alex’s dad. The edges were even sharper, the glass too cloudy and warped for us to see through. We didn’t want to snap out of the chlorine-laced dream of our last days of elementary school, didn’t want to interrupt our skateboard tricks and nervous pecks, the secret fireworks we sparked in the alley behind my house.</p>\n<p>So, we didn’t dare ask how or why Christine’s older brother, Paul, a straight-A eighth grader who went to youth group with some of my older brother’s friends, could have done what he did to his own mother and his only sister.</p>\n<p>A modern-day Orestes if Orestes had slaughtered Electra too. If Orestes knew how to fire a hunting rifle and had the daring to do so at point-blank range. If Orestes had a six-year-old brother, and let that brother live, the whole nightmare happening while their father was away on business. In this Oresteia, Paul was tried as an adult, given two consecutive life sentences, the furies raving over their house on Canterbury Court, swooping down to peck, peck, peck at the half-formed fruit.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/09/at-the-beginning-of-autumn-i-remember-the-last-days-of-6th-grade-by-gregory-emilio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

When we moved to my rural hometown of Fremont, Michigan, with its tall, blond, blue-eyed descendants of Dutch settlers, my family’s neighbors and colleagues quickly took us under their wings. They were motivated by a delectable combination of kindness, curiosity, and relief. Also, the closest Chinese restaurant was an hour’s drive away and my mother made a mean egg roll.</p>\n<p><i>Theory of Buoyancy</i>: When stepping off a dock into unfamiliar water, choose an inner tube over lead weights if you can. When I was three, a kid from Sunday school in Fremont told his grandfather that I was from the Philistines. When I was twenty-five, a man in San Jose told me that Thai food was his favorite kind of Chinese food. At thirty-three, a boyfriend’s family member in Boston asked me if I knew karate. Deep down, there’s not much separating a three-year-old and a thirty-three-year-old, and the difference between a new friend and a bony-eared assfish is their tone of voice, the light behind their eyes, and their open face. Sometimes, floating or sinking is up to you.</p>\n<p><i>Theory of Features</i>: My glasses slip because of my older siblings. Every chance they got during the first decade of my life, they pressed on my nose like they were launching a nuclear missile attack while joyfully exclaiming, “Punky nose!” If I formed a protective cage over my nose with my hands, they pushed in the whole cage, in effect forcing me to punky-nose myself.</p>\n<p><i>Theory of Creativity</i>: I’m resourceful because my parents didn’t have the money or inclination to buy toys when we were children. Props for our games consisted mainly of pencils, paper, snow, rocks, and sticks. This makes it sound as if we were Amish, but we weren’t. We were just regular Protestants.</p>\n<p><i>Theory of Assessment</i>: When I was growing up, teachers sometimes gave me As not because I earned them, but because the reputations of my siblings paved the way for me. Plus, I was Asian in a sea of white kids, and who was I to question implicit bias, pity, or anything else that worked in my favor?</p>\n<p><i>Theory of Decency: </i>My paternal grandmother planted my moral seeds. When I was a little girl, she told me stories about blind beggars on the streets of Cebu City who kneeled with their cupped hands outstretched towards passersby, and she observed my tears with satisfaction. Her only shopping was at Valueland, where she’d get five yards of whatever fabric was on sale and hand sew it into clothing for Philippine orphans. Goodness seemed perpendicular to extravagance, and thus I was never attracted to investment banking, business, and other finance careers, nor did I admire the boys from my dorm at MIT who skipped class to fly to Las Vegas, count cards, drink champagne, and sleep in comped luxury suites. If it weren’t for her, I’d probably have a lot more cash now, pursuing, spending, and stashing it, money begetting money as if greenbacks grew on trees.</p>\n<p><i>Theory of Futility</i>: My father was hard on my big brother because he thought he could change his gentle nature through sheer force and will. But I idolized my brother, who had an imagination more expansive than the night sky and whose magic enveloped me like a nebula of stars. Twenty years later, we were both living in San Francisco and I was a fully fledged fruit fly in the produce section of Dolores Park, wishing him godspeed as he scooted off to throw back drinks at the Stud. King Lear wasn’t the only one who boarded a bullet train to mayhem when he tried to whittle his kids into other shapes.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/09/a-transplanted-midwestern-chinese-filipina-s-theories-of-life-by-ann-guy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Mama is downright giddy. A thick wad of rubber banded bills waits at the bottom of her purse, a cool one thousand dollars from cashing her child support check. As we get in the taxi, Mama tells him where we’re headed. Squeezing my hand, she grins, jokes with the cabby about the shitty drivers and the crazy heat. Wriggling in her seat, she parses out chunks of cash, concealing some in her bra, some more in her underwear. Her long, curvy, loud body does none of this discreetly.</p>\n<p>I admire the sparkly green jellies on my feet, the pair Mama bought with our new money. Then I click, click, click my heels, à la Dorothy from <i>The</i> <i>Wizard of Oz</i>, one of two tapes we own.</p>\n<p>A haze of vapor wavers over the pavement and dances off of everything that holds us. You could fry an egg on the simmer of the sidewalk and melt right there, like an Italian Ice chased to crunch before it’s a rainbow puddle. A swimmy mirage sprawls ahead, a city alive, pulsating in trapped fumes. We pass kids playing near the open fire hydrant, splashing against torrents of water pulsing through the engine port. Laughter squeals outside of our window.</p>\n<p>We are not here to play. In the backseat of this cologne-filled cab, my slap-happy mom schemes to cop dope in the burnt part of the city. The South Bronx is a razed boneyard. Iron beams of buildings spear the sky. Condemned structures reach out of the ground as sepulchers of businesses and homes incinerated by corruption during the fires of the ’70s. Maybe grass grows underneath it all, yearns for light, fights to sprout through cracked cement. I haven’t seen it. I would know if it were there because I notice most things. My senses alert and attuned, I must be present, so as not to be hurt or forgotten by Mama. I keep watch for erratic bodies and swift movements. I feel the people around me.</p>\n<p>Today, Mama is the kind of happy I don’t trust. I know the drill, the way this game unfolds, the losing for us both, and I’m not down. But what choice do I have? The taximeter reads $6.25 in bold red dashes and Mama hands the driver a ten. She is giving when she has the means.</p>\n<p>We exit the cab and step into the remnants of the conflagration that maimed this community. Charred bars pierce the earth and air like caged elephant ribs, casting shadows, offering dark refuge for junkies and crackheads to retreat, and repeat, their need. They stumble through the grim landscape unmoored, twitching and shuffling their lead feet. Caressing the air in bizarre gestures, loud and abrupt, they converse with no one. What are they reaching for? They make me believe in zombies, make me wonder if it’s possible to be alive on the outside and dead on the inside. They are the corpses from the <i>Thriller</i> music video, but with less facility and vigor. I can run from the room when Michael Jackson howls to summon the dead from their crypt, but I can’t run now.</p>\n<p>“Damn, I gotta take a piss.”</p>\n<p>Mama twists her knees together. I watch the zombies to make sure they don’t come too close. If they bite you, you’re one of them, and that scares me more than anything. I pretend I’m not afraid, that I am brave and can dispel their evil sorcery. I’ve been telling myself that Mama isn’t one of them.</p>\n<p>We walk toward a slumped figure on the corner. She’s an elderly woman, clad in a soiled winter coat in the sweltering heat. Her skin is marred with scars and scabs. She has no teeth and cackles as Mama whines about how she has to piss like a racehorse. Purple gums gleam in the light. Mama grasps my shoulders to square them to her. Beaming, she gives instructions.</p>\n<p>“Shosh, stay here with Agnes, I’ll be right back.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/09/lost-by-shoshana-ray/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Johnny really didn’t.</p>\n<p>They didn’t shoot him. That’s why we didn’t know it was a gun at first. A tire iron, a bat, maybe. No, the doctors said, it had to be a gun because of the way his eye socket was broken in four places.</p>\n<p><i>Here, and here</i>, one of them pointed. <i>And here.</i> He indicated to Johnny’s face, held his fingers in a pistol-like shape, and pretended to hit. <i>With the butt of the gun, like this</i>.</p>\n<p>We all winced.</p>\n<p>One thing I had loved about Johnny right away was the blue of his eyes. He had big, round, bright blue eyes. I couldn’t know then that eight years later, our first daughter would be born with those eyes.</p>\n<p>He was hospitalized for a week. To save that eye, they had to screw the bones together and hold it all in place with a titanium plate. Facial reconstruction surgery. In cold weather, it freezes and the plate burns inside his face. For a long time, we worried his face might set off metal detectors, but it never did.</p>\n<p>I didn’t see what happened because I was in the shower.</p>\n<p>At twenty-nine, I had two Ivy League master’s degrees and nothing to show for them but a shitty apartment in the then-undeveloped Journal Square section of Jersey City, an embarrassingly entry-level job in publishing that didn’t even cover the rent, an angry ex-girlfriend who couldn’t understand why I loved Johnny more than I loved her, and an endless pile of dirty black clothes mostly from thrift stores that I’d fashioned to look like I’d bought them at Trash &amp; Vaudeville.</p>\n<p>I hated laundry and saved it until I was down to my least favorite underwear and mismatched socks, making it an all-day project involving a granny cart piled precariously high, pockets laden with hoarded quarters, and my sniper’s eye for any available machine.</p>\n<p>When Johnny entered my life, I decided: no more sitting in laundromats.</p>\n<p>Now, he stayed over. Our bodies came together at night and his clothes accumulated on my floor. He offered to drop the laundry off for me. For us. Wash-n-fold: his first contribution to what was becoming <i>our</i> household. Because now Johnny’s black T-shirts and underwear were mixed in with weeks of my clothes. Everything came together perfectly. It felt like a beginning.</p>\n<p>His tall, lanky frame, pale skin, dyed black hair hanging in his face, those big eyes, and full lips often meant he was mistaken for a girl. He’d been stopped on the street or in bars by talent scouts and asked to do modeling. <i>Heroin chic, </i>they’d said, in awe. <i>Effeminate.</i> I often sang that ’80s song to him, giggling, <i>Johnny are you queer?</i> He was, in fact. Except for me and another girl here and there. Too funny. That song could have been written for him, for us. But other people were not as nice.</p>\n<p>He was returning from the laundromat when it happened.</p>\n<p>He’d seen the teenagers on the way there, he told me later, but he hadn’t thought anything of them. At least not anything more than any of the other times he’d had to walk through an intimidating group. <i>Faggot,</i> they usually hissed. Sometimes they got in his face. <i>I could rape you,</i> one might say. <i>Fuck you up. </i>He wouldn’t say he was <i>used to</i> getting beaten up, but it had happened more times than he could count. Starting with his own father. Then his stepfather. Kids at school. And now, strangers on the sidewalk. They tended to be kids, usually boys, race was irrelevant. His way of dealing was to walk past as quickly as possible. These particular kids may have said something to him, but he couldn’t hear a thing because of the Joy Division in his ears. Within minutes he was past them, and the laundromat was another two blocks down, around the corner to the right. The kids were still there on his way back and, in his mind, once again, the safest way around was through.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/09/pistol-whipped-by-aimee-seiff-christian/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>SAN FRANCISCO — Few figures are more beloved in San Francisco than Lawrence Ferlinghetti. The late poet, publisher, editor, essayist, critic, and bookseller might be best known to most people for his 1958 poetry collection <i>Coney Island of the Mind</i>, which has sold over a million copies — or for being arrested on obscenity charges for publishing Allen Ginsberg’s <i>Howl</i>, or for founding the famed City Lights Bookstore. Thanks to an intimate and lovely exhibition at San Francisco’s Legion of Honor, Ferlinghetti is now cultivating a new reputation as an artist.</p>\n    <p><i>Ferlinghetti for San</i> <i>Francisco</i><i> </i>gathers lithographs, etchings, prints, broadsides, and letterpress books that the famed poet made in the latter part of his career. The 25 works on view are all drawn from the Achenbach Foundation for the Graphic Arts, many of them donated by the author’s estate after his death.</p>\n    <p>Ferlinghetti always claimed painting was his first love, but poems kept getting in the way. It is no surprise that an art exhibit by a poet and publisher goes all in on prints and works on paper. He was, after all, a book guy. In fact, City Lights began as the first all-paperback bookstore in the country, and that commitment to paper and printing is evident in this show. Indeed, <i>Ferlinghetti for San Francisco </i>is a love letter to the great possibilities of the page as it poses fascinating questions about the distinctions and overlaps between “reading” and “seeing.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/far-out-on-the-lake-1200x935.jpg?resize=1200%2C935&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>For example, in “The Human” (2012), letters, graphemes, and hieroglyphics take center stage. Though the human faces, from which the text seems to emanate, are much larger, they are, paradoxically, less prominent. It is as if the “humans” are relegated to the margins, ceding to the centrality of language. To be human, the piece suggests, is to speak, to write, to make marks, to communicate.</p>\n    <p>Similarly, both “And He Was Part of the Sea” (1998) and “Far Out On the Lake a Dark Boat Drifts” (1993/2020) juxtapose the textual and the pictorial in surprising ways. Text and image jockey for our attention. Words are scrawled boldly above an image and yet simultaneously function as image. They exist within the borders of the seascape and bleed into the frame of the visual field. The words are neither headlines, exactly, nor captions; rather, the decoding experiences are like encountering a comic or even advertising: We <i>read</i> before we <i>see</i>, but the reading is also the seeing. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/allen-allen-1200x1528.jpg?resize=1200%2C1528&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>“Allen Allen” (2000), my favorite piece in the exhibition, also plays with the competing gestures of text and image in compelling ways. Here, a poem celebrating Ginsberg by Edward Sanders becomes Ferlinghetti’s canvas, effectively creating a double tribute. The two Allens — the photograph and Ferlinghetti’s drawing — do not compete but rather complement each other in their mimetic/non-mimetic essences. Image is superimposed on text so that Sanders’s words appear to be emanating, almost godlike, from the mythical poet.</p>\n    <p>Many works in the show are collaborations, which feels like a metaphor for Ferlinghetti’s life. One fine example is <i>Endless Life</i>, a series of 10 drypoint and aquatint prints by Bay Area artist Stephanie Peek that appear alongside sparse poems by Ferlinghetti. Peek’s heavily shaded monochromatic images of the moon (or is it the sun?) reflecting on the ocean, or birds flying into or out of the light or a cave evoke Japanese block prints and scroll paintings, which pair well with the austere, haiku-like verses. </p>\n    <p>Ferlinghetti was one of the great ambassadors of contemporary American poetry. The few times I spoke with him, he never wanted to discuss his own work; he would always recommend other poets I should read. That lack of ego is reflected in the entire exhibit, which is a fitting tribute to his generous spirit and capacious vision. He would have loved everything about this show.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/peek-LF-1200x758.jpg?resize=1200%2C758&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/The-Human-1200x1766.jpg?resize=1200%2C1766&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Five-OClock-1200x962.jpg?resize=1200%2C962&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.famsf.org/exhibitions/ferlinghetti-san-francisco\">Ferlinghetti for San Francisco</a><i> continues at the Legion of Honor (100 34th Avenue</i>, <i>San Francisco, California) through July 19, 2026.

    "body": "<p>MEDFORD, Mass. — Fabric works bookend Beverly Semmes’s <a href=\"https://artgalleries.tufts.edu/exhibitions/248-beverly-semmes-boulders-flag-flip-kick\"> Boulders / Flag / Flip / Kick</a> at the Tufts University Art Galleries. Yet the exhibition’s 45-year span evidences a dramatic range of interests. Performance is one throughline, with objects inspired by costumes or props taking on an independent existence. Another is the insistent materiality of fabric, clay, and even glass alongside the exploration of digital mediation. Finally, Semmes constructs a complex interplay of presence and absence in her investigation of women’s bodies as loci for corrosive stereotypes and ebullient individuality. </p>\n<p>The incongruous nouns and verbs of the exhibition title are drawn from individual pieces within each of four loosely thematic sections. The earliest work in the exhibition, “Boulders” (1980) — a series of large, irregular objects made from fabric draped over chicken wire dating to Semmes’s undergraduate years at Tufts — is represented by projected photos documenting its movement through various sites in the greater Boston area. The first work in the show itself, however, is “Buried Treasure” (1994), in which performance morphs into installation. It takes the form of a crushed velvet dress, flattened on the wall, one sleeve transitioning into a long, narrow tube that spills out across the gallery floor in loops. An accompanying photo shows a figure standing by the shore wearing the dress, which extends into coils across the landscape. Though the work is now firmly a gallery object, an element of performance persists since its arrangement is adjusted for each site.</p>\n<p>“Flip” (2024) melds Semmes’s previously distinct painting and textile elements, though its usage of flipped image fragments to pull apart and recombine representations of the female body is typical of her work. Starting in the early 2000s, she began marking up images found in vintage <i>Penthouse</i> magazines, transforming them into disquieting silhouettes. The ongoing series, with the umbrella title <i>FRP</i> <i>(</i><i>Feminist Responsibility Project</i><i>)</i>, has since come to include scans of her own manipulated images, enlarged and printed onto canvases that are then overpainted. The result is a complex palimpsest. </p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>“Wrap” (2024), which includes a portrait of a former <i>Penthouse </i>model named Nickie in the upper right, represents another convergence. Semmes had already been working on <i>FRP </i>when she met the model by chance, and she <a href=\"https://brooklynrail.org/event/2024/05/01/beverly-semmes-cut-paste/\">has recounted</a> the heightened sense of connection she felt to her own body when working with photos of someone she knew. As if this weren’t layered enough, she also decided to digitally transfer some of that collaged imagery onto fabric, which became the basis for a collaboration with fashion designer Jennifer Minniti. Clothing they produced under the moniker Carwash Collective, as well as video of an associated fashion show, appear in an adjoining space as a coda to the exhibition. </p>\n<p>The final gallery, like the first, is both an assembly of independent works and an installation specifically configured for this site. “Not Here” (1999), an expanse of white chiffon and organza across the gallery floor, might appear sumptuous, even frivolous, were it not for the large yellow X extending across its surface — and as the wall text notes, it commemorates the loss of her grandmother. Nearby, the video “Kick” (2005), in which feet abruptly entering and exiting the frame propel amorphous pink forms around another white field, introduces a different kind of tactility. Further punctuating the ensemble are vertical red ceramic pieces reflecting Semmes’s longstanding opulent and visceral manipulation of vessel forms. “Billboard” (2025), consisting of three colossal robe forms made from crushed velvet, looms over the gallery, its shimmering expanse ominously punctuated by a scattering of red circles.</p>\n<p>Semmes’s work tends to lure viewers in with texture, color, or slightly absurd setups, but material sensuality quickly shades over into something more unsettling. As seen in this exhibition, her engagement with varied media is animated by a consistent sensibility evident in the interplay of embodied presence and ephemeral trace.</p>\n<p><i>Beverly Semmes: Boulders / Flag / Flip / Kick</i>, with “Not Here” (1999) in the foreground and “Billboard” (2025) in the background</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Beverly Semmes: Boulders / Flag / Flip / Kick</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038043/beverly-semmes-feminist-palimpsests-aidekman-arts-center/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>From her designated Zoom rectangle, Wendy Kline is describing the séance she took part in to exorcise a deceased doctor from the world of gynecology. As I listen, the multimedia artist Nao Bustamante nods and smiles from her box in the chat, reminiscing. Kline, author and chair of the History of Medicine department at Purdue University, is referring to Bustamante’s 2022 performance at the Park Avenue Armory in New York City. Bustamante’s traveling exhibition, <a href=\"https://www.track16.com/nao-bustamante-bloom-2024\"> BLOOM</a>, focuses on the history, function, and design of the speculum — the main medical tool that has been used since the mid 1800s to examine the vagina. The show has journeyed from San Antonio, Texas (2021) to New York City (2022) to Los Angeles (2024), where I encountered its presentation with an accompanying event featuring Kline. I was struck by the ways in which the work of the medical historian and the artist flowed together. I wanted to discuss how art can enliven — and perhaps correct — the historical record. </p>\n<p>During the show’s San Antonio run, Kline was in the beginning stages of researching and writing what would become her fourth book, <i> Exposed: The Hidden History of the Pelvic Exam</i>. A friend and colleague of Kline’s alerted her to the remarkably similar subject matter of </p>\n<p><i>BLOOM</i>and she caught the show in its final days. Much of</p>\n<p><i>Exposed</i>‘s second chapter ended up addressing Bustamante’s art. Both parties claim to be “gobsmacked” by the other’s interest in working together. Bustamante was surprised that “a serious historian would take my musings more seriously,” and Kline, wowed by the artist’s talent, was stimulated by the “interdisciplinary conversation because so much good can come from generating ideas on new levels.”</p>\n<p><i>Nao Bustamante: BLOOM</i>at Track 16 Gallery, Los Angeles</p>\n<p>Kline’s book is a riveting account of women’s health in the United States. She unearths a cultural lineage of horrific medical abuse, ping-ponging back and forth between recent headlines and events from past centuries. Her writing cadence has a frictionless glide, despite the clinical specificity of her subject matter. Kline credits this to her engagement with Bustamante’s work at the start of her writing process. She claims that the artwork “set the groundwork” for her own approach, which was rooted entirely in conveying the personhood missing from the medical records. The physicality and play in Bustamante’s work immediately transport viewers into her conceptual world. She doesn’t invite them to contemplate the speculum and the history of women’s health as much as she ensconces them so thoroughly that the only possible thought is what it might feel like to receive a metallic, cold, rigid, archaic, and often painful tool inserted into your most private anatomy. Bustamante’s display vitrines, films, installations, and performances create a distinct realm for the topic. Even the entrance to <i>BLOOM</i> — passing through a lush, velvet, deep burgundy drapery with regal passementerie — embodies a tactility that must be experienced.</p>\n<p><i>Exposed: The Hidden History of the Pelvic Exam</i>(image courtesy Polity Books)</p>\n<p>In their own ways, the artist and historian are problem solvers and public educators. They grapple with issues of awareness and context. Both are in search of a more holistic understanding to shed light on subject matter that feels incomplete, veiled, or yet undiscovered. “If you want to breathe life into a past in which so much is hidden or has been destroyed, you have to be creative,” said Kline, gesturing toward Bustamante through the screen. “That enables a richer conversation between a historian who deals with the invisible and an artist who’s constantly visualizing things.” In this particular instance, what’s being visualized — viscerally — is the sovereignty of a person with a vagina in wanting to care for their own health. “It’s not just any kind of art we’re talking about,” Kline explained. “This is something that has been censored, silenced, stigmatized. There’s a political importance to putting a visual on it, providing a narrative.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040688/artist-nao-bustamante-and-historian-wendy-kline-plumb-gynecology-hidden-histories/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I stutter in for a short turn without hurting myself or ruining the rhythm. I delight in my competence. I duck out and sit on the broken asphalt to watch the girls with fancier moves. Thus my habit begins, of sitting down and paying respect.</p>\n    <p>My knees are perpetually bloody; when not tripping over used car-tire hurdles in PE, I pick shards of track from my skin and pull the hem of my gym shirt over my knees to blot the blood. My hair is still nice, without the coarse underlayer. I am a shy white girl; my friend Lisa is gregarious, half-Cuban, half-Canadian, and it’s the latter I find exotic in South Florida.</p>\n    <p>Outside of school, we are mostly outside — roller skating, playing shuffle board, sunning ourselves on the oil-drum raft her father built, anchored in the canal behind their house. Sometimes we walk her neighborhood wearing tight jeans; Lisa carries a small radio blasting Springsteen, Van Halen, the B-52s. We meet boys our age whom we know from school. These conversations by the roadside are like toeing a pebble around and around in the sandy soil. I’m usually looking down. Lisa’s usually laughing.</p>\n    <p>Once, we meet a pair of older boys, high school age. Lisa arranged this, having met them somehow. At church? Unlikely. We attend Youth Mass Saturdays, mostly to be near boys and to gaze at the handsome married deacon. Lisa looks much older than I do — her breasts, hips, and lips full. I’m tall and lean, no extra anywhere. She tells me her intention: the redheaded boy is hers. We agree he looks like the singer from REO Speedwagon. The other boy is dark-haired like me, and skinny, like me. The redhead drives an antique pickup.</p>\n    <p>I remember Lisa being far away in the cab of the truck with her boy, just beyond the stand of bamboo that creaks and sways by the shuffleboard court. I stand near the pool with — Ray? — who has impossibly soft wet lips. The inside of me melts. I pull a panicked story from a place I don’t know, about a guy at school <i>I have my heart set on</i>. He smiles and says he understands. Nothing bad happens. He listens to me. I don’t even have to say <i>no, thank you.</i></p>\n    <p>The inside of my head and body are never the same. Muddled, congested, buzzed. A new frequency has opened up, not transmitting yet but receiving all the time: at school, on the bus, at church and the grocery store, around the pool, at my friend’s house — transmissions coming in from boys and men of all ages. It’s a noise also found in books, especially the paperbacks abandoned by apple-shaped women in kitten-heels at the condo clubhouse.</p>\n    <p>Only on the track with <i>Miss Mary Mack, Mack, Mack, all dressed in black, black, black</i> is there quiet. Girls lounge on the lower levels of the bleachers, close to the ground, the easier to slide into a turn. I have the wrong sneakers. No one cares. I can <i>be</i> and do girl things well enough to hide a little while longer.</p>\n    <p><graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Luongo6-Margaret-Luongo-685x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"Margaret Luongo\"/><i>If the Heart is Lean</i> and <i>History of Art</i>, (LSU Press).

And I call up my best friend Katie down the street because every time we hear that foghorn we’ve said we’ll call each other, the phone cord tethering me to the bed, its curlicues flattened out from being stretched into my bathroom because we never want to hang up. We are majoring in telephone, we are minoring in boys, riding around in my grandpa’s 1969 Plymouth Belvedere with a rope for a door handle, playing Jackson Browne’s <i>The Pretender</i> on the 8-track plugged into the cigarette lighter, unused because we don’t smoke. We are good girls with a bad-ass side. We are living better in our imaginations, looking for love in all the wrong places, with our Maybelline eyes and our tube tops, our Dr. Scholl’s clapping down the school halls, our hips learning how to sway, thinking this is the new game, the new Easy Bake Oven, and what do we know about babies and how they are made? Our mamas can’t bring themselves to tell us. It’s something like immaculate conception, rare as a lightning strike, that’s what we think, until one night the foghorn blows and the phone doesn’t ring and Katie gets pregnant.</p>\n    <p><graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Beth-Tillman-Beth.jpeg\" alt=\"Beth Tillman\"/><i> Creative Nonfiction, HAD, Complete Sentence</i>, and <i>Literary Mama</i>, and she has been twice nominated for a Pushcart Prize.

The hairless pink body they fling deep into the woods, indeed to feed its brothers.</p>\n    <p>I dream she was a fur-farm escapee tasting freedom.

We know the disappointment of arriving in a “dream” destination only to find it cold, gray, and completely shut down for the season. This isn't about avoiding these wonderful places forever; it's about avoiding them when they might disappoint.</p>\n<p>So, drawing on our collective knowledge and current travel trends, here are 7 destinations we're advising caution on for <i>this</i> winter. We've also included a smart alternative for each, because the goal is to travel smarter, not harder.</p>\n<h3><strong>1.

The problem is, the Greece you see in pictures is a summer phenomenon. In winter, popular islands like <a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/move-over-mykonos-this-stunning-greek-island-has-cheaper-prices-smaller-crowds/\">Mykonos</a> and Santorini are not just quiet; they're practically ghost towns compared to peak season. The weather is often cold, wet, and windy, and most of the charming hotels, vibrant restaurants, and even the inter-island ferries are shut down until spring. You'll be met with a lonely, dreary reality, not the sun-soaked paradise you were dreaming of.</p>\n<p><strong>Instead, consider: The Canary Islands, Spain.</strong> For a European island escape that actually delivers on winter sun, head here. Destinations like Tenerife and Gran Canaria are fully operational year-round, offering warm weather, dramatic volcanic landscapes, and bustling towns.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. The Amalfi Coast, Italy</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>The Problem: The “Closed for Business” Vibe</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Positano-on-the-Amalfi-coast-Italy-in-wintertime-with-a-mountain-range-in-the-background-covered-with-snow.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"727\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Positano-on-the-Amalfi-coast-Italy-in-wintertime-with-a-mountain-range-in-the-background-covered-with-snow-1024x727.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Positano on the Amalfi coast, Italy in wintertime with a mountain range in the background covered with snow\" class=\"wp-image-216163 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Positano-on-the-Amalfi-coast-Italy-in-wintertime-with-a-mountain-range-in-the-background-covered-with-snow-1024x727.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Positano-on-the-Amalfi-coast-Italy-in-wintertime-with-a-mountain-range-in-the-background-covered-with-snow-300x213.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Positano-on-the-Amalfi-coast-Italy-in-wintertime-with-a-mountain-range-in-the-background-covered-with-snow-768x545.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Positano-on-the-Amalfi-coast-Italy-in-wintertime-with-a-mountain-range-in-the-background-covered-with-snow-960x681.jpg.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Positano-on-the-Amalfi-coast-Italy-in-wintertime-with-a-mountain-range-in-the-background-covered-with-snow-1080x767.jpg.webp 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Positano-on-the-Amalfi-coast-Italy-in-wintertime-with-a-mountain-range-in-the-background-covered-with-snow-1200x852.jpg.webp 1200w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Positano-on-the-Amalfi-coast-Italy-in-wintertime-with-a-mountain-range-in-the-background-covered-with-snow.jpg.webp 1837w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Positano-on-the-Amalfi-coast-Italy-in-wintertime-with-a-mountain-range-in-the-background-covered-with-snow.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-2\" loading=\"lazy\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p>\n<p>The glamorous, cliffside towns of the <a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/move-over-amalfi-this-beach-town-has-gorgeous-sights-hotels-from-54/\">Amalfi Coast</a> are a summer dream. In winter, however, that dream is on hiatus. The famous beach clubs in Positano are closed, the weather is frequently cool and rainy, and that chic, see-and-be-seen energy is completely gone. While the views are still there, you'll find most of the shops and restaurants that give the coast its buzz are shuttered for the season, making for a surprisingly sleepy trip.</p>\n<p><strong>Instead, consider: Madeira, Portugal.</strong> Known as the “Island of Eternal Spring,” this Portuguese archipelago is a fantastic winter destination. The weather is consistently mild, the dramatic landscapes are lush and green, and it's a world-class spot for hiking and exploring.</p>\n<h3><strong>Marrakech, Morocco</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>The Problem: The “Exotic Deep Freeze” Trap</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Marrakech-Morocco-in-Winter-locals-bundled-up.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"842\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Marrakech-Morocco-in-Winter-locals-bundled-up-1024x842.jpg\" alt=\"Marrakech, Morocco in Winter locals bundled up \" class=\"wp-image-216162 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Marrakech-Morocco-in-Winter-locals-bundled-up-1024x842.jpg 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Marrakech-Morocco-in-Winter-locals-bundled-up-300x247.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Marrakech-Morocco-in-Winter-locals-bundled-up-768x631.jpg 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Marrakech-Morocco-in-Winter-locals-bundled-up-960x789.jpg 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Marrakech-Morocco-in-Winter-locals-bundled-up-1080x888.jpg 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Marrakech-Morocco-in-Winter-locals-bundled-up-1200x986.jpg 1200w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Marrakech-Morocco-in-Winter-locals-bundled-up.jpg 1545w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Marrakech-Morocco-in-Winter-locals-bundled-up.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-3\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p>\n<p>The photos are intoxicating: sun-drenched courtyards in vibrant riads, bustling souks filled with spices, and romantic dinners under the stars. Travelers book a trip expecting an exotic and, most importantly, <i>warm</i> escape from the North American winter.</p>\n<p>The reality? <a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/morocco-entry-requirements-for-us-citizens-the-simple-guide/\">Marrakech</a> can be surprisingly cold. While daytime temperatures in the 60s can be pleasant, they plummet into the 40s at night. The biggest trap, which floods travel forums every winter, is that those beautiful, open-air riads are built to stay cool and often have no central heating, leading to uncomfortably chilly nights. Popular day trips to the Atlas Mountains or the desert are also very cold, not the warm Sahara escape many envision.</p>\n<p><strong>Instead, consider: Egypt (Luxor &amp; Aswan).</strong> For travelers seeking a genuinely warm, exotic, and culturally rich winter escape, the Nile Valley is the perfect alternative. During our winter, the weather there is idyllic—sunny, dry, and consistently in the 70s, delivering the truly warm weather that Marrakech only promises in photos.</p>\n<h3><strong>4. Dublin, Ireland</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>The Problem: The “Perpetual Gloom”</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Deublin-Winter.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"744\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Deublin-Winter-1024x744.jpg\" alt=\"Dublin Winter\" class=\"wp-image-216158 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Deublin-Winter-1024x744.jpg 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Deublin-Winter-300x218.jpg 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Deublin-Winter-768x558.jpg 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Deublin-Winter-960x698.jpg 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Deublin-Winter-1080x785.jpg 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Deublin-Winter-1200x872.jpg 1200w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Deublin-Winter.jpg 1787w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Deublin-Winter.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-4\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p>\n<p>While Dublin's pubs are always cozy, the real issue for tourists in winter isn't just the cold and rain; it's the extremely limited daylight. In December, the sun can set before <strong>4 PM</strong>.

    "body": "<p>Famous for his capacity to forgive his persecutors, Nelson Mandela is credited with the quote “resentment is like drinking poison and then hoping it will kill your enemies<i>”. </i>But many people experience a strong temptation to continue to drink the poison of resentment in vain. This often results in enduring low mood and depression that can have profound psychological, relational and physiological impacts.</p>\n<p>What explains the roots of resentment and why is it so persistent?</p>\n<p>It often stems from a sense of injustice, whether real or perceived. Many grievances, particularly those arising from structural inequalities, discrimination, or unfair treatment, may indeed be morally justified. Yet, remaining bound to these grievances comes with a heavy psychological toll. Chronic fixation on past wrongs narrows thinking, making realistic action toward restitution or reparation difficult. Instead, individuals ruminate and indulge in fantasies of revenge.</p>\n<p>The hazards of prolonged resentment are manifold. Beyond depression and rumination, an inability to “let go” keeps the nervous system in a state of hyperarousal, mirroring post-traumatic stress patterns. Chronic hostility has been linked to hypertension, cardiovascular risk and a weakened immune system. Moreover, resentment is self-perpetuating: passive-aggressive communication, withdrawal and hostility alienate others, which reinforces feelings of injustice and isolation. Resentment has been identified as one of the primary<strong> </strong>factors leading to marital breakdowns, underscoring its deep <a href=\"https://www.gottman.com/blog/blame-resentment-and-negative-sentiment-override/\">relational consequences</a>.</p>\n<p>Paradoxically, neuroscience reveals why revenge is so tempting. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/revenge-the-neuroscience-of-why-it-feels-good-in-the-moment-but-may-be-a-bad-idea-in-the-long-run-175747\">Studies</a> show that imagining or enacting revenge activates the dorsal striatum, a key component of the brain’s reward circuitry. These are the same centres implicated in addiction, explaining why revenge fantasies are psychologically “addictive”. However, as with all addictions, the pleasure is fleeting, while the long-term consequences – emotional exhaustion, relational damage, and physiological stress – are severe.</p>\n<p>To address this, targeted therapeutic approaches are necessary. Central to many of these is the principle that self-forgiveness often precedes forgiveness of others. At the core of many grievances lies shame associated with the belief that one was powerless to resist harm. This internalised “despot” must be confronted before one can truly release anger toward others.</p>\n<p>Mindfulness and emotion regulation have proven effective in weakening resentment. Programs such as <a href=\"https://jonkabat-zinn.com/\">Jon Kabat-Zinn’s Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction</a> (MBSR) train individuals to observe bitterness with nonjudgmental awareness, thereby reducing its grip on cognition and affect. Forgiveness interventions, increasingly studied in positive psychology, provide structured pathways for emotional release. While forgiveness does not excuse harm, it alleviates the physiological and psychological burden of grudges.</p>\n<p>One particularly well-researched model is <a href=\"https://internationalforgiveness.com/\">Robert Enright’s forgiveness framework</a>, which unfolds in four phases: uncovering anger, deciding to forgive, working through empathy, and deepening forgiveness to achieve emotional release. <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24367315/\">Neuroscientific studies</a> show that thoughts of forgiveness, like revenge fantasies, activate the brain’s reward centres. However, unlike with revenge, these rewards are sustained, promoting long-term wellbeing. Repeated practice of forgiveness strengthens neural pathways favouring prosocial reward circuits over aggression.</p>\n<p>The importance of forgiving is illustrated in the case of Marla*, a middle-aged woman overwhelmed by resentment after being betrayed by her business partner. Initially consumed by fantasies of public retaliation, Marla experienced insomnia, social withdrawal and persistent low mood. While initially resistant to relinquishing her desire for revenge, as she felt this meant letting her business partner off the hook, Marla was persuaded that it was she herself that was caught on the hook. She agreed to try Enright’s structured forgiveness therapy, first acknowledging her anger and shame, then gradually developing empathy for her partner. She was able to reframe the situation within a broader context and ultimately practice emotional release. Over time, Marla’s anxiety diminished, her sleep improved, and she reported a renewed sense of agency and freedom.</p>\n<p>Given the power of revenge fantasies, it is critical to ask: will revenge erase my loss? Will it enhance my wellbeing? Will it prevent recurrence of harm? Typically, the answer is no. Forgiveness, in contrast, frees energy for meaningful action, including at social and structural levels where such action is often crucial. Resentment in marginalised or oppressed communities cannot be reduced to intrapsychic dynamics alone; it reflects systemic injustices. Therefore, healing may require combining personal forgiveness with empowerment and collective action.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/14/breaking-free-from-resentment-the-hidden-cost-of-revenge-and-the-healing-power-of-forgiveness\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
