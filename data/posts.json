It was a boon to the grassroots movement, which started in the 1980s in response to a pattern of permitting landfills and polluting industries in neighborhoods that were disproportionately Black, Brown and low-income.</p>\n<p>In the past four years, advisory councils were created — with many of the positions filled by women of color, who have long been leaders in environmental justice spaces — and offices opened to spearhead the work on the federal level. During that time, the administration also <a href=\"https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USEPAIAQ/bulletins/37c321b\">earmarked billions of dollars</a> to address longstanding environmental issues, and to help these communities adapt to the climate crisis.</p>\n<p>But as President Donald Trump took office for a second time, all that momentum at the federal level disappeared, seemingly overnight. An executive order issued on inauguration day took aim at dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, and environmental justice. As a result, any mention of the work is being scrubbed from government websites and funding has been paused.</p>\n<p>For Jalonne White-Newsome, who led the first ever office on environmental justice in the White House, the shift has been jarring if not unexpected. Still, she’s not undaunted. Through her over three decades of working in environmental justice — starting from her youth in Detroit, Michigan — there is one thing she knows: The movement, at its core, is driven by everyday people who will continue to advocate for their communities.</p>\n<p>“Environmental justice did not start with the federal government,” she said. “Nor will it end with the federal government.”</p>\n<p>The 19th spoke with White-Newsome, formerly the federal environmental justice officer for the White House Council on Environmental Quality, about the Trump administration’s recent attacks on her work and how the movement responds now.</p>\n<p><i>This interview has been edited for length and clarity. </i></p>\n<h3><strong>Jessica Kutz: What is it like to see the new administration issue executive orders aimed at dismantling environmental justice, work that you played a part in implementing?</strong></h3>\n<p>Jalonne White-Newsome: I mean, it’s crushing, right? It is offensive. It’s really hard because we have really tried to work hard over these past four years to create a foundation that our federal family could build on.To see a lot of that dismantled, to see our information wiped off websites, to really try and eliminate the trace of any environmental justice work, it’s very frustrating.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do you think this pull back in funding will affect the momentum of the movement? Is there work that was done under Biden that might be protected from this shift? </strong></h3>\n<p>I’ve had so many community leaders over the past couple years come up to me, folks that have been in the movement for decades and decades, to say there has never been this amount of funding and resources to support environmental justice.</p>\n<p>And so our agency partners worked really, really hard to try and get as much money out as possible [before the Trump administration]. I mean, they were grinding very hard.</p>\n<p>I know there are groups that are positioning to make sure that communities can keep the funds that were obligated to them. So that is happening right now. Where it gets sticky is some of the funds were kind of in that period of not being obligated. [Especially with] the current administration’s review of anything that remotely thinks, talks or looks like equity or environmental justice.</p>\n<p>I’m not a lawyer. Is that legal? Can they actually do that? I don’t know. But it’s a fear tactic, right? And they’re trying to cause fear and confusion, and they have been successful. But we have great partners that have a lot of knowledge and passion that are going to protect our folks that have received these funds to continue to do the great work that they’re doing on the ground.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are your concerns about this political shift away from DEI and environmental justice work? </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/the-environmental-justice-movement-isnt-going-anywhere-even-as-it-faces-attacks-by-trump/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We are specifically looking for women who are motivated to find urgent, innovative, science-based solutions as global warming impacts the safety of our <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/announcing-winners-women-in-science-incentive-prize/\">water</a>, <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/meet-the-winners-of-our-2022-women-in-science-incentive-prize/\">air</a> and <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/2023-women-in-science-incentive-prize-winners/\">soil</a>; disrupts <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/once-nasas-dream-a-food-startup-is-making-air-protein-a-reality/\">food systems</a> and <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/terrifying-weather-events-podcast/\">communities</a>; and poses significant threats to <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/the-woman-who-wants-to-change-the-way-we-see-forests/\">biodiversity</a> and <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/how-an-organic-farm-hopes-to-heal-the-land/\">ecosystems</a>. </p>\n    <p>“We particularly encourage nominations of early- and mid-career female scientists, whose work might benefit the most from this recognition,” said Sue Williams, executive director of The Story Exchange. “Our mission is to support and highlight these remarkable professionals, at a time when women – and especially women in STEM fields – still face barriers to advancement.”</p>\n    <p>The focus on women also comes as more research indicates that women are disproportionately impacted by climate change. An Association of American Medical Colleges <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/how-extreme-weather-events-put-women-at-risk/\">analysis</a> in 2024 found that women around the world are more likely to experience injury and death as a result of catastrophic weather events, often in the form of pregnancy complications and sexual violence. UN Climate Change earlier this year <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/why-climate-action-needs-to-focus-on-women/\">called</a> for more integration of gender into climate policy and action. </p>\n    <p>The 2025 Cutting-Edge Women in Science list will be chosen based on nominations from members of the scientific community and an assessment by The Story Exchange editors. Final picks will be recognized this fall on our site, shared with media partners, and potentially featured in video and podcasts. As an example, please see our <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/as-great-salt-lake-dries-dust-is-new-danger/\">video</a> (below) and <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/how-do-we-deal-with-bad-air-quality/\">podcast</a> on Kerry Kelly, a University of Utah professor of chemical engineering who is an expert on air quality and the founder of Tellus, a maker of air quality sensors.</p>\n    <p>To nominate a candidate, please head to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSclj2iY0OMhGugTA4mIrXx9Dyb_0uIOwGULY-MZPkBUsEa0HA/viewform\">our form</a>. Please note: You cannot nominate yourself. </p>\n    <p>Candidates must be U.S.-based scientists with advanced degrees in the fields of physics, chemistry, engineering, biology, agronomy, environmental science, meteorology or closely related fields; or entrepreneurs with advanced degrees who are creating science-based products and technologies to help mitigate/reduce the impact of climate change through innovative practices.</p>\n    <p>“For many years, we have highlighted the incredible accomplishments of women in science, who are often racing against the clock to adapt our world to the dangers of climate change,” said Victoria Wang, co-founder of The Story Exchange. “At a time when there is little reason to be optimistic about the environment, these women stand out as beacons of hope.” ◼️</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/know-a-trailblazing-woman-scientist-nominate-her-for-our-cutting-edge-women-in-science-list/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Published in 1999, the novel was banned in China.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, they discussed censorship, tradition and women’s autobiographical writing in China.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Zhang Yueran</em></p>\n<p>I met Wei Hui one afternoon in January at YongFoo Élite, a restaurant on Shanghai’s Yongfu Road. The old Western-style structure, once home to the British Consulate, cut a forlorn figure in the winter. The listless green of the parasol trees in the courtyard did little to keep at bay the cold seeping between the stone paving slabs. We were some of the few customers there. Wei Hui had chosen the location. ‘I had a lot of fun here in my youth,’ she explained. The idea of ‘fun’, in this context, is not all that meaningful beyond simply killing time. While away a couple hours with someone and you could say you ‘had fun with them’. I have the impression the phrase came into use around the time Wei Hui was still writing, and that it represents an attitude, a bold declaration that adults ought to have fun, too. I was one of Wei Hui’s readers then. As a frustrated middle-school student, I often turned to her books during evening study periods. Her novels were a sort of promise: when I grew up, I would also be someone who had fun, like she did – unlike my parents.</p>\n<p>I’m a big fan of your novel <em>Crazy Like Wei Hui</em>, I told her. ‘Yes? I think I did a good job with that one, too,’ Wei Hui replied, grinning. She talked about her past self as if recalling an old friend, with admiration and tenderness, though her tone was tinged with loss. There is a clear rupture in her person – as if without breaking from her past, she would be incapable of fully occupying who she is now. It was the year 2000 when <em>Shanghai Baby </em>was banned and she left China for the United States. ‘When 9/11 happened, I was eating breakfast,’ she said in one interview. The image she paints is that she watched through her window as the airplanes crashed into the Twin Towers, the implication being that 9/11 was the very thing that shattered her American Dream. But the reality is that she was unable to integrate into America. In her own words, she was not as Westernised as she had imagined. Returning to China, she married hurriedly and had a child. Her marriage quickly fell apart, and during that difficult period, she came across psychotherapy and became a psychotherapist herself. She also developed a rich interest in traditional Chinese culture. Throughout our conversation, she expressed her views in the languages of both. It didn’t matter how far afield I pitched my questions, she always managed to wend her way back to these territories. Getting Zhou Weihui, the woman across the table from me, to discuss Wei Hui, the woman she used to be, was not going to be simple. It’s worth noting the change in name: having forsaken her surname when she decided to become a writer, she has since readopted the patronymic, which may in part have been a response to the desire to reconnect with her lineage.</p>\n<p>Although the conversation with Wei Hui was not always straightforward. On some level, the rupture, and rejection, and her highly-stylised way of speaking, are linked to her early literary career and how that career ended. Beneath her outward composure lies a lasting confusion, which I glimpsed when she asked: Why was Jia Pingwa not banned, when I was?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/never-again-crazy-like-wei-hui/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><em>Granta</em> contributors, friends and staff share what they are reading this summer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>JESSE BARRON </strong></p>\n<p>I regret the day that my friend Jessica said she was reading <em>The Years of Lyndon Johnson</em>. She made it sound easy. Ever since then, I’ve been trapped in this four-volume work by Robert Caro, and in the musty world of mid-century American politics. Three volumes in, I can’t say I’m enjoying it anymore, yet I seem unable to stop, propelled by the same joyless doggedness with which Johnson himself pursued power. One of the many things that drives me crazy about Caro is that he loads his prose with excess freight: a former governor of Texas ‘was not only not typical but was, in fact, unique.’ A simple ‘and’ will never do; Caro must add ‘moreover’. I would throw the book across the room, but it’s too heavy to lift – and, moreover, the pleasures outweigh the frustrations. The most beautiful parts of Caro are the historical reconstructions, the set pieces that plunge you into the Texas Hill Country of the 1920s or the Senate cloakroom of 1949. And there’s the tender – the trampled – figure of Lady Bird. Johnson courted her with chivalry and charm, used her father’s money to enter politics, then treated her like a servant and humiliated her in public for the rest of their marriage. Lady Bird never says a mean word back. She speaks for the whole Vietnam generation when she tells Caro, of her home life with Johnson, ‘Lyndon’s wishes dominate.’</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>TOM BOLGER </strong></p>\n<p>These past three weeks I’ve read three slim books. Although I caught some teasing flak for <em>The Bloody Chamber</em> by Angela Carter (‘Are you doing your A-levels?’), it is hard not to be intoxicated by the violent and sensual collection, not so much a subversion of fairy tales and the Gothic, but a fine distillation of their dormant desires and fears – the tossed-sheets-tussle of Eros and Thanatos. I’ve also arrived late to the Janet Malcolm party, first reading <em>The Journalist and the Murderer</em>, then <em>The Silent Woman</em>. The former investigates with cool precision the implicitly comprised journalist–subject relationship, and the inadequacy of language and memory when gesturing towards ‘the truth’. Her attention to detail, her ability to swiftly capture someone’s presence, their contradictions, is exceptional. The latter – a submersion into the divergent biographies of Sylvia Plath – continues to haunt me; who owns our work, our incomprehensible life, in death? It is devastating and eviscerating, yet often sympathetic to its central players. I plan to work my way through Malcolm’s archive in the coming months.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>ANNE CARSON </strong></p>\n<p>accidentally i am reading collections of stories by people named Elizabeth<br>\nBowen<br>\nHardwick<br>\nTaylor<br>\nthey are all terrific.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>ALEXANDER CLAPP </strong></p>\n<p>I’ve spent most of the last year in Southeast Colombia working on a new book project. My companions have been some of the classics of Amazonian anthropology: Michael Taussig’s <em>Shamanism, Colonialism, and the Wild Man </em>and Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff’s famous study of Tukano mythology, <em>Amazonian Cosmos</em>. Both are waterlogged. My last copy of <em>Tristes Tropiques</em> disintegrated in a rainstorm somewhere on the Rio Caqueta. For pleasure I’ve been reading Vargas Llosa novels – <em>The Storyteller</em>, <em>The Dream of the Celt</em> – and Norman Lewis’s newly-collected essays, <em>A Quiet Evening</em>. Sometimes, before longer trips, I’ll print out <em>NLR</em>  or <em>LRB</em> pieces for the canoe or Jeep. I have a habit of leaving them behind in the lobbies of shabby hotels. I smile at the idea of strangers, months later, chancing upon a Perry Anderson or Neal Ascherson essay deep in the wilderness of the Amazon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>JOSHUA COHEN</strong></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/summer-reads-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p class=\"_--MAIN-TEXT---1st-Line-Indent ParaOverride-2\">The badlands of this issue refer to inhospitable terrain, whether on land or in the mind. Eighty years after the end of the Second World War, multiple times the firepower inflicted on Hiroshima has been dropped on Gaza in savage pursuit of Palestinian oblivion, while the Houthi dissenters in Yemen continue to break world records: first combat exchange in outer space, highest number of US drones destroyed, first non-state actor to down an F-18. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the mineral-rich eastern region of Kivu, an area the size of Western Europe, has been a geopolitical badlands for three decades. In Sudan, a deadlocked civil war fractures the country anew. These are only some of the areas on Earth whose uninhabitability is accelerating.</p>\n<p class=\"_--MAIN-TEXT---1st-Line-Indent\">And Europe? A proxy war still rages there between Russia and the United States, with the Ukrainian people paying the price. What is remarkable is how much of the devastation has been confined within the national borders of pre-2014 Ukraine. Bombings and assassinations in Moscow are, at the time of writing, still rare, and the counter-invasion of Kursk by three Ukrainian brigades has come to naught. Mystifyingly, in the sleepy town of Wiesbaden, Germany – the de facto headquarters of the Western alliance, where NATO officials and Ukrainian commanders coordinate targets – the Russians have not raised a finger. In Berlin in 2022, I remember seeing the dead tropical fish on Karl-Liebknecht-Straße in the aftermath of the explosion of the AquaDom, widely speculated to have been the result of a Russian attack at the time, and thinking: this is what the war will be like when Moscow starts coloring harder outside the lines. But both the US and Russia have an interest in keeping the conflict confined to Ukraine. For the US, the ongoing war underlines the terms of European dependence on American arms and energy. For Russia, it has helped put the economy on a new, more autonomous footing. If the oft-dangled peace arrives, it will be the result of sated appetites as much as exhaustion. At some point Russia will want to consolidate its gains, while the US wants to keep open capacities that may be needed in the Middle East and East Asia.</p>\n<p class=\"_--MAIN-TEXT---1st-Line-Indent\">For this issue, <em><span class=\"CharOverride-2\">Granta</span> </em>sent William T. Vollmann into the drone-infested Ukrainian badlands. Vollmann describes himself as a writer low on fitness but high on endurance. In 1982, when he was twenty-two, he joined the Afghan mujahideen fighting against the Soviet invasion (a portion of his account appeared in <span class=\"CharOverride-2\"><em>Granta</em> </span>40). Vollmann has staged collisions of his innocence with rough country ever since: Sarajevo, Fukushima, the Korean DMZ. ‘I went to help [Ukraine] in my helpless way, with journalistic good intentions which sorrowed into love,’ he writes. The good intentions would verge on naive if Vollmann did not hitch them to sober-eyed appraisals of his surroundings. There are few writers of contemporary reportage who see as many shades of color beyond the windshield. In Ukraine, Vollmann finds distraught mourners, hardened dog-lovers, defensive literary critics, and wised-up drone pilots. His chief interlocutors, however, are the two modernist giants of the region: Joseph Roth and Isaac Babel. In his affectionate way, Vollmann confronts a puritanism among some Ukrainians he meets that recalls Soviet history-scrubbing excesses: the pressure to purge vestiges of a shared past, in an effort to decontaminate Ukraine from the taint of Russian culture. While trying to summon reasons for leaving a statue of Babel intact, Vollmann asks: ‘Isn’t genius enough?’</p>\n<p class=\"_--MAIN-TEXT---1st-Line-Indent\">Vollmann once supplied a dark clue for the origins of his strenuous attention to detail. In 1968, when he was nine years old, he was told to watch over his sister at a pond in New Hampshire. The pond had a steep drop-off and his sister drowned. ‘I just stopped paying attention at one point,’ Vollmann recalled. ‘I was lost in some sort of daydream.’ For a decade afterward, he describes having ‘nightmares practically every night – of her skeleton chasing me and punishing me’. Part of the way out of being pursued for Vollmann has been to become a great noticer of everything around him.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/badlands-intro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><span class=\"dropcap\">I</span>t is a sepia photo, oval-shaped, glued inside a yellowed cardboard folder, showing a baby posed in three-quarter profile on a heap of scalloped cushions. The infant wears an embroidered nightdress with a single, wide strap to which a large bow is attached, just behind the shoulder, like a big flower or the wings of a giant butterfly. The body is long and not very fleshy. The legs are parted and stretch out toward the edge of the table. Under the brown hair, swept up in a big curl over the protuberant forehead, the eyes are wide and staring with an almost devouring intensity. The arms, open like those of a baby doll, seem to be flailing, as if she were about to leap from the table. Below the photo, the signature of the photographer (M. Ridel, Lillebonne), whose intertwined initials also appear in the upper left-hand corner of the front cover, which is heavily soiled and coming unglued.</p>\n<p>When I was little, I believed – I must have been told – that the baby was me. It isn’t me, it’s you.<span lang=\"ar-SA\"> </span></p>\n<p>There was another photo, taken by the same photographer, of me on the same table with my brown hair pulled up in the same sort of roll, but I appear to be plump, with deep-set eyes in a round chubby face, my hand between my thighs. I don’t remember ever being puzzled by the – obvious – differences between the two photos.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Around All Saints’ Day, I go to the cemetery in Yvetot to lay flowers on the two graves, the parents’ grave and yours. From one year to the next, I forget where they are but find my bearings with the tall and very white cross that can be seen from the central pathway and which looms over your grave, right next to theirs. I place a potted chrysanthemum of a different color on each grave, or sometimes a pot of heather on yours, working it into the patch of gravel put there for that purpose at the foot of the tombstone.</p>\n<p>I don’t know if people spend much time thinking in front of graves. I linger for a moment before my parents’ grave. It’s as if I’m saying, ‘Here I am’, and showing them what has become of me in the past year, what I’ve done, written, hoped to write. Then I move on to yours, to the right. l look at the headstone and read the inscription in big, too-shiny gilded letters, crudely repainted in the nineties over the old ones, which were smaller and had become illegible. The marble mason took it upon himself to remove half of the original inscription, leaving a single entry under your first and last name, certainly because he considered it to be of utmost importance: <span lang=\"en-GB\"><span class=\"small_caps\">died on holy thursday, 1938</span></span>. That is what struck me too the first time I saw your grave. Like proof carved in stone of your being chosen by God, of your saintliness. In the twenty-five years I’ve been visiting the graves, I’ve never had anything to say to you.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>According to the civil registry, you’re my sister. You have the same surname as me – Duchesne, my ‘maiden name’.

    "body": "<p><span class=\"dropcap\">H</span>unter was hot but she made me feel stupid.</p>\n<p>It was my fault, not hers. She was patient with me. We’d been dating for three months and the stupid feeling still hadn’t gone away, not even when we kissed, not even when she looked at me under a streetlamp and said with her hands on my hips, <em>You’re an angel from God</em>. I didn’t know what to say so I just looked at her, her skin tinged green by a nearby <span class=\"small_caps\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">exit</span> </span>sign. We stood there, weirdly quiet, until she touched me on the forehead and murmured, <em>Knock knock</em>, and I said, automatic, <em>Who’s there?</em></p>\n<p>I felt stupid when she told me she’d started working at a massage parlor and without thinking I said, <em>How come you never practice on me?</em> We were drinking at a tiki bar and her group of friends burst out laughing, then covered their mouths.</p>\n<p>Being around Hunter’s friends only made me feel stupider. Their lives seemed so robust, urbane, full of rotating love affairs and semi-legal gig work. When they spoke, it was like they were handing out business cards – this is me, here are the things that I’m good at, that get me hot, that piss me off. They chain-smoked but had perfect skin or else the wrinkles suited them, made them look cowboy-esque. They were never home and yet their apartments were full of tropical plants that flourished in their absence. They wore complicated rompers to the gym and dirty T-shirts to parties. I suppose they were nice to me, in their own way. They recommended things for me to try – the soup dumplings from that place on Clement, EMDR, bangs.</p>\n<p>It didn’t help that Hunter had told them I’d never dated a woman before. As a group their understanding made me squirm, their soft-focus waterproof eyes. I didn’t know how to explain myself. I practiced, sometimes, in the bathroom mirror: <em>I don’t like labels</em>, <em>I’m from bumfuck Nevada</em>, <em>I’ve never had a boyfriend either</em> . . . but everything reeked of cliché so I just said nothing, mute in my seat, while Hunter and her friends spoke about movies that I’d never seen and who was fucking who.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">W</span>hen I asked Hunter to explain, her voice was serene. <em>Surely you’ve heard of a happy ending massage?</em> She was eating leftover noodles, standing in her bedroom with one sock on, the other foot bare. Nothing seemed to make her shy; she never doubted the world’s ability to accommodate her and her shapeshifting desires. I was just another casualty to her old-world bravado, to the way she wore her jacket over her shoulders with her long arms bare, to the way she called everyone baby. She had a way of making you feel chosen when she touched you on the inner wrist, like some porno nurse taking your pulse – there, there. Her friend Ducky once told her, <em>If you hadn’t turned out gay as fuck, you would totally be evil</em>, to which they both cackled. Kept afloat by a trust fund, she was always into something new: noise music, numerology, performance art. There was the winter of mime, the self-imposed stick-and-pokes zigzagging her thigh. She spent hours every day in her studio, from which I was barred. That month, a blue June, her thing was collage. The floor of her apartment was covered in thrashed fashion magazines and bottles of Elmer’s glue I liked to sniff when she wasn’t around; the back-to-school smell made me nostalgic.</p>\n<p><em>Of course</em>, I said. <em>You mean those skeezy places where dudes go to get off ?</em> I sat on her bed and picked up a magazine, a weather-beaten <em>Vogue</em>; as I pretended to study it, I saw that each page had a woman-shaped hole in it. This made me uneasy, like I was a rookie detective in a cop show and I’d found something damning.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/happy-ending-newell/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But that’s the tip of the proverbial iceberg. This non-genre-specific, just under 500-page tome covers all phases and aspects of the writing journey, including helpful responses to most of the questions new writers and writers new to a community tend to ask (like, how do I find a writing partner or critique group, where are the literary events, the classes and workshops, and, how do submissions work?) There’s also an index for searching specific terms, names and concepts.</p>\n<p>Throughout, the author’s observations and advice are supplemented with references and quotes from the many interviews she conducted with authors and subject matter experts while conceiving <i>Imagine a Door</i> – such as literary agent Daniel Lazar, publishing industry expert Jane Friedman, authors Lidia Yuknavitch, Rosanne Parry and Beth Kephart (who provides the book’s Foreword), among many others.</p>\n<p>Like many writers, I have amassed a bookshelf of craft books, some well-thumbed, some less so. That said, I can’t think of another writing resource that covers so much terrain and from such a variety of perspectives. It isn’t only the breadth of topics —from initial concept, drafting and revising, to querying, publication paths and more — that makes <i>Imagine a Door</i> such a rich resource. Apart from the information, tips and lessons learned, Stanfill’s refreshing philosophy, her belief in the importance of community, generosity, gratitude and accessibility for all writers, published and not, mainstream and otherwise —provide an open invitation.</p>\n<p>Stanfill writes, she’s “been there, done that, and here’s what I want to share with you.” She brings the accumulated knowledge acquired during her own writing and publishing journey: from journalist to struggling to be published in literary journals and find community, coping with rejection and imposter syndrome, to book author in search of a press, then published author finding the right way for her, as a neurodivergent author, to show up in the world while protecting her physical and mental health. Add to <i>that </i>journey, Stanfill’s experience in publishing, as editor and founder (in 2012) of a small press (Forest Avenue Press).</p>\n<p>“From this place, in the middle of my publishing journey,” she writes, “I hold out these pages to you. I hope they recalibrate your sense of success and help you feel less lonely.” With passages like the following, she does just that:</p>\n<p>\n      <i>“I’ve seen author defined as someone who has a signed book contract, someone who makes money from writing, and/or someone who has been published. Writers, these guides suggest, are the rest of us. Depending on the person trying to establish the hierarchy, how published you are might matter too. Like, a full-length book would count: congrats, you’re an author! But an essay in a small-circulation journal might not. But I say all of it counts. If you’re writing, that’s as legitimate a practice as anyone else’s. Hierarchical definitions pit us against each other. They make some of us doing the work of writing feel smaller or lesser. They also are intended to shore up outdated societal structures—ones that have historically promoted racist and ableist thinking.”</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/review-imagine-a-door-by-laura-stanfill/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

DeWolfe; image of two women of the era, one looking real, the other almost ghostly\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>Pregnant at the time, Madeleine didn’t take that lying down. She sued for breach of promise to marry, a powerful cause of action during the 1890s, when the lawsuit took place, followed by a trial. In a well-paced narrative, Elizabeth A. DeWolfe shows what happened in <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/4094/9781985902244\"> Alias Agnes: The Notorious Tale of a Gilded Age Spy</a> (The University Press of Kentucky; March, 2025)</p>\n<p>As the author writes:</p>\n<p>\n      <i> “The loss of Madeleine’s past and future was not mere romantic rhetoric. Breach of promise established that jilted women suffered injuries, depriving them of the financial security and the social and economic advantages a marriage brought. .. A woman’s security was her reputation, which was built on the notion of respectability. </i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>For much of Victorian society, female respectability entailed chastity—this was, particularly for single women, their most significant asset as they sought the economic safety of marriage. A jilted woman was suspect due to her tarnished reputation; a seduced woman was considered ruined.”</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Jane Armstrong Tucker was an unmarried Boston stenographer scratching out a living during the Gilded Age. She probably would have remained in obscurity were it not for her spirit of adventure and derring-do, which culminated in a unique offer: become a spy for Breckenridge. His lawyers hired her to find Madeleine, become her friend, and extract her secrets. Her salary: fifteen dollars a week.</p>\n<p>The attorneys “wanted her to discover what sort of woman Madeleine was and see if Jane could convince her to settle for a monthly allotment. In the event of a trial,…Jane would keep the defense team informed of the plaintiff’s plans…Here was the great adventure Jane had yearned for in her youth; here was the escape from family duty she craved as a young woman…” If spy craft calls to you, as it does to me, read this book.</p>\n<p>Tucker took on a pseudonym—Agnes Parker—and found Madeleine in the House of Mercy, a home for “fallen women,” a place that, as the author writes, was full of “shop girls seduced by leering customers, hometown girls fooled by false promises, and domestic servants abused in the household. Some girls had been in love, and some girls had not; some young women had been virgins before their fall, while others had been experienced. But all of these women had crossed a line; tricked, cajoled, deluded, or raped, they were unmarried, and either as agents or victims, they had been caught and crucified in an age of moral absolutes.”</p>\n<p>She managed to convince the sisters who ran the home to take her in. Once there, Jane followed the advice of her handler at the law firm: “Get settled at the House of Mercy, he said, and rent a post office box under a fictitious name. He said to send him the key and box number, and that’s how they’d communicate—only in writing and using aliases. Not even Breckinridge would know her name—only him. Meeting in person was too dangerous…Proceed slowly, be exceedingly cautious, and make no mistakes.” Warnings you’d hear in any CIA flick and warnings that will keep you turning the pages.</p>\n<p>DeWolfe reminds us that:</p>\n<p>\n      <i> “… Jane had more in common with Madeleine than perhaps she was willing to admit…They sought a similar destination: directing their lives in the face of, and despite, the challenges women faced: working-class wages barely sufficient for the needs of life; glass ceilings for women professionals …whose expertise was questioned and mocked; rules of etiquette that served as a litmus test on social legitimacy; laws and cultural beliefs that limited women’s rights to property, fair wages, ambitions, reproductive health care, education, the vote; and practices like the sexual double standard—collectively denying women a full measure of personhood.”</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/review-alias-agnes-the-notorious-tale-of-a-gilded-age-spy-by-elizabeth-a/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I had broken things off for good with the psychiatrist – down the line we reconnected, but that summer I was twenty-three and over-certain about the way of things. I’d finally begun to outgrow the ascetic worldview I’d been raised on, newly understanding that romance was the bread and butter of life, and that the termination of a relationship didn’t signify its failure, but still I felt that losing my grip over heartache wasn’t within my financial means. I had no income, was a graduate student of the worst kind – art school – and I wasn’t even one of those creatives who could make art out of a heartbreak. No, for me, heartbreak meant breathing shallowly in bed until the cracks of my eyes burned from salt and any hint of sunlight made me flinch.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The semester ended in the first week of May, after which I was supposed to go home to Fukushima for a month until the start of my internship. The internship was poorly paid, but I had wanted it badly in order to structure my summer around my writing. Before that, though, I had to return to Fukushima to take care of my mother. There wasn’t anything wrong with her other than that she was lonely. It was probable that, despite being around people more regularly as a condition of youth, I was even lonelier than she was; but, while loneliness wasn’t something I minded for myself, it bothered me considerably to think of my mother as lonely. Besides, the pulsating cries of forest cicadas would, in a satisfying manner, mirror the throes of getting over the psychiatrist. But when I went to the pharmacy to get PCR-tested the day before my flight, the results came back positive. I’d had the virus months earlier and knew I couldn’t have contracted it again so soon. Do you have a record of a positive test? asked the travel agent, when I tried to explain this on the phone. If I did, it would be lost in the dumps of trash heaps in some far-off borough, exported from the garbage chute of the psychiatrist’s apartment where we had quarantined together, a week during which I had been the sicker one and he had taken care of me, a real doctor with a permanent pinch between his dark, pensive eyes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The travel agent hung up. I was lying face-up in a sliver of space at the foot of my bed, the rest taken up by stacks of books and other items I had planned to fit inside the suitcase on the floor. I didn’t bother removing the phone from my ear. Somehow, the virus had stayed in my system, and I was unable to resist extrapolating some cosmic meaning from the endurance of both the virus and my heartache. Loud banging noises of cupboards opening and closing came from the kitchenette. Emily, undoubtedly trying to fix something she deemed disorganized, although no matter how much things moved around she wasn’t satisfied. It was the apartment itself she had a problem with, it not only lacking storage space, but furnished with old, rickety appliances. Each bang shot down the slim corridor that led to my small room.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/lover-cay-kim/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Emily St George died thinking of oysters. The obituary writer didn’t know this, of course.</p>\n<p>What the obituary dictated was that Emily St George passed away at the age of fifty-seven, while on a short-lived vacation to a coastal town in Brittany, during the month of March. The writer indulged in descriptions of Emily’s ‘lunar’ skin under an ‘ephemeral’ muslin shirt, and it was these allusions to chilly Brittany, as well as to her inadequate clothes, that meant the newspaper accidentally captured Emily St George’s final mental state. Emily St George died of a heart attack buying oysters at a market stand, died thinking of oysters while buying six of them: no wonder she was a translator, but usually Emily St George was very careful in avoiding literalisms and easy metaphors.</p>\n<p>At half past noon, she told the vendor that she wanted to eat them on the beach, sitting on her flimsy folding chair while facing the ocean. She wished she had a wooden chair rather than a plastic one – nobody told her what the March wind could be like in Brittany. She had only ever travelled there in the summer, and according to what the oyster vendor told the obituary writer, she looked flustered, as if she had just pulled out patches of hair. The vendor was sorry about her death and also about the wind. He wished foreigners knew better.</p>\n<p><em>Oyster</em> was a disturbing word for Emily St George. It forced her to think of translation, her longstanding occupation, as well as the recent change in her circumstances. As the obituary carefully noted, Emily St George was known among her inner circle for being an inveterate translator of romance novels from English into Italian. The newspaper didn’t cover the fact that lately work had dried up and Emily had started discussing the terms of her early retirement with her accountant. She had flown to Brittany because she didn’t want to acknowledge that fact either. The Italian publishing house was really sorry, they valued Emily’s contribution over the years, but they couldn’t keep flooding newsstands with pocket romances. Demand was changing, new trends were emerging overseas.</p>\n<p>Had the newspaper cared enough about Emily’s life to publish a more accurate obituary, surely a less poetic one, the editors would have learned that according to her many friends, Emily St George never traveled off season. The real motive behind the six oysters for lunch, the choice of coastal location in late winter, and the subsequent extreme wind on the day of her death, could be traced back to a phone call Emily had taken with her publisher one day in early February. After the call was over she’d started firing off texts to her friends right away, overcoming her secret shame and fear of being at fault in the whole matter. Her fear that her work had gone out of fashion. The recurring nightmare that an aging translator was like a glass of natural wine before it became widely popular.</p>\n<p>The taste of her translations must have gone musty and funky but no one had the guts to say so and pretended to like her wine out of politeness. On the other hand, not all translations were supposed to be palatable. In the case of old-fashioned romance novels, Emily knew that too much attention to style and language could spoil the product and take away the fun. Those books were supposed to be rancid.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/obituary-of-a-soft-porn-translator/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>We went to Iceland, me, my sister and our parents, like six weeks before they got divorced. I was almost twenty back then and my little sister Maggie was eighteen. I was self-conscious and androgynous and Maggie was very beautiful and troubled. I didn’t really get what her troubles were about, or what the meaning of her struggle was. ChatGPT said that beautiful eighteen-year-old girls might be struggling with social and emotional challenges, jealousy and friendships, online harassment, body shaming, toxic relationships, safety concerns, strict parenting vs. independence, and being underestimated academically, but none of those seemed quite right for my little sister Maggie. I looked at her over the tables of the Icelandic restaurants, over the plates of cold fish or whatever it was. I don’t really remember what we ate, but I do remember one thing: the cows’ heads, skin all dried out, flaking off the bone. There’d be a horrible white cavity where the ear should be, a white-rimmed hole with red inside and I never knew if the white was a bone or some massive, thickened vein or something, white with pus or with the build-up of some other clotted waste product. I don’t mean to be rude about the food. But the cows’ heads really made me feel suicidal, the mouths half-open. Were there teeth inside? The eyes looked shut because the eyes had been cut out. What did the base of the head look like, the place where the neck should have been? I had to stop myself from looking, I badly wanted to look but I knew that if I looked I’d have to see, and I didn’t want to see, I only wanted to surrender for a moment to the urge to look . . .</p>\n<p>I watched as Maggie saw the heads. She shivered, then her eyes glazed slightly over. She was tuning out the heads. I thought I couldn’t do it, make my eyes glaze over, tune things out. I thought I didn’t have Maggie’s dispassion, yes, I thought I was so passionate. I thought it was impossible for me to tune the heads out but of course it was perfectly possible.</p>\n<p>Our parents had strange, fake-seeming arguments that week. They argued about the news, about news items from years ago, Brexit and tariffs. They argued about if it was fine for me to be a vegan and not eat the cod liver oil that the hotels gave us at breakfast but I was almost twenty years old and nobody was about to force cod liver oil down my throat. I almost wished somebody would, not my parents, someone else, a stranger, I wanted someone to care enough to really <em>do</em> something to me. Our parents fought about the cod liver oil and about Maggie’s predicted A-Level grades which were obviously perfectly fine. The arguments seemed contrived and performative. But what roles were our parents performing, and why? Me and Maggie walked behind them, looking at the amazing dead volcanoes of Iceland, the crashing white waterfalls, the foul-smelling sulphuric springs. I tried to work out if Maggie was worried about the smell, if she thought that it might stick to her clothes and follow her around or something. Maybe later, when she took her clothes off, she’d put them in a plastic bag to try and contain it, stop it seeping out and contaminating all her stuff. But she didn’t seem worried at all. Maggie wasn’t vain, she was just beautiful. Maggie Sophia Harrington: what was she going to be? I watched her ponytail swing behind her, side to side, as she walked ahead of me among the craters.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/the-virgin-suicides/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Just over a thousand years ago, on a Thursday in the year 1015, a scribe called Sujatabhadra signed off on an illustrated palm-leaf manuscript in a Buddhist monastery in Patan in Nepal’s Kathmandu Valley.</p>\n<p>The manuscript contained three important Sanskrit texts of Mahayana Buddhism: a hymn composed to the goddess Pragyaparamita by the Indian monk Rahulabhadra, called the <i>Prajnaparamita-stotra</i>; the full text of the famous sutra <i>Astasahisrika Prajnaparamita</i> and a tantric Vajrayana hymn, called the <i>Vajradhvaja-parinamana</i>. It had taken Sujatabhadra a while to prepare the manuscript; in all the time that he was working, three kings had come and gone. Sujatabhadra named all three in the manuscript.</p>\n<p>One of the special things about this manuscript, which is preserved in the Cambridge University Library in the UK, is that its gorgeous miniature paintings illustrate a number of important and popular Buddhist shrines of the time from across South Asia and the deities there.</p>\n<p>Thus, there is a shrine from Oddiyana (modern day Swat Valley in Gilgit-Baltistan), where the Bodhisattva Vajrapani was worshipped; a temple to the Sakyamuni Buddha in Pundravardhana (modern north Bangladesh); a Pragyaparamita temple on the Grihadakuta Hill (Vulture Peak in modern Bihar).</p>\n<p>The manuscript contains 15 illustrations, each depicting shrines from sites as diverse as Magadha (Bihar), Sinhala (Sri Lanka), Chandradvipa (southern Bengal) and Oddiyana (modern Swat Valley in Gilgit-Baltistan). The thing is, one thousand years after these flourishing shrines were described, none exist as sites of Buddhist veneration—an entire tradition lost to history.</p>\n<p>Except one, which still exists as a living place of worship, just as it did in Sujatabhadra’s time: Swayambhu. In the miniature painting, it is depicted is a beautiful image of a <i>shyama</i> (dark) standing Bodhisattva Avalokiteshwara, with the <i>shyama</i> and <i>shweta</i> (white) Taras for company, framed by an ornate <i>torana</i> (gate). The text says, “nepale swayambhu-lokanatha”.</p>\n<p>\n\t                                        \n\t                                    \tI have been fascinated by this survival of Mahayana Buddhism in the Kathmandu Valley for over a decade. During my many visits to Nepal, I have never missed an opportunity to explore the countless <i>bahas</i> (Newari for <i>viharas</i> or monasteries) of Patan and Kathmandu, or sit in for evening <i>aratis</i> and gatherings of <i>kirtan</i> groups as they sang praises of Mahayana deities such as Manjushri, Loknath and Tara.</p>\n<p>It moves me to imagine how, not so very long ago, such devotional songs must have been sung in monasteries and temples across Bengal, Bihar, Kashmir, Maharashtra or Assam, to these same deities. The wildly popular and highly influential cultural force of Mahayana <i>bhakti</i>—which so influenced the Hindu <i>bhakti</i> movement in India—is today, sadly conspicuous by its absence in the land of its birth. It only exists in Nepal.</p>\n<p>I decided to travel to the Valley in September last year, to experience the climax of the month-long Newari Buddhist festival of Gunla, film it and conduct interviews with members of the community with the help of a young Kathmandu-based filmmaker, Sudin Bajracharya.</p>\n<p>Gunla is an annual monsoon festival, and it holds significance for Newar Buddhists because it marks the importance of monastic dedication to the Buddha-<i>dharma</i>, and the ancient Buddhist convention of the rainy season retreat (<i>barsabas</i>). As it turned out, Sudin’s own family <i>baha</i>, in the small town of Madhyapur Thimi, midway between Patan and Bhaktapur, would become the ideal place to experience the Gunla festivities.</p>\n<p>*****</p>\n<p>“Is this your first time in Kathmandu?” my chatty InDrive bike rider asks me as we fly through the streets of Patan. “No, it’s more like my seventh,” I say. He laughs and says, “Very Good.” Then: “And you’ve never been to Swayambhu before?” And the truth is, I hadn’t. This is something I was determined to rectify.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/nepal-buddhism-newar-gunla-panchadan-swayambhu-kathmandu-111712315238025.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Within the loneliness of jail, where most of the time you are in isolation, battling the voices in your head, these books might be your only real companions.</p>\n<p>Growing up as a bookish boy who was hopeless at sports, I can understand the power of book companions. Early in the morning, when the house was yet to stir, I would sneak up on to the window sill in the bedroom I shared with my sister and curl up there with my book, drawing the curtains around me, careful not to disturb anyone. That hour or so of me-time with my book, hidden from the world behind the curtains, was precious beyond words. It ignited a lifelong love affair with books. Every time I travelled abroad, I carefully selected the books I would read during the flight. Recently I came back from a trip to the US, and realised, to my chagrin, that with so many on-demand in-flight entertainment options, I had not read any of the books I had carried. As I took the books and the unused bookmarks out of my carry-on bag, I felt a pang as if I had betrayed an old faithful.</p>\n<p>Of course there is no comparing a transatlantic flight, however long, with indefinite judicial custody. But <i>How Prime Ministers Decide</i> is an interesting choice for Kejriwal. The book opens with a scene with which many politicians in crisis would empathise. And it involves books.</p>\n<p>Indira Gandhi is sitting under a jamun tree in the back lawn of her bungalow on Safdarjung Road in Delhi. It’s April 1977. Her party has just been trounced in the election and she has lost in her own constituency of Rae Bareli. She tells her visitors Kapil Mohan and Anil Bali of the Mohan Meakin liquor company that she is thinking of disappearing into the hills to some place with a small spring, surrounded by trees.</p>\n<p>“I can spend the rest of my life there. And I can read books.”</p>\n<p>“Madam, will you write a book?” Bali asks her.</p>\n<p>“Maybe, but then who will want to read my memoirs?” she says morosely.</p>\n<p>Mrs Gandhi never got a chance to write those memoirs though her father’s letters to her from prison remain a classic. Other figures in Indian history also used their jail time not just to read but also write—Mahatma Gandhi, Jayaprakash Narayan, Veer Savarkar and Bhagat Singh, to name a handful.</p>\n<p>In another time and in another prison, but much in the same vein, Nelson Mandela wrote <i>Conversations With Myself</i>. Alexander Solzhenitsyn, sent to labour camp for criticising Stalin, wrote what became <i>One Day In The Life Of Ivan Denisovich </i>on whatever scraps of paper he could find. As prisoners of conscience, they had a sense of haloed righteousness. Mrs Gandhi, who had lost an election because of the taint of the Emergency, felt she was a reviled figure.</p>\n<p>Not all prisoners spend their time writing philosophical introspective memoirs about the meaning of life. Marquis de Sade wrote the very erotic<i> Justine</i> in 1791 to while away the boredom of prison life. Sir Thomas Malory was awaiting trial for rape in the 1450s when he wrote his famous<i> Le Morte d’Arthur</i> about the chivalric King Arthur. And Miguel Cervantes’ <i>Don Quixote</i> was conceived in debtors’ prison. So Kejriwal has many genres to choose from if he puts pen to paper.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/opinion/chief-minister-arvind-kejriwal-books-jail-read-111712238972601.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

On a middle-of-the-night bathroom run, Lichtenstein experiences a sudden and severe pain in her hip:</p>\n<p><i>What was this pain about?… As I limped back to bed in the dark, I thought, why not write about the memories lodged within my various body parts? </i>Before it’s too late, <i>my morbid internal voice chimed in. I wanted to understand how I’ve gotten to this past-the-midpoint in life, and I imagined my body would be the most  reliable record-keeper. In that moment, I felt an urgent intimacy and need for complicity with my body to make sense of it all. </i>Use me to account for your story<i>, it whispered. </i>Eyes, breasts, hips, and feet: they will collaborate with you and guide your remembrances<i>, it promised.</i></p>\n<p>For this reader at least, unfamiliar aches and pains incite intense reflection, if not rumination, about what lies ahead for this body and its parts. But instead of allowing fear to guide her pen, Lichtenstein takes honest inventory of the parts that made her and make her who she is.</p>\n<p><i>Body</i> reminds me of one of my favorite books of all time, <i>Mortal Lessons: Notes on the Art of Surgery</i> by Richard Selzer. Selzer, a surgeon who practiced from 1960-1985, wrote beautifully about the human body and the human condition. Both Lichtenstein and Selzer have a chapter called “Belly,” in which they each dissect its position, purposes, and dispositions. For Lichtenstein, this body part incubated her three Viking-sized sons, digests the rich and delicious foods and drinks that make life good, and is a comfortable home for her organs. It is also the place that intuition originates: <i>When we say “I have a gut feeling” about something, this is not just some hokey or superstitious expression, but an actual way our body communicates stored knowledge. </i>Bellies can be soft or hard, and, as Lichtenstein learns, a belly is neither a moral failing nor criterion for worthiness: <i>fat and fit</i> is the best of all worlds.</p>\n<p>I adore the structure of this story in parts. Even though each body part is a discrete container, characters weave throughout. We meet her father in “Nose,” where he teaches Lichtenstein to catch, clean, and cook mussels from the family boat. She is transported back to idyllic Nordic summers with family and friends through scent: garlic, thyme, and white wine; cigarette smoke; engine oil; bacon. In “Hair,” <i>Pappa </i>does not approve of her boyfriend when she is a young adult. He soothes a bike scrape when she’s a child and looks out for her joints when she’s a teen riding a moped in “Knees:” <i>my knees have this unique connection to fond and funny memories of my dear pappa. </i></p>\n<p>In “Belly,” Lichtenstein takes her children to Norway to care for her father as he recovers from lung cancer surgery in 2005. And then in “Heart,” she shares her heartbreak when he dies eight years after the surgery and the bittersweet experience of scattering his ashes in their beloved Norwegian Sea. A father’s presence and absence is a theme I return to in my writing and appreciate in others’ stories, as my father died when he was 48 and I was 20, and now I’m older than he got to be.</p>\n<p>Even though the content is organized by body part rather than chronology, Lichtenstein’s story is cohesive and whole. Though we look through the lens of a part, we see a life well lived. She navigates growing up, going through a divorce, and growing more comfortable with herself. Parts that function as a whole are a privilege to be appreciated. Rather than worry about body parts failing and giving out, Lichtenstein shows by example that our relationship to our parts changes over time, and can be used to <i>re-member</i>:</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/review-body-my-life-in-parts-by-nina-b-lichtenstein/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Reviewed by Brian Watson</p>\n<p><i>No Offense: A Memoir in Essays</i>, by Jackie Domenus (ELJ Editions; February 2025) is the type of memoir I thought had gone out of style — and had been told as much by a literary agent who shall remain nameless.<graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image1.png\" alt=\"cover of No Offense: A Memoir in Essays, by Jackie Domenus, a series of quote bubbles on cover\"/></p>\n<p><i>No Offense</i> is a coming-out memoir that details the many twists and turns Jackie experiences as they not only grapple with their own authentic identities, first as a lesbian, then as a nonbinary person, but also as they struggle to claim and share those identities.</p>\n<p>When I first began reading works from authors living on the rainbow back in the 1980s and 1990s, the coming-out memoir and coming-out as a trope in fiction were not only common, they were necessary. Our liberation as queer people had only just begun, and people, myself included, yearned for guideposts, for examples, that we could emulate, particularly when the challenge of coming out occurred during the early years of the hiv/aids pandemic.</p>\n<p>Fast forward three, four decades, and some people in publishing suggest that the next wave of coming-out stories must exceed that foundational trope. That the reading public wants queer authors to go beyond the coming-out moments to something <i>more</i>. <i>Coming out and</i>, they describe this new genre. Indeed, there are queer memoirists who deliver on that <i>and</i>. Jeremy Atherton Lin. Melissa Febos. Edgar Gomez. Greg Mania. George M. Johnson. Neel Patel. Manuel Betancourt. Among many others.</p>\n<p>And yet, it was Mark Twain who quipped that “history doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes,” which is why I am grateful that Jackie reminds us that the coming-out memoir is neither dead nor unnecessary.</p>\n<p>The 1980s were profoundly homophobic, a backlash, I’ve heard it said, to the queer progress made in the preceding decades. But bigotry doesn’t need excuses to reassert itself, and when aids made its presence known in North America in 1981, haters seized on the scare to bedeck their rhetoric once more with a little religion. aids was “God’s punishment,” the product of the “sin” of homosexuality, when that selfsame sin wasn’t triggering tornadoes or hurricanes.</p>\n<p>And although Ronald Reagan, Pat Robertson, Jimmy Swaggart, and Jesse Helms might be (gratefully) dead, Jackie painfully reminds us, against the backdrop of present cruelty and bigotry, of the panic queer people knew, the panic I knew, too, in a series of essays that travel, mainly chronologically, from Jackie’s childhood to their twenties.</p>\n<p>The first essay, “Tomboy,” ricochets through different childhood vignettes, providing a pointillistic portrait, made all the more vivid with the use of the present tense, of Jackie’s understanding of their self, contrasted against how women are perceived by society, a perception Jackie calls attention to as they write, “this feeling of inferiority will only become more familiar — when they walk down city streets and are whistled at like dogs or when they start their first full-time job and wonder why they earn less than their male counterparts who do the exact same work.”</p>\n<p>“Tomboy” also reminds the queer reader of those moments of denial we construct as we realize — and then push back against — our authentic sexuality. “My Myspace bio reads something like ‘Yes I skateboard. No, not all girls who skateboard are lesbians.’” One vignette, one paragraph later, and Jackie writes, “I am twenty years old and realizing most girls who skateboard <i>are</i> in fact queer — including me.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/review-no-offense-a-memoir-in-essays-by-jackie-domenus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Reviewed by Melissa Oliviera</p>\n<p><graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image1-4.png\" alt=\"cover of Crafting the Lyric Essay: Strike a Chord by Heidi Czerwiec\"/><i>The Next American Essay</i> series as well as a handful of wonderful magazines including this one, <i>Brevity</i>, <i>The Seneca Review</i>, <i>River Teeth</i>’s “Beautiful Things,” and others.</p>\n<p>Generally, before anthologies like Randon Billings Noble’s excellent <i>A Harp in the Stars: An Anthology of Lyric Essays</i> came on the scene, I just sought out practitioners whose work I enjoyed and learned by following their work and finding, in the other places they wrote, more people to read. My all-you-can-read lyric essay buffet was satisfying but full of digressions and, to be honest, I didn’t feel like I really understood it as a genre. Over time, the bin in my brain marked “lyric essay” expanded ever further. I couldn’t really pin down what a lyric essay <i>was, </i>though I knew I loved it. Still, when it came to <i>talking</i> about the lyric essay, I didn’t quite have the right vocabulary.</p>\n<p>In Heidi Czerwiec’s wonderful <i> Crafting the Lyric Essay: Strike a Chord</i> (Bloomsbury; March 2024), I found a whole education on the topic of what we could mean when we talk about lyric essays. It’s a genre that has been growing now for over 20 years, but the term “lyric essay” could still be used to describe a nonfiction piece with any or all of the following: pretty writing, hybrid form, heavy use of imagery, more associative (less rigidly narrative) in mode, use of white space, and so on.</p>\n<p>But is a beautifully written essay automatically a lyric essay? Does any nonfiction prose work that is experimental or unconventional count as a lyric essay? Is every miscellaneous, messy, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink essay also a lyric essay, or can we identify stricter formal concerns? As Czerwiec writes, “Lyric thinking, composed of these patterns, may shape itself into various forms, but ultimately, the lyric essay is a structure of thinking, a way of functioning on the page and in the ear, not a form.” <i>Crafting the Lyric Essay </i>serves as a kind of hybrid craft book and anthology of the lyric essay, and I can’t recommend it enough.</p>\n<p><i>Crafting the Lyric Essay</i> offers a smart, simple way of thinking about the lyric essay: if you want to understand what a lyric essay is, look to the lyre. Or as Czerwiec, a poet by training, puts it herself, “the lyric essay depends on the lyre, on lyric mode — a focus on patterning, and on resonances of sound and silence and image on the level of the language.” In other words, we can look to poetry and poetics to help us talk about lyric essays. Czerwiec’s book, itself born of conversations, is itself a kind of conversation, with dialogue built into the structure of it. Chapters move back and forth between more traditional craft essays about some topic and hybrid essays showing those craft topics at work.</p>\n<p>So, for example, the lyric craft essay “Mind the Gap: Writing Around Absence” invites us to think about and experience gaps in time and memories, and the traditional craft essay “Negative Capability” (part of which originally appeared in <i>Hippocampus</i> as “<a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2022/04/craft-of-fragments-and-segments-by-heidi-czerwiec/\">Of Fragments and Segments</a>”) talks more directly about white space. In this way, Czerwiec builds these dialogues between craft and practice, her book moving through discussions of time, space, punctuation, imagery, form, and so on. There’s also an epilogue with suggestions on actually performing your work, which typically doesn’t get anywhere near enough attention.</p>\n<p><i>Crafting the Lyric Essay</i> isn’t dogmatic about genre boundaries, though. Czerwiec writes, “I’ve tried to amass in this book the discussions taking place, creative nonfiction is still fairly theory-less, still in its early stages.” <i>Crafting the Lyric Essay, </i>then, is intended to open the conversation, to urge it beyond the <i>The Next American Essay</i> series and towards “having a shared language to discuss these distinctions.” It’s very successful at this, as in the process of reading we experience two aspects of the craft, and two ways of understanding it: one more theoretical and one more experiential.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/review-crafting-the-lyric-essay-strike-a-chord-by-heidi-czerwiec/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Also included are excerpts of the many journals she kept as a child. Each chapter is structured similarly: Tarpley details her anecdotal experiences of living with and recovering from anorexia, and then after a break she weaves in the relevant research with each stage of her journey.</p>\n    <p>While it sounds it would be jarring to read, it’s not, and Tarpley seamlessly connects her lived experience to past and present scientific research. Her extensive journals allow her to compare her treatment with current standards, and, more importantly, what has and has not changed. She acknowledges in the book’s introduction that some of the entries she references can be triggering. If you are actively suffering from an eating disorder, I would skip this one.</p>\n    <p>After her successful recovery at age 16, Tarpley continues to detail the various ‘relapses’ throughout her adult life, including how anorexia has influenced sex, romantic relationships, and motherhood for her. As she notes in the text, we often have a limited and binary view of sickness narratives: we are sick, then we are well. There is no intermediary stage, and narratives that do include it often gloss over it for a tidy resolution. This all or nothing reasoning oversimplifies the true nature of eating disorders. Many of the subjects interviewed for this book do not consider themselves in full recovery from an eating disorder; just as many do.</p>\n    <p><i>Slip’s </i>most important contribution is putting a name to a phenomenon that many sufferers of chronic illness will know intimately: the middle place. Tarpley argues for a more nuanced understanding of what recovery looks like, especially as recovery from an eating disorder looks markedly different than recovery from drug or alcohol abuse. Someone with an eating disorder will ultimately need to eat again; meaning the possibility for disordered behaviors always lurks. “I’m further along than I ever thought I would be,” she writes in the introduction. “But my disorder isn’t gone.” The middle place is neither active addiction or disorder, nor is it full recovery. It is not perfectionism but acceptance, and for a disorder that relies so heavily on the idea of perfection, this mental shift is critical to ongoing maintenance.</p>\n    <p>Ultimately, the ‘middle place’ that Tarpley describes can be applied to any illness or addiction. I have an anxiety disorder and Ehler-Danlos Syndrome, neither of which will ever be cured. Like many of the interview subjects in <i>Slip</i>, I cannot put my life on hold to wait until they resolve themselves. They won’t. The only way forward is to make peace with their existence and create a life that’s both livable and enjoyable, despite the illnesses in its midst. That’s ultimately the greatest lesson from <i>Slip: </i>that the middle place is attainable, and preferable, to active illness, and that there’s no shame in living there.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image2-2.jpg\" alt=\"Marissa Gallerani \"/>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/review-slip-life-in-the-middle-of-eating-disorder-recovery-by-mallary-tenore-tarpley/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Johnson by Tourmaline; marsha surrounded by flowers\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>Well, this is the biography of Marsha P. Johnson; the P stands for “Pay It No Mind,” one of Marsha’s favorite maxims. That’s exactly what I did with my rule, turning first thing to the photos in Tourmaline’s <i> Marsha: The Joy and Defiance of Marsha P. Johnson </i>(Tiny Reparations Books, 2025).</p>\n<p>Like this biography, the photos arranged in rough chronological order—except, like the story, when they aren’t. Tourmaline gives us a Marsha without limits, a Marsha who gets to be the multitudes that she contains in whatever sequence makes sense. Chaotic? Sometimes. Compassionate, exuberant, and inspiring? Always.</p>\n<p>Tourmaline foregrounds Marsha’s story with her own in her introduction. Drawn to the heart of the West Village after college in the early 2000s, Tourmaline found Christopher Street to be a “sanctuary for young queer and trans people of color like myself, buzzing with an electrifying joy.” The more she spent time in the neighborhood as an activist and artist, the more she began to hear about Marsha.</p>\n<p>What results is as perfect a union of biographer and subject as I’ve read. Tourmaline assembles facts as if they were small tiles that create a glorious mosaic of Marsha. Beginning in Elizabeth, New Jersey in 1945, we follow young Marsha to Sunday school—throughout her life, she professed a deep love of Jesus. She’s in her element in full drum major regalia leading parades at her high school.</p>\n<p>But she’s not accepted, at least not early on, by her mother, who beat and stripped Marsha of her female clothing. New York C/ity was just a bus ride away, Marsha began sneaking there while still in high school.</p>\n<p>Decades before Disney coopted it, the area around the Port Authority and Times Square was a dangerous place. Sex workers, which Marsha would eventually become, were preyed upon not just by johns but by corrupt and brutal cops. New York’s bizarre “three items” law—you could be arrested for not wearing three items of clothing associated with the gender assigned you at birth—provided justification for abusing the trans community.</p>\n<p>Yet Tourmaline credits Marsha’s often harrowing experiences in the city as an essential part in her evolution, the place where she began to create what would become a huge found family. “So much of the intention behind what came later in Marsha’s and other girlies’ lives—the bright international stage, the social movement work, the freedom to move around without being harassed—was dreamt up on Forty-Second Street.”</p>\n<p>Music and dance lured Marsha down to the West Village and the Stonewall Inn, a gritty Mafia-owned bar that was one of the few places where trans people could get a drink and not be harassed; even in the gay community, transphobia was common. It’s in “The Stonewall Rioter” chapter that Tourmaline the reporter hits breathtaking stride. Her blow by blow of the actual Stonewall Riot, from the first shot glasses thrown—one of which almost certainly came from Marsh’s hand—to the liberation that followed is riveting reading, the excitement, danger, and joy of the moment pulsing off the page.</p>\n<p>Tourmaline clarifies Marsha’s Stonewall pivotal role in the historic uprising, one downplayed throughout her lifetime and after it, partly because in Marsha’s own telling she muddled the dates. Rather than turn Marsha’s words against her, Tourmaline addresses the slippery aspect of memory, as well as the roles that Marsha’s own trauma and mental health issues played in her inability to remember things precisely. “Marsha’s account, with all its fire and chaos, was like a fever dream of the raid and the riots. Let Stonewall be both firmly in the early morning hours of June 28 and on her August birthday. Let her be there, throwing the shot glass heard ‘round the world, and uptown at a party, celebrating life.”</p>\n<p>Stonewall lit activist fire in Marsha. When one of the biggest advocacy groups to form in Stonewall’s wake, the Gay Activists Alliance, spurned trans people, STAR— Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries, “transvestite” being the term by which Marsha referred to herself—was born. The Black Panthers’ dedication to community and freedom from poverty inspired her to write the STAR manifesto, a concise statement of rights that remains tremendously relevant.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/review-marsha-the-joy-and-defiance-of-marsha-p-johnson-by-tourmaline/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Eckhart</p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image1-3.png\" alt=\"cover of Uncorked: A Memoir of Letting Go and Starting Over by Mary Alice Stephens; image of woman falling through air, but grabbing onto the &quot;O&quot; in the title. \"/>\n    </p>\n<p>After several glasses of wine poolside, Stephens observed her toddler in the pool hugging a floating noodle and “motoring around in the deep end,” and it occurred to her that he could easily slip beneath the water.</p>\n<p>When she heard herself proclaim (to be witty for her friends as Fun Mary), “Jake, don’t you slip off that noodle and make Mama have to put her wine down to save you!,” she instantly realized it was inappropriate, thinking, “<i>What kind of mom says that to her kid</i>?” But, that didn’t stop her from chugging a final glass of wine before leaving and then blacking out while her husband drove them home.</p>\n<p>Even while inebriated, Stephens was aware of her husband’s disgust, and she had to face him and a wicked hangover the next morning. However, this time was different when she realized he’d slept in the guest room…for the very first time: <i>“</i>No matter how badly we’d argued before or how many times I’d gone to bed drunk, he was always by my side the next morning.” Images of him leaving her and custody battles flashed through her mind, punctuating the seriousness of her intoxication.</p>\n<p>Her child at risk of drowning and her marriage at risk for ending, Stephens faced the fact that she had to make a drastic change: “I couldn’t believe what I was considering: I was going to have to quit drinking…forever.”</p>\n<p>In her debut memoir,<a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/4094/9798897409990\">  Uncorked: A Memoir of Letting Go and Starting Over</a> (Sibylline Press; Aug 2025), Stephens, a television writer-producer and MFA in creative writing recipient, shares her deeply personal story of embarking on the path to sobriety, transitioning from Fun Mary to Sober Mary.</p>\n<p>The narrative begins with a prologue taking readers to a hospital in Dublin, Ireland in 1988, when Stephens is 23 years old. She is studying abroad, and one night she endures a frightening and debilitating accident landing her in the ER for months. This scene is significant, because it permanently alters the course — and quality — of her life, and possibly becomes the catalyst to her decades-long alcoholism.</p>\n<p>Following the prologue, the book is organized chronologically with chapters aptly titled by the content, and ending with the epilogue, which is “present-day” in 2022. In the first chapter, “My Last Drink(s),” we are propelled to that day in 2011 (when Stephens is 45 years old) when she consumes her last alcoholic beverages (mentioned in the opening scene above). This is where we first encounter Fun Mary, the life of the party, free of inhibitions and responsibility, and in subsequent chapters we eventually meet Sober Mary, the self-respecting and sensible wife and mother. The two often collide, as Stephens writes, “Sober Mary sat like an angel on one shoulder, while Fun Mary perched like the devil on the other.”</p>\n<p>Stephens’ memoir discloses her experiences in Alcoholics Anonymous and her encounters with numerous, perpetual triggers challenging her goal of sobriety. In a world that reveres alcohol, the temptations were <i>everywhere</i>. She writes, “How was Sober Mary supposed to forget about booze when it was literally in my face all the time?” She likens the exposure to an ex. “Like after a breakup, I saw my ex everywhere. At the entrance to the grocery store, there were floor-to-ceiling shelves of wine, Gloria Ferrer’s Champagne billboard sparkled enticingly, and the restaurant wine menus were so extensive that they needed binding, yet not a single non-alcoholic drink was listed.”</p>\n<p>Her voice shines in her cleverly crafted sentences interspersed throughout, such as describing a cherished moment with close friends, “The last time we saw them, we spent a liquid afternoon in our hot tub, drinking Champagne and laughing over parenting stories. By the time we got out, I was pickled (in more ways than one).” Her use of imagery and description is vivid, and it’s easy to imagine pictures in our minds. Of her mother, she writes, “She stood only five feet tall; I bent slightly to kiss her downy cheek. Everything physical about her was soft—her sweater, her posture, her gaze—but inside, she was tough Iowa farm stock.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/review-uncorked-a-memoir-of-letting-go-and-starting-over-by-mary-alice-stephens/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Most of the attention in Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League quarter-final with Barcelona on Wednesday will be on Kylian Mbappe, but Ousmane Dembele is also set to have a big role to play for the French club against his former side. Mbappe, who is expected to be coming up against Barca in a Real Madrid shirt next season, has 39 goals for PSG in this campaign. Dembele has only one.</p>\n<p>However, the player described by newspaper Le Parisien last week as a \"tearaway\" offers something different, even if Barcelona are all too aware of what the 26-year-old winger can do with a ball at his feet. The France star returned to his home country last August after six seasons in Catalonia, with PSG paying a reported 50 million euros ($54.3m) to sign him on a five-year deal.</p>\n<p>That relatively paltry sum in the modern transfer market for a world-class player corresponded to the amount of his release clause at cash-strapped Barca. Moving to Paris allowed the Normandy native to team up with Luis Enrique, who he said had previously wanted to sign him when Dembele was breaking through at Rennes.</p>\n<p>\"PSG had been interested in me for a long time. The first contact was when I was at Dortmund, but at that time my objective was to play for Barcelona,\" Dembele told sports daily L'Equipe earlier this season. He admitted leaving Barcelona had not been an easy decision after he flourished under the management of Xavi Hernandez towards the end of his time at the Camp Nou.</p>\n<p>“These were my two best years, with a coach who showed confidence in me. But I wanted to sign for PSG. It was more to do with Paris changing my mind than it simply being about quitting Barcelona.” And so fate has dictated that he, like Luis Enrique, will get to come up against Barcelona in this season's Champions League quarter-finals.</p>\n<p>Dembele was in a Barcelona shirt the last time the clubs met, in the last 16 in 2021, when Mbappe scored a lethal hat-trick in the first leg in Catalonia. Their previous encounter was the notorious last-16 tie in 2017, when a Barca side coached by Luis Enrique overturned a 4-0 deficit in the first leg to win 6-1 in the return.</p>\n<p>A humiliated PSG exacted revenge in August of that year by signing Neymar Junior from Barcelona, paying the 222 million euros needed to activate his release clause. Barcelona were blindsided and panicked, throwing huge money at replacements for their Brazilian superstar.</p>\n<p>They swooped for Dembele, who at the age of 20 had just enjoyed a superb season in Germany at Borussia Dortmund. They agreed to pay 105 million euros plus add-ons for a player still far from the finished article.</p>\n<p>That fee, and the even higher sum committed to signing Philippe Coutinho from Liverpool a few months later, heralded the start of Barcelona's serious financial problems which culminated in Lionel Messi leaving the club in 2021, for PSG.</p>\n<p>Dembele scored 40 goals in 185 appearances for Barcelona, a much better strike rate than he has managed at PSG, where his only goal in 34 games to date came against Monaco in November.</p>\n<p>\"If he were a better finisher he might have won the Ballon d'Or,\" Julien Stephan, the current Rennes coach who worked with a teenage Dembele at the Brittany club, said last week.</p>\n<p>Dembele may really need to weigh in with more goals next season once Mbappe has departed, but for now he has at least provided more assists than any other player in France this season, playing usually in a position on the right flank.</p>\n<p>However, the lightning fast, fleet-footed dribbler has been deployed in a withdrawn central attacking role in key recent matches -- the Champions League last-16 second leg away to Real Sociedad and the clash with fierce domestic rivals Marseille.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/champions-league-psg-vs-barcelona-kylian-mbappe-ousmane-dembele-111712666621156.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Indian football may be struggling to get a foothold in the global game, but individual players from the country have started conquering new frontiers. On Saturday, goalkeeper Panthoi Chanu made history by becoming the first Indian to play in an Australian Lague. Sporting a bright green goalkeeping kit, Chanu turned up for her new club Metro United WFC in the South Australian Women’s National Premier League.</p>\n<p>“Bala <i>di</i> (Ngangom Bala Devi) was among the first Indian players to play abroad,” says Chanu, who has taken over as India’s No. 1 goalkeeper, over a Zoom call from Adelaide. “She had set an example for us. Since then, it was one of my goals as well, to go and play abroad. It is quite exciting to now play in a country that has hosted and done well at the Women’s World Cup.” Chanu joins a growing list of Indian women’s players, like Jyoti Chauhan (playing in Croatia) and Manisha Kalyan (playing in Cyprus), showcasing their talent abroad.</p>\n<p>Like Indian icon Bala Devi, Chanu also hails from Manipur. She was born in the village of Keirak, which has a population of around 5,000 in a family that had little to do with sports. When she was 12, in 2008, Chanu discovered football during a grassroots school sports festival and was instantly hooked.</p>\n<p>“I had no clue what football was till the grassroots festival,” says the 28-year-old. “My coach put me on left wing. Once when we were playing, an opponent hit the ball at the goalkeeper. Our goalkeeper got very scared and started crying. So, our coach asked who will play goalkeeper? I raised my hand.”</p>\n<p>At the time, still not familiar with the intricacies of the game, Chanu had gone in determined not to let a ball through in goal on her watch. “That was the beginning of my journey, and I have stayed on course since then. It has taken a lot of hard work and struggle, but that’s what makes it worth it.”</p>\n<p>Coming from a remote village meant she had to take early morning—5:15 am—bus rides to training when she was enrolled in a football academy in Imphal. A quick learner, Chanu made the Manipur junior state team and the Indian junior national camp within a year of taking up the sport. She started making strides on the senior circuit a few years later—signing up for national club Eastern Sporting United in 2012 and breaking into the Indian national team in 2014. But with many talented and more experienced goalkeepers around, Chanu had to wait for her turn before she became a permanent fixture in the team.</p>\n<p>She suffered a setback in 2021 when she fractured a shin bone and had to undergo surgery. The rehab was long and frustrating, one that pushed her to consider her future in the game. Some people also told her that she won’t be playing football again. It was the first time she had been underestimated, and Chanu strengthened her resolve to come back stronger.</p>\n<p>“Apart from the team training, I would do my individual training as well,” she tells <i>Lounge</i>. “Every day I reserve at least 30 minutes for running, and do my drills, conditioning and training for two hours apart from the practice with the team.”</p>\n<p>In the last couple of years, Chanu has emerged as India’s top goalkeeper and was part of the team that finished runners-up at the Turkish Women’s Cup, which took place in February. Her experience in international football was one of the clinchers for Metro United, who scouted her through the Women in Sports football clinic.</p>\n<p>“Panthoi is very quick and mobile, has good foot skills and is positive and strong in her ball distribution, she is a good shot stopper and confident in her one-on-one decision making,” Paul Morris, the head coach of Metro United, told <i>Lounge</i>.</p>\n<p>Having stayed away from home since the age of 12, when she attended the Manipur state camp, Chanu is used to the life of a football nomad. But she keeps in touch with her family regularly, now more than ever since Manipur has been engulfed in strife for almost a year.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/football-panthoi-chanu-manipur-metro-united-111712665828390.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Virat Kohli has the orange cap for being the top run-scorer in IPL 2024 so far. But the metric that matters much more for team results is the strike rate. And Kohli does not figure in the top 15 of that list, even if you limit it to those who have scored 100 runs or more.</p>\n<p>His strike rate is below 150, which translates to less than 9 runs an over. If you extrapolate that to the team score, it works out to a total below 180, which is likely to fall short on most T20 batting surfaces today.</p>\n<p>And that’s exactly what Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) have been experiencing. Two scores of 182 and 183, in which Kohli made 83 not out and 113 not out, were easily chased down by opponents. RCB have only one win from five matches. So, while Kohli tops the list of run-scorers, his team languishes near the bottom of the table, above only Delhi Capitals (DC).</p>\n<p>Kohli is not the only one having to come to terms with sky-rocketing strike rates leaving them behind. His batting partner for 18 soporific overs in India’s 2023 World Cup final defeat, K.L. Rahul, is getting trolled for his strike rate of 129 (less than 8 an over) in IPL 2024. But he’s not alone: DC opener David Warner, a pedigreed IPL batsman, is struggling to keep up; and Gujarat Titans (GT) skipper Shubman Gill saw his 89 not out in a total of 199 prove insufficient against Punjab Kings (PBKS), even though he scored at a brisk strike rate of 185.</p>\n<p>Strike rates have been shooting up in all formats of the game as coaches and captains are reaping the fruits of backing their batsmen to take more risks. It’s obviously more pronounced in the shortest T20 format, but the IPL has taken it sky high with its impact sub booster rocket.</p>\n<p>Introduced last year, the impact sub essentially gives teams an extra batsman, who can be a specialist or a hitter. Coaches no longer have to rely on mediocre all-rounders for batting depth. And they’re learning to make the most of it. So far, IPL 2024 has already notched up three scores of 240+ (over 12 runs an over). The entire 2023 season had one such mega score and there were none in 2022.</p>\n<p>The classic white ball template of top order batsmen to accumulate runs in ones and twos after the powerplay, waiting for the right ball to hit for a four or six, is outmoded in this scenario. Batsmen are encouraged to take down a bowler for 20+ runs in an over, instead of the safer old way of taking a single after a big hit at the start. They also keep going hard regardless of the fall of wickets at the other end, because to do any less would almost guarantee a loss for the team.</p>\n<p>Risk-taking is the name of the game. This requires stepping out to spinners to smash them—thus disrupting their length—instead of playing from the crease. It involves reverse scoops and clearing the front leg to aim for the cow corner. Batsmen anticipate a wide ball either by shifting their position laterally or holding back their stroke to give the slower ball a whack out of the park.</p>\n<p>As a result of these changes, how much a batsman scores is of less consequence than how fast he scores it. This is not to say there’s only one way to bat, because success also comes from playing according to conditions and situations. But the core principle is to maximise the batting resources instead of having any regrets about how much more could have been achieved.</p>\n<p>Take, for example, Kohli’s unbeaten 113 in Jaipur on Saturday. His strike rate was 157, well above his season average. But his top order counterparts in Rajasthan Royals (RR), Jos Buttler and Sanju Samson, had strike rates of 172 and 164. RR easily won.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/ipl-2024-indian-premier-league-impact-subs-t20-virat-kohli-111712664246513.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In the past couple of years, co-working spaces have become more popular among remote workers and freelancers as well as hybrid and full-time professionals, with many start-ups working from shared offices.</p>\n<p>In fact, a recent report by private equity advisory firm Avendus concluded that co-working spaces in the country are in an expansion mode, owing to increase in demand from start-ups and global capability centres. India’s flexible workspace market is likely to reach 126 million sq.ft (msf) within the next four years, up from 61 msf in 2023.</p>\n<p>Beyond flexibility and cost optimisation, what a co-working space offers is an opportunity for a professional to socialise and form connections with a diverse set of people—something that’s missing when you are working from the confines of your home or in a dedicated office. In a corporation, for instance, people are linked by their department or their manager, often ending up spending the entire workday with team members. A co-working space, on the other hand, allows you to select people on your own, giving strangers freedom to bond over pets, food, news, exercise regimen, even political parties.</p>\n<p>Research, too, has often highlighted the positive impact of a personalised work environment on one’s mental health.</p>\n<p>Mahesh Natarajan, a counsellor at counselling and training centre InnerSight, believes that co-working spaces started becoming more popular during and immediately after the covid era when most physical offices were either closed or they started following the remote/hybrid route. “Not having much adult company can get a bit difficult, lonely and frustrating. In such cases, being able to get to a co-working place helps connect with other professionals and feel like one is in an office space, reducing stress,” he says. “It also works great for people who live in remote locations and brings them the work-community feel.”</p>\n<p>Sahil Khan, a product and design professional working with a tech start-up, was working out of a co-working space till recently. His company is now moving out of the space and shifting to remote work—a move Khan is not happy about. “It’s always great to see other people around and also helps me with a little discipline. Some places have regular community events that help in interacting with others even if we don’t sit in the common areas,” says Khan, who’s in his 30s. “Now, with the company going fully remote, I am sad I won’t have access to the space anymore. But I have friends who work from these places, so I intend to mooch off them for access once in a while (laughs). I feel getting outside and interacting with others has a positive effect on my mental health and well-being. And depending on what my day looks like, if I don’t have too many calls or don’t need quiet focus time, I will go and work from a café.”</p>\n<p>As professionals look for newer experiences, many cafés have also started dedicating spaces for co-working facilities. The Social restaurant, which is spread across six cities, for instance, blends office and café together, where you can eat, drink as well as collaborate on ideas.</p>\n<p>Another one is the Kind Roastery &amp; Brewroom in Bengaluru. It has a “Zen Garden” to provide a tranquil space for individuals to co-create.</p>\n<p>“We believe that the environment plays a pivotal role in shaping experiences. The Zen table, with its minimalist design and serene feel, creates an atmosphere conducive to productivity and innovation,” plugs Pallavii Gupta, the founder of Kind Roastery &amp; Brewroom.</p>\n<p>Vamsi Reddy, founder of Paper &amp; Pie, a café in Bengaluru that has a co-working space, conference room and a podcast room, believes the significant shift in work dynamics owing to the impact of covid prompted a re-evaluation of traditional office spaces. “With an increasing number of freelancers, entrepreneurs and creators, the demand for a more informal and versatile set up has emerged,” he says. That’s why one needs to focus on providing a good environment, besides offering high-speed Wi-Fi, quality food and coffee, and facilities like an open co-working space, he says.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/workplace-culture-co-working-space-remote-work-employee-engagement-111712473971322.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Dealing with them wasn’t the best part of her work life, for the managers were rigid and inflexible, quite the opposite of the popular notion that millennial bosses are “chill” and prefer not to pass down any negativity to their workers.</p>\n<p>“Their job dictates their life—which is what they also expect from their team members,” says Bisht, 32, who works as a sales professional in a tech start-up. “Many millennial managers exhibit toxicity through their actions, either they will make you stay back at work until late or they will inundate you with work and set unrealistic deadlines.”</p>\n<p>Millennials are leading companies today across industries. This is in line with a prediction global consulting firm Deloitte made a decade ago: 75% of the global workforce by 2025 will be dominated by this generation.</p>\n<p>While most offices have a multi-generational workforce, it is the millennials who are increasingly stepping into managerial roles. A 2020 survey of over 1,000 people in the US by workflow automation software company Zapier concluded that at least three in five millennial employees manage direct reports.</p>\n<p>With their entry into the big office cabin, they have also introduced a different style of leadership: a “cool” boss who’s flexible, purpose-driven, and transparent in communication.</p>\n<p>Millennial leaders are “rooted in an unbounded ambition for positive impact and propel organizations forward in a fast-evolving world,” argues Keshav Reddy, a millennial and founder of Hyderabad-based Equal, a digital platform for Indians to share IDs with one click.</p>\n<p>The desire to push ahead and meet targets, however, has pushed many Gen Y bosses or managers towards overworking, so much so that they can put unrealistic pressure on themselves and their subordinates to complete tasks on time—a work ethic they have perhaps learnt from their Gen X parents. Small wonder then there are often reports stating that millennials are dealing with burnout, tiredness, and work-related stress.</p>\n<p>“Unless millennial bosses are willing to unlearn old assumptions and styles, they will alienate younger millennials and Gen Zs (who generally prefer working at their own pace, are more independent and stricter about work-life balance),” says Leena Chatterjee, organisational behaviour professor at BITS School of Management, Mumbai. “Micromanaging and being rigid can lead to high rates of attrition and disengagement.”</p>\n<p>Being too cool, where bosses seem laidback, can go the wrong way as well, if a fine balance isn’t maintained, says Delphin Varghese, 42, co-founder and chief business officer at Gurugram-headquartered digital marketing agency AdCounty Media, who has worked with Gen Y managers.</p>\n<p>“One needs to understand the difference between being relatable and creating an environment that may be potentially damaging. A forced attempt to be laidback or cool may come across as superficial and can erode trust and authenticity,” says Varghese. “It can seem like a fake attempt to connect rather than genuine leadership.”</p>\n<p>According to Anant G., 28, some “cool” millennial bosses only pretend to care about work-life balance or the well-being of their employees. “While my millennial boss may appear interested in flexible working hours or pretend to understand my caregiving responsibilities, he’s hardly taken any action in the past two years since I discussed my challenges with taking care of my ailing mother,” says Anant, who works as a content manager at an advertising firm in Mumbai. “My boss gives me some extra time to complete assignments... but I have been termed inefficient time and again.”</p>\n<p>What makes for a cool boss? It is all about setting a positive example for team members by fostering creativity and open expression to bring about inspiration, says Varghese. “There will be ups and downs, but staying consistent through all of it is what truly defines a cool boss or a great leader. A persistent positive approach is what magnifies employee motivation and drives the growth of an organisation,” he reiterates.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/millennial-bosses-leadership-workplace-culture-management-style-productivity-111712473554499.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

You can tell from the twinkle in her eyes and the gentle admiration with which she looks up at them. It’s the reason why ten of us are gathered at 7am at the Reclamation Bus Depot in Mumbai’s Bandra neighbourhood. We have been promised a tree walk, titled Mumbai Overstory. It takes its name from <i>The Overstory</i> by Richard Powers, a 2018 book about life experiences with trees. This is one of the many literary nuggets Mukhopadhyaya, 36, shares during the walk.</p>\n<p>Another thing that becomes apparent early on is that she is a performer. She holds a pose like a dancer, breaks into different accents and voices, and tells a story with the prowess of a seasoned actor. It is her background as an arts-based educator and theatre maker that makes Mumbai Overstory such an engaging walk.</p>\n<p>We finally get into the storytelling a short distance from the meeting point. Mukhopadhyaya tells us a bit about herself and what one could expect from the walk. She grew up at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) Colony in Trombay with scientist parents and a tree-loving grandmother. The latter ensured her childhood was spent ensconced in the lap of nature with lush surroundings, and a steady supply of saplings from their home state of West Bengal.</p>\n<p>When Mukhopadhyaya moved to Mumbai as an adult, she found the lack of green and camaraderie around trees disorienting.</p>\n<p>“I would talk about what’s blooming and fruiting, and people would meet me with a certain kind of confusion. It wasn’t part of their vocabulary,” she says. Mukhopadhyaya strongly feels that mapping seasonal changes in trees around us are signals of life, which should affect everyone.</p>\n<p>“I have found a lot of meaning in this—for instance, the golden orioles always arrive on the copper pods when they bloom in order to camouflage. They typically mark the arrival of spring. I lean on these markers for a sense of grounding in the otherwise mad city,” she adds.</p>\n<p>The walk was developed in 2020 as part of a workshop by Alisha Sadikot, co-founder, Art and Wonderment, a company that curates walks to deepen conversations about art in the city. “The walks can offer a look into your neighbourhood, allows walkers to recognise what’s growing around them, and establish a co-relationship with them,” says Mukhopadhyaya, who typically conducts the walk in Bandra throughout spring but has covered other locations as well in the past, such as Kala Ghoda and Lower Parel.</p>\n<p>A cross-section of common Mumbai trees, a safe path to walk on and a relatively noise-free environment on a weekend are her only parameters for a good walk. She introduces you to trees with the warmth reserved for a loved one. It isn’t an exhibit but a living, breathing inhabitant of the city.</p>\n<p>The first one is the popular Tabebuia rosea, or rosy trumpet, more commonly known as the desi cherry blossom that paints the streets and Instagram pink when in bloom. Mukhopadhyaya delves a little into the origin and history of the tree and the desirable characteristics of an “avenue tree” in the city. The next tree is<i> Alstonia scholaris </i>or devil’s tree, well-known for its sharp, sweet smell that signals the arrival of winter.</p>\n<p>The other avenue trees we meet are the popular copper pods that give the Mumbai spring its yellow carpets, and the majestic cannon ball tree, which invokes reverence and mysticism in equal measure. There’s Maharashtra’s state tree jarul, the flowery kachnar, and the strangler fig, among others.</p>\n<p>It’s unusual to be on a walking trail, looking up and not around you. A massive rain tree that shelters countless bats or a lone baobab you may have walked past before now holds your attention. Mukhopadhyaya reads out poems and prose that speak of trees, and picks up pods and seeds as souvenirs.</p>\n<p>She attempts to liken the lives of trees to our own—the fact that they resist the concrete urbanisation to spread their roots far and wide. It’s amazing to see how each has adapted—the quintessential Mumbai mango tree grows vertically, often in a zig-zag manner around buildings, adapting to the lack of space.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/mumbai-overstory-trees-walk-bandra-environment-111712378129814.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Water roils in the rising stream below. Rain pools at thresholds, snaking in slivers between stones and stucco, as drips grow to drench on the verge of drowning. I am on solid ground enough to hear instrumental differences. Pattering. Pouring. Water is music. Inside and out—</p>\n    <p>—this stream defies definition as rain fills crevices, spills down walls and slopes. Seeps spring to life. A statue clasps hands: pleading or in prayer. A sculpted head of Buddha weeps. Descending steps slicken with rising waters, no longer still as a splash but a maelstrom, warning to stop and shrink to human size.</p>\n    <p>Pause, for a moment, to hear a call that is always falling. Water calls to what was here before, freezing and thawing, as possible futures surge in storm. It is a wonder this house doesn’t also fall. The walls stand solid as boulders brace halls and hearth, aging as trace fossils and humans who lived here for a time, hanging in the balance of: house and water, bone and fire, wood and stone, earth and air.</p>\n    <p>Lightning flashes. Rain ricochets off leaves and branches. Each spout of the house becomes a liquid trumpet, arcing into action, as claps of thunder clash like cymbals.</p>\n    <p>Listen:</p>\n    <p>You, too, are a body of water.</p>\n    <p>Slip inside your skin. Drink in this sound. Move inside to lay down on stones. Press your hands to the ground to hear elements beyond what any human can compose. This is less about looking than listening within an architecture of attention, as if inside a tolling bell. Live, for a moment, within falling water, solid as liquid, leaking as storms elsewhere stream here—</p>\n    <p>Hear—</p>\n    <p>You are learning where water leaves her marks, in and out of sight, in every drip and pore that soaks your skin and seeps through forest, rooted in soils where trees sometimes fall, too. Falling leaves, falling snow, falling rain, all running into</p>\n    <p>A storm—like this tonight—invites listening to let go of any singular sense of water, whose story continues after you leave. When Fallingwater closes for the night, you ride through the storm to a cabin upstream where you are a guest. One might think you are alone. But listen closer: in the kitchen sink, you turn on a faucet to wash your hands and fill a glass to drink. Rain patters the roof. Off the back porch, frogs bellow in a pond.

A thin line of sweat traces your backbone into your butt crack. You are menstruating heavily. The sea swells under your feet. A crew member steadies you, his hard black eyes searching yours.</p>\n<p>You are one of six men and three women: doctors, management consultants, captains of industry. Until recently, you were each highly successful at home and at work. Nowadays, you fight with spouses, children, parents, colleagues, the man who mops the floors at night.</p>\n<p>You have come to this master class on “groundbreaking leadership” to reclaim your greatness. You expect Sigma Six principles, flowcharts, and tests. Instead, you are asked to fine-comb your memory and find the moment, most likely between the ages of ten and eighteen, when you discovered the survival skill that led to your success. This is the skill you must now unlearn.</p>\n<p>You meet in the morning when the crew unfurls the blue sails.</p>\n<p>You meet in the afternoon when heat drops to the deck.</p>\n<p>Each time, you must reveal your deepest fears, your most tender hopes, the soft hollow at the base of your throat.</p>\n<p>In Indonesian Bahasa, Ombak Putih means white wave. There are no waves on the Flores Sea. It is a mirror of a birdless sky, the line that leads to a flat horizon. There is no escape.</p>\n<p>Some of your boat mates swim in the tepid broth. You do not. You have been going through tampons every two hours. You don’t know whether you’ve brought enough or where you could buy more in the middle of the Flores Sea.</p>\n<p>By day, the Indonesian boat crew gives you the side eye trying to decide whether you are one of them. By night, your boat mates sing sea shanties in the saloon while fear holds you down by both shoulders to press you into your sweat-soaked mattress.</p>\n<p>How did it come to this? You were never one to sit in circles singing Kumbaya. You don’t share your soul with strangers. Yet here you are, damp thighs glued to a wooden bench, listening to your boat mates fumble their way through the story of their lives.</p>\n<p>One man speaks of his alcoholic father climbing the attic stairs in search of someone to wallop. What you hear is his rage at the mother hiding in her bed, the parent who never protected him.</p>\n<p>Another man speaks of the family ship-building business, the in-fighting and the jostling and the weight of a tradition one hundred fifty years old, when all he really longs for is to go to sea.</p>\n<p>You imagine these speakers as they once were. You sketch them in your journal with knobby elbows, blunt cut bangs, a smile that still reaches the eyes.</p>\n<p>Soon, it will be your turn to tell your story. What will you say?</p>\n<p>Don’t blame your husband for the affair he had. The original sin belongs to you both.</p>\n<p>Don’t congratulate yourself for having avoided divorce. The hard work of marriage will never be done.</p>\n<p>Don’t blame your job or the stuffed shirts you work with or the hours you are forced to keep in six-minute billable increments. Don’t think that quitting your job will change your life.</p>\n<p>Don’t look for the island where the Komodo dragons live. You are no apex predator so stop baring your teeth.</p>\n<p>Listen, for once, to your heart. There are no distractions on the Ombak Putih. The boat has dropped anchor. The wind is still. That sound you hear is a pearl of sweat falling on the waxed teak floor of the deck. That taste in your mouth might be hope.</p>\n<p>You have always believed yourself to be unlovable. Say it out loud.</p>\n<p>Tell your boat mates that a Komodo dragon takes fifteen to twenty minutes to swallow a goat whereas fear has stopped your throat most of your life. Tell them that you might now be ready to write.</p>\n<p>And as you do, observe the fistful of light break through the clouds. Feel it expand your body until you become the wind that fills the slack sails. Now, let this boat fly.<br/>\n___</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brevitymag.com/nonfiction/komodo-dragons/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I am looking to solve the riddle where one and one do not make two but rather one is greater than the other, my world easily absorbed by a boy who says he loves me but does not want me to love anything else. Even myself.</p>\n<p>I have been to the Winchester Mystery House before, on a high school trip, shrouded in another life. Back then, we wandered the 160 rooms, learned about the 10,000 windows and 2,000 doors, and though most laughed at a widowed woman so mad she devoted her life to building a labyrinth around herself, already I understood trying to create something that would keep you unreachable and free.</p>\n<p>My high school friends and I kept each other close as lovers, whispered secret devotions and smoothed our hands over one another’s bodies to tend to what haunted us. There was the friend who was secretly dating a teacher, sneaking into his room on nights he was supposedly our chaperone. He knew we knew, and during the day he scolded us for giggling or straying off the path. There was the friend who gave herself to any boy who would have her because her father said she was conceived to replace a dead sister. There was the friend who threw up after every meal. The friend who cut herself to feel. The friend who hated herself because she hated a girl loving a girl.</p>\n<p>How I loved them, these girls. We grew up playing doctor, trying to heal hurts no one would see or believe, and with my oversized dollhouse, taking turns shimmying our growing bodies out the front door as if trying to escape. But after graduation, we saw each other rarely, as memories, as ghosts on the Internet. We tried to flee, but mostly we moved our hurts somewhere else as we built new homes.</p>\n<p>I have tried to build a home with my college boyfriend. He says the woman who built the mystery house must be haunted. He says the same about me, when I have feelings he does not understand, mostly unhappy ones about our relationship, or when I do not want to do whatever he desires like shoot guns or play video games or listen to him incorrectly correct me. Or mend a fight that he started by giving him my body.</p>\n<p>He does not like my body anyway, monitors what I eat by tracking calories on a sheet of paper he keeps in his pocket or removing my plate from in front of me during a meal. One Valentine’s Day, he buys me a chocolate cake in the shape of a heart and permits me one piece before throwing the rest away. As the years add up, pounds subtract on the scale and people ask me where I’ve vanished.</p>\n<p>At its most expansive, the mystery house had hundreds more rooms. Now many are lost, crumbled, walled off, or inaccessible. I imagine them as holes on the inside, wounds that will never be healed because they cannot be reached.</p>\n<p>I wander towards another of the six kitchens but my boyfriend reaches for my hand to pull me back in his direction. The tour guide talks about legends, stories about spirits and superstitions. Most are made up, a convenient way for others to understand a difficult woman.</p>\n<p>But it is no mystery to me why a woman would want to wall herself in, would build something only to watch it fail and be forced to begin again.</p>\n<p>It will be many years before I leave him in order to build something of my own.</p>\n<p>For now, we take the stairs. He climbs the conventional ones, moves easily to another floor. I prefer to take the ones where you climb and climb, convinced you might be mad, might be hovering between life and death, claustrophobic in the tiny corridor, the walls closing in, all that time and effort only to move a few feet, to go nowhere.<br/>\n___</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brevitymag.com/nonfiction/mystery-house/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Many years ago, in an adult writing workshop, the instructor asked us to profile a parent. At the time, I was struggling in my relationship with my father so he came immediately to mind. I began with, “My father is the tallest of two sons born and raised in Philadelphia who majored in philosophy in college and pursued a life in business.”</p>\n<p>As we scribbled, the teacher, who was well regarded and known for being direct, strolled the aisles where we sat at small desks, reading over our shoulders, nodding and hmmm-ing.</p>\n<p>When she arrived at my desk, she peered at my page. I looked up and saw her frown.</p>\n<p>“Tell me about your mother,” she said.<br/>\n“But there’s much more drama around my father,” I responded.<br/>\n“That may be true, but just tell me one thing — one unusual detail — about your mother.”<br/>\nIt took a moment, but out came, “Well, my mother did grow up in a hotel.”<br/>\n“Ah. That’s it!” A smile came to her face. “You must write about your mother.”</p>\n<p>And, before I could argue, off she strolled to the next writer.</p>\n<p>That was the day I learned about the value of the well-selected detail. The one that comes to mind when we think of a particular person. The one we recall long after reading a book. The ones that signals a storyline.</p>\n<p>Details like: Mob boss Tony Soprano sees a therapist. Wednesday Addams wears a white-collared black dress, pigtails and has a fascination with the macabre. Harry Potter has a lightning bolt-shaped scar on his forehead.</p>\n<p>What I discovered that day was that the right details don’t just set the table. They are more like the seasoning we add to a recipe. They project clues about the character and the storyline.</p>\n<p>They can actually work as a narrative tool. Even if we call a rose by some other name, by its color or texture or aroma — as Juliet said to Romeo — naming it allows us to experience it.</p>\n<p>All a reader learns about my father in those first words I wrote was his height, where he grew up, what he studied and did for a living. They expressed very little about who he was at his core, what my story about him might be and any sense of his relationship to me.</p>\n<p>Compare this to when people learn that my mother grew up in a hotel. Their eyebrows go up. “Really?” they ask. They often bring up the children’s storybook character Eloise, though my mother didn’t live at the Plaza but at a hotel in Pittsburgh. She did, however, live with her mother and father in three rooms with no kitchen. She would take the elevator down to the hotel dining room, order a bowl of cereal for breakfast — which she ate alone — and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch. Growing up in a hotel not only left her with zero kitchen skills, but they influenced her decorative leanings to something I lovingly call institutionally immaculate. Clean. Spare. Formal. There was a lot about her that was formed by growing up in that environment.</p>\n<p>These are the kind of details that can lure us into a story.</p>\n<p>Here’s the thing — we don’t need many. Too much detail can distract your reader and slow the pace of the action.</p>\n<p>An example from Dinty W. Moore. Compare this scene:</p>\n<p>\n      <i>My mother walked quickly into the room and she sure seemed angry about something. She didn’t normally enter my bedroom when the door was closed.

    "body": "<p>There’s a well-worn trope in the literary world that publishing a book is an act of creation analogous to producing a human life. Authors refer to their “book babies,” announce due dates, celebrate publication birthdays, enlist book doulas. “It’s your baby!” I’ve been told of my forthcoming debut. “It must feel like you’re giving birth to another child.”</p>\n<p>And, sure: it’s a conception only possible through great care and love and the deepest sort of nurturing, culminating in the grueling work of pushing something beautiful into the world.</p>\n<p>But, I can’t claim to know if the comparison totally holds.</p>\n<p>My book, an infertility memoir-in-essays, isn’t out until October. What has felt true on my long path to publication is a notion adjacent to the natalist fairytale: the rejection and pain and hope of the querying and submission process is the closest mirror I’ve found to infertility itself.</p>\n<p>Most notably, it’s the waiting. In publishing, the infinite stretches of being on hold in anticipation of something happening — for an editor to read, for a response to a query that may never come, recognizing that three or even six months is somehow a reasonable period in which to expect a response — felt so much like the waits I did when I was trying to get pregnant. That unsettled discomfort and bottomless longing while I waited for my period, for an explanation, for an IVF cycle to finally work.</p>\n<p>Though even as one wait flowed into the next, it didn’t matter much anyway, because in books, as in babies, it’s all or nothing. There’s no chipping away, inching incrementally closer to your goal, celebrating modest wins as you close the gap. You either sell your book or you don’t. You get to hold your baby or you don’t. And to keep going, to find a way forward when your entire query column is a tally of nos, when there isn’t one remaining imprint on your submission list, when your body refuses to accept even the healthiest embryo and grow it into a baby — you require a sort of obsessive belief in what could be, what you just know is possible, even when the universe seems hell bent on proving otherwise. To be the driving force in an act of creation requires something deeper than stamina, something steelier, like an unyielding, existential urge that says: Pick yourself up. Do not stop. What else is there?</p>\n<p>The lowest moments on the path to publication — the agent who considered taking me on before ghosting me completely, the supposed book deal that fell apart weeks later — brought up feelings I knew intimately. The despair of rejection, the all-consuming longing, the unshakable focus and desire to do something despite a complete lack of control. In this way, the book mirrored not only the process of infertility, it reacquainted me with the emotions I’d grappled with while actually living it.</p>\n<p>Despite what I’d told myself about how my career as a magazine editor might be the sort of terrain I could gently fork into a literary path, I was as unprepared for the wilds of book publishing as I’d been when I set out to get pregnant. In both cases, the experience proved an odyssey through all manner of peril. This fall, my book, You May Feel a Bit of Pressure: Observations from Infertility’s Heart-wrenching Ride, will be released 10 years to the month after I sat down to start writing it. Back then there was a baby in my belly; that girl, Hazel, is now a nine-year-old aspiring writer.</p>\n<p>I never imagined I’d sit with this story for so long, a proper decade of gestation. In cradling it against my chest, gazing into its eyes each morning when I opened my laptop, the most traumatic period of my life has grown into something I can’t quite imagine living without.</p>\n<p>When you’ve been pregnant with something for a decade, it’s hard to know who you’ll be once you finally let it go.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/writing-life-publishing-and-infertility-by-amy-gallo-ryan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>On this day, exactly 105 years ago, a peaceful crowd gathered at Amritsar’s Jallianwala Bagh during the annual Vaisakhi fair to protest against the draconian Rowlatt Act. Formally known as the Anarchical and Revolutionary Crimes Act of 1919, this British law gave the police the power to detain, arrest and imprison without trial any person suspected of committing “revolutionary crimes”, a nebulous and all-encompassing category of offences.</p>\n<p>Punjab had already faced the worst brunt of colonial brutality since the early decades of the century, as hundreds of men were rounded up and conscripted for the British effort in World War I. But on 13 April 1919, the atrocities peaked to an unprecedented level. Under instructions from Brigadier General R.E.H. Dyer, the police opened fire on the gathering, killing hundreds in the next few minutes and unleashing a reign of terror on the citizens for days on end. The official figure of casualties was 379, though the actual number is likely to be in the thousands.</p>\n<p>Cut to the 2000s and the fields of death have transformed into a tourist spot. As writer Sarmistha Dutta Gupta recalls in her powerful new book, <i>The</i> <i>Jallianwala Bagh Journals</i>, during her visit to the site in 2016, she saw, “people swarming inside the Jallianwala Bagh. The lawn inside was curated, and even topiaries of sepoys stood with guns. People were busy taking pictures in front of the topiary and clicking selfies in front of the bullet-marked wall. Some people had opened their picnic hampers in the garden and listened to loud music. The inside thrummed with crowds, and flashy shops lined the outside.”</p>\n<p>The people of a country are a product of their times. Most of them take their cues from the state. In 1961, under Jawaharlal Nehru’s government, a memorial was built on the killing fields of Jallianwala Bagh, a move that Rabindranath Tagore, who relinquished his knighthood to protest against the tragedy, had strongly objected to until his death in 1941. The poet was not opposed to preserving the memory of the event, as Dutta Gupta points out, but rather to the idea of “monumentalising memory”. In his prescient address to the Congress in April 1920, later published in <i>Modern Review</i>, he had made his position abundantly clear: “Let those who wish, try to burden the minds of the future with stones, carrying the black memory of anger, but let us bequeath to the generations to come only those memorials which we can revere.”</p>\n<p>Tagore’s apprehension about the generational burden of the “black memory of anger” has come to haunt us in more ways than he could have imagined. One of the unique strengths of Dutta Gupta’s book is her ability to connect the dots between 1919 and 2020s India, via the Partition of 1947, tracing the bitter legacy of state oppression from colonial times to the present. Contemporary India is riddled with “Jallianwala Baghs”, a stand-in for the myriad forms of violence that citizens have had to face at the hands of subsequent governments in independent India.</p>\n<p>From the farmers’ protest against the agricultural black laws to the plight of migrant workers during the pandemic, the spectacle of suffering crowds appears with a terrifying regularity in the annals of India’s living history. However, instead of taking a dry academic look into the social and political narratives of Jallianwala Bagh, Dutta Gupta presents her years-long research in the form of a journal. The result is refreshingly authentic and powerful. Not only does she bring in a profusion of unheard voices, along with images, through her extensive use of oral history, but she also contextualises many of modern India’s present crises in the light of its complicated past.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/jallianwala-bagh-journals-book-review-amritsar-memorial-111712843351234.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

By next weekend, we’ll be in the thick of it with the first of the states going to the polls. Rather than look at vote shares and candidates, our lens at <i>Lounge </i>is a bit different. It’s the way elections affect lives that is of interest to us, and we approach it through ideas of art and culture. And so, the first of our stories for this election season is about cinema’s long association with the democratic process. </p>\n    <p>Films have always been a vehicle for parties to get their agenda across to their existing and potential supporters, with Tamil Nadu’s DMK being the first party to have built its base entirely by scripting films that read like party manifestos. More than stars, films have been a vehicle for campaigning and our cover story examines the impact, either obliquely or directly, that such films have on people’s decisions.</p>\n    <p>What will you vote for or against? That’s a question to ponder, because it’s not just about people and parties, but also the ideas that need representation. A few stories in this issue address these concerns, which may seem arcane but are deeply relevant to everyday living, such as climate action, the idea of history and the future of young people. We have a piece on a multimedia exhibition on the shifting aspirations and worries of 18-to-25-year-olds. Conceptualised between 2019 and 2024, the show, <i>Notes from a Generation</i>, by Snigdha Poonam and Prarthna Singh, is a collection of stories of the lives of young people that encapsulates a generation’s views on the world they inhabit, and is a pointer to the things we should think of when we vote, no matter our age.</p>\n    <p>As always, the elections coincide with summer, which chefs and bars are welcoming with new menus that spotlight unusual ingredients. As our story points out, everything from ant pupae to vetiver root are being pressed into service as the temperature rises. And if your palate runs to more traditional tastes, you’d be interested to read about the strategy and ideas behind Karnataka’s beloved MTR Foods, which started life as a place famous for its rava idlis but is now also known for its easy-to-cook packaged foods.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Write to the editor at shalini.umachandran@htlive.com</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>@shalinimb</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/opinion/box-office-polls-voters-elections-film-111712976432145.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Over a five-week stretch starting 25 January, I saw the same scene play out thrice on the big screen in three different films. First came <i>Fighter</i>, which had a recreation of the attack by a Jaish-e-Mohammed suicide bomber on a Central Reserve Police Force convoy at Pulwama in 2019, in which 40 soldiers were killed. A month later, <i>Article 370 </i>showed the Pulwama attack. A week after that came <i>Operation Valentine</i>, which again recreated the attack and used newsreel footage of the funerals. All three films had actors essaying the role of the prime minister, either attending the funerals or addressing rallies and promising retaliation.</p>\n<p>Every other week this year, a film has released that extols the achievements or reflects the concerns of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its affiliates—the existence of Pakistan, the rights of Hindus, the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. Since the official announcement of the polling dates (19 April to 1 June), there are some restrictions on campaigning. But films continue to play in theatres across the country that openly or tacitly make a case for the ruling dispensation.</p>\n<p>“A particular piece of propaganda by itself is unlikely to shift the way somebody votes,” says Aakar Patel, author of <i>Our Hindu Rashtra</i>. “But it all helps. The volume of material—whether it’s through social media or on the big screen or the small screen or radio—will consolidate the message the party is trying to send out.”</p>\n<p>These films range from big studio releases to shoestring provocations. Some of the makers have a discernable political agenda; others just want to turn a profit. If we consider only the films released this year, three broad categories emerge: war and foreign policy (<i>Fighter, Operation Valentine</i>); internal politics (<i>Article 370, Bastar: The Naxal Story</i>); and right-wing history (<i>Main Atal Hoon, Swatantra Veer Savarkar</i>, the Telugu film <i>Razakar</i>). There are also a handful of incendiary films with trailers out that could release in the next month-and-a-half: <i>The Sabarmati Report, Accident Or Conspiracy: Godhra, The Diary Of West Bengal, The UP Files, JNU: Jahangir National University</i>. And there’s <i>Emergency</i>, directed by and starring BJP candidate Kangana Ranaut as Indira Gandhi, slated for release on 14 June, after the election results are declared.</p>\n<p>This flurry of right-leaning films comes on the back of 10 years of increasingly conservative Hindi cinema. Secular overtures in commercial films—once as common an ingredient as song and dance—are less frequent now. Spy and war films boast of an aggressive “new India”. Dissenting voices have dried up. The idea of India as a Hindu nation is often touted, especially by historical films that portray Muslim kings as cruel invaders and play up the resistance of the Rajputs and Marathas. Meanwhile, films from <i>Brahmāstra: Part One—Shiva</i> (2022) to <i>Ram Setu </i>(2022) to <i>Adipurush </i>(2023) promote different shades of Hinduism, from quasi-science to baroque fantasy.</p>\n<p>How has this pronounced slant affected Hindi cinema? Few would argue that Bollywood has made any leaps, or even small hops, in the last five or six years. Compared to other language cinemas, it looks slow-footed and timid, unsure of how to capture the popular imagination or make an incisive point. The slant has as much to do with political climate as it does with opportunism. Films favourable to the government are offered tax breaks (four BJP states made the controversial 2023 film <i>The Kerala Story </i>tax-free), talked up by leaders in rallies, their makers given awards and, occasionally, party tickets (Kangana Ranaut is contesting her first election from the Mandi Lok Sabha constituency in Himachal Pradesh; Arun Govil is standing from Meerut in Uttar Pradesh). It all adds up to a unique situation: one of the largest popular cinemas in the world, overwhelmingly for the State, but not by the State.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/bollywood-hindi-film-elections-politics-government-fighter-article-370-111712922679732.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The service has not been available in the US since 2 April, and users were asked to migrate their subscriptions to YouTube Music, which seems like it will be Google’s prime “podcatcher” going forward. While Indian users can still access Google Podcasts on both app and web, multiple reports suggest it will not be long before other regions follow suit.</p>\n    <p>Launched in 2018, Google Podcasts has registered more than 500 million downloads on the Play Store. For me, it was an early introduction to the podcasting world through an app that was minimal design-wise and simple to use. It also had the option to add podcasts via an RSS feed. Six years down the line, I still have subscriptions to <i>Reply All</i> and <i>Science Weekly</i> on Google Podcasts. For Android users, this was perhaps the go-to app before Spotify entered India in 2019.</p>\n    <p>The <i>2024 Media Morph</i> report released on 1 April by YouGov, a UK- based market research and data analytics firm, reveals that Google Podcasts is the second most popular podcast app with 20% of Indian users, after Spotify (at 44%). Audible (15%) comes in third. Spotify is popular among GenZ and has grown in the last two years, going from 33% in 2022 to 44% in 2024. Google Podcasts saw a drop, going from 24% to 20% in the same time span. Seven in 10 Gen-Z respondents said they listen to podcasts each week (71%) as compared to two-thirds of the overall urban Indian population (67%).</p>\n    <p>“Just like Apple Podcasts, which is native to iOS devices, there was a lot of hope when Google Podcasts came into the market because it was a native app on Android devices.... I know a few people who preferred Google Podcasts because of its clean interface and searchability. It also meant downloading one less app to listen to podcasts,” says Shaun Fanthome, producer and chief operating officer at Maed in India, a podcast production company and audio consultancy based in Mumbai.</p>\n    <p>Fanthome says the app’s analytics also helped creators access interesting data points. “On the creative side, some of the data analytics that Google could provide are still not available on other platforms. It used to give you impressions and searchability information... You could find keywords being used for your podcasts when someone searched for it,” says Fanthome. “YouTube Music is an excellent opportunity. The integration is great, YouTube being the second largest search engine in the world.”</p>\n    <p>If you are not a fan of YouTube Music, there are other podcast apps that can do the job: Spotify (for creators: Spotify for Podcasters, formerly known as Anchor), Pocket Casts, Overcast and Podbean Podcast App &amp; Player, among others.</p>\n    <p>Delhi-based Razi Hasnain, who produces the <i>Shuffling Notes</i> podcast on music, has relaunched his podcasts in video format on YouTube. “But the most traffic I have seen comes from Spotify. Sometimes more than YouTube,” he says.</p>\n    <p>While Stitcher’s closure last year meant we are slowly witnessing the death of the podcast aggregator app, Google Podcasts now joins an unwanted list known among internet history enthusiasts as the “Google Graveyard”—a host of products shelved by the tech giant down the years: Google Play Music, YouTube Stories, Google Stadia and Google Duo and Hangouts.

While the original restaurant on Lalbagh Road in Bengaluru continues to be a major draw for food enthusiasts of all stripes, the brand is also a multi-million dollar company in the packaged food business. Its basket of 140 products includes ready-to-eat meals, breakfast mixes, traditional spices and <i>masalas </i>and sweets, among others. </p>\n<p>“Hundred years is not a common milestone and we are thinking of a range of celebrations for the entire year,” says Sanjay Sharma, 57, CEO of Orkla India, sitting in his spacious office in Koramangala.</p>\n<p>This is probably a good point to rewind to 2007 when MTR Foods, the packaged foods’ division of the parent company, was up for acquisition, allegedly due to a family split. In February of that year, it was bought by Orkla ASA, a Norwegian industrial investment company, for $80 million (around Rs.664 crore now). The restaurant business though continues to be owned by the Maiya family.</p>\n<p>As part of the reorganisation of MTR Foods, Sharma was appointed the CEO in February 2009. “It (the role) was about delivering sales, profits, growing the company and building a team,” he says. In 2020, Orkla picked up a majority stake in Kerala-based spice maker Eastern Condiments Pvt. Ltd. Last year, Sharma was appointed CEO of the newly restructured Orkla India, which comprises three business units: MTR, Eastern Condiments, and international business (set up to scale up exports in 42 countries).</p>\n<p>As the person leading the charge of established regional brands, Sharma is conscious of the magnitude of responsibility his position carries. If MTR is 100 years old, Eastern Spices turns 41 this year. “Running legacy brands comes with a tremendous amount of responsibility. It’s not just about taking the vision of the promoter ahead, it’s also about carrying the responsibility of the people who have dedicated their lives to work for these companies,” he says.</p>\n<p>As a combined company, Orkla India ranks among the top 50 largest FMCGs, and 15 largest food companies in India. But the organisation’s vision, in Sharma’s words, is to focus on their core markets. “We are counted as the sixth or seventh biggest FMCG player in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Kerala. So, our vision for the next few years is not to become a national brand in India. Instead, it is to become a national brand in these four states.”</p>\n<p>This strategy of focusing on being a big player in the local/regional area, according to Sharma, gives Orkla a competitive advantage with regard to consumers, suppliers and the trade itself. “Today, I do over Rs. 600 crore of business annually in Karnataka alone.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>On a Tuesday evening outside the al-Kalouti mosque in Amman, Jordan, a crowd of men, women and children has gathered. They carry Palestinian flags and hold placards that read: “Food, Water and Medicine are Rights Not Privileges” and “Stop Ethnic Cleansing”. Some display images of Benjamin Netanyahu, Joe Biden and Abdel Fattah el-Sisi alongside condemnatory messages. In a voice close to breaking, a man yells: “We’re sorry, people of Gaza.”</p>\n    <p>In Jordan, which shares a border with Israel and the West Bank, a heavy atmosphere has prevailed since October. Over half of Jordan’s population is Palestinian or of Palestinian origin, and in the capital of Amman, that number is far higher. Many have family in Palestine. “People are living in a ghost-like state,” said Jumana Abdin, a Palestinian Jordanian woman who lives and works in Amman. “It’s like my life is moving in slow motion. Looking at how the world is reacting and how people still justify the killing shows just how much our lives are worth in their eyes.” It triggers many emotions, she said, especially for the older generation that went through the Nakba, or the mass displacement and dispossession of Palestinians during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.</p>\n    <p>“In Germany you have to wonder if you might get in trouble for expressing support for Palestine, but Amman feels like a refuge,” said David Ghannam, a Palestinian German working in the development sector in Amman, who travelled to Gaza in early 2023. “There’s a sense of unity in Amman. We’re all collectively mourning the loss of innocent lives.”</p>\n    <p>Across Amman, signs of solidarity are ever-present: Palestinian flags hanging from shopfronts and in cafes; watermelon imagery on billboards, clothing and stationery; people donning keffiyehs; daily demonstrations near the mosque. Fundraisers are regularly held for Gaza, and businesses have carried out strikes in solidarity. Starbucks and McDonald's stores across the city remain empty. In supermarkets, customers are embracing local products, a shift that stems from a refusal to purchase products from countries actively supporting Israel, such as the US and Germany.</p>\n    <p>Another byproduct of the war has been a drastic drop in the number of tourists arriving in Jordan. Petra, which used to draw 4,000-5,000 daily visitors prior to October, has seen as few as 400 visitors on some days, according to the regional tourism authority. Bedouin-run shops in the famous archeological site remain deserted. “We went through difficult days because the Bedouins’ main source of income is tourism,” said Hussein W, who runs the Harmony Luxury Camp in Wadi Rum. “Now the situation is better as visitors who did come spread the word saying things here are safe and stable. But we hope for an end to the war.”</p>\n    <p>During the month of Ramadan, Amman’s streets usually come alive with decorations and a festive air descends as people break their fasts at sunset with a variety of foods. This Ramadan, however, was different. “People are [hesitant] to exhibit any sense of celebration,” said Abdin. “Streets are less busy, restaurants are emptier, and people are staying at home more. On the other hand, fasting for over 14 hours heightened our sense of solidarity with our brothers and sisters in Gaza, who are going days without food or water.\"</p>\n    <p><i>Yamuna Matheswaran is an independent journalist based in Jordan and India.</i>\n\t                                    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/amman-jordan-israel-palestine-conflict-111712737428396.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But this <i>Emergence Magazine</i> piece is about much more than simply color—in each of her essay’s vignettes, Krzywonos explores stories of extraction, violence, and death.</p><blockquote><p>Cochineal comes in vibrant reddish hues, like scarlet, crimson, carmine, and orange, and is known for its luster and longevity. To make cochineal pigment, brush plump, wingless females that have just made a waxy cocoon into bags and kill them by immersion in scalding water; exposure to steam, sunlight, or the heat of an oven; or rolling them on a wooden board without popping. If needed, leave their bodies to dry in the sun, then pulverize the dead bugs, and combine the powder with liquid. Seventy thousand female nocheztli make one pound of cochineal; harvesting the insects is tedious.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Marketers don’t want so much to capture the shriek of animals who give products their hue, but rather to capture the attention and appetites of consumers. Red insect pigment, also known as E-120 or Natural Red 4, is still used to color drinks, food, and makeup, especially those branded as having “natural ingredients.” In 2012, Starbucks stopped using cochineal in drinks such as its Strawberries &amp; Crème Frappuccino after consumers protested.</p></blockquote><h2>More picks on color</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2024/12/10/maya-blue-the-mystery-dye-recreated-two-centuries-after-it-was-lost/\">‘Maya Blue’: The Mystery Dye Recreated Two Centuries After It Was Lost</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“A ceramicist in Mexico retraces his Maya roots to recreate a long-lost pre-Hispanic pigment for the first time in more than two centuries.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2023/11/28/tyrian-purple-the-lost-ancient-pigment-that-was-more-valuable-than-gold/\">Tyrian Purple: The Lost Ancient Pigment That Was More Valuable Than Gold</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“For millennia, Tyrian purple was the most valuable colour on the planet….

Four?</i>We are curved together over the lip of the trash can as she empties her stomach. Her bile smells sweet and acrid, the desiccated remnants of a mango-pineapple mixer. A cup of ice water sits, sweating and futile, on the floor by her feet. Her skin is shiny and leached of color, amplified by the artificial lights in the windowless bar bathroom.</p>\n<p>Earlier there was a man, tall and insistent. Men are always like this around Jackie— long-stemmed preening flowers eagerly bending to hog her light. He had brought her an offering, a delicate, thin plastic shell full of ice and liquor. I had held it for her as she twirled around the bar’s dance floor and then placed it ceremoniously back in her palms, thinking nothing of it. Laughing, even.</p>\n<p>Now, I am calculating my complicity in her probable drugging. We’ve been in the bathroom for over an hour and she oscillates between leaning back against the cool dingy tile and clinging to the rim of the trash can, the black plastic liner slick with her sweat. Jackie is insistent that she doesn’t want to go to the hospital and I am reluctant to rip another shred of autonomy from her. I have become guardian of the damp feather that is her body. All of our energy, our concentration, is going into keeping her awake.</p>\n<p>When we finally leave it is a long, slow climb from the angry pit of the basement bar. Jackie is doing most of the work, each step a deliberate, desperate push. I am soothing her as she whines, though I couldn’t tell you what either of us said. As we ascend, I look for the man that did this to her. I am scared to find him, scared not to find him.</p>\n<p>Why don’t they write more survival stories like these? It’s all men and bears and wilderness. Never two girls trying to survive one night at a bar, clawing onto consciousness. Death feels so much closer here than it does in the woods.</p>\n<p>As I drive back to my house, Jackie tells me, <i>I just need you to go slower on the straight parts and faster on the turns. </i>She cannot even open her eyes, but she is telling me how to drive. This is the joke we will tell when we try to soften this night. We will excise our terror, play up the absurdity of this moment. We will laugh as though it is funny, as though we were having a really good time. But for now, I am parking and prying my hands off the steering wheel and Jackie is vomiting into the gravel that is my driveway.</p>\n<p>Inside, glittering clothes are stripped from our bodies and left in sweating piles. I sprawl on the living room floor next to her makeshift bed, nursing her. I feed her bits of popcorn piece-by-piece and watch her throat carefully for each swallow. I am both desperate to sleep and desperate not to.</p>\n<p>I think often about how the word roofie does not portray its violence, how quickly control can be ripped from your body without your consent. <i>She has been poisoned, </i>I think. Except poisoning belongs in fairy tales and there are no heroes here, just two girls suddenly aware of how frail our bodies truly are.</p>\n<p>The next morning, the view outside my house is filled with raucous twenty-somethings dressed in the trappings of nationalism, off to celebrate their freedom with fireworks and hotdogs. In my apartment, Jackie is Googling the side effects of GHB and Rohypnol. The circulating air is clicking on and off, muting and unmuting the sound of her crying. I am cleaning to keep myself from saying <i>I’m sorry, it’s not your fault, I’m sorry, it’s not your fault</i>, over and over and over again.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brevitymag.com/current-issue/girls-night/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I stand in the parking lot of the local nature preserve, hoist the last remaining stretch of bright blue kayak onto the roof-rack of my SUV and strap it in.</p>\n<p>On the phone, Brittany is ecstatic, explaining that this role as mealworm caretaker reminds her of her girlhood, when she was still young and life still possible, when Friday nights meant Dominos and Dorito’s and a slumber party in a friend’s finished basement. When days were soft and sunlight and spent at the public pool in pink chlorined nylon. Those days, dusk fell in Bellefontaine, Ohio, and Brittany rose to meet it in cottoned nightgowns from the local Walmart, bending her body over games of Twister, or drinking 7-Up beside her brothers. She squatted in the front yard of her mother’s home, her body hunched and careful as she hoisted baby birds and voles and mice from the mouths of the family animals and set them neatly into shoeboxes stuffed with folded washcloths and warm water bottles and ramekins filled with sunflower seeds, peanut butter, Pedialyte—these, makeshift recovery units made from boxes that, just a few months prior, held back-to-school school sneakers made of discounted leather.</p>\n<p>The mealworms, she tells me, are a privilege and the closest she will ever get now to having an animal of her own: something to caretake, to love, to nurture, to celebrate the way she once did children.</p>\n<p>I idle inside my car, watch an osprey glide above the water, and the thought comes naturally: the freedom of a bird with wings, greater than that of a thirty-two-year-old abused since childhood.</p>\n<p>Her stepfather, she was nine, no one believed her, and then they did.</p>\n<p>Later, after we hang up, I Google the life stages of the mealworm beetle, learn that before it is a beetle, the mealworm emerges in the larval form: an insect yellow and round as cooked spaghetti, the same kind served in heaping bowls to reality television contestants clamoring for money in our mutual childhoods. It is hard not to envision Brittany and I both sprawled out on the carpet of our families’ living rooms, watching competitors in pastel tank-tops consume basins of mealworms by the gaping mouthful, their faces gagging, their pink tongues lolling, the mealworms clamoring helplessly, wanting escape more than men want money.</p>\n<p>The mealworms, I read, then form a pupa. Then they turn red, then brown, then black.</p>\n<p>Eventually, they emerge as beetles, black and hard as Dominoes. They live for three to twelve months on average, and the females will lay within this lifespan three hundred white, bean-shaped eggs, which will again evolve into yellow mealworms, at which point Brittany’s supervision will no longer be necessary; technicians from the local zoo will return to collect and transport these fresh new offspring to place in the Columbus Zoo’s aviary, where they will be eaten by droves of birds housed forever within thin metal cages—indigo bunting and rose-breasted grosbeak, summer tanagers, orioles—that people like you and I and all of America’s parents with collapsible strollers pay great money to go and see, our toddlers tapping on the glass, cooing innocently at cockatoos.</p>\n<p>One small portion of the mealworms remain, their growth and development to be overseen by another inmate in good standing at the Ohio Reformatory for Women, and the cycles—of both worm and convict—continue in this way, ad nauseam.</p>\n<p>Every Sunday, I field this call from Brittany, and every Sunday, some new dispatch of what life is like for one in every hundred Americans, the greatest number of prisoners worldwide. Tonight, it is a story of mealworms, of the thirty-year-old tasked with raising them, and for all of the differences now between us—between the nuances of our Midwestern Sundays, between the ways the system failed and did not fail us, between who we are now and who we once were—for a moment in time, we were the same.</p>\n<p>Two girls in denim overalls fitted with iron-on pink peace signs and flowered patchwork.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brevitymag.com/nonfiction/american-girl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Or not. Because we will never really know. She just vanished.</p>\n<p>When the clouds come down to touch the earth, like they did this morning on the first of November, I run with ghosts. Their not-bodies thread the canyons, hover feet above the earth, cast the light from my headlamp back into my eyes. I recite the names of the dead.</p>\n<p>This fall, my children, Aidan and Kellen, both left for college. By definition I am still a mother, but I mother absence, empty bedrooms, closets without clothes, or maybe I am mother to memory of how they reached for my hand when out walking, sang nonsense from their car seats, how it felt to take a warm washcloth to their cheeks to remove pear, or potato, or snot, or syrup, more caress than cleaning, cupping jawline, tracing lips.</p>\n<p>We never found her body, have nothing to bury. We assume the river chose to keep her, continues to hold her body under a shelf in the bank; a cottonwood’s roots dig deep into the soil there. Those are the arms that claim her now.</p>\n<p>When Aidan was three and just starting preschool, we visited Tucson for the holidays. He received a scooter for Christmas. Underneath a still-warm desert sun, we took Aidan to the neighborhood park. He immediately hopped aboard the scooter and zipped back and forth on the asphalt, his left foot speeding him on his way. I didn’t know he knew how to ride. It was the first time my child had mastered a skill that I had not been the one to teach.</p>\n<p>A friend gave me a Brazilian seer stone two days after we lost Aela. At that point, we still had hope she might be alive. For hours we had called her name in the canyon. She never came. Standing at the river, on a bridge far below where she vanished, I looked into the stone, purple and opaque except for a flat window faceted into one side, but saw nothing.</p>\n<p>On the fourth day of her disappearance, we stood at the edge where she was last seen. Sending logs down the river had told us what we wanted to know—anything heavy, like a body, was not returned from beneath the shelf. Aidan and my husband Michael began digging, hoping to make a window into what we could not see. Above a crow would not stop calling to us. Her caws sounded like barks, a dog above our heads.</p>\n<p>Last night was Samhain, one of the eight pagan sabbats, the tip toward the winter solstice. In the north, we make our way toward the dark now, the leaves gone from the trees, soon earth shrouded in snow. I have to remind myself that emptiness is the place of pure potential; the inchoate holds all possibilities because nothing has yet taken shape.</p>\n<p>The house is so quiet now. I no longer know how my children spend their days. Entire days pass when I don’t hear from Aidan and Kellen. For years, my life was shaped to their needs. What is the form I assume for the formless? How do I hold my arms?</p>\n<p>Samhain is the night when the veil between the living and the dead is at its thinnest. Aela does not greet me at the door. I will not touch her fur again, have no body to ash. We do not elect the void; the void arrives. Maybe that is why I saw nothing in the seer stone. I was being offered emptiness.</p>\n<p>The morning fog has lifted, though the few golden leaves on the maples are glossed with the remnants of the night. They shine in the sun, not unlike a host of daffodils, but even now, through the window, I watch them fall to the earth. The tree distills; I close my eyes.<br/>\n___</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://jennifersinor.com\"> Jennifer Sinor</a> is the author of several books, including, most recently, </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brevitymag.com/nonfiction/lonely/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The doorbell rang in the middle of a hot April afternoon in Kolkata.</p>\n<p>It was yet another courier, the third of the afternoon.</p>\n<p>The temperature was already inching towards 40 degrees Celsius and the humidity was high. The family had drawn the curtains, turned on the air-conditioning and settled in for a post-lunch siesta. But it seemed that every courier in the city had timed their deliveries to coincide with our siesta.</p>\n<p>“As soon as it’s afternoon, the bell rings non-stop,” grumbled my mother. “No one can rest or work in peace,” I agreed.</p>\n<p>Bills, packages, books, groceries, medicines, gas cylinders—they kept coming, delivered by men on bicycles and motorbikes. Every time I opened the door, the heat hit me like a sledgehammer. The streets were deserted. Even the street dogs were nowhere to be seen. Not a leaf stirred in the <i>bael </i>(Bengal quince) tree outside the house. I stood impatiently at the gate in the blazing sun, waiting irritably as the delivery person rummaged in his rucksack looking for our parcel. I wondered what it would have hurt to have had the package ready before he rang the doorbell.</p>\n<p>Then I looked at the man. He had a handkerchief tied around his head. But he was still drenched. This was a few minutes of discomfort for me but it was a whole day’s work for him, all afternoon, probably every day.</p>\n<p>“I hope you are drinking plenty of water,” I said lamely. He gestured towards the plastic bottle he was carrying. “What to do?” He said. “Just because it’s summer, the deliveries don’t stop.”</p>\n<p>In fact, chances are because it’s summer, more of us are using services that require others to run around so as to allow us the luxury of being indoors. The grocery delivery apps, the food delivery apps, the errand running apps are all working overtime so we can keep our cool.</p>\n<p>This summer we will need more of their services than ever. India has just invoked a 21-year-old emergency provision to operationalise its gas-fired power stations from 1 May to 30 June as the electricity demand is likely to spike because of a projected prolonged heat wave. According to Business Today, last year peak power demand hit 243 GW in September, an all time high. This year, the power ministry is projecting it might hit 260 GW. Much of gas-powered generating stations are under-utilised because of commercial considerations.</p>\n<p>From a consumer’s point of view of course, these emergency measures are far preferable to power cuts or load shedding. Once newspapers would publish a zone by zone chart of projected power cuts. The reality often outstripped those projections. Sometimes the power would go for minutes, sometimes for hours. If it went in the middle of a favourite television serial or a crucial football match, the curses would ricochet around the neighbourhood.</p>\n<p>Load-shedding nights meant dragging a mattress on to the terrace, looking for the hint of a breeze. I remember lying on the terrace looking at the silhouettes of the buildings around us and the patch of night sky above. My sister and I invented stories about a ghost family who lived in the neem tree behind the house. We could see the neighbours in their windows, some of the rooms lit up by the smoky light of oil lamps. When the lights suddenly came back on, a cheer would echo through the neighbourhood as televisions would flicker back to life. “Let’s hurry and have dinner before it goes again,” my mother would say.</p>\n<p>As power cuts became routine, people started investing in battery inverters and generators, and every time the power went out, the generators cranked up. That loud rattling noise too became as much part of the city soundscape as its trundling trams and wheezing Ambassador taxis. We looked forward to summer holidays with eager anticipation but then were bored within a week as we lay in pools of sweat scanning the skies for a thundercloud that might usher in the relief of a nor’wester storm in the late afternoon.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/opinion/summer-heat-delivery-guys-climate-change-111713420319282.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>What does a deconstruction of the Palani temple prasadam as an ice cream have to do with learning about the fragile but rich biodiversity of the Western Ghats? Kurinji, a food festival on through 19 April at The Amethyst in Chennai, has the answers.</p>\n<p>Developed and anchored by food historian Rakesh Raghunathan, the festival is a sister-initiative that follows and complements the announcement of Sky Islands, an upcoming online eco-journal focused on the issues of food, community, culture, and environment of the Western Ghats.</p>\n<p>“Having grown up in the hills, showcasing the produce and history of the region has always been of interest to me,” says Raghunathan. Through the Palani prasadam – essentially a panchamritham made with dates, milk, bananas, honey and ghee – Raghunathan wants to not only showcase the natural produce that was grown, foraged, and produced by the earliest settlers of Palani, he also wants to make a point about the uncomplicated but sincere nature of faith, and the ideas of sanctity and devotion behind offerings made at and received from temples.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Also Read: </i>\n      <i>A community-run newspaper that celebrates the diversity of the mountains</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Through a spoonful of a panchamritham reimagined as an ice-cream, audiences could very well be introduced to the story of the indigenous communities and their contribution to the culinary landscape of the region, he says. Similarly, a take on the concept of the Buddha bowl will showcase produce from the regions of Kodaikanal and Ooty in one bowl – from millets to tree tomatoes and forest mushrooms with a vinaigrette made of plum – all brought in, in collaboration with foraging members of the Adivasi communities there.</p>\n<p>Such an intersectional approach will also inform the stories in <i>Sky Islands</i>, to be published by editor and writer Rajni George from early 2025. George has already done a version of this earlier with <i>The Kodai Chronicle</i>(TKC), an initiative that was born during the pandemic. Through storytelling, the initiative showcased the biodiversity of and challenges in sustainably developing the Kodai region’s ecosystems. This will now give way to <i>Sky Islands</i>. With this, George and a team that she’s still putting together, will expand coverage from just the Kodai region to the entire 1,600 kilometre stretch of the Western Ghats.</p>\n<p>Jacob Cherian, an advisor to TKC, says that when he worked on commissioning a series of stories for TKC about waste management in Kodaikanal, he realised that in Coonoor, Ooty, Panchgani, Mussorie, and Gangtok too faced similar issues. “We then realised we had to carve out a niche,” Cherian, also the director of TerreGeneration, a collective of social-impact storytellers, says. “It became quite evident that we needed a publication that could span these mountains–well in the long term it would be all mountains, but for now it's the Western Ghats,” he adds.</p>\n<p>With Sky Islands, George hopes to continue with the model of hyperlocal, community-driven journalism that TKC has championed. This will ensure that they avoid instances of parachute journalism – where a writer with no adequate context or knowledge of the region, reports on issues specific to a place. “This is very, very difficult even for the best reporter,” says George, who has experienced the pitfalls of such an assignment – as a reporter, editor, as well as a reader.</p>\n<p>“Also, as insiders, we are mindful of our roles as stewards for the environment when we are writing stories,” George says of being journalists with lived experience and responsibility towards a place.</p>\n<p>Expanding the geography of their coverage means getting different kinds of readers, too. This will further translate to more funding avenues, one of the biggest hurdles when trying to sustain the running of <i>The Kodai Chronicle</i>. George roughly identifies advertorial opportunities when including regions like the Nilgiris, or the Goan Western Ghats. Additionally, The Kodai Chronicle Trust will turn three in June, which, George says, will finally make them eligible for CSR funds.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Also Read: </i>\n      <i>Coexisting with the gentle giants of Kodaikanal</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/western-ghats-sky-islands-kurinji-kodai-chronicle-hill-stations-eco-journalism-111713424454231.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>There is just one legal lottery in Utah. The reward is the chance to explore The Wave, a gorgeous sandstone rock formation on the Utah-Arizona border, revered for its streaks of vermillion and warm colours. It’s a fragile space and entry requires a permit, 40 of which are given using a lottery system. As the saying goes in this desert region, “even if you lose that lottery, you still win”. During my week in Utah, I didn’t win that lottery but I certainly did win. All I needed to do was take a hike.</p>\n<p>In the heart of the state lies the Zion National Park, Utah’s oldest, and a cluster of canyons, cliffs, sandstone and impressive views. Perhaps the most unique hike here is The Narrows, the narrowest part of the Zion Canyon, where the placid Virgin river is bound by walls that are a thousand feet tall. Hiking The Narrows is a pleasurable activity in summer, a way to cool off from the intense heat. In winter, it becomes an adventure sport because temperatures hover around the zero mark. Wading through the water is a daring, fairly difficult task. Despite being armed with a dry suit, neoprene socks, water boots and a sturdy stick, my feet are numb within minutes. The numbness comes with a payoff. The Narrows are a pleasing sight in winter, with clear waters falling gently over smooth stones, and soaring sandstone canyon walls that seem to reach out to the sky, some decked with icicles. It is enough to make you gape in awe.</p>\n<p>Sometimes a good travel memory involves frozen feet. Other times, it features a majestic sand castle. On another placid morning in Kanab, a city in Utah, I find myself close to the Best Friends Animal Sanctuary, the country’s largest no-kill sanctuary. I am not there to see the animals, but to embark on another adventure. Strapped in the backseat of 4x4 ATV, I listen to our guide from Roam Outdoor Adventure Co. talk about the trip (“hold tight”, “sand will go everywhere”, “remain strapped in”). It’s advice I hold dear because the next half hour is a hair-raising off-roading ride through deep sand, and over frequent road bumps into the heart of Grand Staircase-Escalante Monument. We stop at what looks like yet another sandstone mountain, and are told we have to embark on yet another hike.</p>\n<p>This hike is a short one, on an incline and through slippery sand. Two steps ahead, one slide down. Rinse and repeat. Our calves definitely feel the stretch. A few turns later and we reach the top. The sudden silence is deafening. I can almost hear people’s jaws drop. Ahead of us is the 200-foot Cutler Cove or The Great Chamber, whose name belies its outwardly beauty. A tower of sand sits beneath a cove, shaped by its time in the desert into a grand arch. All around are textured, striated walls of compressed sand, crumbly to the touch, which envelopes the cove in a natural, tan hue. The arch and the sand dune framed against the sky is a photographer’s dream. It’s a sand creation unlike anything I have ever seen.</p>\n<p>I get similar lessons in geology in Utah. Home to five national parks, the state is a tangle of mountains, red rock canyons, sand dunes, basins, glacier- and river-eroded canyons, rocky landscapes that look like Mars, and lava-filled trails. Every surface can be hiked, and each hike makes for a unique adventure.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/best-hiking-trails-utah-national-parks-111713273598522.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Every season we experience moments that are both stunning and inspirational in the Indian Premier League (IPL), franchise cricket’s biggest annual event. The first 30 games of IPL 2024 have already left some indelible impressions. Here’s our pick of the best:</p>\n<p><strong>Dhoni’s 666: </strong>Some are afraid of 666 as a mark of the devil, while for others it’s an angel number representing self-discovery. M.S. Dhoni’s 666 on Sunday night at the Wankhede stadium was definitely angelic, although to Mumbai Indians (MI) he was a familiar nemesis.</p>\n<p>He walked out to bat in the last over, to the accompaniment of the usual crescendo of cheers, and thumped MI skipper Hardik Pandya’s last 4 balls for three sixes and a two. It took Chennai Super Kings (CSK) from 186 to 206, and the 20 he scored was CSK’s margin of victory in the end. If this isn’t scripted in heaven, what is?</p>\n<p>For Dhoni to bat like that, after knee surgery and no competitive cricket since last year’s IPL, is one of those natural phenomena nobody can explain. He simply turned back the years like dialling a time machine. He even looks like his original avatar with his flowing hair.</p>\n<p><strong>Pant’s switch-hit: </strong>Excitement was high but expectations were low. Rishabh Pant’s return to the IPL was itself a miracle after his horrendous car crash in December 2022.He started promisingly but fell for 18 and 28 in his first two games. Then came a match-winning fifty against old foes CSK in Vizag, and everyone sat up and took notice: this was more than anybody had expected so soon.</p>\n<p>Another fifty, followed by 41 in 24 balls to win a low-scoring encounter in Lucknow, showed it was no flash in the pan. His wicket-keeping has been equally impressive, with sharp catches. Pant is now a serious contender to regain his spot as India’s wicket-keeper for the T20 World Cup right after the IPL season.</p>\n<p>A moment to cherish was a switch-hit to the boundary off Marcus Stoinis in the game against Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) last Friday. The nonchalance with which he swivelled around to hit it brought back to mind the audacity of reverse-scooping James Anderson of England in his pre-crash days. The usually serious countenance of Delhi Capitals (DC) director of cricket Sourav Ganguly lit up with a warm smile. Pant is back.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Pant being Pant 😉</p>— JioCinema (@JioCinema)<a href=\"\">#IPLonJioCinema</a><a href=\"\">#TATAIPL</a><a href=\"\">#LSGvDC</a><a href=\"\">pic.twitter.com/5ZN5YjwZtT</a><a href=\"\">April 12, 2024</a></blockquote>\n<p>\n\t                                        \n\t                                    \t<strong>Heady century: </strong>Travis Head is in the form of his life. After his match-winning century for Australia in the ODI World Cup final in Ahmedabad last year, the left-hander smashed the fastest century of IPL 2024 in Bengaluru on Monday. His Australian team captain, Pat Cummins, who is also the skipper at Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH), appears to bring out the best in the dashing opener.</p>\n<p>His 39-ball century against Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) began with a tame forward defence to off-spinner Will Jacks. After that, he swung at every ball to race to 102. It set up SRH’s record score of 287, topping their own 277 mark in Hyderabad last month. Strike rates are going through the roof, and we may see a 300+ total this season.</p>\n<p>\n\t                                        \n\t                                    \t<strong>Kuldeep’s googly: </strong>When LSG’s dangerous hitter, Nicholas Pooran, got bowled out by a Kuldeep Yadav googly for a first ball duck, it was a game-changing moment against DC last Friday. The sheer beauty of the ball beating the forward defence to go between bat and pad to the stumps was as good as it gets in leg-spin bowling. Yadav’s back-to-back wickets of Stoinis and Pooran, after dismissing LSG skipper K.L. Rahul earlier, broke the back of the opposition.</p>\n<p>The left-arm leg-spinner is oozing confidence and panache, after his comeback from the wilderness in December 2022. Meanwhile, his right-arm counterpart, Yuzvendra Chahal, is enjoying another purple patch at the top of the wicket-taking table of IPL 2024. Will we see the return of “KulCha” to the Indian T20 team?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/ipl-2024-indian-premier-league-dhoni-rishabh-pant-111713272612873.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The last time Mumbai City FC and Mohun Bagan Super Giant competed for the Indian Super League shield, in 2020-21, the match was in a Covid-19 bubble, sheltered from the virus and insulated from their supporters. But the two teams went head-to-head yet again on Monday, in another League shield showdown, in front of over 60,000, who packed and rocked the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata.</p>\n<p>They delivered a finale that was high on quality, and higher in drama. But Bagan came up with a decidedly superior performance when it mattered, stealing the show and the shield from Mumbai City FC with an entertaining 2-1 win. They finished the League stage at 48 points, the most by a team in ISL history and one more than their opponents.</p>\n<p>This completed a trio of triumphs for Kolkata clubs. Earlier, East Bengal won the Super Cup while Mohammedan Sporting Club secured the I-League title and earned promotion to the Indian Super League.</p>\n<p>With the League winners earning the only confirmed spot in Asian competitions—in AFC Champions League 2—a lot was at stake on Monday. The match between Bagan and Mumbai was billed as the best attack versus the best defence in the League. The ISL champions of last year versus the 2022-23 League Shield winners. Coming into the match, the Kolkata team had scored the most goals this season, 45, while Mumbai’s had been the stingiest defence, leaking only 17 goals.</p>\n<p>The fact that they were the two teams competing for the shield was a turnaround by itself. While Mumbai had seen coach Des Buckingham, who moulded the team into a winning outfit since 2021, return to England in December, Bagan had let go of title-winning coach Juan Ferrando in January and handed the reins back to Antonio Lopez Habas. Even Mumbai’s key playmaker Greg Stewart departed mid-way through the season, leaving a massive void in the team.</p>\n<p>When Petr Kratky, who was parachuted in from sister club Melbourne City FC, took charge of the team they were sitting fourth in the table. It was Kratky’s first turn as the head coach in a top division, but he rounded up the troops effectively, making the most of the talent at his disposal and getting them to perform as a team.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the defending ISL champions had made a strong start to their 2023-24 season as they won the Durand Cup and embarked on a seven-match unbeaten streak. In an attempt to strengthen the attack, the coach had thrown out the more adventurous four-man defence and opted for three defenders. The wheels came off when they faced the Islanders in Mumbai. In a high-voltage clash, which became better known for seven red cards, Mumbai handed Bagan a 2-1 defeat. On Monday, they kept it to a modest 10 yellow cards and 1 red (Brendan Hamill).</p>\n<p>After two more defeats in as many matches, the Kolkata club decided to part ways with Ferrando. Habas, who had led ATK Football Club (ATK merged with Mohun Bagan AC to become Mohun bagan Super Giant in 2020) to a title win in the inaugural ISL season in 2014 and later in the 2019-20 season, and understood the ebbs and flows of the Indian League better than anyone, took over as the interim coach in January. He demanded greater cohesion, better energy and improved performance, and the team delivered. From No. 5 on the table, they rose to the very top.</p>\n<p>Mumbai not only held a two-point advantage going into the final day of the ISL 2023-24 League stage, they were on a nine-match unbeaten streak; nor had they ever lost to Mohun Bagan since the legacy club made its foray into the ISL in 2020. The fanciful statistics, however, didn’t add up to a winning formula on the field on Monday.</p>\n<p>Perhaps unsettled by the atmosphere created by some of the most passionate fans in the country, or the weight of the moment finally bearing on them, Mumbai were slow off the blocks. Their transformation that had looked so seamless under Kratky, started cracking. And they were made to pay by a clinical and driven Bagan, who started with a 3-2-4-1 formation and dominated proceedings early on.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/football-mohun-bagan-sg-mumbai-city-fc-indian-super-league-111713270808463.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>For Anant Pujari, a marketing professional with a multinational in Mumbai, getting a job was a struggle, but not because he didn’t fit the desired role. It was because of his extremely vocal posts on social media, which was called out by prospective employers who refused to hire him if he wasn’t willing to change his online habits. For instance, he had shared images of his presence at the protests against the CAA-NRC Act in Shaheen Bagh, Delhi, which did not go down well with recruiters.</p>\n<p>“The first time it happened to me was five years ago,” says the 32-year-old. “I had no idea that my social media activity was being scrutinised. As someone who publicly posts about my political opinions, I got a bad rap from many employers who labelled my content offensive. Eventually, I had no option but to dumb down my activity on such platforms. I knew it would impact my career graph and I didn’t want to take a chance.”</p>\n<p>In today’s digital-first world, one’s academic and professional achievements are not enough to score a job. An individual’s profile has also become a deciding factor in weeding out potential “bad” hires. One might post a comment on issues currently plaguing society or personal thoughts on the country’s political climate, hoping to start a conversation and get more likes/followers, but it’s hard to predict how the post might land.</p>\n<p>In a US survey with 2,041 hiring managers, conducted in December 2022, by market research company Harris Poll on behalf of Express Employment Professionals (a leading staffing company in US and Canada), 88% of them admitted considering firing employees for the “objectionable” content they put out on their social media profiles. This includes writing something offensive, sharing sexually explicit material or revealing confidential information about the company.</p>\n<p>“Social media is not the same as it was a decade ago,” says Bhakti Talati, an independent work-life balance coach from Mumbai. “Back then, it was mainly about connecting with friends. An individual’s social media account is more like their marketing tool. It has become an open platform to share not just their personal lives but also their opinion about anything under the sun.”</p>\n<p>At a time when general elections in India are around the corner and sharply divergent views define social media, how does an existing employee or a potential entrant into a company keep themselves safe from employers’ judgements? What if an individual’s political ideology is starkly different from an employer’s?</p>\n<p>An organisation must engage an employee for the competencies and skill sets they possess in achieving organisational goals, says Dr. Irfan A. Rizvi, professor of leadership and change management, International Management Institute, New Delhi.</p>\n<p>“As long as an employee fulfils their contractual obligations, an employer has to respect and reward them for that. Beyond this, employers do not have any right to dictate what the employees do beyond office hours, the hobbies or interests they pursue, or even the philosophies and ideologies they subscribe to,” he says.</p>\n<p>Until a few years ago, organisations laid out social media policies and expected employees to follow them. Common advice given to working professionals was to be mindful of what they posted on social media, lest it had professional consequences for them, says Neelima Chakara, executive coach and founder of PurposeLadder, a coaching organization that aims to increase the capacity and effectiveness of executives. “However, times have changed. The younger generation does not want their professional identities to overshadow their lives. They want to live with purpose and show up as their whole authentic selves in all forums, from the workplace to social media. In that spirit, youngsters are increasingly using social media as a means for public advocacy for social, environmental, and political issues,” she adds.</p>\n<p>In a democratic country, each employee has a private and social life that must not be controlled by the employer, believes Dr Rizvi. “An employee must have absolute freedom to express themselves any which way they want in their personal and social space. The employer is neither responsible for such behaviours beyond office hours nor liable to them,” he points out.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/social-media-professional-work-office-elections-censor-111713161320733.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>“Who was Marian Spore Bush?” The question begins an essay by Bob Nickas, who curated the exhibition <a href=\"https://karmakarma.org/exhibitions/marian-spore-bush-2025-188-new-york/works/\"> Marian Spore Bush: Life Afterlife, Works c. 1919–1945</a>, currently at Karma. The artist’s first solo exhibition in almost 80 years, it feels extraordinarily modern in both style and content. Vivid, saturated watercolors of flowers and Christian allegories in the back room flirt with naïveté as much as they nod to art history. In the main space are large depictions of grim scenes (e.g., bodies immersed in water or on a raft, coupled with formidable avian creatures) that draw on the surreal and the grotesque.</p>\n<p>So, who was Spore Bush? She was born in 1878 in Bay City, Michigan. She studied dentistry at the University of Michigan and was among the state’s first woman dentists. After her mother died in 1919, she used a Ouija board to contact her, and began receiving messages from deceased artists urging her to take up painting. The next year, she left her dentistry practice and moved to New York to dedicate herself to art and charity work; while organizing a soup kitchen, she met and eventually married millionaire Irving Bush.</p>\n<p>It’s the kind of compelling narrative the art world — or just about any audience — devours: rags (or middle-class) to riches, spiritualism, obscurity, and rediscovery, all in one fascinating figure. Hilma af Klint’s 2018–19 Guggenheim survey resurfaced the narrative of the self-taught, visionary woman artist, often unknown to or forgotten by the art world until her posthumous or late-life “discovery,” as a popular trope. It’s easy to read Spore Bush’s story and situate her in this lineage, and the exhibition essay does so — along with af Klint, it cites Agnes Pelton, Emma Kunz, <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/661920/paulina-peavy-spiritualist-artist-who-channeled-a-ufo/\">Paulina Peavy</a>, and <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/991689/gertrude-abercrombie-american-surrealism/\">Gertrude Abercrombie</a>, disparate artists whose notable commonalities are their spiritualist leanings and their gender.</p>\n<p>There’s no doubt that Spore Bush and her work deserve recognition. But this framing, particularly when little literature on her exists, should raise some questions. Who acts as the discoverer, who tells the story, how do they tell it, and what are its ripple effects?</p>\n<p>Thematically, her late mostly grisaille paintings bring to mind a different set of artists, including Goya, Otto Dix, and Käthe Kollwitz, whose art addresses violence, struggle, and salvation. Stylized birds occupy the bulk of the composition in multiple pieces from 1933 to ’43. In the United States, those dates span the Great Depression and midway through World War II, a fraught period rich with those same themes.</p>\n<p>In “The Gaunt Bird of Famine” (1933) — a stunning painting, but not the show’s most dramatic — a giant whitish bird, rendered in thin gossamer lines that arc into<strong> </strong>graceful points, looms large against a solid black sky. Below, in the same dirty white, is what looks like a village. Spore Bush articulates it loosely and thickly, but realistically enough that it feels separate from the sky. The divide suggests a symbolic menace sweeping over the real world.</p>\n<p>Two similarly striking birds, rendered in black against a cloudy gray sky, nearly meet at the center of “The Pawn Broker (Three Vultures),” from the following year. Below the rigid horizon line is a body of black water. A face, just above the surface, looks up at the birds, fearfully or dolefully; chains are visible around the person’s neck. The show’s standout is “The Avengers” (1943). Here, a winged figure flies close to a dead tree, from which three bodies hang. The dark, undulating ground resembles both earth and water, a stark contrast with the oceanic turquoise sky.</p>\n<p>Spore Bush herself described her art as prophetic and guided by the spiritual forces she called “They” or “the People.” Edward Alden Jewell’s 1943 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1943/05/19/archives/mrs-irving-t-bush-to-open-exhibition-artist-with-psychic-powers.html\"> New York Times</a> review, for instance, quotes her as saying: “They move my hand up and down and onward across and sideways in all directions.” Though this automatic process might echo that of af Klint, Peavy, and others, defaulting to such comparisons defangs the art and erases its cultural context. A more substantive comparison is the oversized vultures that recur in Goya’s </p>\n<p><i>Disasters of War</i>print cycle (1810–20), in works like “</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://fristartmuseum.org/exhibition/goya-the-disasters-of-war/#lg=1&amp;slide=4\">The Carnivorous Vulture</a>” and “</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038749/marian-spore-bush-was-nobodys-visionary-artist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>What’s the opposite of a white cube exhibition? <i> Touch Jamaica</i>, Rejin Leys’s show of paper sculptures set among the period props of a historic home, feels pretty close. The Queens-based Haitian-American artist creates mixed-media work that meditates on displacement due to the climate crisis, political shifts, and the legacy of colonialism. She is also known for the PulpMobile, a paper-making studio she wheels out to public spaces like parks and street fairs for community art-making. Both strains of her work come together in this exhibition featuring relief sculptures of local landmarks — the oldest tree in Jamaica, Queens, architectural details of defunct libraries and theaters —</p>\n<p>\n      <i>at the King Manor Museum, a historic house built by Rufus King, a United States founding father. Taken in this context, these paper works feel like the surface of the densely layered past that is our collective inheritance.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>The King Manor Museum is currently only accessible via guided tours between noon and 4pm, Tuesdays through Saturdays. This creates a unique dynamic: There is no skimming through didactic information here; rather, a staff member — in my case, Hannah — leads you through, room by room. The house itself has been decorated to reflect various periods within its past — an 18th-century room on the first, 19th- on the second — making you feel that you are moving through time. History feels not only alive but in progress: The very person walking with you is currently researching the objects that surround you. It is their archival research that determined the decoration of the library (jaguar pelts, apparently, were all the rage in the 18th century); the reproductions of paintings on the walls (art history lovers will be excited to learn that John Trumbull and Gilbert Stuart painted family members); and, speaking of the anti-white cube, even the color of the paint (plaster painted to look like wood, an original marigold yellow the museum hopes to restore soon).</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Rejin Leys: Touch Jamaica</i>\n    </p>\n<p>It’s fitting, then, that Leys works in paper, a medium so closely associated with archives and record-keeping. In the servants’ preparation room, beside antique muffin tins, dark glass jars, and a weathered wooden storage box, is a thick, pale blue paper sculpture imprinted with some of those very objects. Similar items are strewn around the gallery and the kitchen next door. Between two windows, in a darker blue paper patchwork set against a white wooden armature, for instance, is the imprint of what looks like an arched window with intricate ironwork. Around the corner, also set on a wooden armature, is a cobalt-blue work seemingly cast from a stone monument engraved with the years “1861” and “1865,” the date range of the Civil War.</p>\n<p>Indeed, in this room, it’s impossible to forget that each of us carries a collective history, that no one exists within a vacuum. Hannah, my tour guide, pointed to reproductions of the food that would’ve been available to the house’s early residents: On one side, local items, such as a turkey and potatoes, and on the other, those produced or transported via the labor of enslaved people, such as sugar and lemons. Whereas a white cube induces you to suspend the broader context in favor of the here and now, Leys’s exhibition demands that you see these objects in relation to yourself and the larger world.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Rejin Leys: Touch Jamaica</i>\n    </p>\n<p>I found myself drawn to the formal beauty of the works: the square dimpling and ripped apertures of one piece, the white spatters that dot another midnight blue sculpture like stars. But I felt that I missed Leys’s intention to make present not just the deep past of the 18th and 19th centuries, as represented by this house, and the contemporary, through her objects, but also the many nested layers of history between them. A link included in the exhibition’s didactics takes a viewer to a map of the sites from which Leys drew these impressions, such as a former Queens Public Library, bank, and theater. This information was intellectually engaging, but didn’t penetrate my felt experience; perhaps a Jamaica local might recognize some of these places and be more deeply moved.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038759/rejin-leys-contemporary-art-exhibition-in-an-18th-century-home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Traveling down a river in West Bengal reveals the enduring imprint of empire—and the soul of a region shaped by centuries of change</h2>\n<p>The morning temperature was pushing 90 degrees as I made my way on foot past the Howrah Railway Station in Kolkata, the capital of the Indian state of West Bengal. Following a guide, I wove through a crush of traders, civil servants and other commuters on the Howrah Bridge, a steel cantilever span over the Hooghly River. Down below, on a concrete platform extending into the river, the Mullick Ghat flower market was in full swing. Trucks from the countryside disgorged huge piles of roses, sunflowers and gladioli, and garlands of yellow and orange marigolds.</p>\n<p>Couriers placed the bundles on their heads and darted through a maze of wooden stalls as hundreds of customers haggled with shopkeepers over the prices of floral displays for weddings, cremations and religious festivals. This relentless cycle of buying and selling has gone on seven days a week, every week of the year, since the flower market, now one of the largest in Asia, was founded in 1855. Above many stalls, I noticed alcoves into which shopkeepers crawled at night, clambering down at dawn to begin another day of frenzied commerce.</p>\n<p>Kolkata has always been a city that tends toward extremes. When I first visited, in 1981, I walked out of the railway station and found myself enveloped in a scene that could have come from the febrile imagination of Hieronymus Bosch: refugee families from the impoverished countryside cooking and sleeping on broken sidewalks; barefoot rickshaw <i>wallahs</i> pulling their two-wheelers through diesel-choked streets and alleys; volunteers from Mother Teresa’s Home for the Dying Destitute coaxing the desperately ill to the charity’s shelter to die in relative comfort. Beyond this dystopian scene rose remnants of the British Empire, which ruled here for two centuries before India gained independence in 1947: spired Anglican churches, marble memorials, neo-Classical buildings where the empire builders once worked. </p>\n<p>Returning four decades later, I found that while much had changed, some things had not. My guide brought me back to the Indian Coffee House, housed in an iconic, nearly 150-year-old establishment packed with students and writers smoking and talking beneath lazily spinning ceiling fans. We browsed overflowing bookstalls on College Street that testified to the city’s vibrant intellectual life, exemplified by such locally bred Nobel Prize-winners as the writer Rabindranath Tagore (once a regular at the Indian Coffee House) and the economist Amartya Sen.</p>\n<p>But the city I encountered in the early 1980s, now a megalopolis of roughly 20 million people, has become an increasingly globalized commercial center. Economic modernization was already under way when West Bengal’s Marxist regional government was voted out of office in 2011 after 34 years in power. Subsequent reforms and initiatives have continued to help launch the state into the 21st century. “First Coca-Cola came to Kolkata, and then mobile phones, then everything else,” Monideepa Banerjie, a political journalist and broadcaster in Kolkata, told me. The barefoot rickshaw wallahs are still there, but now they share the streets with BMWs, Mercedes and other luxury vehicles. Glittering shopping malls and art galleries add to an increasingly international atmosphere. Last year, West Bengal’s economy grew by nearly 7 percent.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>&#13;\n\t<p>The British East India Company established its first Indian trading post near Kolkata in 1690.</p></li>\n      <li>&#13;\n\t<p>In 1757, the trading firm’s private army defeated a joint Bengali-French force, effectively seizing control of the subcontinent.</p></li>\n      <li>&#13;\n\t<p>After the “Indian mutiny” of 1857, a mass uprising, the British crown took direct control of India, finally relinquishing power in 1947.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>the Hooghly.

Nicknamed the “<a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/news/131107-white\">White Hurricane</a>,” the blizzard caused one of the largest inland maritime disasters in United States history, sinking a dozen ships, damaging seven others and claiming the lives of an estimated 250 sailors.</p>\n    <p>One of those vessels was the S.S. <i>James Carruthers</i>, a 529-foot-long Canadian freighter. It sank in Lake Huron, taking all of its 22 crew members to their watery graves.</p>\n    <p>Now, more than a century later, the wreck of the <i>James Carruthers</i> has been found. The vessel is upside down, submerged 190 feet deep on the U.S. side of Lake Huron, reports <a href=\"https://www.thescubanews.com/2025/08/25/the-ss-james-carruthers-is-discovered-in-lake-huron/\"> Scuba News</a>’ Kathy Dowsett.</p>\n    <h4>Quick fact: What made the White Hurricane so deadly?</h4>\n    <p>Between November 7 and 10, 1913, the behemoth storm ravaged the Great Lakes with <a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/news/131107-white\">90-mile-per-hour winds</a> and 35-foot waves, as well as heavy snow and ice.</p>\n    <p>The <i>James Carruthers</i> was discovered by David Trotter, an 84-year-old shipwreck hunter, who spent the past five years searching for the ship in Lake Huron, reports the <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2025/08/24/shipwreck-hunter-carruthers-michigan-huron-great-lake-david-trotter/85679549007/?gnt-cfr=1&amp;gca-cat=p&amp;gca-uir=true&amp;gca-epti=z119252p002250n11----c11----e003800v119252b0054xxd005465&amp;gca-ft=135&amp;gca-ds=sophi\"> Detroit Free Press</a>’ Frank Witsil. On May 26, while using underwater cameras to map part of the lake bed, Trotter and his colleagues spotted an object that matched the </p>\n    <p><i>James Carruthers’</i>dimensions</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>“They immediately knew they had found the <i>Carruthers</i> when her giant hull crawled across the screen, since no vessel anywhere near that size is still missing on Lake Huron,” writes Brendon Baillod, a friend and fellow shipwreck hunter, in a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbaillod/posts/pfbid0oMAvmjNYKD2n9ZzNbNYi4gLMRzsqaGe8w153ppVnwC5H1QgtuqXnVTtCjBVNdjUYl\">Facebook post</a> announcing the discovery on Trotter’s behalf.</p>\n    <p>The wreck is not where many experts—including Baillod—expected it to be. Instead, the vessel is located “well off Michigan’s thumb,” he writes, a nickname for the peninsula that juts out from the state’s Lower Peninsula into Lake Huron.</p>\n    <p>For Andrew Pepler, the great-great-great grandson of the vessel’s namesake, the discovery “laid to rest a huge looming question that has hounded my family, and the families of [the ship’s] crew, for generations,” he writes in an email to the <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2025/08/28/james-carruthers-shipwreck-relatives/85830714007/?gnt-cfr=1&amp;gca-cat=p&amp;gca-uir=true&amp;gca-epti=z117952p005050c005050e008400v117952b0055xxd005565&amp;gca-ft=122&amp;gca-ds=sophi\"> Detroit Free Press</a>, adding that he felt joy, happiness and excitement when he heard the news.</p>\n    <p>The <i>James Carruthers</i> is just one of the many shipwrecks Trotter and his team at Undersea Research Associates have found over the years. By Baillod’s count, Trotter has located “well over” 100 shipwrecks in Lake Huron.</p>\n    <p>“We do it for the sense of exploration, finding something that no one else knew where exactly it was,” Trotter tells the <i>Detroit Free Press</i>. “It’s a one-of-a-kind experience you just can’t duplicate.”</p>\n    <p>Trotter uses a somewhat unconventional method: Rather than heading out to a specific part of the lake to look for one known shipwreck, he prefers instead to methodically map “high probability areas” of the lake bed and see what turns up, according to Baillod.</p>\n    <p>Shipwreck hunters are still searching for other missing vessels that sank in the Great Lakes during the White Hurricane, including the S.S. <i>Leafield</i> in Lake Superior and the <i>Plymouth</i> in Lake Michigan.</p>\n    <p>“Think of four days of absolute hell,” Corey Adkins, a spokesperson for the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society, told the <a href=\"https://www.petoskeynews.com/story/news/history/2023/11/09/four-days-of-hell-remembering-the-1913-storm-that-sunk-a-dozen-great-lakes-ships/71501175007/\"> Petoskey News-Review</a>’s Jillian Fellows in 2023. “It started kind of like most storms do, kind of calm.

Later in life, he rejected the foundational document as a failure</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Gouverneur_Morris#/media/File:Gouverneur_Morris_(NYPL_Hades-268561-EM3000).tiff\">Wikimedia Commons under public domain</a></p>\n<p>“The general current of events, for some years past, drives us rapidly toward a condition in which no human power can prevent these States from separating into two or more sections, independent of each other. … I repeat it, fellow citizens, the union is in danger.” These <a href=\"https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/morris-to-secure-the-blessings-of-liberty-selected-writings\">cautionary words</a> might call to mind Jefferson Davis and other Confederate leaders who tore the United States apart in the interest of preserving slavery.</p>\n<p>But these were not the fears and threats of a politician from Dixie. Instead, they were published in 1812 as a somber warning from a New York Federalist with unimpeachable qualifications to speak on matters regarding the U.S. Constitution. After all, he’d written it. That elder statesman was the ebullient <a href=\"https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/gouverneur-morris\">Gouverneur Morris</a>.</p>\n<p>It just so happened, however, that Morris’ ire was directed at the only other person alive who could legitimately claim symbolic fatherhood of the Constitution: President <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/collections/james-madison-papers/articles-and-essays/james-madison-and-the-federal-constitutional-convention-of-1787/\">James Madison</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Convention_(United_States)#/media/File:Scene_at_the_Signing_of_the_Constitution_of_the_United_States.jpg\">Public domain via Wikimedia Commons</a></p>\n<p>Lesser known yet no less significant than the most famous founding fathers, Morris wrote the American government into existence but came to doubt his own words by the end of his life. He was a financial tinkerer who saw firsthand the detrimental effects of a weak federal government, a tried-and-true patriot whose family was torn apart by the American Revolution, and an <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/constitutionalconvention-august8.htm\">avowed opponent</a> of human bondage who nevertheless failed to incorporate antislavery language into the Constitution. Morris <a href=\"https://www.gouverneurmuseum.com/gouverneur-morris\">was also</a> a prodigious lover, an unrepentant elitist and one-half of a bizarre yet tender high-profile <a href=\"https://www.monticello.org/research-education/thomas-jefferson-encyclopedia/ann-cary-randolph-morris/\">marriage</a>. And, for the most part, he undertook his work while navigating a significant <a href=\"https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/gouverneur-morris-founding-father-disabled-american\">disability</a>; his <a href=\"https://www.statutesandstories.com/blog_html/gouverneur-morris-amputation-and-recovery/\">left leg</a> was amputated below the knee after a 1780 carriage accident.</p>\n<p>The towering, lusty Morris and the diminutive, solemn Madison had not always disagreed. In 1787, they were colleagues in Philadelphia, where they labored together to condense the disparate voices at the <a href=\"https://americanhistory.si.edu/explore/exhibitions/american-democracy/online/great-leap/adopting-constitution\">Constitutional Convention</a> into a manageable, unifying charter.</p>\n<p>The bookish <a href=\"https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/james-wilson-1742-1798\">James Wilson</a>, a Scotsman who would be confined to debtors’ prison twice while sitting on the Supreme Court before his death in 1798, <a href=\"https://csac.history.wisc.edu/2021/05/18/speeches-motions-and-committee-assignments-in-the-constitutional-convention/\">delivered the most speeches</a> at the convention: 172. Close behind him in loquacity were Morris (171 speeches) and Madison (167 speeches).</p>\n<p>Serving alongside Madison and <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/issue-table-hamilton-good-history-180969192/\">Alexander Hamilton</a> on the convention’s five-person <a href=\"https://teachingamericanhistory.org/document/committee-of-style-report/\">Committee of Style</a>, Morris had significantly condensed an unwieldy draft of the Constitution and <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/pre-1-2/ALDE_00001234/\">written</a> the preamble outright. Perhaps the seven most famous words in American history came from Morris’ mind: “We the People of the United States.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Gouverneur_Morris#/media/File:Gouverneur_Morris_1789.jpg\">Gouverneur Morris Papers via Wikimedia Commons under CC BY-SA 4.0</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://npg.si.edu/object/npg_NPG.74.47\">Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery under public domain</a></p>\n<p>“It’s fair to say that Morris wrote the Constitution, every bit as much as [Thomas] Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence,” <a href=\"https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/directory/dennis-c-rasmussen\">Dennis C. Rasmussen</a>, a political theorist at Syracuse University, tells <i>Smithsonian </i>magazine. “He singlehandedly and rather radically reorganized the draft Constitution, consolidating 23 sprawling articles down to a neat 7, and he changed or chose a great deal of the wording of his own initiative, oftentimes in consequential ways.”</p>\n<p>Madison himself <a href=\"https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/99-02-02-2323\">acknowledged</a> in an 1831 letter that “the finish given to the style and arrangement of the Constitution fairly belongs to the pen of Mr. Morris.” Nonetheless, Madison was more diligent than Morris in <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/collections/james-madison-papers/articles-and-essays/james-madison-and-the-federal-constitutional-convention-of-1787/\">recording</a> his thoughts. His posthumously published <i>Notes of Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787</i><i> </i>detailed the major discussions that went into creating the U.S. government. Madison also devised the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/virginia-plan\">Virginia Plan</a>, which privileged larger, more populous states, and wrote 29 of the 85 <a href=\"https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/full-text\"> Federalist Papers</a>.</p>\n<p>The fourth president continued tinkering with his notes<i> </i>long after the Constitution had been ratified. As historian <a href=\"https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/law/academics-faculty/faculty-directory/mary-sarah-bilder.html\">Mary Sarah Bilder</a> writes in <a href=\"https://amzn.to/45JfPCd\"> Madison’s Hand: Revising the Constitutional Convention</a>, “Madison understood his revisions as repeated efforts to create a record—his record—of what he saw as significant in the convention.

    "body": "<p>Ayesha Fernandez loves to tell stories. Like the tale of the tortoise and the hare—not the familiar version, but what happens next. The hare, she often narrates, realises that he needs to work harder to win. She also narrates the story of the teacher who fills a jar with stones, asking students if the container is full. When they reply with a yes, she fills it with gravel, which takes up the space between the stones. The students again reply that the jar is full. She repeats the process with sand and the students give her the same answer. She finally fills it with water, proving them wrong yet again.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/workplace-monk-mode-focus-tasks-office-111711905144063.html\">Also read: How to organise your work life like a monk</a>\n    </p>\n<p>These may sound like tales that Fernandez, 40, tells her young daughter, but her audience is actually her colleagues, clients, team members and senior leaders at her workplace.</p>\n<p>Fernandez finds stories effective in communicating varied information at work, whether data, technical details, processes, or abstract ideas. The hare and the tortoise tale illustrates that it’s never too late to change and get back to the top. The teacher story, on the other hand, shows there’s always room for improvement. “It helps the listener to connect and brings emotion to what would otherwise have just been a list of facts and figures. People’s attention is tuned to focusing on a story,” says the Bengaluru-based sales director at American software company Salesforce.</p>\n<p>Fernandez is among a growing number of professionals who are using storytelling in the workplace to convey information, make connections, entertain and make messages stick.</p>\n<p>Using stories to communicate in the office is not a new concept. For years, leaders have used them to build a more collaborative workspace. Storytelling has become a more important and integral part of the office now, because they help employees break away from the constant noise they are surrounded with, whether it’s in the form of leadership gurus giving<i> gyaan</i> on Twitter or forwarded WhatsApp memes explaining why it’s a “good idea” to take leave from work immediately after a confrontation with the manager.  Effective in-person storytelling helps bring the message home. The bonus points are that stories bring some heart to boring data, motivating and inspiring listeners and developing trust among people.  </p>\n<p>Studies, too, have shown that it is easier to remember random lists of words when embedded in a story. Author Paul Smith highlights storytelling’s effectiveness for varied learners in his book, <i>Leader As Storyteller: 10 Reasons It Makes A Better Business Connection</i>. The vocal aspect appeals to auditory learners, who prefer discussions and lectures; mental pictures help visual learners; while the emotional connection and feelings evoked stay with kinesthetic learners who imbibe learning through feeling and doing, Smith writes. </p>\n<p>People may be technically proficient, but there is also a need for them to be good communicators. “Whether in finance, marketing, or HR, many professionals need this skill. How do you persuade and influence people and push a call to action? You do it through stories,” says Debolina Dutta, organizational behaviour and human resource professor at the Indian Institute of Management Bengaluru, who conducts a post graduate and executive program on storytelling for business.</p>\n<p>But what distinguishes storytelling for business? Indranil Chakraborty, author of<i> Stories At Work </i>and founder of communications consultancy, StoryWorks, which helps business professionals become compelling communicators through storytelling, mentions three key distinctions in business storytelling. Stories in business are used to make point; they help wrap facts in context and deliver them with emotion; and brevity is key.  </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/social-media-professional-work-office-elections-censor-111713161320733.html\">Also read: Watch out, your social media posts might cost you a job</a>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/business-storytelling-happier-workplaces-communication-connection-111713719757190.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Art historian Alka Pande is multi-tasking. When talking about book cover design in the run-up to the Oxford Bookstore Book Cover Prize announcement anytime this month, she cuts out to handle something else for a minute. When she returns, she takes a minute to pick up the conversation again. “Attention span,” she says with a grin. “It’s also one of the reasons why the attractiveness and seductiveness of a book jacket becomes so important.”</p>\n    <p>Pande, who has been chairing the prize’s jury since its inception, is only half-joking. In a crowded bookstore, an eye-catching book jacket that attracts potential readers could be the first point of the book’s marketing success. With online marketplaces, cover design that is striking even in the size of a thumbnail becomes important.</p>\n    <p>Book covers have been around as long as books have, of course, but in recent years, a few things have put them in the spotlight: authors have been naming and thanking cover designers either in the acknowledgement sections of their books or during promotions, designers have been showcasing their professional portfolios and working on self-branding, and award categories for book cover design have emerged.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Also Read: </i>\n      <i>The comfort of books in our loneliest hours</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>The jury of the Oxford Bookstore’s Book Cover Prize 2023 arrived at their current shortlist of six after sifting through 300 entries. The Publishing Next Industry Awards 2023, which announced its winners in the last week of March, has three categories for book cover design: English (introduced with the first edition of their awards in 2016), Indian Languages (since 2019) and Children’s Books (intermittently since 2019). This acknowledgement of genre-specific design sensibilities in a category rarely fêted in India is pleasantly surprising.</p>\n    <p>Such diversity “is the sign of maturity and evolution in the market,” says Lisa Rath, partner at Delhi-based design and branding studio Itu Chaudhuri Design, which has worked on jackets of books such as Arundhati Roy’s <i>The God of Small Things </i>(IndiaInk and Penguin Books, 1997), <i>The Doctor and The Saint</i> (Penguin, 2019) and Mujib Rizavi’s <i>Sab Likhni Kai Likhu Sansaara</i> (Rajkamal Prakashan, 2018). She notes that the likes of a neon cover or a chalk-like typeface, common today, were rare a decade ago<i>. </i></p>\n    <p>The book cover is more than a rectangle. “I like to see an artist use the entire space, and the imagery flow from the front to the spine to maybe a flap,” says Danica Desilva, artist and jury member at the Publishing Next Awards for the last two years. While doing this, a designer ought to also think about bringing the book’s essence into an image, she says.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Also Read: </i>\n      <i>Recreating covers of books banned through history</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Rath calls this “depicting the temperament of the book”, making the job a balancing act between faithful interpretation and an original comment.</p>\n    <p>The book cover has become a space for the visual and literary arts to meet. “Book cover design<i> </i>is an inherently collaborative process,” says Antra K., who won in the Best Cover Design category at the 2022 Atta Galatta-Bangalore Literature Festival Book Prize for Saeed Naqvi’s <i>The Muslim Vanishes</i> (Penguin, 2022). </p>\n    <p>Over the years, she has learned how to blend her ideas seamlessly with the author and editor’s inputs, while also accommodating the pulls and pushes of a book’s marketing team. “Art can seem like an insular process,” she says. “But with a book cover, I know I’m making it for the author, the reader and for myself—and that’s quite exciting.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/book-cover-design-oxford-bookstore-book-cover-prize-publishing-next-industry-awards-111713670258266.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>On a windy April day, we were at Baragaon in the languorous city of Guwahati, Assam. In the sky, a large bird flapped its wings slowly. It was the bird we were looking for; we moved in its direction. We went down a kaccha path and then turned right. The road ended in a towering garbage mountain.</p>\n<p>It was an overwhelming sight. The garbage mountain was massive, with the solidity of a building or a monument. And it was alive. On thousands of kilos of plastic, food and solid trash, things were slowly moving. A cow chewed her cud, picked from the garbage. I wondered what she was eating, because the dominant feeling was poisonous. The stench was overwhelming, moving in pulses and waves like it wouldn’t mind socking us in the face. Plastic bags were everywhere, waiting to come alive on headwinds. Dust was omnipresent—some of it could have been the Brahmaputra’s silt, the rest was detritus. There was a haze in the air, but the birds and animals broke through the miasma and carried on their business. Kites did sorties in the air. Crows hopped about, suddenly taking off like smoke. And Greater adjutant storks moved ponderously through, their baby-pink neck pouches swinging like pendulums. Their gait had a certain gravitas, a sense of an inevitable closing of the loop. Greater adjutant storks were once the symbol of the municipality of Kolkata because they scavenged in garbage dumps. Decades ago, they soared in the skies with <i>Gyps </i>vultures, both looking for carcasses. Now, vultures are critically endangered, and Greater adjutant populations are much smaller in India—restricted to rural Bihar near Bhagalpur and rural parts of Assam and Guwahati.</p>\n<p>The faces of the storks have a marbled, mottled pattern, like they are in various stages of decomposition. A proud kind of decomposition, a frankness that feels like a homage to their surroundings—to the bacteria and microbes that surround the discarded and rotting. This is amongst the world’s largest storks, and its beak is pale, the eyes bone-white. And behind the heads of the storks, there is a glistening pink portion. It looks like a brain. Two spots of colour stood out on the garbage mountain in that blistering, dusty place—the brain-like back of the stork’s head, and the floral yellow<i> kurta </i>of a young ragpicker going up the mountain. She walked with consummate ease, as if she was going up a rolling, grassy hill. A child shrieked, pausing mid-play with a friend, before tumbling on the brackets of the mountain. Sobered, she resumed her work of parsing through the trash. The stork nearby opened its great black wings—like a thundercloud on the horizon, seeming to shake off the shrieks of children playing. Just as easily, the bird tucked its wings back, all threats of an angry rumble abated. In a single foot of space, there was a cow, a person and a threatened stork. They seemed to have an old acceptance of each other.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/greater-adjutant-scavengers-india-wildlife-environment-111713517039022.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Democracy, at its core, is about equality—and that’s not only about politics, it is also about the way we live. Or rather, choosing how we want to live is actually a deeply political decision, and even those who say they are “apolitical” are still making a political choice of not caring. So, this week, we look at the fundamentals of living in a democratic society through a curated set of books we think you’d like to read. That doesn’t mean that we’ve picked 1,000-page doorstoppers. Instead, we decided to go with comedy, fiction, parody, poetry and stories that have shaped people’s ideas of democracy.</p>\n    <p>Twelve writers tell us about their favourite stories that changed their view of the world, and moulded their personal beliefs about equality, identity and nationalism while being an engaged member of a larger community or the country. On our request, they have picked writing in languages other than English to reflect the variety of mores that characterise India.</p>\n    <p>Film critic Raja Sen selects shows—past and present, witty and dramatic, and all available in India—that will get you thinking about the challenges facing a democracy. From the evergreen classic political comedy <i>Yes, Minister </i>to the hard-hitting <i>Maharani </i>with Huma Qureshi, these shows hold lessons about the state of the country. While each of these books and shows make for good weekend reading and watching, we also hope they will help you look within and reflect on first principles before you go out to vote.</p>\n    <p>Elsewhere in the issue, we address the other big preoccupation of the month—summer. One columnist makes a case for being a little kinder to make the rising temperatures somewhat bearable, another story delves into the trend of dessert cocktails, while our compilation of products to keep you cool is inspired by the shades and shapes of mangoes.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Write to the editor at shalini.umachandran@htlive.com</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>@shalinimb</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/opinion/stories-vote-elections-books-politics-tv-series-111713580789309.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Every five years, as Indian democracy gears up for its biggest carnival—the general election—publishers fall in step with the spirit of the season. Suddenly bookshops are flush with political titles. From itinerant reporters with their ears to the ground to armchair analysts making heavy-duty predictions to politicians of all colours lobbying for their cause, everyone wants a piece of the democratic pie that is the Indian book trade.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, there is value in reading contemporary critiques of the state of the nation. But even as we delve into immersive reportage, the data stories, the autobiographies and hagiographies, it’s crucial to remember our primal understanding of the promises of democracy. That’s why, instead of putting out a list of new political books that have graced bookshops this election season, we decided to go back to the first principles. We invited 12 distinguished writers to tell us about some of their formative memories and literary experiences of democracy.</p>\n<p>What follows is an eclectic garland of ideas, thoughts and inspirations, strung together with remembrances of poems, stories, novels, non-fiction and defining moments from the past.</p>\n<p>Each of these pieces draws our attention to a point of view that is unique, a history of emotions that straddles reading, watching, conversations, and other traces of memory. We hope you will be inspired to look up some of the works mentioned and allow them to expand and complicate your consciousness.</p>\n<p/>\n    <p>\n      <i>Harishankar Parsai’s satire resonates with the drama of elections to this day</i>\n      <i>—Amitava Kumar</i>\n    </p>\n<p>I was recently writing about the drama of elections in a constituency near Gaya for my forthcoming novel, My Beloved Life. I thought of what might be the best description of this process—in Vikram Seth’s A Suitable Boy. A mofussil air, the petty intrigues, the shifts in fortune. By the time I was ending my book, however, I inserted a scene that is a classic in Hindi literature, Harishankar Parsai’s <i>Inspector Matadeen Chand Par</i> (1994), or Inspector Matadeen on the Moon.</p>\n<p>The father and daughter duo who narrate my novel are on their way to a restaurant in Atlanta. The father is talking bitterly about politicians in Hindi, his voice growing louder as he quotes Parsai, delivering his lines as if at a kavi-sammelan. Even as I imagined the scene, I felt I was paying homage to a writer whose deft satires gave his readers a small measure of agency. A political system that left them helpless could not take away from them the freedom of laughter. Here is what the father recites: “How politicians hear the call of the people just before the elections, this is a trade secret and cannot be shared. The call of the people is sometimes like the bleating of a lamb. The lamb is calling for its mother but it is the wolf who arrives instead. Even if the lamb stays silent, the wolf comes and asks, Did you call me? The lamb says No, I didn’t even open my mouth. The wolf says, in that case I must have heard your heart’s call.”</p>\n<p><i>Amitava Kumar, author of several works of non-fiction and four novels, grew up in Patna and teaches at Vassar College in New York.</i>\n\t                                    </p>\n<p/>\n    <p>\n      <i>True democracy requires a deep consciousness of humanity</i>\n      <i>—Gogu Shyamala</i>\n    </p>\n<p>As children, we grew up with stories about independence, freedom and nationalism. Barring a few small treats such as the children’s magazines Chandamama or Bommarillu, we had little access to anything more than school textbooks. So it was only as I grew up and started attaining some paripakvata (maturity) that I began to comprehend ideas like democracy. When I saw children drop out of school, or when I began to comprehend how caste and untouchability is practised in everyday life, I grew restless with asantrupti (discontent). I started looking at the ideas of freedom and the independence movement through the lens of caste. It changed everything.</p>\n<p>In 1910, the famous playwright and poet Gurajada Apparao wrote <i>Desamante mattikaadoi, desamante manusholoi </i>(<i>A nation doesn’t mean a land, it means a people</i>) in his patriotic poem <i>Desamunu Preminchumanna </i>(Love your Country). It was a great way to bring humanity into conversations about nationalism. But things stopped there.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/democracy-books-elections-2024-politics-literature-111713514096553.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Sudipta Das has witnessed drastic ecological changes over the years in her hometown of Silchar in Assam. “These days, we are getting excessive rainfall during what are supposed to be dry months. Nature is disturbed. Floods arrive earlier than usual, and with greater ferocity,” says the 39-year-old artist, who is currently based out of Vadodara, Gujarat.</p>\n<p>Das has witnessed a disproportionate impact of these natural calamities on women in Silchar. It is the women of the household who flush out the water from homes, arrange for food, and take care of the farmlands. “They end up falling ill the most during this time,” says Das, who is known for her figurines, crafted from rice paper and Hanji paper, depicting the migration of communities due to political and geological changes. Deeply touched by the suffering of women during natural upheavals, the artist—who calls herself an ecofeminist—has been creating works for the series, <i>Mother and Child</i>.</p>\n<p>Ecofeminism—the intersection of feminism, politics and ecology—isn’t a new term. It was first coined by French writer Francoise d’Eaubonne in her 1974 book, <i>Le Féminisme ou la Mort</i>. She wrote: “Ecofeminism relates the oppression and domination of all marginalised groups (women, people of color, children, the poor) to the oppression and domination of nature (animals, land, water, air, etc.).”</p>\n<p>As the world goes through drastic ecological changes, the concept of ecofeminism has acquired greater urgency. “The climate crisis is not ‘gender neutral’,” states a report, dated 28 February 2022, on the UN Women website. “Women and girls experience the greatest impacts of climate change, which amplifies existing gender inequalities and poses unique threats to their livelihoods, health, and safety. Across the world, women depend more on, yet have less access to, natural resources.”</p>\n<p>Art too has been responding to the concept of ecofeminism since the 1970s. A landmark 2020 exhibition, <i>ecofeminism (s)</i> —curated by Monika Fabijanska, an art historian who specialises in women’s and feminist art at the Thomas Erben Gallery in New York—offered a historical perspective of this genre of art, and its relevance today. The curatorial note stated that “ecofeminism is one of the richest hidden caches of contemporary art. It is art that delights the eye, provokes the mind, and can inspire change. It also restores art’s function to what it was before the Enlightenment, when both science and art were tools to understand the world and propose solutions.”</p>\n<p>The exhibition looked at the works of pioneering artists such as Betsy Damon, Ana Mendieta, Aviva Rahmani and Cecilia Vicuña, “and how their ideas and strategies are continued, developed or opposed by the young generation”. In India too, over the past few decades, contemporary artists such as Vibha Galhotra, Sonia Mehra Chawla, Navjot Altaf and Rohini Devasher have consistently been responding to political and environmental ecologies, but without really defining themselves as ecofeminists.</p>\n<p>However, there has been a change in the way artists are now excavating complex relationships between gender, ecology, capitalism, oppression, and more. The scope has expanded to include queer histories, anti-nuclear war sentiments, and privatisation of land resources. The mediums too have moved beyond painting and sculpture to include performance art and multimedia, with the body playing an integral role in the work. Bhavna Kakar, founder, Gallery Latitude 28, Delhi—who represents ecofeminist artists such as Das and Manjot Kaur— feels that this genre of art plays, now more than ever, a pivotal role in amplifying suppressed voices, evoking empathy, and inspiring action towards collective responsibility to nurture and protect our ecosystem for future generations.</p>\n<p>\n\t                                        \n\t                                    \t2023 witnessed some of the highest temperatures on earth, and many countries around the world grappled with extreme weather conditions. It is no wonder then that the past two years have seen a rise in the number of exhibitions focusing on ecofeminist art as well in response to these changes. For instance, the Tai Kwun Contemporary in Hong Kong presented <i>Green Snake: Women-Centred Ecologies</i>, between 20 December 2023 and 1 April 2024.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/ecofeminist-art-intersection-feminism-ecology-climate-change-politics-111713457421850.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

My parents driving across five states to stay with our four-year-old who would have been your sibling, his hand waving out the car window when they drove him to preschool the morning we left for the hospital, as if waving you goodbye. Canceling the baby books and the teething ring but not catching the gray stuffed bunny that still arrived and that your father hid in his closet so I wouldn’t see it but still did, clutching it to my chest and hearing the howl. Telling our four-year-old there would be no sibling. Giving him the bunny that would have been yours that eight months later he still holds to his own chest in his sleep. Seeing just this morning the last item I placed on the registry for you, a package of pacifiers three days before you died inside me. Letting go of your father’s hand and your aunt’s hand when the doctors wheeled me back for surgery. Selecting an urn at the funeral home, one shelf of infant-sized vessels. Filling out the cremation forms, never married, birth and death the same date. Standing on the driveway the night before the funeral home told us you would be cremated, half-sane beneath the midnight stars, your father and sibling long asleep inside the house, the only place I knew to go to still look for you, your last night on the sear of this earth. Our child hugging the stuffed bear that the funeral home sent with the urn, zipped inside something we could still hold. Sharing the same room, however many brief minutes, when the doctor pulled you from me in the surgical theater, the exact number of seconds I will never know, my brain fuzzed out into anesthetized unconsciousness. The doctor capturing your footprints, what your father and I opened on the day you should have been born, ink-blue and perfect. Inking the songbird after which you were named into my arm, measured to the exact size you were, the tattoo artist’s needle never digging deep enough, a pain I wanted to feel bleed down into bone. Reading the post-loss notes in my medical record, a detailed and clinical description of your removal from my body that concluded nonetheless in an entire paragraph on grief, containing your name, that I should carry your legacy forward by telling your story. Hearing your name in our child’s mouth, what we never told him, what he must have still heard. He said your name at bedtime last month and the breath stopped in my lungs and I asked if he meant the gray bunny beside him on the pillow and he shook his head, he said the bear, he said the stuffed bear, he said,<graphic src=\"https://brevitymag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Valente-Pear-1-300x233.jpg\"/></p>\n    <p>\n      <i>we’ll take care of Wren.<br/>___</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>___</p>\n    <p><a href=\"http://www.annevalente.com\"> Anne Valente</a> is the author of two novels, </p>\n    <p><i>Our Hearts Will Burn Us Down</i>(William Morrow/HarperCollins, 2016) and</p>\n    <p><i>The Desert Sky Before Us</i>(William Morrow, 2019), as well as the short story collection,</p>\n    <p><i>By Light We Knew Our Names</i>(Dzanc Prize, 2014).

G is at the hospital. Their kids are on their way.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>A Bit of It</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Hours later, a posted photo of the accident site on Facebook shows one car destroyed, the front end crushed, the rest damaged by fire. D’s car is farther down the four-lane highway, twisted sideways and pressed against a guardrail. “Whoever was driving the less damaged car,” the poster writes, “is the one who was seriously injured.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>A Glimpse of It</i>\n    </p>\n<p>In the comments that scroll below, a familiar name says she’s so sorry she didn’t recognize D’s car as she was slowly passing by in the one open lane. “All I thought was how awful it must have been by the look of the car that hit him, how fast it must have been flying down that hill to have its engine explode like that.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Some of It</i>\n    </p>\n<p>The following day, an electronic newspaper article reports that it’s still undetermined how it happened, but the elderly driver of the car that was struck while attempting to cross Rte. 15 was entrapped for two hours, that after being extracted, he was life-flighted to the hospital. “After extensive surgery, he is listed in critical condition. The other driver, nineteen, escaped serious injury even though his car was demolished and caught fire.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>More of It</i>\n    </p>\n<p>The detailed police report, when released a week later, is one short paragraph. In three sentences, it declares that there is no evidence that the uninjured driver was speeding. That he was not impaired by drugs or alcohol. It concludes by saying that the retired professor, who has died despite two major surgeries, pulled from a side road and attempted to cross two lanes of highway with “insufficient clearance.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>The Rest of It</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Because the retired professor was more than forty years a close friend, the report’s absence of detail magnifies the immediacy of his sudden absence. There is nothing revealed about what was surely, mid-afternoon, on D’s car radio—an NPR showcase of classical music. No reassurance that his seat belt lay snug around his waist and against his chest where his heart kept its reliable pace. No mention that his vision was recently recorded as 20/20 after being restored to perfection by cataract surgery. That his trained, historian’s mind, supplemented by extensive research, was mid-way through producing another commissioned book. Not a word about the why of his choosing Laurel Road, the most unlikely route for haste or convenience or mileage saved. Not a phrase about his retiree’s love of finding an unusual rather than a shortest route to anywhere he had to drive for the errands that were within thirty miles of his home. No investigation into October’s temptation of leaves, D’s annual self-guided motor tour where ash, sycamore, maple, and beech synchronize into Pennsylvania’s spectrum upon one particular, brilliant hillside for a few hours, receiving the slanted light so perfectly that whatever errand D had could wait patiently in a neighboring town eight miles north of Laurel Road. No speculation about how, each autumn, one farmer sells cider by that roadside until October’s end, closing his stand’s produce season with something that might have held an old, faithful customer for conversation while he sampled a preview of the gallon discovered intact behind the driver’s-side seat. How that highly likely give-and-take affected timing to the smidgeon of a second when fate exclaimed “Now” as D accelerated across those two downhill lanes, the high-speed rural-area traffic light and intermittent, even what could be called “spotty” just after three p.m., NPR’s “Here and Now” begun, the sun behind him, the sky clear of clouds.<br/>\n__</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:gfincke@susqu.edu\"> Gary Fincke’s</a> essay collection </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brevitymag.com/current-issue/all-of-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

(I am not allowed to drive for a month.) I sat in the passenger seat and cried and hugged tight a gigantic red heart-shaped pillow—a pillow you must lug around everywhere and clutch against your sternum in case of coughing, laughing, or sneezing (God forbid you sneeze: the pain is majestic in its agony) and even hug at night as you attempt to sleep on your back. My wife, who is a professional therapist, patted my left knee and said, “You do belong here. It’s okay. Remember they said you might cry a lot more after. Go ahead and cry…”</p>\n    <p>With the elderly I sit in a line of gray plastic chairs and I wait for the kinesiology interns from the local college to take my blood pressure and I watch the row of televisions—game shows on silent, local news on silent, a video about the circulation of the blood and another about eating a diet rich in nuts, fruit, and fish, both on silent but with closed captions—and nod along and listen. Mostly the elderly talk about their daughters. Or about death, but in a casual manner. For example, a typical statement might be, “Well, I’ll see you on Monday, if I even wake up tomorrow at all.” Or, “A young man like you should go to Alaska. My daughter Jenny went to Alaska on a cruise. She loved it.” And of course, the weather.</p>\n    <p>The weather should be a universal language, direct and elusive, forthright and yet metaphorical, but I never know how to reply. We need rain, we don’t need rain. I agree it’s cold. Colder than the ice storm of 1973? I’m not certain.</p>\n    <p>I went on a cruise once and it made me feel like I was trapped inside a snow globe inside a disco ball inside an overripe rotting watermelon sculpture of my own bloated face. And, yes, I understand the inevitability of death—as Larkin noted, “Some things may happen, this one WILL.”—but I don’t necessarily want to dwell.</p>\n    <p>And daughters. Mine is 17, and we both believe in The Smiths. We believe in Morrissey. What else do we share? Possibly she is slipping away from me…</p>\n    <p>Surely anyone can talk about the weather, can speak of sunshine, or of sleet sweeping the roof of the rehab gym. I used to work outside, on a motley landscaping crew: an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, a schizophrenic named Maxine who lived on the psych ward of the local V.A. hospital, the young frat-bro owner of the business who was never around except for payday (under the table, cash), and me. So many stories, so many tiny stories, of a truly odd summer in Tuscaloosa, Alabama: shattered windows, malt liquor, a man abandoned in a deep forest, a runaway truck (faulty brakes), a stolen purse, the V. A. nurse… gasoline, fire, fire ants, a rattlesnake, a llama, an ostrich, and a Great Dane. Days of hammering rain, which meant no work and no money. Days of scorching sun, humidity leeching out salt and sweat as we mowed, ran the weed-eaters and the blowers, planted flowers and ground shrubs and trees, dug holes in the red clay and ate dust and felt a shift in the wind and watched the skies, yellow, soapy, strange… ”A twister coming this way,” Maxine said. And it was.</p>\n    <p>Should I share these stories with my elderly friends? No, not today. Scale, blood pressure, Spectra 360, EKG, treadmill, bike, blood pressure… I fumble for my coat and hat.

I told you you were too good for this life. I told you that you should die because you thought that The Sea and Cake cover of “Sound and Vision” was better than the original. I didn’t really mean it. I drove you to score. I wondered if you’d have a tragic end like in the movies. <i>They only want you when you’re 17; when you’re 21, you’re no fun</i>, you sang in the car. Our lives felt tragic, and maybe they were. I bought into the romance of it. Made it feel like a movie. This was the only way I knew how to support you. Can you forgive me?</p>\n    <p>I remember when you tied me to your daddy’s bedpost, making the knots so tight I couldn’t move. You were sick of me saying no. My boner was a stand-in for yes. I didn’t have the words to ask you how you lost your virginity, the words to tell you that even though I didn’t want you like that, you were the closest to desire I had ever found. In my mind, you had always had sex. Was I even 18 then? If I hadn’t balked and begged for you to stop, I would have been a father—I’m sure of it. When people ask me about my Coney Island, I don’t have the heart to tell them; this is it. The cosmos aren’t consensual. Real life breaks you. In my dream, you would never have become a junkie. We would have named our kid Oscar. You would tell everyone that a gay man got you pregnant, and I would get so mad about it that one day we’d do it all over again. This was before the johns, when you were just a teen cokehead, a high school dropout living off the glamor of your absent daddy’s shame, before I drove you around to score, before I refused then let up just to refuse again. When it was one of your other gays who took you to your shifts at McDonald’s, to your dealers’ houses, to church. You who always needed a ride. Who was always going somewhere. Anywhere but up, you’d say.</p>\n    <p>Of course I know what Oscar Wilde has to say about stars. How many times did you recite that quote? Sneaking through the wooded trails during third period to go to my house and smoke cigarettes, coasting along country roads to your thirty-something-year-old boyfriend’s trailer in the sticks, making a home under the big Christmas tree in the mall. The cover of foliage, the hood of the car, the metal and plastic of the artificial fir: there was always a barrier between us and the night sky. It was something between protection and curse.</p>\n    <p>The first time you got arrested, the sky felt so big, it was suffocating. When I moved away, and my parents drove me the three thousand miles to the Pacific, I did nothing but encounter the mordant blankness of it, letting the pain strike me until it turned to numbness.</p>\n    <p>In my half-life since, I have learned to look at stars. You’ve got to take in the vastness like a punch to the gut. Consider your smallness. Let it mull over you. Stars have half-lives that we can’t even fathom.</p>\n    <p>Somewhere up there, Oscar is turning 18. We used to say the best die young, but eighteen years later, I feel like I’m just beginning to live. Back then, we were in the gutter, sure, but it was you who made me really look up. The absence of you, but yes, it was you.</p>\n    <p>The next time we cross paths, can you tell me if you feel the same?<br/>\n__</p>\n    <p><strong>  C.R.

When it’s ready he will call me down and seat me in the sun in the small courtyard between his house and studio, where he’s set a table for one: crisp white cloth, spotless silver cutlery. He’ll serve me orange juice, granola and coffee.</p>\n    <p>The flowers in the photograph are larger than life, velvety like the soft white skin of my inner thigh. They have been positioned against a dark background to look like a Dutch <i>vanitas </i>painting, a reminder of mortality.</p>\n    <p>My boyfriend buys me gifts: a necklace with a silver charm in the shape of an open book. He tells me he wishes he could introduce me to his parents, but they are dead. He shows me off to his neighbors at a party, wearing a new dress he chose for me.</p>\n    <p>One day I wake to find him sitting on the bed beside me. I am lying on my stomach. The bottom half of my body is naked. He has lifted the covers and, although I cannot be sure, I think he has taken a photograph.</p>\n    <p>I start to have panic attacks at work. It’s a good excuse for him to pick me up in his late model Audi, drive me back to his house and put me to bed. There’s no need to call my family or friends. He will take care of me.</p>\n    <p>One evening he is scrolling through my mobile and finds I have been messaging a friend.

    "body": "<h2>The sky above us is a complex ecosystem, just like the land and sea. A new field of research is bringing a fresh understanding of the birds, bugs and other species that live there</h2>\n<p>Each year on September 11, visitors gather at the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum in Lower Manhattan to watch an art installation called Tribute in Light. Two ramrod-straight beams pierce the night sky, representing the fallen Twin Towers and all the people who perished from the attack. Each beam is made using 44 blazing 7,000-watt xenon spotlights. On a clear night, people in the New York area can see the display within a 60-mile radius—it’s beautiful, soul-stirring, poignant.</p>\n<p>The light show is also mesmerizing to passing birds. Early September is the peak of fall migration along the Atlantic Coast, and birds from the northern United States and Canada—from warblers to sparrows to nighthawks—are streaming south through the skies above Manhattan. Once the tribute switches on, something comes over them: Researchers using weather radar and other types of remote sensing found in 2015 that the number of birds in the vicinity increased from 500 to nearly 16,000.</p>\n<p>As the birds enter the columns of light, each beam measuring 48 feet by 48 feet, they become so mesmerized that they forget themselves and their journey. They circle, zombie-like, inside the beams in growing numbers, calling out loudly, and their circling grows lower in altitude. If they fly too low in this disoriented state, they risk crashing into buildings or onto the pavement.</p>\n<p>Last year on September 11, I joined a group of binocular-bedecked staff and volunteers from the New York City Bird Alliance atop the Battery Parking Garage—the staging ground for the light show—for the group’s annual all-night vigil. Some of the volunteers had personal connections to 9/11—they’d lost loved ones or a limb or otherwise suffered trauma that day. Looking out for the birds is part of their healing journey. The light show’s producers and their equipment were stationed beside us on the roof of the garage.</p>\n<p>Around 10:30 p.m., as the birds appeared to descend into the danger zone, the aptly named Dustin Partridge, director of conservation and science for the alliance, asked the production company to switch off the installation. Immediately, the sky went dark, and the loud call of confused birds ceased. After 15 or 20 minutes, the lights went back on. (Insects get no such consideration. From our perch on the garage, we could see them wander into the source of the light beams and disappear with a loud zap and a puff of smoke.)</p>\n<p>Partridge signaled three switch-offs before midnight, and after that, the birds stayed out of the beams until daybreak. “If we weren’t there, the situation would be very different,” he told me after the all-nighter. “We would quite literally have thousands of birds becoming exhausted and falling from the sky or colliding with buildings nearby.”</p>\n<p>The vigil that night was a practical application of a young field called aeroecology. For a long time, scientists who studied flying creatures focused on their earthbound activities: nesting, foraging and mating. Because of a lack of technology, their time in the sky was largely left out. In the 1940s, George Lowery, an eminent ornithologist and zoologist at Louisiana State University, organized volunteers to document nighttime migrations of birds as their silhouettes crossed the face of the moon. But as recently as 2008 such studies were still rare enough that Thomas Kunz, a bat biologist at Boston University, wrote an influential paper, titled “Aeroecology: Probing and Modeling the Aerosphere.” He urged fellow scientists to regard the space above the ground not as a transitional void between point A and point B, but as a complex ecosystem in its own right.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/new-science-aeroecology-tells-more-about-amazing-creatures-humans-can-ensure-survival-180987151/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The structure is known as a <a href=\"https://esahubble.org/wordbank/planetary-nebula/\">planetary nebula</a>, though the term is a bit of a misnomer—it comes from the fact that early astronomers described the shapes of these nebulas as resembling planets. In reality, planetary nebulas like NGC 6302 are formed when a star nears the end of its life, as the outer layers of the star are shed into a cloud of glowing gas and dust. The planetary nebula phase is extremely short-lived on astronomical timescales, lasting only about 20,000 years.</p>\n    <h4>Fun fact: Planetary nebulas</h4>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/research/topic/planetary-nebulas\">Planetary nebulas</a> are formed by stars with <a href=\"https://esahubble.org/wordbank/planetary-nebula/\">0.8 to 8 times</a> the mass of our sun.</p>\n    <p>This cosmic butterfly is considered bipolar, because it has two lobes spreading out in different directions and giving it its “wings.” What looks like the butterfly’s body is actually a side view of a dark band of dusty gas—known as a <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2006/07/Dust_torus_around_a_supermassive_black_hole\">torus</a>—hiding the nebula’s central star.</p>\n    <p>The JWST image, taken with the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/webb/mid-infrared-instrument-miri/\">Mid-Infrared Instrument</a> (MIRI), focuses on that torus. The researchers also used radio data from the<a href=\"https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/home/\"> Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array</a> (ALMA) to supplement the space telescope’s observations. They were able to determine the location of the nebula’s central star, which, at 220,000 degrees Kelvin, is one of the hottest planetary nebula stars in the Milky Way. The research was published in the <i>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</i><i> </i>on August 27.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/HbRzasisfYu9w6n75eKn_bSk6KU=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(425x215:426x216)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/4b/a0/4ba0314e-9379-4606-9efa-3e836a4a3bf4/butterfly_nebula_ngc_6302_webb_and_alma_image_annotated.jpeg\" alt=\"an annotated image of the Butterfly Nebula\"/>\n    <p>Importantly, the new observations also allowed the researchers to gather more information about the formation of cosmic dust. The torus is made up of tiny crystalline silicates, such as quartz, and irregularly shaped dust grains. The grains are just a millionth of a meter long, but that’s larger than most cosmic dust. This indicates the dust has been around for a while and is also suggestive of the beginnings of planet formation.</p>\n    <p>“For years, scientists have debated how cosmic dust forms in space. But now, with the help of the powerful James Webb Space Telescope, we may finally have a clearer picture,” says <a href=\"https://profiles.cardiff.ac.uk/staff/matsuuram\">Mikako Matsuura</a>, an astrophysicist at Cardiff University in Wales who led the research, in a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250828002403.htm\">statement</a>. “We were able to see both cool gemstones formed in calm, long-lasting zones and fiery grime created in violent, fast-moving parts of space, all within a single object.”</p>\n    <p>“This discovery is a big step forward in understanding how the basic materials of planets come together,” adds Matsuura.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/1MW6Sa45JOi1kFna18Hwy-qsHZI=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(2550x850:2551x851)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/97/38/97384179-339f-4642-8015-e062af9ae1d3/butterfly_nebula_ngc_6302_hubble_webb_alma_images.jpg\" alt=\"a panel of three images showing different views of the Nebula\"/>\n    <p>The researchers spotted iron and nickel in jets that extend outward from the star, opposite each other. They also noted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), carbon-based molecules that, on Earth, are often found in campfire smoke or burnt toast. They’re also <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2021/space-complex-carbon-molecules-0318\">abundant in space</a>, and scientists suspect they play a key role in the formation of stars and planets, writes <i> Space.com</i>’s Keith Cooper. The PAHs in the Butterfly Nebula have a ring-like structure and likely formed when a bubble of wind from the central star hit the surrounding gas. They could be the first evidence of PAHs in an oxygen-rich planetary nebula, per the statement.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/see-the-stunning-butterfly-nebula-in-a-new-image-from-the-james-webb-space-telescope-180987267/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Publications including “Mademoiselle,” “Glamour” and the long-forgortten “Charm” first emerged in the 1930s to satisfy an emergent force in the workplace</h2>\n<p><i>Charm</i>amid traffic on Park Avenue. William Helburn / Getty Images</p>\n<p>Sometime during the Great Depression, a high school student named Helen Ralston complained to her father that she and her friends were fed up with <i>Vogue </i>and <i>Harper’s Bazaar</i>. The French couture and luxurious lifestyles promoted in their pages were unattainable, she said, while the articles did not speak to the interests of young women or girls her age. There were another 40-odd women’s magazines on the market, but all were aimed at housewives. </p>\n<p>Luckily for Helen, her father, Henry W. Ralston, a vice president of the New York publishing company Street &amp; Smith, was in a position to address her concerns. Since the 19th century, his firm had been turning out men’s and boys’ fiction by authors like Horatio Alger and Bret Harte, plus pulps and comic books like <i>Detective Story</i> and <i>Buffalo Bill</i>. Fired by this bracing wisdom from his daughter, in February 1935, Henry and his colleagues introduced <i>Mademoiselle</i>, the country’s first magazine for young women, which also became the first “career-girl” magazine in the United States. </p>\n<p>The extraordinary early history of <i>Mademoiselle</i>, and of the similar publications it inspired, is little known. A close study of their archives reveals an era of remarkable advancements for American women—poignant, as it proved so fragile. Nonetheless, these women writers and editors helped write an early and important draft of 20th-century American feminism. And they did it in style. </p>\n<p><i>Mademoiselle</i>’s first issue, conceived by a primarily male editorial team, got off to an inauspicious start. Later a newsagent told the editors that its few buyers were mostly men who, drawn by the saucy French name—and perhaps also by the cover photo, of a woman in a backless evening gown—mistakenly assumed it was a “girlie book.” Instead, the issue contained a grab bag of material concocted for a youthful female reader, including fashion sketches, girls’ adventure stories and overwrought tales of romance, one concerning a Southern gent who shocks himself by falling for a Yankee at a ball. Humiliated by low sales, the editors swiftly withdrew the sorry experiment from newsstands and halted publication for a month to regroup. </p>\n<p>Thankfully, by then they had hired Betsy Talbot Blackwell, a 29-year-old journalist with more than a decade’s experience in fashion reporting and marketing. Blackwell also had an adolescent stepdaughter, an impressive bullpen of writer friends on whom she could call and above all a keen sense of what young women wanted: something totally unlike their mothers’ magazines.</p>\n<p><i>Mademoiselle</i> originally targeted women between the ages of 18 and 30, all of whom had come of age knowing they could vote. “What nobody seemed to have noticed was that women had changed,” Blackwell later reflected. “Younger women were in revolt. Their ideas were different from their mothers’....They were not interested solely in recipes or babies. They were going to college. They were getting jobs.” </p>\n<p>She went after college women, publishing first-rate writing by authors like the wildly popular French writer of the day known as Colette, and pulling together an advisory “College Board” of students, who sent in tips about fashions and social trends. The magazine drew more eyeballs with an annual August “Guest Editors” issue, also assembled by students. This gambit, for which <i>Mademoiselle</i> is best remembered today, later helped launch literary stars like Sylvia Plath and Joan Didion. </p>\n<p>Other attention-getting ploys included a series in which a Hollywood makeup artist revealed beauty tricks used by actresses, adapted for home use. When a self-described “homely” nurse wrote in, begging <i>Mademoiselle</i> to transform her “from ugly duckling even into a pale pink swan,” the editors created the first makeover. Nurse Barbara’s metamorphosis made national news, winning a page of admiring coverage in <i>Time</i> magazine. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/first-magazines-written-for-career-women-reveal-portrait-immense-creativity-hope-180987174/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The Japanese government had issued an <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/surrender-of-japan\">unconditional surrender</a> to Allied Forces over a month earlier, on September 2, effectively ending the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pacific-War\">Pacific Theater</a> battles of World War II. With the United States, led by General <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/general-macarthur-australia-wwii-comeback-180984897/\">Douglas MacArthur</a>, now occupying Japan, the Imperial soldiers were instructed to return home. The war had lasted six years; many Japanese troops had disappeared or were missing in action. Others not already back in Japan were returning from China and Korea, and still others were on isolated islands <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-japanese-wwii-soldier-who-refused-to-surrender-for-27-years-180979431/\">unaware the war had ended</a>. Communications were disorganized, with many Japanese fighters simply arriving unannounced in their hometowns.</p>\n<p>Media outlets within Japan shared information about communication efforts, and one November article in the <i>Mainichi </i>newspaper<i> </i>reported about writing letters to missing service members. News like this prompted Torako to write to her husband, whom she hadn’t heard from in a year. She starts her letter stating, “Even the indomitable Yamato spirit seems to have had no choice but to surrender before the power of science,” referencing the cultural value of <i>Yamato-damashii</i>, or Japanese soul, along with the U.S. use of the atomic bomb <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/nine-harrowing-eyewitness-accounts-bombings-hiroshima-and-nagasaki-180975480/\">in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</a> Then, Torako gives updates on their three children and their new living situation. She concludes by writing, “Please come home quickly. We don’t need anything—just your safe return. Even if it’s autumn or winter, with you back, the house will feel like spring again. So, with that in mind, the entire family is waiting for your return.”</p>\n<p>Her letter was never delivered to Tadao, as he had already died (according to the Toyoshima family). This letter was also never returned to Torako. Instead, decades later, it arrived at the Smithsonian affiliate <a href=\"https://www.evergreenmuseum.org/\">Evergreen Aviation &amp; Space Museum</a> in western Oregon. Now the museum, working closely with <a href=\"https://www.obonsociety.org/\">Obon Society</a>, a nonprofit organization also based in Oregon, is returning Torako’s letter and many other letters written to Japanese military members in 1945 to the descendants and relatives of their intended recipients. The correspondence contains names and addresses, making it possible for the groups to find the families in Japan.</p>\n<p>The Evergreen Aviation &amp; Space Museum is a nonprofit that <a href=\"https://www.evergreenmuseum.org/about/\">focuses</a> on “preserving the artifacts and telling the stories of the men and women who impacted our current-day aviators, astronauts, engineers and explorers.” Some of its artifacts include the <i> Spruce Goose</i> (a wooden plane with a 320-foot wingspan) and the </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.evergreenmuseum.org/exhibit/titan-ii/\">Titan II</a>(a 103-foot-tall rocket used in the U.S. space program).</p>\n<p>The collections department at the Evergreen Aviation &amp; Space Museum stores and processes all artifacts that have been donated, gifted or lent to the museum. Jean Herkamp, the lead of volunteers for this department, describes her staff as “the caretakers of all the items.” In September 2024, fellow volunteer Barb Pittman was organizing shelves when she came across a small bag with Japanese writing on it. In the bag she found 116 objects: a mixture of postcards and letters in envelopes, all written in Japanese. Pittman then brought these objects to Herkamp’s attention.</p>\n<p>The full history of how this correspondence arrived in the U.S. and where it stayed over the intervening decades is not completely clear. Herkamp and the Evergreen team were able to piece together some information about the messages’ histories. They came to the museum in 2010, when a woman named Helen Hayley donated them, stating that they were found by her father who served during World War II and had since died. Hayley’s father said he found them in a “<a href=\"https://postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibition/about-postal-operations-administration/dead-letter-office\">dead letter</a>” file when he worked at a post office in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/a-batch-of-undelivered-wwii-letters-intended-for-japanese-soldiers-ended-up-in-an-oregon-museum-decades-later-now-experts-are-returning-the-lost-correspondence-to-their-families-180987271/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She didn’t know what it was, but she asked her superiors if she could keep it. They said yes.</p>\n<p>When she got home, she gave the tome to her teenage son, Michael William Bonds. He never examined it closely—but he kept it.</p>\n<p>“I’ve had it ever since,” Bonds, now 65, tells the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2025/08/18/pearl-harbor-navy-attack-book-lost-archives-found/\"> Washington Post</a>’s Michael E. Ruane. “In the last few years, I’ve moved here, moved there. It’s just been in a box.”</p>\n<p>The volume turned out to be a logbook from the naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. Now, half a century later, the National Archives has recovered the text, which includes records from before, during and after the <a href=\"https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/topics/pearl-harbor-december-7-1941\">attack on December 7, 1941</a>.</p>\n<p>At more than 500 pages, the logbook contains “regular, handwritten entries from March 1941—when war in Europe was raging but prior to the entry of the United States—to June 1942 at the <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/true-story-battle-midway-180973516/\">Battle of Midway</a>,” according to a <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/news/articles/nara-recovers-phny-logbook\">statement</a> from the National Archives.</p>\n<p>Bonds didn’t recognize the logbook’s significance until last year, when he moved in with his fiancée, Tracylyn Sharrit, in Hemet, California. She was helping him unpack his books when she noticed the mysterious volume. Every page that had been filled in featured a stamp at the top, which read either “Pearl Harbor” or “Pearl Harbor, T.H.”—short for <a href=\"https://www.hawaiimagazine.com/hawaiis-statehood-remembered/\">Territory of Hawaii</a>.</p>\n<p>The logbook recorded the barometric pressure, air temperature, water temperature, wind direction, wind force and weather every four hours, as well as the names of the ships that came and went each day. It also featured a section at the bottom of each page titled “remarks.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.army.mil/article/272241/remembering_pearl_harbor\">2,400 Americans</a>perished during Japan’s attack in 1941.</p>\n<p>On December 6 and 7, 1941, the “remarks” sections contained the <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/552663772?objectPage=286\">following notes</a>: “At 0657 unknown submarine (Japanese) attacked—was attacked and sunk near entrance. At 0755 Japanese aircraft and submarines attacked Pearl Harbor and other military and naval objectives on Oahu.”</p>\n<p>Sharrit was stunned. Could this kind of contemporaneous account be valuable? The couple contacted experts at <a href=\"https://www.whitmorerarebooks.com/\">Whitmore Rare Books</a> in Pasadena, California, to find out.</p>\n<p>“When someone reaches out and says, ‘Hey, we’ve got the station logbook during the attacks of Pearl Harbor,’ your ears perk up,” Dan Whitmore, the founder of the company, tells the <i>Washington Post</i>, which first reported the discovery. “That’s a significant cultural object.”</p>\n<p>Whitmore wasn’t sure how much it was worth, though he wondered if it could be a lot—maybe even six figures. But there was one complication: He worried the book could still be considered government property.</p>\n<p>When Whitmore contacted the National Archives, he learned that his hunch had been correct. A special agent with the National Archives flew to California, and the couple handed over their discovery. As gratitude, they received two National Archives T-shirts.</p>\n<p>“This special item is one of the few surviving records that helps tell the story of the ‘<a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1986022.afc1986022_ms2201/?st=text\">date which will live in infamy</a>,’” says Jim Byron, a senior adviser at the archives, in the statement. “Thanks to the efforts of [a] historically conscious California couple, it is now available to the American people, allowing everyone to better appreciate their history—and especially the sacrifice and heroism of December 7, 1941.”</p>\n<p><i>West Virginia</i>and USS</p>\n<p><i>Tennessee</i>after the attack on Pearl Harbor.

After all, without his mother’s keen eye, “it would have been gone and nobody would have ever seen it again,” he tells the <i>Washington Post</i>. “All I got was a T-shirt so far.”</p>\n<p>But officials are thankful that the logbook has returned to the National Archives, where it was formally unveiled in August.

    "body": "<p>T20 cricket was already a slam-bam affair compared to longer forms of the game. Relatively small grounds and mostly easy wickets made it even more so in the Indian Premier League (IPL). And yet, some IPL administrators wanted to give “entertainment” a bigger push, with more fours and sixes.</p>\n<p>So they came up with an “impact sub”, which essentially gives a team an extra batsman. In a 20-over game, that’s a huge deal. It means a team can have seven specialist batsmen plus an all-rounder or two. And yet, when it’s their turn to bowl, they can still have a full complement of their five best bowlers and more.</p>\n<p>With eight or nine batsmen, a team can keep going hard for 20 overs even if it loses two wickets every five overs. There’s almost no fear of getting bowled out or running out of batsmen in this scenario. So we are getting used to 250 plus scores.</p>\n<p>Is that high entertainment though? What makes cricket a nuanced game are the choices it forces captains, coaches, and players to make. On a particular surface, for example, should you aim for 250 and risk getting bowled out for 150, or settle for 200?</p>\n<p>The fundamental problem with the impact sub is that it has destroyed these trade-offs that make cricket truly engrossing. We anticipated this, in an article in <i>Lounge</i>, two years ago, titled <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/why-the-ipl-does-not-need-a-supersub-111663669791842.html\"> Why the IPL does not need a ‘supersub’</a>, before the rule was introduced in IPL 2023. Now, several players, including Indian captain Rohit Sharma, are speaking out on the damage it’s doing.</p>\n<p>While Sharma talks about the harm to Indian cricket because all-rounders are sidelined, it is sucking the life out of T20 cricket in even more insidious ways. Here are five reasons to drop the impact sub:</p>\n<p><strong>Diminishing value of wickets: </strong>After Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) got off to a blistering start in Delhi on 20 April, left-arm leg-spinner Kuldeep Yadav of Delhi Capitals (DC) struck three quick blows. Then Axar Patel removed Heinrich Klaasen with the first ball of the 10th over. SRH’s top four batsmen were back in the hut with 11 overs to go.</p>\n<p>Normally, a slowdown or even a collapse would have ensued—a fair price to pay for being ultra aggressive with the bat. But with extended batting resources, the loss of wickets barely made a dent in the scoring. SRH ended up with 266 and won easily.</p>\n<p>This is just one example of the diminishing value of taking wickets because teams have an extra batsman. Yadav’s triple-strike on a batting paradise in a small ground counted for almost nothing. When there are no consequences to going gung-ho with the bat, it’s no fun to see 250 plus scores.</p>\n<p><strong>Choice of playing 11: </strong>Eleven players in a team is one of the fundamental characteristics of cricket. Over decades, it has created a fine balance between batsmen and bowlers. Indian coach Rahul Dravid must have agonised over the fifth bowler before picking Shardul Thakur for his all-round promise, and leaving out strike bowler Mohammed Shami from the playing 11 of the 2023 ODI World Cup at the outset. Shami came in after four matches and became the highest wicket-taker of the tournament.</p>\n<p>These are the sorts of choices that coaches and captains had to make when picking a playing 11 in the IPL too, which fans enjoyed debating. Now the impact sub, who is really a 12th member in the side, has destroyed this strategic aspect of the game. The rule says, you can have your cake and eat it too.</p>\n<p>With an impact sub, Imran Khan would not have required his ingenuity of picking five specialist bowlers to win the 1992 ODI World Cup for Pakistan. Every team would have had five specialist bowlers instead of fiddling with all-rounders.</p>\n<p><strong>Lowering stature of bowlers: </strong>The T20 game is already stacked against bowlers. Most wickets are flat, grounds are small, and the white ball stops swinging after four overs. Now the impact sub has added the pressure of the top order swinging at every ball with impunity.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/indian-premier-league-ipl-2024-impact-subs-cricket-t20-111714052296487.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Sometime later, some of these thoughts made their way into Kakar’s 2008 book <i>Mad and Divine: Spirit and Psyche in the Modern World</i>. The book, which specifically had a chapter devoted to Kunley, challenged the prevailing notion in psychoanalysis that the body and spirit ought to be studied separately. </p>\n<p>“It is such a deep and important book,” recalls Gokhale, who authored<i> Mystics and Sceptics: In Search of the Himalayan Masters</i> in 2023. “It was a very layered understanding of human consciousness. And he could communicate these layers with simplicity,” she notes. This was the case at the many editions of Jaipur Literature Festivals that he attended (last in 2016), of which Gokhale is co-founder and co-director. “Apart from being a great writer, he was a great communicator. There was an ease in his speaking…psychotherapists usually only analyse individuals with the grammar of the Western world. But Sudhir would always root it in and look at the Indian context. That was his genius,” she says. </p>\n<p>Gokhale’s remarks are reminiscent of what a review of Kakar’s <i>Mad and Divine</i>, published in the 2011 edition of <i>The Journal of Asian Studies </i>had also noted. The author Daniel J. Meckel, an associate professor of philosophy and religious studies at the St. Mary’s College of Maryland writes that with the book, “Kakar once again brings an extraordinary depth of psychoanalytic and Indian sensibilities to bear on topics of sainthood, religious ritual, and healing in India, as well as the profession of psychoanalysis itself.” </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Also Read: </i>\n      <i>Story of Sigmund Freud’s home</i>\n    </p>\n<p>This sense—that Kakar was one of the few intellectuals who managed to forge a new, original, and Indian path in the field of psychoanalysis—strongly colours the memories of most who remember him today. Internationally, a well-awarded academic and author of 20 books, including six works of fiction, Kakar died on 22 April. He was 86.</p>\n<p>Among his works of fiction are <i>The Ascetic of Desire</i>, a fictionalisation of the life of Vatsayana, the sage who wrote the Kama Sutra, <i>The Kipling File</i>, a similar treatment of the British Indian writer Rudyard Kipling’s life, and <i>Mira And The Mahatma</i>, another novelisation of the relationship between Mohandas Gandhi and his follower Madeleine Slade or Mira Behn. His non-fiction includes <i>Inner World</i>, a study of Swami Vivekananda; <i>Analyst and Mystic</i>, a similar study of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa; <i>Shamans, Mystics, And Doctors</i>, a psychological study of the ancient healing traditions of India; and <i>The Colours of Violence</i>, a psychoanalytical examination of the causes of communal violence in the country. </p>\n<p>Kakar, an engineer by training, also earned a doctorate in Economics from the University of Vienna, and later trained at the Sigmund Freud Institute in the University of Frankfurt.</p>\n<p>“He was a rare intellectual,” says Ramin Jahanbegloo, Iranian-born philosopher and friend of Kakar’s for over 20 years. “But beyond his work on Indian psychoanalysis and spirituality, I want to add that he had the character of a typical intellectual—he was an Indian but also a man of universal thought, always open to ideas, travelling to different countries, and meeting with psychoanalysts there—including in Iran. Not many people do that. To me that was very important,” Jahanbegloo adds. A series of his conversations and interviews with Kakar, on topics ranging from the Partition, secularism, tradition and culture, and several iconic leaders like Gandhi or Nehru, were published in the 2009 book <i>India Analysed</i>. </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Also Read: </i>\n      <i>Review of Sudhir Kakar’s ‘The Devil Take Love’</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/sudhir-kakar-works-death-namita-gokhale-ramin-jahanbegloo-111714031212094.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Should the Indian triumph there as well, he would be the sport’s youngest ever world champion.</p>\n<p>Gukesh’s title came after 14 gruelling rounds of chess over 18 days between eight top contenders in the open category, which included two other Indians, R. Praggnanandhaa and Vidit Gujrathi, making this the best Candidates tournament from an Indian perspective.</p>\n<p>“It was unbelievable—what he did and how he did it. I don’t think anyone thought (he would win), especially since Gukesh is the youngest and the others have so much experience… But it was consistency. He was never worse off in any of the games. He was the best player in Toronto,” says Woman Grandmaster (WGM) and commentator Tania Sachdev.</p>\n<p>“I thought that throughout the tournament he looked comfortable,” says grandmaster Dibyendu Barua, who runs the Dhanuka Dhunseri Dibyendu Barua Chess Academy in Kolkata. “He lost one game, which was an upset because he was not in a losing position. He made a mistake and he came back, which is fantastic and shows his temperament. For me, he was always the favourite among the Indians.”</p>\n<p>The tournament result was poised on a razor’s edge going into the last round on Sunday with four players shooting for the top spot. Gukesh, ranked 16th in the world, needed to not lose to world Mo. 3 Hikaru Nakamura, which he did. But the Indian was distracted by another match, which was to impact his fate.</p>\n<p>World No. 2 Fabiano Caruana and No. 7 Ian Nepomniachtchi needed wins, as the winner would take on Gukesh in a tie-breaker on Monday. But they drew, leaving Gukesh alone at the top on the table.</p>\n<p>The whole situation left Gukesh so frazzled that he went back to his hotel with coach and second, Polish grandmaster Grzegorz Gajewski, while the other match was still on. “Those 15 minutes were probably the most stressful of the entire tournament,” Gukesh told reporters, laughing.</p>\n<p>He tried to follow the Caruana-Nepomniachtchi game on commentary but could not. He then went for a walk with Gajewski, before his father Rajnikanth, a doctor, came running over to them to announce that it was over. “The walk was (emotionally) the turning point,” Gukesh said later.</p>\n<p>“In this tournament, what set him apart was his nerves. He had so much composure, maturity in his play, in practical decisions,” says Sachdev over a call. “The way he handled everything around—the fans, the tension… he was an ice man in that tournament. He feared no one. He was so cool headed when everything around him was burning.”</p>\n<p>“Finally, there is one player from India who could be compared to our own Anand,” says Arvind Aaron, who runs the Aaron Chess Academy in Chennai, over email. “Winning the Candidates with 9/14 is a tall score. Experts did not give any title chances to any of the three Indians at Toronto. This stellar show reconfirms that his (Gukesh’s) 2022 Chennai Olympiad performance was no fluke and that he is progressing to the next level.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/chess-candidates-tournament-gukesh-111713896642654.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Of all the incredible moments that India scripted at the 2022 Thomas Cup, the one that became definitive of the odds-defying, history-making team, was of the players bouncing up and down, arm in arm on the podium. Joyous, victorious.</p>\n<p>Team celebrations can generate that kind of hopped-up energy on the podium that individual triumphs lack. Away from the fiercely individual pursuits on the tour, the Thomas Cup had given the players a cocoon of camaraderie—of common goals and collective ambition. India’s badminton stars had channelled it perfectly to clinch the Cup, known as the men’s world championship, for the first time.</p>\n<p>On 27 April, when India begin their title defence in Chengdu, China, they will be hoping to recreate that team magic yet again. The team WhatsApp group, which was formed ahead of the last edition of Thomas Cup, is full of chatter again. Meetings and team dinners are being scheduled.</p>\n<p>“During the Thomas Cup, we also want to go out there and have fun, enjoy the whole process of being with the team,” says H.S. Prannoy, who is India’s No. 1 singles player going into this Thomas Cup. It was seniors Prannoy and Kidambi Srikanth who had stressed upon, and helped create, a thriving team atmosphere at the last edition.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, we don’t have anything like a team camp. We don’t have that culture like some at places like Indonesia or China. Here the players have to take initiative and make sure that we at least spend little bit of time together before we go for these tournaments,” says Prannoy.</p>\n<p>“When it comes to a normal tour event, you have your dinner, you go back to the room, you are all by yourself and sleep according to your match schedule. But in a team event, you have to spend that extra hour or so with your teammates, be it having dinner with them or doing some team activity. I am really excited about it.”</p>\n<p>The Indian players will have to believe in the collective now more than ever. They were merely the dark horses the last time around; they now go in as the defending champions.</p>\n<p>The core of the team remains the same: Prannoy, Lakshya Sen and Srikanth are the leading singles players, while Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty will be the No. 1 doubles team. In Priyanshu Rajawat and Kiran George give them some serious talent in singles reserves. M.R. Arjun and Dhruv Kapila will be the team’s second doubles pair, with Sai Pratheek as the reserve.</p>\n<p>A Thomas Cup tie consists of five matches–three singles and two doubles against ranking counterparts (No. 1 vs No. 1 and so on) of the rival team. “I think winning the Thomas Cup was one of the biggest achievements in Indian badminton,” says Sen. “As a kid I used to watch China or Indonesia lift the trophy. When I played my first Thomas Cup (2018) against China, just to see their men’s singles line-up was a bit shocking to me—there was Chen Long (reigning world champion), Shi Yuqi (All England champion at the time) and the third singles was Lin Dan(five-time world champion, two-time Olympic champion). At that time, I hardly ever imagined that we can have such a strong team and win the event.”</p>\n<p>India had never won a medal at the event before 2022, didn’t have the serial winners that China possessed in their golden age, but there was enough talent—and belief in each other—to pull off the heist.</p>\n<p>India defeated Malaysia in the quarterfinal and got the better of a star-studded Denmark (including World No. 1 Viktor Axelsen) in the semi-final. In the final, they clinched the tie against 14-time champions Indonesia in the first three rubbers. Sen set the tone with a battling three-game win over Anthony Sinisuka Ginting. Satwik-Chirag saved four match points to defeat Mohammad Ahsan and Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo 18-21 23-21 21-19, before Srikanth wrapped up the tie by beating Asian Games gold medallist Jonatan Christie in straight games.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/badminton-thomas-cup-2024-prannoy-satwik-chirag-111713895709335.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>France, for most of the world, is Paris—arguably global pop culture’s most romantic city—and Paris is France. But for the French people, perhaps, present-day Paris is the least French thing about their country. The next thing that the world loves about France is the country’s wine regions. So much so that entire vacations are spent visiting wineries in Bordeaux and Champagne.</p>\n<p>Yet, France is a lot more than Paris’ museums, churches, overpriced cafés along the Seine, Eiffel Tower, the world’s most visited monument, or the bubbles and wine tastings in chateaus of Champagne, Bordeaux and Medoc, which are usually bustling with bus-loads of wine enthusiasts and those ticking off an “authentic French experience”.</p>\n<p>Paris, a truly global city akin to New York, Berlin, Amsterdam and London, is home to the country’s richest and most successful football club, the Qatari-owned Paris Saint Germain (PSG), which also draws the maximum rebuke from most people outside of the city. And what irks Parisians the most, apart from the high rent and cost of living, is the fact that the city is always teeming with tourists no matter the time of the year; a good number of French people who move to Paris for either work or study, escape it as soon and as often as they can. This summer Paris is going to be busier than ever as it hosts the Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p>\n<p>It would be stupid to ignore local wisdom, which always beats Google and influencers’ video itineraries based on “extensive research” of 72 hours in a city, the bulk of which is probably spent in shooting content instead of feeling the pulse and pace of a place. So, I listened to my friends and took a train south to Marseille on France’s Mediterranean coast. The railway station, Gare de Marseille Saint-Charles, is one of the best places to see the city as well as to enjoy a sunset. That’s a good reason to get yourself a drink and snack as soon as you get off the train and witness the golden hour magic as the Mediterranean skies usually put on a stunning show. The only spot that has better views of entire Marseille is the city’s most visited church, Notre Dame de la Garde, up on a hillock, which is also the highest point in the city.</p>\n<p>Marseille, France’s oldest city, is a mix of the old and new and you can sense how different it is from Paris the minute you stroll through it. Unlike the wet, cold and congested Paris, Marseille greets you with good weather, moderate temperatures for most of the year and the city is not as busy either. You won’t hear as much English as you would in Paris. While all of France loves its wine and beer, the go-to drink in Marseille is pastis, a herbal alcoholic drink made from anise, fennel seeds and liquorice, drunk with water over ice. This drink, 40-45% ABV, is soothing on a warm day.</p>\n<p>You are much closer to nature in Marseille. Cassis offers some great hikes and stunning views of the sea and water from a height, and there is the lovely Calanques National Park where you can hike, spend time on the beaches and swim in the brilliant turquoise waters. You could have a relaxed day on a boat while you make your way to Calanques from Marseille. If pressed for time, you could drive through all this in a day and still be back in the city by dinner time, but you won’t be able to get down to most of the beaches or enjoy yourself in the waters.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/travel-marseille-explore-southern-france-111713506687171.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>For most working professionals today, the line between work and personal life in a hyper-connected world is blurred. We are constantly checking our smartphones, no matter the place or time and the fear of missing out keeps us tethered. Even on vacations, we tend to continuously check our work emails and group chats. The option of missing a meeting is now a thing of the past, with Microsoft Teams and Zoom calls keeping us often busy.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/millennial-bosses-leadership-workplace-culture-management-style-productivity-111712473554499.html\">Also read: Are millennial bosses really cool?</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Taking a vacation, or small breaks, allows one to completely disconnect from work. But how many of us truly stay away from replying to emails or looking at office Slack channels during a break? Is it even possible to take a vacation from work in an era where the popular belief is to stay connected 24x7? It is. Here’s how you can disconnect from work during a holiday to return refreshed and more connected to your work.</p>\n<p><strong>Blueprint for a reset</strong><br/>Just as it is at work, even for a vacation planning is key. Decide what you want to see, do and experience. If it is history that interests you, you may want to look up historical sites, if it is food, then check out the local hotspots for delicacies, and if it is adventure, then find out which activities you can indulge in. </p>\n<p>Investing time in planning allows your mind to explore new avenues, build anticipation and keep you focused on your vacation goals. In other words, during a break, one should embrace active relaxation—be it through lounging by the pool all day/ reading, or hiking, walking or simply spending quality time with loved ones. Basically, any activity that actively takes your mind off work. Plus, immersing yourself in new experiences will keep you away from checking your phone constantly and allow you to unwind.</p>\n<p><strong>Say it out aloud </strong><br/>Open communication about taking time off is as important as communication about other work matters. Inform your colleagues/peers about your vacation dates clearly and emphasize that you will only be available for an urgent emergency. Set an “out-of-office” email response and resist the urge to check or reply to messages. </p>\n<p>Often, those who are in a key leadership position may feel that the world will fall apart if they don’t check their emails for an hour—a thought process that may prevent you from going in for a full-fledged digital detox. In such a case, consider limiting your screen time. Designate specific times during the day to check for important messages that need to be addressed, but avoid getting sucked into the vortex of emails and work chats.</p>\n<p>Remember, a vacation is meant for you to recharge, not for you to be on-call all the time. That can wait till you are back in the office.</p>\n<p><strong>Set an example</strong><br/>As leaders, it’s essential to set the right example and encourage a healthy approach to vacation time. One aspect of effective digital leadership is empowering your team to handle responsibilities in your absence. This involves clear delegation, providing them with the necessary tools and resources, and fostering a culture of trust and accountability. By doing so, you not only ensure that work continues smoothly but also demonstrate your confidence in their capabilities. When you as a leader trust your teams to manage in your absence, it sets a positive example for the entire organization. </p>\n<p><strong>Technology to the rescue </strong><br/>Use the thing that keeps you hyper-connected to disconnect as well. In fact, embracing technology can enhance the vacation experience without compromising on rest and recovery. Utilising communication tools for urgent matters, setting up automated responses, and scheduling tasks in advance can help minimise disruptions during your time off. Tools like project management platforms and shared calendars can ensure everyone is informed and projects stay on track.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, practising digital leadership means finding the balance between staying connected when needed and allowing yourself and your team the space to recharge and disconnect during vacations. It’s about leveraging technology to facilitate productivity and well-being, rather than letting it become a barrier to enjoying time away from work.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/disconnect-during-vacation-reconnect-digital-leadership-active-relaxation-111713722537235.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Here’s what Matt said about working on<strong> </strong>this piece: “I’ve been thinking about and trying to write about, in poetry and prose, this experience for over 20 years now.

It was not that at all, even if that was what I expected when I was first buzzed into New Hampshire State Prison for Men to teach a class in literature and creative writing. No, the smell was clean. Too clean. Even beyond the antiseptic clean of a hospital. This was a scrubbed-too-hard-with-rendered-animal-fat-soap clean. This was a rub-the-skin-raw kind of clean. As I walked into the prison, it was everywhere. It was the kind of clean that made you feel filthy, like you could never be clean enough, scrub hard enough to be right. You could see it on the men too — their skin was dry and tough-looking, ruddy from scrubbing with the fierce, heavy waters that came out of the old pipes in this place. The correctional officers carried it on them too, but it was mixed with whatever they brought with them from the outside: a wife’s perfume, cigarette smoke or the meat sweat of some steak and cheese sub they’d eaten at a pizza place right before their shift.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/star-student-also-committed-murder-reconcile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He shouted and banged his fist against a wall inside Toronto’s Hospital for Sick Children, demanding to know why his son had died.<br/>The boy, Kevin Pacsai, had been born just 25 days earlier with a head of dark hair like his 21-year-old father. His mother, Laurie Pacsai, also 21, thought her son was perfect. But Kevin’s heart had started to fail in his second week of life, and he had barely survived an episode of shock. His heart was structurally normal, but its conduction system seemed to be misfiring. Earlier that day, March 11, 1981, he had been transferred to the world-renowned hospital, known as SickKids.<br/>Youngsters came from all over the globe to the imposing brick building, where doctors had invented techniques that revolutionized pediatric heart surgery. Cardiologists were venerated; they seemed to work miracles to prolong the lives of children born with faulty hearts. The previous spring, the hospital had unveiled a splashy renovation of its cardiac unit, which now stretched over wards 4A and 4B.<br/>But since the summer, deaths on the cardiac unit had soared — 625 percent higher during the nine-month period between July 1980 and March 1981 than in the periods before and after, according to a later government analysis. Most of the deaths had happened overnight, when one of the eight nursing teams, headed by Phyllis Trayner, was on duty. By the fall of 1980, the five nurses had earned a nickname: “the jinx team.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/our-latest-mysterious-true-crime-story\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Beyond the boulder, a dead spruce has been partially uprooted. Its bare branches look brittle against the other, still upright, lushly-needled trees.</p>\n    <p>From the photo, it’s impossible to tell whether the boulder is drying now or about to be drenched again, or how long that spruce has been upended. Nor is it possible to say how many times I, who took the picture, have been wrong about where a story ends or where it even starts.</p>\n    <p>Take, for instance, the sailing trip that took me to that beach in the summer of 2023. Did the trip begin a decade ago when a friend and I considered the sheen of boulders in moonlight and how we mark the milestones in our lives?</p>\n    <p>Or did it begin, more concretely, when we boarded the boat in a small Maine coast cove? The sky was blue that day, the winds were good; we hoisted sail, and I, sitting up at the bow of the boat, decided that the beginning of this voyage would be a good time to make one private gesture of an ending. In my pocket was a Zip-lock bag with a few teaspoons of my husband’s ashes. We both loved the Maine coast. What better place to discretely drop a handful overboard, to mark, not a milestone, but the subsiding at last of a two-year grief and the turn to possibilities ahead.</p>\n    <p>The bow rose and dropped; the swells rocked us side to side. The tide and wind, our captain said, made the sea “confused.” Kneeling, I hung onto the stanchion with one hand, and kept the other in my pocket, ready, while I waited for a moment that said <i>now</i>.</p>\n    <p>But the finish or start of a story is often frayed and full of holes, and nothing ever opens or closes where or when we think it does. <i>Beginnings are apt to be shadowy,</i> Rachel Carson warns. Endings too. And so the ashes stayed in the baggie and when we went ashore, the dead spruce remained tilted and still, and the boulder I leaned against sat unmoving in bright sunlight. Marking nothing but the force of a long-gone glacier, it cast the darkest shadow on the beach.</p>\n    <p>But out there, on the water, the waves kept overlapping the present and the past, the sky piled up with in-betweens, and the sea, which mutes all questions about stops and starts and anything pretending to be firm, says without saying that the real story of that trip might have begun when I couldn’t mark the other story’s end.<br/>\n__</p>\n    <p><a href=\"http://www.barbarahurd.com\"> Barbara Hurd</a> is the author of </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>The Epilogues,</i>\n    </p>\n    <p><i>Listening to the Savage / River Notes and Half-Heard Melodies, Tidal Rhythms</i>(with photographer Stephen Strom),</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Walking the Wrack Line,</i>\n    </p>\n    <p><i>Entering the Stone</i>,</p>\n    <p><i>Stirring the Mud,</i>and several collaborative chapbooks with artists.

The floor tiles are chipped and sticky and there’s a roach of course, on the wall in the shadows beneath the slowly dripping sink.</p>\n    <p>I am not alone. There’s an older man here, looking at himself in the mirror, liking what he sees, combing his thinning gray hair with a hard black comb. It’s my father. I’m sure of it. I’m sure of it because I know what my father looks like. The big ears, sly grin, sparking blue eyes, loud sports jacket. Dan Wallace. It’s him. Except it can’t be him because he’s dead and has been for over 25 years.</p>\n    <p>I flush the toilet, but he doesn’t take his eyes from the mirror. It’s as if, of the two of us, I’m the one who’s not there.</p>\n    <p>***</p>\n    <p>I’ve never dreamed about my father, until I had this one. I <i>have</i> seen him a few times though, mostly around town, in the years right after he died.</p>\n    <p>Once I saw him driving down the highway in an Electra, the window down, cigarette in one hand and the wheel in the other. Another time he was in a vintage light blue Cadillac. Then I saw him in New York City, from across the street, disappearing around the corner. I was sure it was him. I would have bet on it if it weren’t for the fact that he wasn’t alive.</p>\n    <p>Supposedly. It’s sounds farfetched, but I thought it was possible he may have faked his own death.</p>\n    <p>I wouldn’t have put it past him. He was a businessman who railed against governmental regulations and intrusion. He liked making money and he hated paying taxes and did everything legal and not legal not to. He was being sued for sexual harassment. His only son had quit the business to become a writer. All his kids were asking him for shit and he was tired of it. Faking his death would free him from all of this. He would be dead, but not so dead that he couldn’t enjoy the fruits of his labor and deception. Watching him drive by I could see how happy he was, how free. He had avoided the two things everyone says are unavoidable: death and taxes.</p>\n    <p>Now I’ve found him, but he’s still pretending he doesn’t see me. Like we’re strangers.</p>\n    <p>“What’s your name?” I ask him.</p>\n    <p>He smiles. “My name is Harry,” he says.</p>\n    <p>I almost laugh. “Your name’s not Harry.” He turns and gives me the once over and what he sees does not impress him.</p>\n    <p>“What’s wrong with your pants?” he says.</p>\n    <p>I look and he’s right: the cuffs are too long. They’re dragging the ground.</p>\n    <p>“I’ve lost some weight,” I say.</p>\n    <p>He turns back to the mirror and brushes some light dandruff from his shoulders. It’s his reflection that talks to me now. “You’re about to lose more,” it says.</p>\n    <p>I never saw my father dead. His ashes were buried in a golden box. I cried all day the day of his funeral, even though we had been distant for many years.</p>\n    <p>But I never saw him dead. He was 67, the same age as his own father. I’m 65. It’s ridiculous, of course, all of this. I know he’s dead. I know it. But there are times, even if it’s just for a few seconds, I think he could be alive. I don’t really believe it, though. I also don’t believe he came to me in this dream to tell me that I, too, was going to die. That’s also ridiculous. But for a few seconds every day, maybe even more than a few, I think he did.<br/>\n___</p>\n    <p><a href=\"http://danielwallace.org\"> Daniel Wallace</a> is the author of six novels, including </p>\n    <p><i>Big Fish</i>, one memoir,</p>\n    <p><i>This Isn’t Going to End Well</i>, and, most recently, a collection of flash fiction,</p>\n    <p><i>Beneath the Moon and Long Dead Stars</i>, from Bull City Press.

    "body": "<p>Four decades after dozens of culturally significant objects were stolen from the Santa Ana Pueblo in New Mexico, a team of Tribal investigators has pledged to bring the missing items back home.</p>\n<p>In August 1984, the Santa Ana Pueblo (Tamaya in the Keresan language) was plagued by a 10-month-long string of burglaries. Thieves looted pottery, war shields, clothing, drums, baskets, and rugs from homes in this Native American community situated on the Rio Grande, about 20 miles north of Albuquerque. The Pueblo, generally closed to the public, opens its doors on rare occasions such as feast days, and the first thefts took place shortly after one such event.</p>\n<p>“This is particularly heartbreaking because these people took ceremonial items actively being used,” Shannon O’Loughlin (Choctaw), chief executive of the Association on American Indian Affairs, told<i> Hyperallergic</i>.</p>\n<p>The robberies continued until a sting operation in May 1985. According to court records obtained by the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/native-american-stolen-artifacts-santa-ana-pueblo-75e8271e9bb7b27778f46eb5fbfca5c8\"> Associated Press</a>, the architect of the plot was an Albuquerque-based dealer of Native American artifacts who recruited members of a nearby pueblo to infiltrate the historic village. Although the perpetrators were caught, little effort was made to recover the stolen artifacts by the FBI and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), the agencies that oversaw the case. (A spokesperson for the FBI Albuquerque Division told </p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>that “attempts to recover stolen items have been made.”</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>submitted a FOIA request for additional details.)</p>\n<p>Last fall, however, a team from the Santa Ana Pueblo took it upon themselves to track down the roughly 150 looted objects, working meticulously to return them to their rightful owners, one by one.</p>\n<p>“Memories of the thefts and the loss of cultural heritage items still weighed heavily on the community,” said Monica Murrell, director of the Santa Ana Pueblo’s Historic Preservation Department. The Pueblo tapped William Woody, a former “top cop” at the Bureau of Land Management, to join the search. Woody’s experience with cases involving the Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA) and Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) was key, and “teaming up created a synergy,” Murrell said. “Woody brings a law enforcement angle, we bring technical expertise as preservation specialists.”</p>\n<p>The task force also includes Pueblo members Jarrett Lujan and Thomas Armijo, grandson of the Pueblo’s governor, Myron Armijo, who told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that their family lost a war shield, ceramics, pottery, and jewelry in the burglaries.</p>\n<p>Working with the often scant descriptions in case files obtained from the FBI and BIA, the team began scouring auction catalogues, gallery websites, and museum databases for similar objects. “We were looking for anything that suspiciously appeared on the market in the mid-1980s, items with no former provenance,” Murrell said. Notably, pottery made on the Santa Ana Pueblo was not commonly sold to outsiders, so the few examples that make it into the hands of dealers fetch relatively high prices.</p>\n<p>The team got a big break when they discovered that several of the stolen artifacts were later sold to Larry Frank, a collector and dealer of Native American art. Frank died in 2006, but his son Ross Frank, now a professor in the Department of Ethnic Studies at the University of California, San Diego, agreed to share his father’s ledgers with investigators, yielding invaluable clues to some of the missing objects’ current whereabouts.</p>\n<p>Their first victory was a bowl that, according to Frank’s records, had been sold to a local gallery. It was illustrated in an old catalogue and matched a case file description of a medium-sized bowl with triangle designs. They were able to track the item to the last gallery to sell it, which then contacted the family who purchased it. That family agreed to return it, and this past May, the bowl was returned to the Santa Ana Pueblo.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had great cooperation from some of the galleries on getting items back, when you explain the stories. I’ve been quite impressed,” Woody said.</p>\n<p>Despite some people’s willingness to cooperate, Murrell said that not every source has been as eager to assist in their repatriation efforts.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037100/decades-after-heartbreaking-thefts-santa-ana-pueblo-recovers-stolen-artifacts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "author": "AventurOO Editorial",
    "body": "<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>LONDON — The Wallace Collection is famous for its trove of Rococo art, such as <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/tag/jean-honore-fragonard/\">Fragonard</a>’s pastel depiction of indulgent flirtation “The Swing” (1767–68), in which a woman with a voluminous skirt kicks a pink slipper into the air with coquettish abandon, closely watched by two male suitors. In his solo exhibition, Grayson Perry responds to these holdings, offering a fever-dream take on Fragonard’s painting in a tapestry entitled “Fascist Swing” (2024). Here, pastels give way to psychedelically bright colors, while the woman’s smiling expression is contorted into a mask of horror. The laughing suitors are also absent — Perry’s protagonist is alone in her mental disintegration. The work depicts a delusion of excess and grandeur much like Fragonard’s, but with a much darker, more frightening tone.</p>\n<p>“Fascist Swing” depicts Perry’s alter ego Shirley Smith, dreamed up for this exhibition as a way to explore both the Wallace Collection and his ideas around gender, class, and mental illness. Smith, Perry tells us, is a working-class Londoner whose mental illness pushed her into “delusions of grandeur,” as the exhibition’s title puts it, leading to a prolonged psychotic breakdown in which she came to believe she was a member of the aristocracy and the rightful heir to Hertford House, the home of the Collection. Smith is based in part on real-life so-called outsider artists who suffered from mental health challenges and delusions, such as Aloïse Corbaz (1886–1964) and Madge Gill (1882–61) — some of whose fascinating works are included at the beginning of the exhibition.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Grayson Perry: Delusions of Grandeur</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Visitors unprepared for Perry’s <i>gesamtkunstwerk</i> approach to this exhibition may be puzzled by this opening room, where the boundary between truth and fiction is bafflingly but effectively blurred. Fictionalized “archival” photographs of and letters by Smith sit beside real documentation of Gill’s activities at the Wallace Collection in the 1940s, with false dates attributed to the former but not the latter, for instance. Unusually, the audio guide is key to entering Perry/Smith’s world; tracks are alternately narrated by Perry and Smith, making for an immersive experience — although it is a shame that Smith is given a caricatured Cockney accent, which creates a lazily stereotyped image of working-class identity. </p>\n<p>The exhibition loosely follows Smith’s life, ending in a quasi-recreation of the bedroom in which she spent her final days. There are some beautiful objects in here, including a cabinet decorated with portraits of women from the Wallace Collection. There is also a piece called “Hospital Queen” (2024), a hand-beaded self-portrait Smith supposedly made during a stay in a mental hospital. This perhaps alludes to our somewhat morbid fascination with such objects. But even though Perry has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/apr/13/grayson-perry-donates-sketch-to-help-mental-health-support-group\">struggled with issues around mental health</a>, his treatment feels a bit flippant. </p>\n<p>Similarly, in “A Tree in a Landscape” (2024), Perry creates a family tree using portrait miniatures from the museum’s collection, labeling each one with a different mental health diagnosis. The caption notes, “We all exhibit some traits that could be pathologized.” Do we? Perry’s analysis feels glib; here, as in his treatment of Smith’s psychosis, he fails to engage with the realities of serious mental illness.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Grayson Perry: Delusions of Grandeur</i>\n    </p>\n<p>This is but one instance of a recurring lack of nuance in some of Perry’s engagements with complex issues. It is evident that he thinks deeply — but not always about the right things in the right places. For instance, “Man of Stories” (2024), a central piece in the exhibition, is a truly (and deliberately) hideous beaded sculpture of a bard-like figure, inspired by “the expert storytellers of the Luba people in central Africa,” according to Perry’s caption. It is not explained why Perry was inspired by this particular culture, or whether the Luba people have any connection to objects held in the Wallace Collection. The caption continues: “One of my ongoing concerns is over-intellectualism in Western culture, so I was fascinated by the idea of a travelling bard.” Is the implication that he is ascribing a desirable non-intellectualism to central African culture? This speaks to me, at best, of a failure to allow viewers to engage with the figure at an intellectual level, and at worst, of exoticism.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1027871/insider-artist-grayson-perry-outsider-alter-ego-wallace-collection/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><i>Cavalier Perspective: Last Essays, 1952-1966</i>(2025) by André Breton, translated by Austin Carder (image courtesy City Lights Books)</p>\n<p>What does Surrealism, a major art movement in the 20th century, have to do with surrealism, a term often used to describe so many uncanny facets of life in the 21st? The word “surreal” was first used in 1917 to describe a ballet choreographed by Jean Cocteau and composed by Erik Satie, with Cubist costumes by Pablo Picasso. Today, it has been used to describe the “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/12/alligator-alcatraz-trump-cruelty\">Alligator Alcatraz</a>” immigrant detention center and the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-04/-it-s-surreal-trump-s-freeze-on-climate-money-sows-fear-and-confusion\">Trump administration’s climate policy</a>. Does the world today merely resemble dreamlike visions by Leonora Carrington and Salvador Dalí? Or is the American mind reaching for a deeper affinity?</p>\n<p>To answer this question, we must turn to André Breton, the architect and apostle of Surrealism. At just 28 years old, Breton <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1006369/the-small-magazines-that-birthed-surrealism/\">established</a> the movement in a 1924 manifesto, where he defined it as manifesting one’s subconscious “in the absence of any control exercised by reason.” His attempt to exert dictatorial powers over this movement would be his undoing, after a caustic Second Surrealist Manifesto in 1929 largely alienated him from his peers for suggesting that he could excommunicate them. But Breton continued to think, write, and speak about Surrealism until his death at age 70. </p>\n<p>In <i>Cavalier Perspective: Last Essays 1952–1966</i>, translated by Austin Carter, an elder Breton appears for the first time in English — gentler, wiser, and far more adept at analyzing the ideological underpinnings of a movement that had ballooned into an international sensation. It’s in these late writings that his ideas about the surreal begin to mingle with our own. </p>\n<p><i>Médium: Communication Surréaliste</i>, which Breton contributed to (image courtesy City Lights Books)</p>\n<p>While it’s now understood instinctively as shorthand for unreality, one of the ironies of Surrealism is that it has never neatly circumscribed a particular style or technique, the way Fauvism or Impressionism once did. In a 1952 essay titled “Link,” Breton explains that this was by design; Surrealism was never meant to simply define an aesthetic. “When I began searching as early as 1936 for the emotional catalyst for Surrealism,” he wrote, “I discovered it right away in the anxiety inherent to a time when human brotherhood was collapsing more and more each day.” He was referring to the period between World Wars, when the “rational” forces of industrial capitalism, fractious nationalism, and global imperialism continued unabated, with violence looming on the horizon again.</p>\n<p>Breton had spent World War I in a neurological ward in Nantes, treating soldiers suffering from what we now understand as PTSD. As poet Garrett Caples writes in his excellent introduction to <i>Cavalier Perspective</i>, Breton “saw firsthand the effects of technologically advanced weaponry on the human psyche” and responded with a system of thought that was both mystical in power and revolutionary in scope. By the 1950s, Breton’s vision of a liberatory anti-rationalism had become fully postcolonial. He hailed France’s Algerian War as “an orgy of crime,” championed the work of Martinican writer Aimé Césaire and Haitian poet Clément Magloire Saint-Aude, and <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2022/07/andre-breton-haiti-revolution-communists-surrealism\">helped foment a student revolution in Haiti</a>.</p>\n<p>In <i>Cavalier Perspective</i>, Breton explores this anti-rationalism as inherently accessible and corrosive to systems of logic that demand conformity and deride creativity. His many short essays of the period championed astrology, Medieval alchemy, games of automatic word association, and emotionally expressive art forms dismissed by mainstream Western institutions as “primitive,” from Celtic poetry to African masks. I was particularly struck by “The Language of Stones,” which suggests that certain polished rocks draw sensitive seekers toward them and may even be imprinted with divine messages. Today, the theory reads like a startlingly familiar concoction of new-age natural mysticism poisoned by a terminally online paranoia that “it’s all connected” — Make America Healthy Again, <i>avant la lettre</i>.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038721/andre-breton-cavalier-perspective-surrealism/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>With a collector’s eye with a collagist’s heart, <i> Doors</i> (2022), Swiss-American artist and composer Christian Marclay’s most recent assemblage-style film, splices together clips of doors and the various comings and goings they usher, all plucked from films spanning cinema history. Playing on a continuous loop in the Brooklyn Museum’s fifth-floor Moving Image Gallery, which is appointed with nine backless benches, this 55-minute work shares DNA with the artist’s other film and television montages, including his monumental, 24-hour-long film </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>(2010) and</i>\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/55022/six-things-i-learned-and-one-i-didnt-from-christian-marclays-the-clock/\">The Clock</a>\n    <p>\n      <i>(1995), anchored, respectively, in the evolving technologies of time pieces and communication devices.</i>\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.paulacoopergallery.com/exhibitions/christian-marclay2#tab:slideshow\">Telephones</a>\n    <p>In Marclay’s latest mashup, doorways serve as passageways from one scene to the next: When one shuts, another opens, revealing another character in another room and another era. In one sequence, a lone cowboy struts through a wood-paneled space. He grabs a door handle, and a posse of leather-jacketed men exit into a dim apartment hallway. And so the scenes unfold with an air of a surprise, unknowns lurking and morphing behind every door.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/DIG_E_2025_Christian_Marclay_Doors_07_Paula_Abreu_Pita_PS22-General-Use-JPEG-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Christian Marclay: Doors</i>at the Brooklyn Museum</p>\n    <p>As vexing and disjointed as this premise might sound, the painstaking transitions and match cuts create an internal logic and sense of continuity. Sorrow and searching give way to mischievous escapades, peppered with comedy and crime. Fear simmers. Tension builds. Doors slam and squeak open again, leading into well-to-do homes, modest apartments, workplaces, doctor’s offices, and winding corridors. The result is a labyrinthine, imagined architecture that feels, at turns, like one of M.C. Escher’s <a href=\"https://mcescher.com/gallery/impossible-constructions/\">impossible constructions</a> and the product of the Surrealist parlor game <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/terms/exquisite-corpse\">exquisite corpse</a>, with its neatly matched doorways cobbling together a chimera. Even though the actors, setting, and plot specifics shapeshift every few seconds, as if jumping into a different plane of a multiverse tale, the emotional thrust and action create a propulsive through line that coheres the sea of snippets.</p>\n    <p>In <i>Doors</i>, Marclay makes visible the mindless, forgettable actions of life indoors — turning keys in locks, twisting knobs, entering and exiting spaces — while exploring the ways that doors serve as charged metaphors and well-worn cinematic devices and tropes. This congress of clichés could teeter into tedium. But, with a wink and a nod, the precise editing and absurd juxtapositions between the assembled film excerpts toy with perception, flowing like a dream sequence. Doors double as sites of transformation. Space and time warp. Narratives get remixed and reinvented. Nothing is static, and anything could happen in the next scene. In this art film, as in life, the whole story can change course in an instant.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/DIG_E_2025_Christian_Marclay_Doors_04_Paula_Abreu_Pita_PS22-General-Use-JPEG-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Christian Marclay: Doors</i>at the Brooklyn Museum</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/christian-marclay\">Christian Marclay: Doors</a>\n      <i> continues at the Brooklyn Museum (200 Eastern Parkway, Prospect Heights, Brooklyn) through April 12, 2026.

    "body": "<h2>A new study delves into the development of the ilium, the largest bone in the pelvis, and the genes that underpin its formation</h2>\n<p>Walking upright on two legs is one of the key traits that sets humans apart from other primates.</p>\n<p>Now, scientists are beginning to unravel some of the developmental and genetic mysteries underpinning the shift to bipedalism. In a new study published last week in the journal <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09399-9\"> Nature</a>, researchers describe two evolutionary changes that reshaped the human pelvis and paved the way for our unique walking style.</p>\n<p>For the new study, the team focused on the ilium, the largest bone in the pelvis. Humans have two ilia—one on the right side of the spine, the other on the left—and together they help form the wide, bowl-like shape of the pelvis. (When you put your hand on your hip, you’re feeling your ilium.)</p>\n<p>Researchers collected 128 samples of embryonic tissues to compare ilium development in various species, including humans, mice, lemurs, gibbons, chimpanzees and other primates. They also studied the cells and genes responsible for the development of this bone.</p>\n<p>“What we have tried to do is integrate different approaches to get a complete story about how the pelvis developed over time,” says lead author <a href=\"https://gayani.science/\">Gayani Senevirathne</a>, an evolutionary geneticist at Harvard University, in a <a href=\"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/08/solving-evolutionary-mystery-of-how-humans-came-to-walk-upright/\">statement</a>.</p>\n<p>Their analyses revealed two important differences between humans and other species in the ilium’s development process.</p>\n<p>First, not long after the ilium cartilage begins to form in human embryos, it makes a 90-degree turn, which causes the bones to grow short and wide instead of tall and narrow. This broad, basin-like shape in humans provides anchor points for our gluteal muscles, which are essential for walking on two feet; it also supports our inner organs when we stand upright. Scientists suspect this shift occurred when early humans split from apes on the primate family tree, between five million and eight million years ago.</p>\n<p>The ilium cartilage, in other primates, grows parallel to the spine. But the dramatic turn seen in humans<strong> </strong>makes the ilia grow perpendicular to it—a radical change that was a bit of a surprise to the researchers, as they expected to find a more gradual shift.</p>\n<p>“It’s not a stepwise process,” says co-author <a href=\"https://heb.fas.harvard.edu/people/terence-capellini\">Terence Capellini</a>, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University, to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/27/science/human-evolution-ilium-bipedal.html\"> New York Times</a>’ Carl Zimmer. “It’s actually a complete flip.”</p>\n<p>Second, the bone cells that eventually replace the ilium cartilage form later in humans than they do in other primates—and they form about 16 weeks after much of the rest of the human skeleton. This process, called delayed ossification, allows the human pelvis to hold its shape as it grows. Scientists suspect this shift occurred before roughly 1.6 million years ago, when humans began to develop larger brains, reports <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/science/two-evolutionary-changes-underpinning-human-bipedalism-are-discovered-2025-08-27/\">Reuters</a>’ Will Dunham.</p>\n<p>This evolutionary change was critical not only for bipedalism, but also for giving birth safely to offspring with hefty heads. “This way, the pelvis could grow in size and maintain a shape important for walking—but also it retained the shape of a birth canal that eventually would be used to allow the passage of a big-brained baby,” Capellini tells Reuters.</p>\n<p>Scientists also pinpointed more than 300 genes that help explain these developmental variations of the human ilium. Of those, three specific genes appear to play the biggest roles: <i>SOX9</i>, <i>PTH1R</i> and <i>RUNX2</i>. Their findings are further supported by the fact that mutations to these genes can cause skeletal problems with the pelvis and disorders that affect walking.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/scientists-discover-key-evolutionary-changes-to-the-pelvis-that-helped-humans-walk-upright-180987273/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Veni Jain, 30, had an idea she believed in. Before she could act on it, however, she got married and moved to Kolkata from Delhi, where she knew no one except her husband and his family. She signed up for a Youth Ficci Ladies Organisation (Y-Flo) meeting in 2022. Two years and several Y-Flo meetings later, she has a thriving social life and is about to launch a business curating gourmet cheese and grazing boards for parties and dinners.</p>\n<p>On International Women’s Day last month, Neha Sharma, 41, attended her first-ever women’s support-cum-networking group event at Lead Like Her Club, a group exclusively for women in leadership roles in human resources. Gurugram-based Sharma, head of human resources for market operations at Airtel, found the gathering useful as she met many like-minded people at a similar stage in their careers. “Everyone wanted to come together as a community to figure out ways in which we can give back to working women,” says Sharma.</p>\n<p>Jain and Sharma are among a growing number of women who are turning to women-only groups because regular networking groups don’t do enough for them. “Women frequently encounter the double bind dilemma, where they are expected to be assertive but not aggressive, nurturing but not weak. Gender pay gaps and lack of representation in leadership roles further exacerbate these challenges, making it crucial for women to have spaces where they can discuss and address these issues,” says Aparna Acharekar, 46, co-founder of women’s networking platform Coto. Coto started in October 2022 and has 400,000 members and 7,000 communities, or groups based on various interests. Community heads decide how often they meet.“Further, responsibilities like childcare and household management disproportionately fall on women, creating a constant tension between work and home.”</p>\n<p>All business owners need like-minded people to consult, create, caution and celebrate, says Elisha Saigal, 40, the Mumbai-based founder and CEO of El Sol Strategic Consultants, who has been part of multiple women’s networking groups, including Ladies Who Lead, for five years. “Your teams share your vision, wins and annual goals, but you need a closed circle to course correct, reflect and motivate,” she says. “We brainstorm, co-create, party, unlearn and learn from each other. We share similar business hiccups and help each other navigate them.”</p>\n<p>Women-only support groups foster empathy through shared experiences, says Radhika Yuvraj Iyengar, 47, India country director for Women In Tech Global, an organisation championing diversity in STEM. The group has 528 members in India and 10,000 globally. The India arm started six years ago, and its members meet once a week. A global meet-up is held once in two months; they use both virtual and in-person meetings. “The struggles faced by Indian working women are widely acknowledged, yet not universally comprehended. Issues such as achieving work-life balance, managing work and family obligations, addressing health and wellness concerns, navigating adversity including toxic work environments, all while striving to maintain dignity and break barriers, remain complex and often misunderstood. By participating in women-centric groups, individuals can freely express themselves, find common ground, and grow together,” explains Hyderabad-based Iyengar.</p>\n<p>Such groups are also a good way to build a community of friends for oneself in a new city. They also helped working women navigate the challenges of the pandemic, bringing them closer. “Surviving and thriving in 2020 wouldn’t have been possible without this support,” says Saigal.</p>\n<p>Workspaces and culture remain largely patriarchal, which is why women often turn to groups that understand their unique circumstances and challenges as well as get advice. “Studies have shown that women are interrupted more frequently, receive less credit for their ideas, and are underrepresented in decision-making positions. They face microaggressions and gender biases that hinder their professional growth and networking opportunities,” says Acharekar, who is based in Mumbai.</p>\n<p>One word that consistently comes up among founders and members of women-only networking groups is “community”—for both work and fun. Garima Dhamija, 50, and five others co-founded Lead Like Her in Gurugram in 2022 with the aim of creating and giving back to the community of working women. It now has 50 members and they meet fortnightly. The group is restricted to the National Capital Region (NCR).</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/women-groups-networking-work-office-111714324086252.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Unlike other two-year-olds, Timtim loves broccoli and peas. He starts the day with two boiled eggs, each stuffed with a broccoli floret. His dinner includes a portion of boiled peas. “If my baby doesn’t see the greens, he won’t eat,” laughs Delhi-based software engineer Saurabh Khurana.</p>\n<p>When Khurana, 35, adopted Timtim, a Retriever, from an animal shelter in 2022, he was clear that he wanted to feed him nutrient-rich, freshly cooked food. So, he would wake up at 5am and, with the help of his wife, prepare Timtim’s food—a combination of chicken, rice and vegetables. But combined with office workload, it was an exhausting drill.</p>\n<p>Early last year, Khurana started to look for brands that serve healthy pet food with “human-grade” ingredients, or made in accordance with regulations for ready-to-eat human food products. Today, Khurana depends on three platforms to deliver food for his dog—sometimes, it is pork and lentils; often, rice, chicken and vegetables, including peas. The food resembles, even almost tastes like, what humans would eat.</p>\n<p>“I have tasted all the food that I have ordered. It’s like what we eat, minus the salt and masala,” says Khurana, who spends ₹15,000 on pet food every month, about 10% more compared to when he used to cook at home for Timtim. The dog seems to have adjusted well to the “outside food”. “Why should he eat stinky, packaged food (referring to kibble), when I can afford to give him food that looks like food and keeps him healthy?” says Khurana.</p>\n<p>As millennials and Gen Zers reimagine the idea of parenthood, they are ready to spend more time and effort to ensure their beloved pets eat nutritious food, even if it means shelling out more money. Several startups and brands are banking on this visceral urge. From gluten-free to vegan and vegetarian diets, the Indian market is slowly and steadily seeing a rise in pet food that’s seemingly less processed and, in some cases, more closely resembling human food.</p>\n<p>According to Statista, the 2024 revenue in the pet food market in India amounts to $640 million (around ₹5,300 crore). It is expected to grow annually by 12.63%, hitting $1.03 billion in the next four years. Globally, the most revenue is generated in the US (over $57 billion in 2023).</p>\n<p>While there’s no official data on the growth of “human-grade” pet food in India, a quick search online and in retail stores for bespoke and “holistic” options is enough to give an idea of how serious people are becoming about the wellness of their pets. “Being a pet parent is different from being a human parent. When you are a pet parent, you know that unless something untoward happens, you will outlive your pet,” says Ishmeet Singh Chandiok, a pet parent and chef who has done stints at Hyatt and JW Mariott. He’s the founder of Harley’s Corner, a ready-to-eat premium dog food brand that claims to use human-grade ingredients and zero preservatives to create meals.</p>\n<p>Among the dishes Harley’s offers are Goulash ( ₹625 for 900g; to give an idea, a 30kg dog needs 360-450g a meal), a low-fat meal that comprises a blend of sorghum millet, pumpkin seeds, brewer’s yeast, sweet potato, chicken, brown rice, cod liver oil, wheat germ oil, vegetables, algae calcium and seaweed powder; and Wooferole ( ₹800 for 900gm), a “full dietary meal” that combines fish, brown rice, quinoa, pumpkin, algae calcium, and vegetables. My dog and I tried the Goulash. It looked and tasted like chicken khichdi, without salt and spices. My dog finished it in seconds.</p>\n<p>“By just changing the food, if I can have my dog live even a year longer, it would be priceless,” says Singh. “This kind of belief is driving the interest in human-grade pet food, besides growing awareness in general around wellness and what you yourself eat and feed your pet.”</p>\n<p>Human-grade pet food, in simple words, means food fit enough for human consumption. “Humans can eat it but it’s not recommended since pet food has added vitamins, minerals and supplements that are more suitable for animals,” says Shivangi Raina, a Bengaluru-based veterinarian.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/pet-food-good-enough-for-humans-to-take-a-bite-of-111714046366689.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The athlete as backwards prophet is the fashion. What would you tell your younger self, we ask? Write a letter to him, please. And so greying, considered heroes give wise advice to the reckless, obsessive, dynamic creatures they once were.</p>\n<p>He, the Olympic champion, isn’t the looking-back kind. But we want to examine the bones of athletic journeys and younger athletes want to peer down the roads he walked. And this is when he’ll say repeatedly that yes, sure, he reached several goals yet he “failed miserably”.</p>\n<p>Failed?</p>\n<p>In “achieving my fullest potential?”</p>\n<p>But wait, what was the problem?</p>\n<p>“My lack of balance.”</p>\n<p>Abhinav Bindra is talking about something beyond just mere winning. About winning well. About courage of a form we don’t always acknowledge. Courage to take days off, to do less, to not be consumed by sport, to not get imprisoned in the unhealthy grip of competition.</p>\n<p>“Why did I have self-doubt?” he says. “Because all my eggs were in one basket. Because my self-worth depended on where my name was in the ranking list. I didn’t have the courage to let go.”</p>\n<p>“My most successful years, in terms of quality, were in the US in 2001 when I was a student-athlete. I had only so many hours to train. I was challenged intellectually, I was challenged outside the field of play. I went on hikes. Even if I didn’t win in Athens (Olympics, 2004), I was at my best then. And it was because of balance. If everything rests on one pillar and there’s an earthquake, everything shakes.”</p>\n<p>Then he became obsessive, his life a narrow pursuit of gold, and ironically it’s what he got. But if he stayed balanced, could he have been even better? A career never answers every question.</p>\n<p>It’s 16 years since Bindra won 10m air rifle gold in Beijing and since it’s Olympic year, he’s a fair subject for another interrogation. After all, he’s not the athlete I knew. He has a taste for occasional Vesper martinis—shaken, of course—but, to put it politely, there’s nothing much else about him which says James Bond. Except the weapon. The last gun he has left from 22 years of shooting is a gold rifle presented to him by Walther, the gun-maker to 007. The other guns have gone, some pellets remain and a few jackets. His athletic skin has been shed. Now he’s someone who used to be talented.</p>\n<p>Singer Jon Bon Jovi recently spoke about buying back his first guitar. Then he played it, for it’s what musicians do. But athletes let go. Exhausted and played out, they don’t look back. They might clutch on to a little memorabilia, as Rahul Dravid has with a few bats and gloves, but as the Indian cricket coach said, they’re “in some boxes that I haven’t opened in years”.</p>\n<p>But didn’t he, batting engineer, ever step back into the nets, just you know to remember the sound and sensation of timing? Like strumming an old guitar?</p>\n<p>“Never hit a ball in the nets after I stopped,” he replied.</p>\n<p>Athletes often stay in sport, in some form, for it’s all they know. Dravid turned mentor. Bindra works with the International Olympic Committee on mental health and in safeguarding athletes from harassment and abuse, sits on the board of Bajaj Auto and has opened 15 hi-tech centres, some used for athletic high performance and others used by patients in hospitals for rehabilitation.</p>\n<p>But dearest to him is his foundation, through which he runs Olympic Values Education Programmes (ask and you’ll get monthly reports and sermons on sport and gender equality), supports athletes and is currently involved in an environmental restoration forest project in Odisha.</p>\n<p>Becoming great demands selfishness, no time for anything or anyone but a dream. But Bindra’s new life has an unselfishness which appeals to the wiser him. Once he told stories of waking at 3 am and practising in his underwear. Now he talks delightedly of meeting a 14-year-old Adivasi swimmer in Odisha, where he has a sports science centre, who “very enthusiastically discussed his VO2 max values with me”.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/opinion/abhinav-bindra-olympic-champion-sports-111714113926916.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Vasudev, as well as the late sculptor S. Nandagopal, have hilarious and moving stories about the founding of Cholamandal Artists’ Village—the home of the Madras Art Movement of the 1960s; stories that are testament to the support they provided one another. In Mumbai, members of the Progressive Artists’ Group (PAG), formed a few decades earlier in 1947, may not have lived in each other’s houses but they had a similar camaraderie and shared sentiments about the direction of art in a newly independent country. In Paris, about a hundred years before PAG, another group of artists banded together, played with light and colour, and brought spontaneity to art by painting outdoors, picking everyday subjects, and infusing art with a sense of movement and brightness.</p>\n    <p>Without this kind of community, artists wouldn’t thrive, and without inspiration from the past, there is little new or original they could create, as our story marking the 150th anniversary of Impressionism shows.

Before that, he had only come across reproductions of paintings by these artists while pursuing a bachelor’s degree in art at the Sir J.J. School of Art in Mumbai. “As arts students in India in the 1970s-80s, we learnt so much from these masters but were unable to view even a single one of these original paintings. We only knew of them through reproductions, or if someone showed 35-mm slides,” says Dodiya, a leading contemporary artist who is currently showing his solo, <i>I Know You. I do. O’ Stranger</i>, at the Galerie Templon, Paris.</p>\n<p>His exhibition coincides with an important milestone in art history—2024 marks 150 years since the first Impressionist exhibition was held in Paris. Dodiya reflects on that moment when he first entered the Musée d’Orsay, which has one of the largest collections of works by Impressionist artists. The ground floor featured a work by Honoré Daumier, who painted life on the street and in the train carriage. “His work was not entirely Impressionist, but was along those lines. On display on the upper floor of the museum was the controversial work <i>Le Dejeuner sur l’herbe (The Luncheon on the Grass)</i> by Edouard Manet,” he recalls. The large oil on canvas, painted between 1862-63, featured a nude female with two fully-dressed men, while on a picnic somewhere in rural France.</p>\n<p>It was not just the large works that impacted Dodiya but also small-scale landscapes by Monet, Camille Pissarro and Alfred Sisley. “I continue to visit the museum during every visit to Paris,” he says. “I take profound delight in the way these artists painted. There is a lifelike quality, and yet the rendering isn’t rooted in realism. Rendering is one thing and transforming is another. In these works, we can see the transformation of life, light and time, which is very critical to Impressionism.”</p>\n<p>What makes Impressionist artists so popular across the world—including in India—150 years after they first exhibited at the studio of photographer Nadar in Paris? To understand this, one has to look at the history of this significant movement, which was rooted in an act of rebellion. In the middle of the 19th century, a jury of artists from the Académie des Beaux-Arts would select artworks and award medals as part of its official exhibition Salon de Paris. In 1874, however, artists such as Monet, Degas and Pissarro decided to organise an exhibition that didn’t subscribe to the style of academic realism—rooted in Biblical and mythological themes—preferred by the Salon. So, 30 artists, who collectively called themselves the Société Anonyme des Artistes Peintres, Sculpteurs et Graveurs, came together in this landmark show, which heralded the birth of Impressionism as a movement.</p>\n<p>Also read: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/how-to-lounge/art-culture/retrospective-at-dag-saluting-the-indomitable-spirit-of-gogi-saroj-pal-111713968923067.html\">Saluting the indomitable spirit of Gogi Saroj Pal</a>\n\t                                    </p>\n<p>\n\t                                        \n\t                                    \t“The independent artists, despite their diverse approaches to painting, appeared to contemporaries as a group.

    "body": "<p>An understanding of entrepreneurs overcoming the odds in gaining access to capital is part of Hardika Shah’s inheritance. As a child growing up in 1980s Mumbai, the CEO and founder of non-banking financial company (NBFC) Kinara Capital, witnessed her mother running a provision store on the ground floor of a building where her parents had an apartment. In pre-liberalisation India, customers were often short of cash at the end of the month, which meant her mother would extend them credit while herself being perpetually short of cash to expand. “Every one (of her customers) was operating salary cheque-to-salary cheque, so she always had this working capital gap,” recalls Shah. But every few weeks, “this random guy would come with a paper bag with cash. There was this unofficial credit community. That was how you got working capital through the Gujarati community.”</p>\n<p>It is perhaps not a coincidence that Shah would eventually start Kinara Capital in 2011, focusing on unsecured lending to small business owners similarly starved of working capital, after a successful stint in consulting. In 1988, Shah had moved to the US for undergraduate studies and then joined Accenture, where she worked for two decades. Shah’s frenetic travel schedule meant that over a decade had passed before she returned to India in 2003. When she visited India that year to set up an office for a client, Microsoft, in Hyderabad, she realised that she had missed witnessing the liberalisation of India’s economy by then finance minister Manmohan Singh and his successors. Shah felt like Rip van Winkle. “You end up in a time warp,” says Shah, 53. But as so often in India, she also noticed the growing disparities between “entitled engineers” and the rest: “You realise so many are left behind.”</p>\n<p>Moved by the experience of watching India’s rapid growth phase unfold but also conscious that this wasn’t benefiting everyone—she was particularly concerned about the unequal lack of access to credit—Shah returned home to the Bay Area. The following year, she started mentoring social entrepreneurs studying at Santa Clara University and at Stanford University, both in California. In 2007, she began an executive MBA while still working for Accenture, shuttling between classes at New York’s Columbia University and the University of California Haas business school campus in Berkeley.</p>\n<p>Shah had juggled academics and work before in Mumbai, receiving internships as a market researcher and later as a font designer while still in high school, earnings she put away towards the exorbitant costs of higher education in the US. After she finished school in Mumbai, in an India before large student loans, Shah received an early lesson in being unable to raise credit. Her parents sold their apartment in Mumbai so that she could study computer science and liberal arts at Knox College in Illinois, US. While she was in college, the rupee was substantially devalued in 1989 and her parents said they would be unable to continue to fund her education. Shah received permission to work off campus and spent weekends working as a receptionist in a nursing home and got jobs during summer holidays as well.</p>\n<p>Completing her MBA in 2009, Shah took a couple of months off and again visited India. In Mumbai and Chennai, she met anyone who would give her the time to talk about finance directed at MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises). She found credit in India to be characterised by a strange dichotomy. Banks loaned money to those with land or other collateral while others relied on relationships or chit funds to raise cash. “I looked at it and thought, ‘Most of our nation doesn’t have land, capital or property.’ I saw this missing middle beyond micro finance.” On her return to the US, she raised $180,000 in seed capital primarily from her classmates in the MBA programme and Accenture colleagues, and Kinara Capital was born.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/hardika-shah-kinara-capital-profile-nbfc-micro-lending-india-111714108834045.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The Surrealists understood that so much depends on context: What is ordinary lining a glove, for instance, becomes <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/works/80997\">grotesque in a teacup</a>. Angolan artist Sandra Poulson — who studied fashion in Lisbon and London, and lives between the latter, Angola’s capital, Luanda, and Amsterdam — operates under a similar ethos of off-kilter recontextualization. In her first museum exhibition, at MoMA PS1, she presents wooden assemblages embedded in or punctured by the floating signifiers connected with Angola after its Civil War (1975–2002), which began immediately after the nation gained independence from Portugal. A bed frame lurches drunkenly toward the viewer; a mirror sits sullenly in the corner, a headboard bolts upright like a soldier. Across these mostly household objects, Poulson emphasizes that history is something that haunts you as you sleep, as you dress, as you look at yourself in the mirror. </p>\n<p>Several complex circuits converge in Poulson’s work: the global trade routes that brought this specific wood into the artist’s path; symbols connected to important events in Angolan history as they intersect with world events; and, finally, Poulson’s own stylistic iconography. The material itself is freighted: Vintage Dutch objects made from wood that might be sourced from Angola sit along chipboard furniture made in China in an American style. It is the physical manifestation of a global trade network made local, the items carrying evidence of their circulation — peeling inventory stickers or faded stamps — and their use, such as the ring imprint of a cup.</p>\n<p>Poulson’s method, then, is not so much about lodging one signifier (logos, presidents’ silhouettes, and symbols of local organizations) into another (wood) so much as colliding them together. Her interventions certainly draw attention to the unseen forces that have shaped these objects — the symbol for the European Union, a dominant trade partner, appears multiple times. But by setting them in wood, rather than more ephemeral media such as digital imagery or even apparel, she draws attention to their significance and heft: These symbols and what they represent do not simply layer over your skin; they puncture the way you live.</p>\n<p>Some of the furniture-as-artworks on view, such as the found mirror “Untitled (Mirror)” or the wooden speaker “Leitura dos Acordos de Alvor, January 1975” (Reading of the Alvor Accords), which plays aloud the Angolan independence agreement, feel both underdone and too on-the-nose. While I liked that the former made a trick mirror of the exhibition space, intensifying its surreality by reflecting and recombining the other absurdist objects on its surface in jarring and unexpected ways, positioning a found object in the corner as the sole intervention felt a bit cheap compared to other works, and fell proportionately flat to me. Meanwhile, the latter emits audio so softly that I think even Portuguese speakers would miss its significance; even when noticed, the work’s intended effect of drawing attention to the way history permeates lived experience is already achieved more compellingly by other pieces in the show.</p>\n<p>plywood, and steel</p>\n<p>The more successful<strong> </strong>objects on view are simultaneously unfinished and highly finished, heightening their absurdity. In “Cabinda Dreams” (all works 2024), a bedframe with the EU logo punched into the cheap wooden headboard has been sawed at a clean diagonal on one end so that it angles haphazardly, as though pleading for help or reaching to grab you. Other objects short-circuited my sense of material logic: The wooden headboard of “Candidato a Presidente da República de Angola” (Candidate for President of the Republic of Angola) sits upright on a sheet of rusted steel, uncannily unsupported. I couldn’t determine either the quality or weight of the wood. Elsewhere — particularly in “Confessionário” (Confessional) — there are apertures where there shouldn’t be, glass where you wouldn’t expect it. And walk around to the back of “Igreja Universal do Reino de Deus” (Universal Church of the Kingdom of God) and you’ll see that it’s been blown out, the cheap corkboard drawers sagging from the lack of support, speaking to the disasters that hide beneath the veneer of stability. Meanwhile, “Propaganda Flush” declares and then immediately curtails its function: The toilet is suspended in the air, torn from the sewage pipes that make it what it is. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035186/sandra-poulson-haunted-house/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>LONDON — There is something both frightening and fascinating about a sculpture that could kill you. Hamad Butt’s <i>Familiars</i> (1992) is a series of three sculptures that, if broken, could toxify the air and cause significant harm. “Familiars 3: Cradle” resembles a huge Newton’s cradle, common as a desk toy, wherein a ball is dropped against a stationary line of similar balls, causing the one at the other end to swing away before it falls back to repeat the process. In this case, however, the spheres are made of vacuum-sealed glass containing greenish-yellow chlorine gas — playing with this toy would spell disaster. </p>\n    <p>This series exemplifies Butt’s career-long exploration of risk and contagion. Made at the height of the AIDS epidemic, and shortly after the artist’s own diagnosis, which would lead to his premature death two years later, <i>Familiars</i> throws oblique light on the threat of disease and the complex, often contradictory emotions thrown up by the risk of contagion. Another piece in the series, “Familiars 1: Substance Sublimation Unit,” consists of a ladder whose rungs are glass tubes containing a heating element and iodine crystals. The heaters periodically turn on and off, sublimating the iodine into an eerie purple gas, again both fear-inducing and alluring.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/07/qFTKw-1200x1865.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1865&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/07/fP2PO-1200x2086.jpeg?resize=1200%2C2086&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>These are confident, conceptually complex, and allusive works, coolly holding their own in the large space of the opening gallery. Their minimalist and scientific aesthetic also offers an intriguing foil to some of the artist’s earlier paintings and drawings, displayed upstairs. A wall text notes that Butt saw his sculptures and paintings as closely connected, particularly in terms of color, but while his sculptures are more formal, his works on paper and canvas are significantly more figurative. “No Title: Figures with Muzzles” (c. 1984) shows nude men being chased into a body of water by dogs in barbed-wire muzzles. The scene, apparently lit by a bare lightbulb, feels both bleak and emotional, perhaps drawing from Butt’s experience of being a queer Pakistani in Britain in the 1980s.</p>\n    <p>Symbols of fear and contagion emerge repeatedly throughout Butt’s oeuvre. One series of drawings from 1990 features illustrations of triffids, the menacing plants from John Wyndham’s 1951 sci-fi novel <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-day-of-the-triffids-john-wyndham/17204649?ean=9780593450086&amp;next=t&amp;affiliate=539\"> The Day of the Triffids</a>. Butt draws a parallel between these monstrous plants and HIV’s indifference to human life, which he saw as an unstoppable force intent on fulfilling its destiny.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/07/N9m33-1200x1133.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1133&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>These drawings are directly connected to the installation “Transmissions” (1990), which consists of nine glass books engraved with a triffid and illuminated by ultraviolet light, which can cause damage to human eyes. Visitors are encouraged to put on protective glasses to view the installation, which draws attention to the scapegoating of sexual and racial minorities during the AIDs crisis and beyond. Here, as elsewhere, Butt’s work cleverly and powerfully plays with our sense of fear, examining its source, whether instinctual or instilled in us by political, religious, or media manipulation. In his hands, contagion becomes both poetic device and devastating lived reality — and we are invited to share the complicated emotions it evokes.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/07/uopDJ-1200x917.jpeg?resize=1200%2C917&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/07/5XmdF-1200x799.jpeg?resize=1200%2C799&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.whitechapelgallery.org/exhibitions/hamad-butt-apprehensions/\">Hamad Butt: Apprehensions</a> <i>continues at Whitechapel Gallery (77-82 Whitechapel High Street, London, England) through September 7.

    "body": "<p>Portraiture has always been a slightly misleading art form. A good portrait gives the viewer the sense that they can peer into the essence of the sitter. It’s a glimpse, a passing moment in a person’s life. But to know someone more fully, we have to see them in their totality, from birth to death, through all the major seasons of their life and in relationship with their most important people.</p>\n<p>I first came across the expansive portraiture of artist John Clang in 2010 when <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/john-clang-being-together\">he began the  Being Together series</a>, which depicts diasporic families photographed together via Skype. A Singaporean artist living far from family after moving to New York, Clang stages the photos so that one half of the family is projected onto the wall, as if in the physical presence of the other half.</p>\n<p>For those of us living in diaspora with loved ones in other countries, togetherness also means being together across time. Some live in an ostensible future and others in an ostensible past, both close together and distant. As Clang wrote in a piece for <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/john-clang-being-together\"> LensCulture</a>, diasporic families can be “made whole again through the use of a third space, a site that is able to reassemble them together within the photographic space that we call a family portrait.”</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://johnclang.com/reading-by-an-artist\"> Reading by an Artist</a>, an ongoing performance series that began in 2023, Clang pulls from a decade-long study of </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.feng-shui-institute.org/Chinese_Astrology/ZWDS-astrology.html\">(紫微斗数)</a>\n    </p>\n<p><i>,</i>sometimes called purple star astrology in English. It’s a philosophical and astrological system dating back to Tang dynasty China and originally designed to make sense of royals’ destiny through a chart structure of 12 palaces. These palaces are laid out as a square border comprising smaller individual squares that represent elements like the self, finances, siblings, and travel.</p>\n<p><i>Reading by an Artist</i> was staged this year at the National Gallery Singapore, the Sharjah Biennial, and most recently, the <i> Summer Reads</i> group show at New York’s Galerie Lelong, where I visited him for a reading earlier this month. Although he occasionally conducts readings by request through his </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://johnclang.com/\">website</a>, his series is experienced through scheduled performances, including one in the upcoming</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.e-flux.com/announcements/6783961/ghost-2568-wish-we-were-here\">in Bangkok, Thailand, starting October 15.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>In popular apps like CHANI and Co–Star, users plug in their birth date and location and receive a natal chart that references one’s Sun, Moon, and Rising sign, along with other details. These charts come from <a href=\"https://time.com/5315377/are-zodiac-signs-real-astrology-history/\">Western astrology</a>, whose roots can be traced back to the Babylonian system, and every day, users can get a glimpse of what astrological forces may be shaping their lives.</p>\n<p>It’s a similar process for ziwei doushu: Clang requested basic details around my birth date in advance of our session so he could develop a chart. Getting a reading done by the artist transformed the experience, as he mediated the process through conversation. When I sat down with him at Galerie Lelong, he had a paper notebook and a tablet propped up on a stand. He pulled up my chart with a printout and on the screen in front of me, a series of squares with each palace laid out. The tablet app he used allowed him to move forward and backward by decades in my life, capturing different versions of me through time and space.</p>\n<p>Clang then homed in on a few squares: my Life palace to point out my challenges with burnout, my Career palace to note what he calls my “scholar energy,” and my Travel palace to observe my frequent sojourns. With each series of observations, he did a gut check with me to make sure his reading was landing effectively. It did.</p>\n<p>At this point, a skeptic could argue that these broad observations stem from topics I’ve written about publicly before (a quick look at <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/author/an/\">my  Hyperallergic bio and datelines</a>, for example, would confirm my frequent travel) and could just as easily have been Googled. The skeptic would be right, to a certain extent, but the reading was just getting started. And in any case, that critique would miss the point of Clang’s work.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035796/john-clang-reading-by-an-artist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>MIAMI — On a July afternoon, in an abandoned boutique sandwiched unassumingly between a dentist’s office, a Latin grocery store, and a barbershop, Little Havana residents and artists gathered for their afternoon <i>cafecito </i>ritual. But instead of coffee, the plastic fluted espresso cups held swamp mud from the Everglades and checkpoint soil from the entrance to Alligator Alcatraz, the notorious immigrant detention center at the center of a <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032766/alligator-alcatraz-construction-halted-but-native-heritage-remains-at-risk/\">lawsuit</a> alleging violations of the National Environmental Policy Act and <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032766/alligator-alcatraz-construction-halted-but-native-heritage-remains-at-risk/\">Miccosukee land protections</a>. On Thursday, August 21, a judge ordered the <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article311770767.html\">halting of operations</a> at the prison, but the state quickly filed a motion to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/22/alligator-alcatraz-closure-appeal-immigration\">appeal</a> the decision.</p>\n<p>The performance by Miami artist Agua Dulce, titled “Untitled (todo lo que toques se transforma)” (2025), took place at the opening of <i>The Artist As Activist</i>, curated by Isabella Marie Garcia with works by members of Artists 4 Artists (A4A). In recent history, the advocacy group has mobilized in response to local challenges like the <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/913047/art-alluding-to-pro-palestine-slogan-nixed-from-miami-beach-display/\">censorship</a> of political art for Palestine, inequitable pay, and <a href=\"https://www.americantheatre.org/2025/08/01/miami-dade-budget-proposes-major-cuts-to-arts-funding/\">funding cuts</a>. But since Alligator Alcatraz’s construction, A4A has shifted into high gear, convening artists to employ a range of defensive strategies against detention — accompanying migrants to their court hearings, participating in direct action, collecting stories of those detained, leading workshops to help affected families, and creating graphics to build awareness about the history and contemporary politics of the camp.</p>\n<p>Misael Soto, a lead organizer of A4A, told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that they want the organization to “commit itself to taking a stance,” encouraging artists to draw on their special expertise to “affect real change in this city.” </p>\n<p>“I was thinking of artists who are doing creative work, but also doing work for others,” said Garcia. “Artists who work in organizing spaces don’t often get the chance to show their work publicly.”</p>\n<p><i>The</i> <i>Artist As Activist</i>, on view through September 7, includes works by members Motyko, Fola Akinde, and Agua. The show occupies a storefront in a strip mall in Little Havana, a historically Cuban neighborhood that holds layered histories of migration and is home to residents of varied and often precarious legal status. </p>\n<p>“This show speaks to people who inhabit the space naturally,” said Agua. “It’s been interesting to disrupt the mundanity of people going about their days. That’s what makes this space powerful — you’re not expecting to engage with it.”</p>\n<p>Behind the glass, the installation unfolds as a triptych: Motyko’s mixed-media collages at the foreground, Akinde’s cartographic screenprints on the side, and Agua’s altarpiece on the ground. In the background reads the exhibition’s resonant message: “The Gestapo is here, has been here and its name is ICE. No to Alligator Alcatraz!” Translations in Spanish and Kreyòl ripple down.</p>\n<p>“We’re in a more removed part of the city from where a lot of the Alligator Alcatraz situation is in effect,” Garcia explained. She hopes that the installation serves as a public reminder that, despite diminishing news coverage and hopeful developments in the courts, people are still being kidnapped and unlawfully detained.</p>\n<p>Familiar motifs of immigrant life flank the explicit imagery about the detention center. Motyko’s collages include cutouts from magazines, personal photos, newspapers, websites, and archives, combining roosters with cans of condensed milk, whispers of lace with elders’ ringed hands. Two collages draw on the grief and instability that loom over mixed-status and undocumented families.</p>\n<p>Motyko’s father came from Cuba on the Mariel boatlift, her mother from Honduras on Temporary Protected Status. The collage “Untitled”<i> </i>(2023) splices a line of migrants diagonally across a Social Security card, white space in between marking an absence of family milestones: a mother’s funeral, a wedding, a birthday. </p>\n<p>Another overlays agricultural workers protesting the governor’s veto of the Heat Protections Bill onto a plastic Publix shopping bag. The proposed measure would have mandated rest, water, and shade for outdoor laborers, but ultimately failed, even after 29-year-old Mexican farmworker Efraín López García <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/climate-change/article277399723.html\">died</a> of heatstroke on the job in Miami. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036413/with-cafecito-cups-and-direct-action-miami-artists-rise-against-alligator-alcatraz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Rooted in the synthesis of Eastern and Western philosophies, Caodaism — a syncretic religion founded in Vietnam in the 1920s — serves as both inspiration and metaphor in this work, which is on view at the </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/4fNyL7p\">Halsey Institute of Contemporary Art</a>at the College of Charleston in South Carolina through December 6.</p>\n    <p>In his practice, Nguyen transforms torn strips of silk by dipping them into acrylic paint, layering them onto canvas, and hanging them dynamically on the wall to construct new topographies. Now for the first time, his technique has been adapted to form columns that reflect Caodaism’s distinctive temple architecture, marrying traditional Eastern elements with Western influences to create a visual dialogue between the past and the present, the local and the global.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Kenny-Nguyen-The-Divine-Eye-2-1-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Caodaism emerged in response to the tumultuous history of Vietnam in the early 20th century, during a time of colonial occupation and national struggle. In the face of foreign domination and the erosion of indigenous cultural practices, this new religion synthesized elements from Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, Christianity, and other world religions to form a unifying spiritual force. Although Nguyen is not a practicing member of the faith himself, his grandmother was a member of the temple that inspired his work. This connection left a lasting imprint on his understanding of Caodaism and its significance to the Vietnamese people. For the artist, the creation of “The Divine Eye” (2025) is deeply personal.</p>\n    <p>Nguyen’s use of silk is deliberate and symbolic. By pushing the limits of the material, he aims to emphasize concepts of transformation and perseverance, mirroring the journey of the Vietnamese people — both within their homeland and in the diaspora. In many ways, the work is intended to reflect the strength and grace of his grandmother and others in their community who have preserved their culture and spirituality amidst adversity.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Kenny-Nguyen-The-Divine-Eye-3-1-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Through the hybrid form of architecture, intricate folds of silk, and the profound symbolism of the Divine Eye — an all-seeing force that guides and protects — Nguyen hopes to create a space of reflection and connection, speaking not only to the spiritual beliefs of Caodaism but also to the resilience and ongoing transformation of Vietnamese culture. Through Nguyen’s art, viewers are invited to look inward and outward, to witness the past’s impact on the present, and to consider the transformative power of heritage in shaping the future.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>To learn more, visit  halsey.charleston.edu.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Kenny-Nguyen-The-Divine-Eye-4-1-1200x972.jpeg?resize=1200%2C972&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Kenny-Nguyen-The-Divine-Eye-5-2-1200x954.jpg?resize=1200%2C954&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035821/kenny-nguyen-the-divine-eye/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Then, you google everyone involved, get excited to chat with anyone who’s seen the movie in question, and find yourself still thinking about it weeks later. Here’s one movie from this year that did it for me…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sorry-baby-movie.jpg\" alt=\"sorry baby\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p><i> Sorry, Baby</i> bowled me over. Eva Victor’s directorial debut, which they also wrote and starred in, follows Agnes through a few years of her life, sequenced out of order. There’s “The Year With The Baby” and “The Year With The Really Good Sandwich,” but also “The Year With The Bad Thing.” When Eva shared the movie poster on Instagram, they confirmed that “nothing bad happens to the cat.”</p>\n    <p>Instead, it is Agnes to whom the bad thing happens. “I wrote this film because there’s a part of my experience of trauma that I haven’t seen on-screen often: the part where you’re confused,” Eva said during a <a href=\"https://www.sundance.org/blogs/give-me-the-backstory-get-to-know-eva-victor-the-writer-director-behind-sorry-baby/#:~:text=When%20awful%20things%20happen%20to,re%20not%20like%20everyone%20else.\">Sundance interview</a>. “I spent years floating, just trying to accept that I went through something bad.” The movie “honors those years lost,” as they put it. To write the script, Eva holed up in Maine one winter with their cat and many cans of split pea soup.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/try-this.gif\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>The warm friendship between Agnes and Lydie (Naomi Ackie) is the central love story animating the movie. But, as Lydie’s life carries her away from the small town where they met during grad school, Agnes feels stuck. Getting an impressive teaching job at the university means staying in a place marred by a devastating experience during her time as a student. “Bad thing” is a euphemism, but also, with its childlike clarity, a perfect description.</p>\n    <p>Offering a really moving portrait of trauma’s reverberations and one person’s recovery, <i>Sorry, Baby </i>is also very funny. In the theater, I laughed a lot and cried a little. I loved Agnes and would’ve been happy to spend a hundred years with her. Of the movie’s reception, Eva recently told the <i> L.A. Times</i>, “I keep hearing, ‘Oh, Agnes is so awkward.’ I’m like, ‘What the hell?’ I’m very humbled by people’s reactions to how bizarre they think that character is because I’m like: ‘Oh, I thought she was acting legitimately normal, but okay.’”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-02-at-4.01.57-PM.png\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>What’s been your favorite movie so far this year?

But a huge hat tip to the reader who recommended it somewhere in the threadjacks — it's an amazing read so far. (Well, I've primarily* listened to the book thus far, and it's such an easy listen.)</p>\n<p>She's shared less than five stories so far, I think (not all regarding Facebook, either), and each and every one of them have been absolutely jaw dropping, told beautifully, and honestly leave me speechless and emotional if I have to stop in the middle of the story. (My poor son had to listen to me telling him the entire story of her shark attack because I had just listened to it and I was still OMG-ing.) I'm assuming this is where the cover art comes from!</p>\n<p>She's also been talking about how she decided she was fascinated by Facebook and the “global revolution” that she saw coming in 2011, and how she went about pitching an entirely new job to the Facebook team, including using her network and adjusting her pitch in really smart ways… great reading if you've ever had a fantasy job that you wanted to make reality.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/41vz4xQ\">The book</a> is available on hardcover for around $17 at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/41vz4xQ\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/12747/9781250391230\">Bookshop</a>, <a href=\"https://howl.link/aad42sj3y89qn\">Target</a>, or <a href=\"https://rstyle.me/+2J-0gGGzsRxrrKyNHbL6QQ\">Barnes &amp; Noble</a>; if you're a member of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4nbvNMB\">Kindle Unlimited</a> (*raises hand*) it's available for free.</p>\n<p>*Am I the only one who likes to get the ebook and the audiobook out at the same time and move between the two? I often find it easiest to start a new book via audiobook. I belong to a few different libraries so I like <a href=\"https://corporette.com/tool-of-the-trade-library-extension/\">this Chrome extension</a> to put myself on various hold lists; Spotify Premium also has a lot of audiobooks available. </p>\n<p><strong>Sales of note for 8/29/25</strong> (I'm bolding the ones I'm checking out first):</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://corporette.com/holiday-weekend-open-thread-58/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I also made a day trip to Devil’s Bridge, a place I had only seen in a couple of episodes of <i>Hinterland,</i> a noir crime drama set in Wales. The dark and atmospheric Devil’s Bridge comprises three bridges that span the Afon Mynach, a tributary of the Rheidol. Each one, built upon the previous bridge, can be reached by the Rheidol Steam Railway, and had made it to my travel wish list since I saw the show in 2018.</p>\n<p>I am not the only one who’s guided by the screen when it comes to travel plans. According to Expedia, the screen is sparking wanderlust across the world. The travel company’s 2023 report <i>The No-Normal: Unexpected Travel Trends</i> revealed that 66% of travellers worldwide have “considered visiting a destination after seeing it featured in a show or movie they have streamed at home, and 39% have booked a trip for the same reason”. The company’s Unpack 2024 research predicted that the trend would continue this year, with “movies and streaming shows (the) top inspiration for travel”.</p>\n<p>Be it gorgeous landscapes of New Zealand (<i>The Rings of Power</i>) or the natural beauty of Maui and Sicily (<i>The White Lotus</i>), the urbanity of Paris (<i>Emily in Paris</i>) or the glamour and glitz of New York (<i>Sex and the City</i> reboot), travellers are planning trips to locations popularised by TV series and movies.</p>\n<p>In fact, Expedia believes this will lead destinations such as Thailand (<i>The White Lotus,</i> season 3), the Scottish Highlands (<i>Outlander,</i> season 7), Malta (<i>Gladiator 2</i>), Greece (<i>Argylle</i>) and South Korea (<i>Squid Game,</i> season 2) to trend in 2024.</p>\n<p>Nishant Pitti, CEO and co-founder, EaseMyTrip, agrees that seeking holiday inspiration from films, soaps or sitcoms is the new global travel trend that is influencing tourists’ holiday plans and is expected to gain momentum this year. “This is a rather unconventional take on travelling and vacationing, with new movies and TV series generating higher interest in travel to those places,” he says.</p>\n<p>The trend has been around for a while, especially after <i>Harry Potter, Game of</i> <i>Thrones </i>and <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, but screen-inspired travel has soared post-pandemic. One destination though that remains an evergreen choice for set-jetting is the UK, due to the fact that so many films and series have been shot here.</p>\n<p>Over the years, iconic film and TV franchises such as <i>James Bond, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Outlander, The Crown</i> and <i>Paddington</i> have consistently chosen UK locations and studios to house their productions. Recent films such as <i>Wonka</i> and Napoleon have boosted visitor numbers, while the growth of TV streaming has fuelled a rise in screen tourism. The fact that films and series have been filmed across Britain, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland has led to numerous set-jetting opportunities.\n\t                                    </p>\n<p>With inbound tourists spending an estimated £892.6 million (around ₹9,194 crore) in film-related screen tourism in the UK in 2019 alone, according to the British Film Institute (BFI), the country is tapping the potential of screen tourism.</p>\n<p>Pitti says the UK tops the list owing to its scenic beauty and the right blend of royalty, history and modern experiences that create the perfect backdrop for historical dramas and contemporary shows. “For instance, Chatsworth House in Peak district was featured in <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> (the 2005 version starring Keira Knightley). The UK has also been the centrepiece of shows like <i>Downton Abbey</i> and <i>Bridgerton</i> (Hampton Court Palace). Even the <i>Harry Potter</i> franchise sought inspiration from the alluring Scottish Highlands to create a mystical fantasy world for children,” he says.</p>\n<p>The choices for travellers are plentiful. The British Film Commission, the agency that supports production of international films and television in the UK, in 2022 alone supported film and TV titles such as <i>Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, The Crown, season 6, The Boys in the Boat, Black Cake</i> and <i>Napoleon</i>.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/setjetting-uk-travel-trend-expedia-111714111224778.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Imagine that your application for a teaching position has been rejected by a number of universities and teaching institutions in Europe. You advertise private tuitions but no pupils turn up. You settle for a job as a third-division clerk at a patent office, reading patent applications from nine in the morning till five in the evening, six days a week. Back home, your marriage is in trouble. And yet, you churn out no less than five theoretical papers on science, three of which will give a new lease of life to physics for another century. That was Einstein in 1905. He was a technical expert—class III at the Federal Office for Intellectual Property in Bern between 1902 and 1909, and with no access to any scientific instruments, literature, colleagues, or inspiration. He was all by himself, consumed by his thought experiments. By today’s standards of work culture, Einstein was moonlighting.</p>\n<p>Every few months, there’s a storm in a teacup about moonlighting—or working at another job while holding a steady one. The term hit headline soon after the pandemic, when work-from-home became the norm and employees logged in without the supervision of their bosses. Is it indeed “cheating” as some leaders have declared? It depends on what you do—if you do the very same work for a competitor, it is wrong. But, if the side hustle is a creative pursuit that gives you a shot at creating history, why not?</p>\n<p>Steve Wozniak was creating the future of Apple years before he left HP to set up the company with Steve Jobs. He would develop new hardware and systems with no direct relevance to the HP of the day. During the late 1980s, Tim Berners-Lee took on the side gig of automating information sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world, which led to the creation of the World Wide Web. If there is a pent-up creative capacity which is not adequately channelised by the employer, the person should be allowed to do justice to it.</p>\n<p>There are three conditions under which moonlighting makes sense, and, in fact, must be encouraged. First, when an employee’s talent is not fully utilised or developed, the employee must be allowed to take up additional tasks within or outside the formal setup. After all, it is an employer’s responsibility to tap into the resource or they run the risk of the asset eroding. It’s not just utilisation of talent, but also development and enhancement through exposure. The mythologist and writer Devdutt Pattanaik spent his early years at Sanofi Aventis and Apollo Group of Hospitals honing his skills as a writer, alongside his day job as a medical practitioner. That allowed him to craft a creative career for himself as well as entertain and inform a huge number of readers.</p>\n<p>Second, when the cause the employee is working for is broader than the firm’s immediate interest or relevance. If an employee is creating a solution that could potentially shift the paradigm of the market as a whole, the firm should be willing to fund such a venture. That’s how Intel encouraged its engineer, Ajay Bhatt, to create the USB standard that didn’t just benefit the firm to inter-operate with other devices but became an industry standard for data communication. It was not exactly what Intel, the chip maker, was known for.</p>\n<p>Third, moonlighting makes for a great investment if the employee helps the firm develop new skills and competencies. If an employee is working on a similar domain that the firm excels in then where is the firm learning from? It’s a circular flow of knowledge. It is possible that through a side-gig the employee develops new competences that would become mainstream in the organisation. This way the firm can transform to become future ready.</p>\n<p>The early experiments that the internal IT team did at Amazon with its infrastructure and computational capacity laid the foundation of AWS, which has become the biggest profit engine for the company. All such experiments were planted years before the company made any profits from its core business.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/moonlighting-side-job-part-time-work-interests-111714324643689.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>When Banksy visited New Orleans a few years after Hurricane Katrina, the artist left 17 murals behind, sprinkled across the city. One piece on the exterior of a biker bar, <i>Boy on a Life Preserver Swing,</i> had been spray-painted over and then reduced to rubble after the bar was demolished. Ronnie Fredericks, a dump truck driver, went to the site to collect the cinderblocks that made up the mural and stored them for years until he found an opportunity—and an art-loving New Orleans hotelier—to bring the artwork back to life. Ivy Knight writes a delightful <i>Oxford American</i> story about three people who come together to restore a Banksy.</p><blockquote><p>Grenier met Cummings and Fredericks at a warehouse in Bywater—the same one where she’d spent two months working on</p><i>Looters</i>. Located along the railroad tracks close to the Mississippi River, it takes up a whole city block. As she looked at the collection of cinderblocks, she had a few concerns. First was where to begin, for they were in no particular order, and she had only Fredericks’s word that a Banksy existed under the paint. And was Fredericks trustworthy? She noticed he had a tattoo of Da Vinci on his bicep. “I was a little suspicious when I saw that tattoo of Leonardo because I thought, ‘Well, maybe you’re an artist or maybe you’re a forger. I don’t know who you are yet.’” Counterfeit art is a common concern in Grenier’s work. “There will always be art forgers as long as there’s a demand for art. You’ve got to be really careful with Banksy. We know there have been some fakes,” she said. “It’s difficult to identify spray paint, because of it being a modern material and available to anybody. So, you know, initially I wasn’t that optimistic.”</blockquote><h2>More picks about art</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/07/22/thomas-kinkade-trump-america/\">The Painter of the Right</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Thomas Kinkade’s paintings show conservatives a world they have already won.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/05/22/the-man-who-wrote-take-on-me-on-the-fine-art-of-not-giving-a-fk/\">The Man Who Wrote “Take On Me” on the Fine Art of Not Giving a F**k</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Magne Furuholmen doesn’t care if the only reason you want to see his art is that he’s the A-ha guy.

    "body": "<h3>We climb glaciers and take minute measurements to understand the threats to our future. This is the story of my last, and most dramatic, trip to the Arctic.</h3>\n<p>\n      <i>My book,  Meltdown: The Making and Breaking of a Field Scientist, comes out this week, six years after I started writing it. It’s about my time as a female academic scientist traveling to remote field locations, and the illness that cut my career short. This Narratively Classic was critical for my book, as I drew heavily on its content and style to create a world that readers could understand and be immersed in. </i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>—Sarah Boon</i>\n    </p>\n<p>It was 10 p.m. one night in June of 2008 and we were cut off from our on-glacier camp. When we’d left that morning, it was sunny and the glacier surface was crisp and crunchy, perfect for our plastic boots and crampons. My graduate student and I had decked ourselves out in hats and sunscreen to protect us from the sun’s reflection off the ice, then headed up-glacier to check on a weather station and a stream gauge to make sure we were ready to capture all of the data we needed once spring melt began.</p>\n<p>It was a long day, and by the time we headed back down-glacier, toward our camp, my bad knee had started acting up and I couldn’t walk without pain. To make the situation worse, we realized that things had changed while we were away from camp. The warm day had melted the snow on the lower glacier, leaving a shifting landscape of ice slurries in hidden surface channels surrounded by small hummocks of solid ice. We got within 1,500 feet of our camp and couldn’t go any farther, as there were two slushy streams between it and us that were just too wide and deep to cross. My graduate student tried to cross anyway, but the slush was like quicksand. I had to yell at him to lie down and pull himself out by the arms instead of trying to kick out with his legs. Now he was curled up in the tinfoil blanket from the emergency kit, icy wet to the waist and moaning about not wanting to die. Thank goodness for 24-hour daylight.</p>\n<p>I couldn’t reach him, and neither of us could reach our camp. It was time to get out the satellite phone and call base camp in Resolute Bay, 250 miles southwest.</p>\n<p>Not all Arctic researchers have had the luxury of satellite phones or shortwave radios. Take the English explorers at the turn of the century: If they got in trouble on their travels, they had only themselves to rely on. Searchers were only sent out if the expedition didn’t return after several years. This is what happened to Captain Sir John Franklin, who set off to traverse the last unexplored section of the Northwest Passage in 1845. The story ends badly — Franklin and his crew died of zinc deficiency and scurvy, some resorted to cannibalism, and they left artifacts strewn across the Arctic tundra as they tried to walk for help. Franklin’s wife pushed for a search for the missing expedition as early as 1848, but it was too late for Franklin and his crew. More than 50 expeditions searched for 12 years before concluding that every one of the 129 men was gone. The searchers found only graves, relics and Inuit stories about the expedition. It wasn’t until 2014 that Parks Canada and the Royal Canadian Geographical Society finally found one of Franklin’s abandoned boats, the H.M.S. <i>Erebus</i>, on the seabed where the Inuit had always said it was. The wreck of the H.M.S. <i>Terror</i>, Franklin’s second boat, was found in 2016 by the Arctic Research Foundation. Both sites are currently being explored in collaboration with the local Inuit.</p>\n<p>The Arctic has long tempted researchers to take risks to answer questions of science. Consider Norwegian Fridtjof Nansen, who suspected that, rather than being static, sea ice was a dynamic system that moved ice from east to west across the Arctic Ocean, from Siberia to Greenland, and potentially over the North Pole itself.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/the-secret-life-of-a-scientist-new-book\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

To the west, acres of cow pastures rolled into the distant hills. Everyone on our tiny street knew everyone else, and everyone knew our next-door neighbors hated us. <br/>Lined up in neat rows along our backyard was a young orchard: spindly trees still too weak to bear fruit, propped up by wooden stakes and thick twine. Looping through the branches and woven between the trees was a series of tripwires adorned with silver Christmas bells. My father told me he put them up to keep the deer from eating our apples.

For writers, that means carving out the time and space to finally give our creative projects the attention they deserve. We’ve designed our Narratively Academy summer class schedule with that in mind. And since we know summer is also for giving yourself a break, all of our upcoming summer classes are either short (one to three sessions) and/or designed so you can attend asynchronously. </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Sign up this week (by Sunday, June 15) and take 20% off any one of these classes by using the code EARLYSUMMER at checkout.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Read on for everything we have on tap!</p>\n<p>But before we get to the brand-new classes, just a quick reminder that we have Abeer Hoque back teaching <strong> The Insider’s Guide to Writing Personal Statements and Applying for Grants &amp; Residencies</strong> this coming weekend, June 14 and June 21. There are just two seats left in this small class, so if you want in, grab yours now!</p>\n<p>We all know that one of the trickiest things to write about honestly is family — especially parents. Talk about navigating emotional minefields! That’s why we’re so pleased to have Ladane Nasseri, a MacDowell fellow who has published everywhere from <i>The New York Times</i> to <i>McSweeney’s</i>, teaching a two-hour seminar later this month, <strong> The Way They Were: Writing About Parents and Formative Relationships</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you’re working on a memoir or a personal essay that you want to infuse with original reporting and research, don’t miss this class. Kristina Gaddy — acclaimed author, essayist and editor at the literary journal <i>true </i>— is leading a special two-part craft-focused seminar in July called <strong> Reporting the Personal Essay</strong>. Students really loved the first edition of this class last year, and Kristina has now expanded it to include a second day where you can discuss your own works-in-progress.</p>\n<p>This summer, just 10 writers will have the chance to work one-one-one with Narratively executive editor Jesse Sposato. Jesse edits almost all of the memoir pieces that are published on Narratively, and this is the very first time she’s teaching <strong> Summer Memoir Mentorship: Perfecting the Personal Essay</strong>. If you have a draft of a personal essay and you’re ready for professional feedback, Jesse will review and critique your story, hop on a one-on-one call to discuss edits with you, then review your revision and help you get it all polished up and ready to submit to publications. </p>\n<p>We could not be more excited about this next class which, honestly, everyone on our team wants to take ourselves! If you’re a journalist, essayist or other writer who has always wanted to try your hand at a screenplay, this summer is your chance to commit. Bill Gullo is a very accomplished Hollywood screenwriter and longtime educator. In <strong> this fun, fast-paced summer class, he’ll show you how to write a “vomit draft” of a screenplay in six weeks</strong>. What’s a vomit draft? It’s just what it sounds like: fast and disgusting, but productive. Plus you’ll feel better after you’re done! Any professional screenwriter will tell you about the importance of getting the first draft finished so you can step back and see what’s working and what’s not. Throughout these six weeks, Bill will walk writers through all the details of how to get that full first draft finished in a way that allows you to move forward with intention.</p>\n<p>One of our perennially popular classes, Katey Schultz’s <strong> The Fine Art of Deep Revision</strong> explores how revising your own writing can be efficient, productive and even fun — once you identify the concrete techniques that work best for you. Our three previous sessions of this class all sold out quickly, so grab a seat now if you want to get to work on revising your writing projects this August.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/first-look-check-out-our-new-summer-classes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s a balmy August night, lit by a big, yellow moon. Two fishermen in a boat are earning their keep out there off the shore of Antibes in southern France. One of them aims at a large, curmudgeonly fish with a pitchfork, the other tries his luck with a fishing line. A cautious crab keeps a safe distance.<strong> </strong>Gas lamps reflect on the water’s surface and flicker into the air. A girl on a bike observes the whole scene from a high dock while licking an ice cream. She’s there with a friend, it seems. </p>\n    <p>Luxurious Monaco is less than an hour away by car. Beachy Nice is even closer. Everything looks fine and lovely. But beneath these calm waters swirl malignant tides that portend the onset of a Second, much deadlier World War just a few weeks away.</p>\n    <p>This scene in Pablo Picasso’s “Night Fishing at Antibes” stopped me in my tracks during a visit to the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) on a hot Saturday afternoon in New York City.</p>\n    <p>Currently hung on a wall at a busy intersection connecting two escalators on the museum’s fifth floor, it’s nearly impossible to have a private moment with this Cubist masterpiece, much less heed its alarm that we’re never really too far away from a third, infinitely more horrific World War, probably powered by AI.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/image00002-1200x900.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>This sprawling piece (6.75 by 11.3 feet, or two by 3.5 meters) was acquired for MoMA in 1952 by Olga Hirsh Guggenheim, wife of industrialist-philanthropist Simon Guggenheim, brother of Solomon R. Guggenheim, who started his own eponymous museum on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue. The Guggenheims made their fortune from building a global mining and smelting empire, which reached its peak during the First World War. They, among others, have been <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt130hv7t\">accused of war profiteering</a> by gouging the price of copper, which was essential for the arms industry. Many in the family have abandoned the mining industry since then. Now we recognize them more as great patrons of the arts, just as we do many contemporary MoMA donors and board members accused of <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/871887/protesters-hit-moma-again-demanding-museum-drop-board-chair-marie-josee-kravis/\">extractivism</a> and <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/521733/moma-private-prison-open-letter/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20denounce%20MoMA\"s%20connections%20to%20mass%20incarceration%2C,letter%20reads.%20%E2%80%9CStopping%20the%20global%20cycles%20of\">profiting off the military-industrial complex</a>.</p>\n    <p>And isn’t it an interesting coincidence that 1939, the year Picasso made “Night Fishing at Antibes,” is also the year he loaned “Guernica” (1937), his most famous anti-war painting, to MoMA for safekeeping after the outbreak of the war in Europe? Such is history, a turning wheel of irony. The people collecting and safeguarding the anti-war art are often the same ones selling the bombs.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/image00001-1200x900.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>PING</i>! As I stood blocking escalator traffic while contemplating these entanglements, a notification on my phone screen announced that the United States, 80 years after the atomic end of World War II, had <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-orders-nuclear-submarines-moved-after-russian-provocative-statements-2025-08-02/\">positioned nuclear submarines close to Russia</a>.</p>\n    <p>Outside the museum, an August sun flagellated the asphalt roads, concrete pavements, and skyscrapers of Midtown Manhattan. It was a vengeful, punishing sun. A jingoistic sun that wants you to go the hell back to where you came from. Nevertheless, the streets teemed with people shopping, sightseeing, and licking ice cream — just going about their normal business. Every one of them looked like a Picasso fisherman to me.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035989/we-are-all-picasso-fishermen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

On the opposite side of the gallery, “Half Memory”<strong> </strong>(2024) coalesces three years of filming in the United Kingdom, United States, and France into an allusive, nonlinear 27 minutes. Soon, though, the two works come to complement each other, their dreamlike atmospheres opening onto shared themes of history and memory threaded through with the voices of Black artists and intellectuals. </p>\n    <p>In “Bodies In Dissent,” Essi’s scenes of artist Nambi Kiyira performing in a grassy green field are interspersed with black and white video of then-married jazz drummer Max Roach and singer Abbey Lincoln during a 1964 concert, and archival clips of dancer Loretta Abbott. Kiyira, wearing a long black dress, is seen alternately from afar and up close, backed by audio from the concert.</p>\n    <p>“Half Memory” takes Toni Morrison’s essay “The Site of Memory” (1986) and her concept of “rememory” — repressed memories returning via a living force — as a jumping-off point for an exploration of individual and collective memory and history. In it, grainy imagery of public places like cities and beaches — suggesting both anonymous found footage and surveillance videos — is layered with the words of Morrison and other Black feminist scholars.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Essi2-1200x883.jpg?resize=1200%2C883&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>Most online descriptions of Essi’s work, including her own artist statement, put forth a didactic portrait of the films (her website states that her art “revolves around Black feminist epistemology and the configuration of displaced histories”). These themes inhere in the references and connections she brings to light, but the films themselves are far more abstract and intuitive than academic and dry. The meditative pace and washed-out color palette of “Half Memory” reflect the ways that memories cohere, dissipate, and reemerge, while the pastoral setting of “Bodies In Dissent,” framing the performer’s elegant movements and form, renders the work lush and painterly.</p>\n    <p>The show’s location, in one of MoMA’s free ground-floor galleries, is a boon for art lovers who don’t have $30 to spend on a museum visit. Essi’s focus on music and landscape calls to mind some film works by Cauleen Smith (for instance, her 2017 ode to Alice Coltrane, “Pilgrim”). Smith’s more cinematic vision strikes a balance between abstraction and narrative that Essi’s works don’t quite achieve — and maybe weren’t meant to. But the artists are separated by a generation or more (Essi was born in 1995, three years before Smith released her feature film, <i>Drylongso</i>), and Essi’s aesthetic is still evolving. </p>\n    <p>Some contextualizing materials, such as archival texts or background on Roach and Lincoln’s activism through music, might have brought the show to another level. However, Essi’s great skill in these pieces lies in articulating her conceptual concerns through aesthetic and sensory means. “Half Memory” evokes the workings of memory and its relationship with official and repressed histories through its fluid montage, while “Bodies In Dissent” interweaves the past and present of Black arts and activism through music and the body. The effect is subtle, but it lingers.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Essi4-1200x894.jpg?resize=1200%2C894&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Essi5-1200x867.jpg?resize=1200%2C867&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Essi6-1200x919.jpg?resize=1200%2C919&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/K4A0765_PRESS-2000x1334-1-1200x800.jpeg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Projects: Ufuoma Essi</i>at The Museum of Modern Art, New York (photo Jonathan Dorado)</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/5813\">Ufuoma Essi</a> <i>continues at the Museum of Modern Art (11 West 53rd Street, Midtown, Manhattan) through October 13.

But hers are especially unique. The Tlingit artist, born and based in Juneau, Alaska, is trained in both Ravenstail and <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/985534/reviving-tsimshian-weaving-with-threads-of-community/\">Chilkat</a> weaving practices. She learned the art forms from her ancestors and elders, including her late mother, Clarissa Rizal — one of the last living apprentices of Master Chilkat <a href=\"https://www.arts.gov/honors/heritage/jennie-thlunaut\">Weaver Jennie Thlunaut</a> — and weaver Kay Field Parker. Hope’s Labubus are dressed in traditional Ravenstail regalia, woven robes, and headdresses made of Merino wool.</p>\n    <p>“They’re actually repurposed dance cuffs,” Hope told <i>Hyperallergic</i>, describing the process as “Indigenizing the Labubus.”</p>\n    <p>Hope planned to sell the regalia at the <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035211/dispatches-from-the-ever-evolving-santa-fe-indian-market-2025/\">Santa Fe Indian Market</a> during her recent trip to New Mexico, but after posting a Ravenstail Labubu on her Instagram on August 5, the clothes almost completely sold out within days. At the market, she gifted one to a tourist from Trinidad, who planned to give it to his father. “So the regalia has made its way down to the Caribbean,” she said. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/4R1B0280-1200x1419.jpg?resize=1200%2C1419&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Kathryn Bunn-Marcuse, curator of Northwest Native Art at Seattle’s Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture, also acquired two outfits via Facebook messenger, initially purchasing a Tlingit outfit beaded by Hope’s <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/yourauntiedee/\">Aunt Deanna</a>. Bunn-Marcuse was excited to add multiple artists to the collection; the second acquisition will be woven by Hope, contributing more mini Ravenstail attire “to represent the regalia that we love and share on the northwest coast of Alaska and Canada,” in the artist’s words.</p>\n    <p>Emphasis on <i>we</i>: For Hope, one of the most important components of her practice is sharing. She began teaching public weaving workshops in the early aughts with her mother. “I loved the community that was being built and expanded,” she said, “and the feeling of creating work that’s bigger than any one of us. Sitting in a quiet space alone — that’s a disservice to my weaving community, to my Native community. If I do that, the work is not serving its highest good.” Hope added online classes to her repertoire at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and now has Labubu regalia materials available for purchase on her website, in preparation for a public virtual course.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/jami-powell-osage-holding-doll-by-lily-hope-tlingit-credit-kaela-waldstein-1200x1799.jpg?resize=1200%2C1799&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Even if participants have no weaving experience, the kit “is a very beginner-accessible project,” Hope added. It includes a pre-drilled header bar, the initial band that spreads out a loom’s warp threads. “People who’ve never done this before can get to work right away. You can just snap the header bar on a basket or toilet paper roll.”</p>\n    <p>And the workshop is truly for everyone, Hope emphasized. “Ravenstail geometric weaving has been in the hands of many nations for 40 years,” the artist said, “so I don’t pause to share the knowledge with people of any nationality.”</p>\n    <p>To those who are curious: The kit doesn’t include Labubus themselves; any dolls that don’t become models are given to her children, who adore them. “My children help me unbox them,” Hope said. “For every six or 12 that I buy, they each get to keep one.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036741/the-indigenous-artist-making-dazzling-labubu-regalia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

New evidence now suggests that the damage was far less than initially feared and may not have warranted the harsh two-year sentence for Phoebe Plummer and the 20-month sentence for Anna Holland.</p>\n    <p>The two Just Stop Oil activists hurled soup at van Gogh’s 1888 painting “Sunflowers” in London’s National Gallery and then glued themselves to the wall, an act that made global headlines. The painting was protected by thick security glass, but social media reacted strongly to the protest that aimed to draw attention to the climate crisis.</p>\n    <p>A Freedom of Information request from <a href=\"https://novaramedia.com/2025/08/22/the-national-gallery-only-spent-150-retouching-van-gogh-frame-after-just-stop-oil-souping/\"> Novara Media</a> revealed that the museum’s head of framing, Peter Schade, estimated the cost of retouching the frame at £150 (~$203). According to the media outlet, the museum also spent around £250 (~$338) restoring the wall, plus £35 (~$47) for paint, totaling about £435 (~$588) for all damages. In September 2024, when reporting on the sentencing, the </p>\n    <p><i>BBC</i>said that the pair caused</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly7zy3d3exo\">£10,000 worth of damage to the gold-colored frame</a>of the glass-covered painting in what they characterized as an “attack,” but provided no evidence or</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>source for their estimate. The British public broadcaster added that the museum had purchased the frame in 1999 and that it was valued at £28,000.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Judge Christopher Hehir, who presided over the case, ruled that the value of the damage was irrelevant for the jury, thus preventing its members from hearing these figures. The activists were found guilty and received a combined three-and-a-half-year sentence. <i>Novara Media</i> inquired about a full restoration of the frame, but the museum reportedly declined to comment.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMAGE_JustStopOil_NationalGallery5_14102022-1200x874.png?resize=1200%2C874&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The judge, known for his harsh stance on climate activism, stated in his sentencing remarks, “It is not the value of the damage caused to the frame that is the most serious aspect of your offending … You came within the thickness of a pane of glass of irreparably damaging or even destroying this priceless treasure, and that must be reflected in the sentences I pass.”</p>\n    <p>Human rights lawyer <a href=\"https://juststopoil.org/2024/10/16/five-legal-missteps-in-judge-hehirs-sentencing-of-plummer-and-holland/\">Aabhinav Tyagi has written about five alleged legal missteps</a> in the sentencing of these eco-activists, and questions remain as to whether justice has actually been served. Pussy Riot member Nadya Tolokonnikova chimed in on the pages of the<i> </i><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/03/vincent-van-gogh-just-stop-oil-sentencing-nature-painter-protesters-soup-sunflowers\"> Guardian</a> shortly after the verdict, writing in the activist pair’s defense: “Nature was Van Gogh’s ultimate muse. He loved it, as do Phoebe and Anna. I believe he would have approved of Phoebe and Anna’s action — it belonging to the tradition of activists and artists defying norms to create a new, better world. In the case of Just Stop Oil, to save our one and only planet from destruction and protect the natural world that Van Gogh so loved.”</p>\n    <p>This case highlights the debate over what counts as peaceful protest versus violent crime. According to Tyagi, “Judge Hehir classified the activists’ actions as violent, equating throwing soup at a protected painting with physically assaulting a person. This characterization enabled the judge to disregard the protections for peaceful protest under the European Convention on Human Rights, bypassing Articles 10 and 11, which protect freedom of expression and assembly.”</p>\n    <p>As museum protests continue to draw attention, debates over protest rights and proportional sentences are likely to persist. One may argue that the cases of eco-protests at museums were the canary in the coal mine for the larger Gaza protests that have since followed, since many of the same issues outlined by Tyagi — including punishment based more on perceived risk than on actual harm and the proportionality of sentences — are more relevant than ever.</p>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i> reached out to the National Gallery for comment and has not yet heard back.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036809/why-did-eco-activists-get-years-in-prison-for-only-588-in-damages/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><i>Perfection</i>(2022), translated by Sophie Hughes and published by New York Review Books (image courtesy New York Review Books)</p>\n<p>I started reading Italian novelist Vincenzo Latronico’s <i>Perfection</i> (2022)<i> </i>splayed out languidly<i> </i>on the beach. Then I was sitting up, nerves ablaze, and then on the train, the world outside whizzing past unnoticed, and then in bed that night, my Kindle having temporarily usurped my iPhone, and then it was over. I felt abuzz, delirious, called out. Reading <i>Perfection </i>is as uncanny and disturbing as looking at your doppelganger. I’m not a Southern European emigré to Berlin, like the main characters, Anna and Tom. But I am a part of the art world of New York, and their East Berlin reads a lot to me like my Brooklyn and Lower East Side. Because, as Latronico himself points out, their neighborhood could “just as well have been New York — or anywhere in the world, for that matter.”</p>\n<p>Translated by Sophie Hughes and published in English earlier this year, <i>Perfection </i>is fundamentally about making meaning in a world where the real and digital, the local and global, have fused into one hybrid, monstrous, relentless thing. Latronico lampoons a specifically white-collar, self-styled cultural person with an art critic’s attention to detail, and perhaps the pettiness as well. Anna and Tom are graphic designers, and though they think of social media and the internet as a “constellation of distractions,” there is, in reality, no distinction between “the personal and the professional — between news stories and banter, project pitches and catchy pop hooks.” As the author puts it: “They would drift from one thing to the other, because one thing was the other.” But though Latronico delights in ridiculing his characters, he also recognizes them as hapless avatars of a globalized culture flattened by the internet. They live as though trapped in a screen, seemingly unable to really touch or taste the world as their lives unfold like the images they consume.</p>\n<p>The Berlin art scene, as experienced by Anna and Tom, is as surface-level as those images. It’s just another part of their protracted going-out routine that begins on Saturday morning and runs into the following afternoon. “Table tennis in Arkonaplatz” or “bocce on Paul-Lincke-Ufer” blends easily with an “independent art space above a car wash in Friedrichshain,” a “basement gallery on Graefestraße.” Descriptions of these events will be familiar to anyone who frequents a gallery circuit anywhere in the world: little clusters of people huddled under the “neon glow” of a streetlamp, the “empties piled up around plastic beer crates on the pavement.” They have learned to “talk the talk,” Latronico writes, but they didn’t actually “get it.” They go to openings because art is the “pulse of their life in Berlin”; galleries, he writes, are both “a stage and a social hub.”</p>\n<p>It’s not just the art world that’s been razed to the level of abstraction in <i>Perfection</i>. It’s literally everything. It’s sex: “One of them would read a piece by a New York journalist about how she’d taught her boyfriend to use a double strap-on and then send the affiliate link to the other over Slack.” It’s history: Living in East Berlin, Anna and Tom can vaguely connect “place names and crucial events from the previous century … but really their awareness didn’t exceed a few anecdotes rattled off to make it look like their life there had more substance.” It’s political engagement: the <a href=\"https://www.unhcr.org/us/news/stories/2015-year-europes-refugee-crisis\">refugee crisis</a>, with its “image[s] of migrants crammed into dinghies beside grey military patrol boats,” becomes just another part of the “information landscape,” along with the “dusty yellow photos of wars in the Middle East, or the red and cobalt blue of the smoke grenades at G8 protests.” Real life collapses into RGB pixels. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036701/vincenzo-latronico-perfection-novel-is-the-art-world-black-mirror/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I’m satiated, I have energy and you’ve heard it before – <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/how-to-go-from-blonde-to-brunette/\">my hair is the healthiest</a> it’s ever been.</p>\n<p>Anyway, to get everything all in one place for you, here is my entire day of food and supplements.</p>\n<h2>What I Eat In A Day and My Bowl of Meat:</h2>\n<p>+ As soon as I wake up I remove my <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/the-skinny-confidential-mouth-tape-is-here-for-your-deepest-beauty-sleep-ever/\">mouth tape</a> then I <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/bye-bye-bad-breath-everyone-tongue-scraper/\">scrape my tongue</a> (my fave is <a href=\"https://wellnesse.com/products/coppertonguescraper?oid=20&amp;affid=174\">this one</a> by Wellnesse). You should do this before consuming anything so you don’t swallow the bacteria that grows in your mouth overnight. Then it’s right into hydrating with tons of water that I keep right beside my bed.</p>\n<p>+ Once I’m downstairs I’ll take <a href=\"https://justthrivehealth.com/discount/Skinny\">Just Thrive probiotics</a>, because they’re one of the only ones that actually survives the trip to your gut. And I’ll also do a water with fresh lemon juice, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3wsZhk1\">unflavored electrolytes</a> or <a href=\"https://www.gopjn.com/t/8-12762-307361-261816\">Kroma’s Cranberry Hydration Elixir</a>, depuffing drops (sold out but get <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4bZFQQ2\">the debloat pills</a>), <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3uNke8H\">apple cider vinegar</a>, <a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1818040&amp;u=3239803&amp;m=113313&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=\">Quinton minerals</a>, and <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3I9Jed9\">colostrum</a> (listen to <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/the-skinny-confidential-him-her-podcast/id1093028505?i=1000628218024\">this episode</a> to learn more).</p>\n<p>The tumblers I like for water concoctions right now are these <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3UQDP2c\">glass ones</a> and the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3uJwbw2\">Simple Modern 40oz</a> ones.</p>\n<p>+ After the kids have breakfast, Townes and I go for our circadian walk. When we get home I’ll have an <a href=\"https://www.owlvenice.com\">Owl Venice bone broth</a> with lemon, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3wsktGJ\">turmeric</a> and <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3UKC3Qm\">Celtic salt</a>.</p>\n<p>+ Approximately 90 minutes after waking up I’ll do an iced coffee with raw milk. So many coffee beans contain mold and chemicals so I like <a href=\"https://getkion.com/collections/see-all?utm_source=theskinnyconfidential&amp;utm_medium=grin&amp;platform=grin&amp;link_id=901932&amp;token=I1ig1VYsapR97bn3xXrjICbxDaWf3izF&amp;contact_id=f8f17aef-04fa-4673-8770-b9356d52d2e9&amp;attribution_window=30\">Kion</a> the best. Huberman says “you need to let some adenosine fix itself on receptors before you consume coffee.” You can get raw milk from the Farmer’s Market but do your own research. Most days I add the coffee alkalizer by <a href=\"http://www.getoffyouracid.com/?afmc=2c&amp;utm_campaign=2c&amp;utm_source=leaddyno&amp;utm_medium=affiliate\">Get Off Your Acid</a> (use code SKINNY for 20% off your first purchase and get the strawberry kiwi minerals too).</p>\n<p>Michael and I think it’s the perfect pre-workout drink because it gives you a bit of protein, carbs, and fat, plus amino acids, antimicrobials, vitamins and minerals. Oh, and an iced coffee is best served with nugget ice. <a href=\"https://bit.ly/48s8DJY\">This is the machine</a> I recently bought and I fully recommend it along with this white <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3SON2Wb\">W&amp;P Porter tumbler</a>.</p>\n<p>+ Around 9:30/10 I head to the gym to <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/my-trainer-brent-hruska-on-micro-dosing-lowering-cortisol-how-yoga-changed-his-life/\">lift weights</a> with yet another drink concoction. Creatine is the most studied supplement in the world and it helps increase your performance and strength. <a href=\"https://www.livemomentous.com/skinny\">Momentous</a> is the one I use and I have 5 grams with a school of <a href=\"https://getkion.com/collections/see-all?utm_source=theskinnyconfidential&amp;utm_medium=grin&amp;platform=grin&amp;link_id=901932&amp;token=I1ig1VYsapR97bn3xXrjICbxDaWf3izF&amp;contact_id=f8f17aef-04fa-4673-8770-b9356d52d2e9&amp;attribution_window=30\">Kion mango amino acids</a>. And I’ll sip it during my workout.</p>\n<p>+ When I get home I’ll have a protein shake with <a href=\"https://bit.ly/48xiQoA\">Thorne fiber</a>. The protein I like right now is <a href=\"http://paleovalley.com/skinny\">Paleo Valley</a> vanilla. I do 2 scoops for 26 grams of protein and 1 scoop of fiber which is equal to 10 grams.</p>\n<p>+ After that I’ll have 3 poached or scrambled <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3P27H86\">eggs</a> with a bit of <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3SZUVs7\">Primal Kitchen ketchup</a> and a slice of sourdough with <a href=\"https://bit.ly/49wWVir\">grassfed butter.</a> Katie has been <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/sourdough-for-beginners/\">making sourdough</a> for me, but I also <a href=\"https://www.idevaffiliate.com/33359/idevaffiliate.php?id=248\">love this one</a>.</p>\n<p>+ For lunch and/or dinner I have a big bowl of meat. I take Force of Nature <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3wztSMC\">ground beef</a> or <a href=\"https://bit.ly/42ZAO1W\">venison</a>. Cook it up and then top it with <a href=\"https://bit.ly/48zxWtq\">Yellowbird hot sauce</a>, raw cheese, and <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3wBVFft\">Siete chips</a>. For snacks, I like venison meat sticks by <a href=\"https://mauinuivenison.com/?gclid=CjwKCAiAx_GqBhBQEiwAlDNAZq887S-BqJr52yUksAddPOmvATB91VtKIQ1oYVvH-OU6DMeMjdTP_RoClc8QAvD_BwE\">Maui Nui</a>, but <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3uH2BaF\">Chomps</a> and <a href=\"https://bit.ly/42UQlQs\">Paleo Valley</a> have delicious clean ones too. I shared my <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/paleovalley-beef-stick-review/\">Paleovalley Beef Stick Review</a> here.</p>\n<p>+ In the afternoon I’ll have a protein matcha with <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3SWuIun\">almond milk</a>. <a href=\"https://www.gopjn.com/t/8-12762-307361-261816\">Kroma’s matcha</a> has 10 grams of protein and is ceremonial grade. Matcha is such a good coffee replacement if you’re looking to cut down on caffeine.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/what-i-eat-in-a-day/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>You may know by now that mouth taping has been the most life-changing practice in Lauryn’s life. It’s changed her entire face, increased her energy levels and brightened her eyes.</p>\n<p>The benefits speak for themselves, but let us remind you, consistency is key.</p>\n<p>Over the years Lauryn’s developed some tips and tricks, of course, and today we’re sharing them all with you to enhance your experience and maximize your results.</p>\n<h2>Lauryn’s Mouth Tape Tips: Maximize Your Results</h2>\n<h3>\n      <strong>LIFT YOUR FACE</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>As I’m applying <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/mouth-tape?selling_plan=4150198365\">mouth tape</a>, I pull my face up instead of down. It helps my tongue rest in a proper position and also lifts my entire face.</p>\n<h3>\n      <strong>REMOVE WITH MIST</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>When removing your mouth tape, use a mist to ensure it comes off gently and doesn’t pull at your skin. I love <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3B1xbOK\">Primally Pure’s Plumping Mist</a> or <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/ice-queen-face-oil?selling_plan=4027154525\">Depuffing Oil</a> to make it super easy.</p>\n<h3>\n      <strong>REUSE YOUR TIN</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>You can find mouth tape tins all over my house, in all my bags, in my bathroom and on my nightstand. I use them for lip gloss, prenatal vitamins, throat coat drops when I’m recording – for everything.</p>\n<h3>\n      <strong>WEAR YOUR RETAINER</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>If you use a retainer or mouth guard, you can still use them while you wear mouth tape. I wear my mouth guard every night and wake up feeling energized and refreshed.</p>\n<h3>\n      <strong>USE THE SLIT, OR DON’T</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>We designed mouth tape with optionality. You can use the slit if you like to sip water through the night, or pull it up over your top lip if you don’t need it.</p>\n<h3>Benefits of Mouth Taping:</h3>\n<p>Breathing through your nose can help you establish a stable breathing pattern, which can help you fall asleep faster, stay asleep longer, have a deeper sleep, AND wake up feeling more refreshed.</p>\n<p>All those little hairs in your nasal passages serve a purpose. And that purpose is to prevent the introduction of viruses, bacteria, &amp; other gross things into the body. Mouth breathing while sleeping makes it so much easier for these yucky things to enter the body. But, the good news is your nose was literally MADE to be one of the body’s first lines of defense from any &amp; all sickness.</p>\n<p>Mouth breathing at night is one of the most common causes of nasal congestion &amp; that annoying sound we call snoring. Not only can snoring disrupt your breathing pattern throughout the night, it can also really annoy your SO.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.sleepfoundation.org/snoring/mouth-taping-for-sleep\">Sleep Foundation</a>, mouth taping for sleep changes the angle of your palate &amp; tongue, and thus, mouth taping reduces snoring. No snoring = better sleep = better LIFE! (P.S. another super handy hack to prevent snoring is <a href=\"https://getcanopy.co/products/tsc-humidifier\"> The Skinny Confidential x Canopy Humidifier</a>.)</p>\n<p>Ok, guys. This one gets a little gross…but we’re gonna go there anyway. When you breathe through your mouth at night, it can cause dry mouth, bad breath, cavities, yellow teeth, gum disease, &amp; tooth decay. It can also introduce yucky bacteria &amp; viruses to your oral microbiome and long story short…it’s NOT GOOD for your <a href=\"https://www.colgate.com/en-us/oral-health/respiratory-conditions/mouth-taping-for-sleep\">oral health</a>. You will see an instant increase in oral health by mouth taping at night. For more on oral health you have to check out <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/how-to-heal-your-oral-microbiome/\">this post</a>, there are so many good tips.</p>\n<p>Sleep disorders &amp; major disruptions in breathing throughout the night can have some seriously negative health effects. These effects can include stroke, heart attack, high blood-pressure, &amp; other cardiovascular issues. Mouth taping will help you regulate your breathing, which will help prevent spikes in blood pressure &amp; adrenaline.</p>\n<p>Nitric oxide is produced in the nostrils of all humans. So, when we inhale through the nose, the nitric oxide goes all the way through the airways &amp; deep into the lungs. This promotes everything from relaxation to expansion of blood vessels to the destruction of some bacteria &amp; viruses.</p>\n<p>Have you tried mouth taping? What is the number one benefit you noticed and how long did it take to see it?</p>\n<p>x, Lauryn and The Skinny Confidential team</p>\n<p>+ <i>Give yourself a  total mouth makeover.</i></p>\n<p>++ <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/mouth-taping-tips-for-beginners/\">Mouth Taping tips</a> for beginners.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/lauryns-mouth-tape-tips-maximize-your-results/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Summer is here and with it comes the opportunity to get outside, enjoy the hot weather, and even do some traveling. It’s SO good for you to spend time outside and ground yourself in nature. And, summer is the perfect time to do just that.</p>\n<p>But, summer has its drawbacks, of course. The intense heat is no joke. Plus, the hot weather can also cause you to develop swollen feet and ankles. We’d rather pass on that aspect.</p>\n<p>That’s why today, we’re sharing a guide on how to stop feet from swelling in hot weather. There are lots of things we want to do this summer, so there’s no time for swollen feet. Today, we’re going to talk about why it happens and how to prevent it.</p>\n<h2>How To Stop Feet Swelling In Hot Weather</h2>\n<p>We’re here to help you out if you suffer from ankle and foot swelling in the summer months. First, we’ll dive into what causes the swelling in warm weather so that we can better understand what’s going on how to stop it. Then, we’ll get into our tips and tricks for stopping the swell!</p>\n<h3>Is It Normal For Feet To Swell In Hot Weather?</h3>\n<p>Yes, it’s totally normal for feet to swell in hot weather. Of course, if it’s happening all the time, you should definitely talk to your doctor. Some swelling is normal, while other swelling can come from health conditions that affect blood circulation, like venous insufficiency or kidney disease. In some cases, swelling especially if it’s sudden, painful, or only in one leg can be a sign of a blood clot, which requires prompt medical attention.</p>\n<p>But, in general, it’s actually not surprising at all that feet swell in the heat, as it can be caused by our bodies’ cooling mechanisms. Let’s dive into what that looks like.</p>\n<h3>What Causes Feet To Swell In Hot Weather</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thefeetpeople.com.au/learning-hub/why-do-my-feet-swell-in-the-heat/#:~:text=Unfortunately%2C%20this%20expansion%20can%20also,baths%2C%20can%20worsen%20the%20swelling.\">When your body needs to cool off, it naturally expands your blood vessels</a> (aka <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557562/\">vasodilation</a>). The reason this works is that the blood vessels then allow more blood to flow closely to the skin, helping the heat transfer out of your body. </p>\n<p>This mechanism can cause more fluid to leak into the surrounding tissues. But why does it end up in your feet and ankles?</p>\n<p>Gravity is what pulls the fluid down to your feet and ankles. You’ll find that this is even worse when you’ve spent a long time sitting or standing. In hot weather, the way your body moves fluid back up to your heart slows down. This is when feet tend to swell.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320603#definition\">Dehydration can alert your body to retain fluid because it’s expecting a period of drought, with little to no water</a>. This will cause more fluid buildup in your tissues. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://myhealth.alberta.ca/Health/pages/conditions.aspx?hwid=not245134&amp;lang=en-ca#:~:text=The%20balance%20of%20salt%20in,conditions%20that%20affect%20their%20circulation.\">Increased salt levels can cause the body to hold onto more fluid</a>, which will be drawn by gravity towards your feet.</p>\n<h3>How To Stop Feet From Swelling In Hot Weather</h3>\n<p>By now, you’ve gotta know how important it is to stay hydrated. Even though it may seem contradictory, increasing your water intake actually helps reduce fluid retention.</p>\n<p>Lauryn is all about upgrading your water so that it boosts your hydration levels even more. You can do this so efficiently with <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/beauty-salt\">Beauty Salt</a>. It’s a quick scoop of powder to add to your water, and it hydrates you from inside out (with beauty benefits). </p>\n<p>Long periods of sitting or standing can be a serious contributor to feet, ankle, and leg swelling. Just think about it like this: when you move, you’re helping your heart pump blood and fluid through your system more efficiently. This can reduce the buildup of fluid occurring at your feet.</p>\n<p>If you’ve been dealing with a lot of swelling, you may need to look at the amount of salt in your diet. The right salt level is different for everyone, and too much can cause your body to retain water, making swelling worse. So, if you’ve been having a lot of salty snacks, try minimizing your salt intake and see if that helps.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/how-to-stop-feet-swelling-in-hot-weather/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I've regretted not standing up to her ever since.</h3>\n    <p><i>Last week, over at Narratively Academy, we</i> <i>hosted a live video chat between two literary legends, Lee Gutkind and Dinty W. Moore, breaking down what (the heck) a flash essay is ( check it out here if you missed it). Following the insightful and inspiring talk, we ran a special flash essay contest with the assignment to write about a moment you regret. We got so many great submissions that, as always, it was hard to choose a winner. But one, from writer Jen Shepherd, really stood out, and we’re pleased to share that piece with you today.</i> </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>We hope you love it as much as we do!</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>“Now that he’s become unresponsive, it won’t be long. Maybe 24 hours,” the hospice nurse explained. I expected to be by his side when he died. We’d spent our entire lives knowing each other. He was there when I was 16 after the head-on collision resulted in that nasty concussion. I was there for him after he burned both hands making homemade fudge, his favorite Christmas tradition. When I had chicken pox, didn’t make the volleyball team, and had my heart broken more than once, it was his shoulder I cried on. When he had no one else to lean on, the world went dark and he turned to the bottle or the drugs, it was my turn to listen.</p>\n    <p>My first marriage was a fail. His second marriage was a fail, although none of us would say it out loud. My relationship with my father was unique. Our closeness had always been envied by my friends, by most people really. It was not, however, envied by Wife Number Two. I sensed she disliked me from the start, that she was jealous. But this was never discussed in our family, though it was always the elephant in the room. The poor man was stuck in the middle, forever navigating the icy waters between the two of us. “Why can’t everyone just love each other?” he’d ask. But I couldn’t love someone who pulled him away from me. Who went out of her way to keep him all to herself like a special secret.</p>\n    <p>I wanted to stay at the house. I wanted to sleep on the couch, on a chair, on the floor, in my car. As long as I could be there. Holding his hand. Watching him take that last precious breath of life. But she said no. And I didn’t argue. I didn’t stand up for myself. I let her call the shots. I was weak. Scared. She scared me with her large stature, head of frizzy gray hair and those dark brown eyes forever boring into mine. “No,” she said. So I kissed him goodbye and walked out the front door. In the driveway, I glanced up at his bedroom window, glowing yellow from a single pale bulb. I knew in my heart I was making a mistake. I should have stomped right up those concrete stairs, threw open that damn door and announced without hesitation, “I’m back and I’m staying. And I don’t give a damn what you think.”</p>\n    <p>But I missed it. He died the next morning, just as the pink-tangerine sun streaked across the bay. I was walking the dogs along the shore. It was 7 a.m. I knew the moment it happened. I felt the energy surge from my feet through my head like a weird out-of-body experience. I should have been there.</p>\n    <p>I should have been there.</p>\n    <p>But I wasn’t.</p>\n    <p><strong>Jen Shepherd</strong> is a lifelong photographer and writer.

She was shortlisted for Fractured Lit’s 2025 Anthology Prize and was awarded sixth place in the 2024 Writer’s Digest Personal Essay Awards.

    "body": "<h3>Sixteen years after going to prison, Kwaneta Harris tells her 13-year-old self everything she wished she knew sooner.</h3>\n<p>Dear Kwaneta,</p>\n<p>Growing up, attending an all-white Catholic school with two other Black girls, Brooke and Amy, makes you really hate having your name. But guess what? You won’t always. You, Ms. People Pleaser, will demand your name not be shortened or mispronounced. How can I be so sure? I’m you, at 52.</p>\n<p>You don’t believe me? Of course not. You stopped believing everything and everyone at age 12. Now, you’re 13 and addicted to sexual self-destruction. You’re still suspicious? Allow me to convince you with our deepest secret: At age 12, you were kidnapped and gang-raped for three days.</p>\n<p>This was 1984, and the police refused to search for a Black girl. So, the community did. Your family, friends, church and the neighborhood organized search teams and canvassed door to door, checking garbage dumpsters, abandoned houses and cars. Finally, they rescued you.</p>\n<p>Mom was almost arrested after the Catholic hospital nurses implied that because of the assault and subsequent S.T.D.s, you were promiscuous. They wanted to perform surgery, but Mom didn’t trust them to cut your toenails, let alone your body parts. You just went home.</p>\n<p>That first night, you overheard your Southern Baptist grandfather and great-uncle despairing: “When they found her, she ain’t look like she was even trying to get away. Probably was her boyfriend...runaway. If she start actin’ like her crazy daddy, she going to a home.”</p>\n<p>After hearing that, you spent every day pretending. Pretending to be normal. You laughed and joked. You studied your peers to mimic their behavior. In 1984, nobody understood the trauma of childhood sexual violence. That you don’t just “get over it.” This is how trauma works: Every new encounter or event is always contaminated by the past.</p>\n<p>You wore your Sunday best and carried your scrapbook stuffed with honor awards and report cards. You were walking stiff, still recovering from the surgeries. Mom made you take a second shower with instructions not to apply Jean Naté perfumed talc after. She combed your hair in two braids, removed the nail polish and wiped off the Bonne Bell lip gloss. All this for an appointment with police detectives. Granny kept saying to show them your grades. You were afraid of those two burly detectives grilling you, under the pretense of playing devil’s advocate, about boy crushes, menstruation and sex. You never actually opened the scrapbook. Because of those bullies, you end up carrying a lifetime of distrust for law enforcement.</p>\n<p>In school, everybody knew about the assault. But your nonchalance gave them — and law enforcement — permission to see you as the trope of the “hypersexual Black girl.” You played into the myth.</p>\n<p>In gym class, boys you’d played floor hockey and soccer with since third grade pulled you into the sports equipment closet to grope you…and more. The girls called you a slut, but the boys called you cool. The only people willing to hang out with you were the boys who never asked, just took — sharing you with older brothers while coaches looked the other way.</p>\n<p>Eventually, you will learn about adultification of Black girls and the high standards to be deemed a credible “victim.” Still replaying that scene with detectives and regretting not opening your scrapbook? Girl, let that go. It wouldn’t have made a difference.</p>\n<p>The heavy mask and shame you carry from those early years will push you to remain in two abusive marriages longer than you should, believing that if you were quieter and more obedient, these men would change. If you could just stop provoking them. Listen, you can only change yourself. Forget what you learned in Catholic Mass and Baptist Sunday School about women’s roles — your value isn’t determined by a man. All the years of playing pretend will catch up with you, and the next time a man harms you, you will finally stick up for yourself. This act of self-preservation will lead you to prison.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/letter-to-my-teenage-self-saved-power-words\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In April 2025, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/22/nx-s1-5340753/trump-democracy-authoritarianism-competive-survey-political-scientist\"> NPR reported</a> that in a survey of over 500 political scientists, the majority believed that the United States was moving from a liberal democracy toward authoritarianism. And that was before June, when regular Americans took to the streets in record numbers to oppose it. Over </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-parade-turnout-protest-no-kings-millions-1235365602/\">5 million turned out</a>to support the “</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1020681/photos-capture-millions-marching-in-epic-no-kings-protests/\">No Kings</a>” marches across the country on June 14 to protest Trump’s policies and a “military parade” on his birthday, budgeted at</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://au.news.yahoo.com/army-reveals-scale-damage-done-130929092.html\">$45 million</a>. But where can we turn to for resistance strategies? Might the historical rise of authoritarianism in the ancient world help us understand its rapid expansion today? A freely downloadable book by top ancient historians across the globe,</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783111705446/html\">(De Gruyter, 2025),</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>argues that it can.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>In the new anthology, edited by Frederik Juliaan Vervaet, David Rafferty, and Christopher J. Dart, the authors collectively claim that readers can use Ancient Roman history to make sense of the rapid descent into fascism in the United States. A key reason for choosing Rome as a parallel to America is the extraordinary nature of the moment we are living in.</p>\n<p>“Before now, no long-established democracy has fallen to internal causes except Rome,” the editors told <i>Hyperallergic</i> in a statement. “Several of the old, consolidated democracies around the world are in trouble, and political science has only recently started to confront that as a problem; they are used to thinking of consolidated democracies as pretty safe.” </p>\n<p>The book treats the late Roman Republic as a dataset. Although the editors noted that Rome did not have the same scope in terms of policing, healthcare, or inflation controls, they explained that democratic decay or creeping authoritarianism is primarily about “interactions of political institutions, about the relative power of the different parts of the state.” While comparisons between Rome and America are nothing new, <i>How Republics Die </i>analyzes these empires’ parallel lives to underscore the consistent methods used by autocrats to shift societies away from dissent, democracy, or independent thinking, toward a triumphalist narrative of the past that culminates in their own ascent. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.walksinrome.com/blog/maps-and-mussolini-via-dei-fori-imperiali-rome\">four large maps</a>that showed Rome’s ascent and empire from 753 BCE to 117 CE, along with a new map of Italy’s future conquest of Africa in 1936, which had to be removed because the campaign was a failure. This image is from 1935. (image public domain via the</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/maps/2022/03/out-and-about-in-a-provincial-empire-of-fascism/\">Library of Congress</a>)</p>\n<p>Although the United States became a “<a href=\"https://www.colonialwilliamsburg.org/discover/civics/was-the-united-states-founded-as-a-republic-or-a-democracy/\">mixed government</a>” predicated on republican and democratic models of governance, Rome adopted a republican model in 509 BCE. This came in the wake of the overthrow of the city’s last king. Four centuries after Rome’s Republic began, the underpinnings of the state and the explicit policies that limited the power of ambitious politicians began to erode rapidly. The book looks particularly at this period from the end of the Roman Republic to the rise of the Augustan New Order (133 BCE to 14 CE) — a time when Rome began to transition from an electoral republic to a military monarchy. Vervaet, Rafferty, and Dart told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that the decades marking Rome’s shift from a republic into an autocracy were heavily influenced by the arts. They also suggest how we might cross-compare Ancient Rome and America with other moments of rising authoritarianism around the world, such as in India and Belarus.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037152/an-ancient-roman-guide-to-donald-trump-authoritarian-playbook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>OTTAWA — I first encountered multidisciplinary artist Skawennati in person at her December 2019 talk at the former McLuhan Centre for Communication and Technology in Toronto. I recall that the artist wore Barbie-doll pink; I later learned that she is a Barbie fan.</p>\n<p>At the talk, Skawennati introduced herself as both an urban Kanien’kehá:ka (Mohawk) woman and a cyberpunk avatar. She discussed her longtime practice of costuming avatars in cyberspace as a means of realizing Indigenous peoples’ self-determination. This work takes place on a thriving, futuristic island built and maintained by the research-creation studio, Aboriginal Territories in Cyberspace (AbTeC), in the virtual world, Second Life. Later, she shared work-in-progress documentation for the project <i>Calico &amp; Camouflage</i> (2020–22), a fashion line of Turtle Island “resistance wear” — her interpretation of traditional ribbon shirts and combat pants as Kanien’kehá:ka protest gear — for both avatars and IRL models. </p>\n<p>At the time, I was taken by Skawennati’s commitment to working within a massive multiplayer virtual world that was, in my view, a ghost town. She was adamant that if the platform were to “sunset,” she would stop making her avatars: “In the end, I know it’s not mine,” she shared with me in a 2020 interview for <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-in-america/features/skawennati-abtec-island-indigenous-community-second-life-1202693110/\">an  Art in America profile</a>. The Montreal-based artist utilizes these characters, as well as settings and backdrops she has built and designed in AbTeC, for her machinimas and machinimagraphs — films and photography produced within virtual worlds. “That’s why I take lots of pictures, lots of documentation. As long as you know you’re not actually in control, you have a lot of control.” </p>\n<p><i>Skawennati: Welcome to the Dreahouse</i>at the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa. Foreground: the diptych “Dancing with Myself” (2015); background: “Birth of an Avatar (Homage to Mariko Mori)” (2017)</p>\n<p>Yet, as her current National Gallery of Canada (NGC) mid-career survey <i> Skawennati: Welcome to the Dreamhouse</i> proves, the trajectory of the past 25 years of her work lies not only in these machinimas and machinimagraphs, but also in her burgeoning work with fashion. The </p>\n<p><i>Calico &amp; Camouflage</i>collection was part of a turn in her understanding of the virtual as increasingly hybrid performative experiences involving garment-based sculptures and textiles. Within the NGC exhibition catalog, contributors Cheryl Sim and Mojeanne Sarah Behzadi make the case for how formative Skawennati’s engagement with fashion has been to her work overall. As exhibition curator Wahsontiio Cross, of the NGC, writes in the accompanying catalog, her creation of fashion and textiles has resulted in the artist finally “bring[ing] her idea of the future into the present.”</p>\n<p>The exhibition design for <i>Welcome to the Dreamhouse</i>, in which each room is perfectly structured for its intended purpose, is reminiscent of the Barbie Dreamhouse, aligning Skawennati’s multidisciplinary works with open-ended play. However, the artist clarified in conversation with <i>Hyperallergic</i> that she and Cross were drawn toward the “dreamhouse” concept for its aspirational potential. “A dreamhouse feels attainable. It might take work, but people think they can achieve it. I wanted to say with this show, this concept, this title, that a peaceful and just future is attainable.”</p>\n<p>Among the longstanding themes that carry through the show, a core motif is Indigenous futurism, wherein the pain of the colonial past is worked through a “future imaginary.” The term, coined by Skawennati’s partner and frequent collaborator, Jason Edward Lewis, reclaims historical narratives and centers Indigenous peoples in “exploring new cultural configurations that will enable us not just to survive, but thrive.”</p>\n<p>Across different galleries, visitors encounter new and old characters from the artist’s moving and still image works. Many involve Indigenous sci-fi retellings of Hotinonshón:ni cosmology and histories, ranging from the creation story told in “She Falls For Ages” (2017) to the ancestral narrative of the Iroquois confederation, updated to the year 3025, in “The Peacemaker Returns” (2017).</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036805/skawennati-cyberpunk-future-is-now-national-gallery-canada/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

According to Joslin, Temporary Deputy Superintendent Ray McPadden of the National Park Service (NPS) told them that they had “[failed] to demonstrate acceptable conduct” after they hung the Trans Pride flag on the face of the granite monolith El Capitan.</p>\n    <p>“The messages my termination send out to the public is that if you have an identity that has been turned into a ‘ideology’ not in line with the current administration, your rights will be different than other Americans that fall into the ‘ideal standard’ for who and what a person should be, look like, and believe in,” Joslin told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. </p>\n    <p>An NPS spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic </i>in a statement that the agency is “pursuing administrative action against multiple employees for failing to follow National Park Service regulations.” They declined to comment on the specifics of Joslin’s case.</p>\n    <p>“We want to emphasize that we take the protection of the park’s resources and the experience of our visitors very seriously, and will not tolerate violations of laws and regulations that impact those resources and experiences,” the spokesperson said, alleging that “several unauthorized demonstrations involving El Capitan” last year had drawn complaints from visitors.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/sj-with-flag-1-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Joslin stated that they displayed the flag for about two hours on May 20 during their off-duty hours, and noted that Yosemite regulations did not ban the hanging of flags at the time. The following day, however, the NPS appears to have updated the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/management/upload/yose-compendium.pdf\">park’s rules</a> to prohibit the display of “any banner, flag, or sign larger than fifteen square feet” on any natural or cultural features without a permit, citing the need to “provide for an unimpaired visitor experience” and “protect natural and cultural resources.”</p>\n    <p>While the new version of the compendium with the ban is dated May 20, the signature from the park’s acting superintendent, Raymond McPadden, is dated May 21, 2025. Previous versions of the compendium, accessed by <i>Hyperallergic</i> via the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250227002244/https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/management/upload/yose-compendium.pdf\">Wayback Machine,</a> did not mention flags or banners. </p>\n    <p>Hanging flags on the famous vertical wall of El Capitan is a tradition that many climbers have long participated in. In February, park employees <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/us/yosemite-upside-down-flag-protest.html\">flew an inverted United States flag over the side of the monolith’s cliff</a> to protest the Trump administration’s cuts to the National Park Service. Last June, climbers hung a banner that read “Stop the Genocide” to decry the US-backed Israeli military’s assault on Palestine.</p>\n    <p>The NPS’s termination of Joslin’s employment comes amid the Trump administration’s ongoing attacks on LGBTQ+ rights and visibility. In February, the national parks agency <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/990547/trans-rights-groups-protest-scrubbed-stonewall-monument-website/\">expunged all references to trans and queer people</a> from its website describing the 1969 Stonewall Rebellion. The erasure then <a href=\"https://www.them.us/story/stonewall-bisexuals\">extended to mentions of bisexual people</a> in May.</p>\n    <p>“In my celebration of identity and acceptance, I’ve been disparaged and deemed unacceptable,” Joslin told <i>Hyperallergic.</i> “It’s a tragic juxtaposition of how to treat human beings.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036200/us-parks-agency-fires-ranger-who-displayed-trans-pride-flag-yosemite/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Colorado, the suit claimed that the town had violated the artist’s constitutional right to free speech. </p>\n    <p>In last week’s settlement, Vail agreed to several concessions, including funding an art program “for underrepresented and economically disadvantaged people” and hosting a powwow led by SeeWalker every year for the next five years.</p>\n    <p>“The intention is to allow other underrepresented artists, including Native American people, to have the opportunity of creating art in the town of Vail in place of my own missed opportunity,” SeeWalker said in a statement.</p>\n    <p>The settlement also included Vail’s commitment to sponsor a “community forum” on Israel and Palestine that would include interfaith leaders and host an annual Indigenous-led cultural sensitivity training for employees of the municipality’s Arts and Public Places Department.</p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for the town of Vail did not respond to <i>Hyperallergic</i>‘s<i> </i>inquiries about when or how it would implement the terms of the settlement.

Months later, however, the town of Vail rescinded the opportunity after she posted an image of a pro-Palestine artwork on her Instagram that she said was unrelated to her public commission. In a public <a href=\"https://www.vail.gov/Home/Components/News/News/1509/15\">statement</a>, the town said it removed SeeWalker from the project because it would “not use public funds to support any position on a polarizing geopolitical issue.” </p>\n    <p>The painting “G for Genocide,” however, was created on SeeWalker’s own time and had not been submitted as her design for the public mural. She told <i>Hyperallergic </i>in an earlier <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/959839/aclu-sues-colorado-town-over-cancellation-of-native-artists-residency/\">interview</a> that she created the work after observing common threads between Israel’s assault on Gaza and the history of Native Americans in the United States. The artwork was included in a December 2024 <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/972948/things-not-seen/\">collaboration</a> between <i>Hyperallergic</i> and <i>Jewish Currents </i>that highlighted artists who had been silenced or censored over their support of Palestine. </p>\n    <p>SeeWalker told <i>Hyperallergic </i>that settling with Vail was advantageous in that it allowed her to secure programming that other artists can benefit from, whereas a trial might only have yielded a financial result, if any. She said the settlement could have included additional terms she bargained for, but she intended to maximize community benefit over her own grievances.</p>\n    <p>“Even if one other person is impacted in a good way, that is enough for me,” SeeWalker said. “My dad once told me, ‘Danielle, if you don’t speak up, no one will do it for you.’ I carry that with me everywhere I go.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036790/colorado-town-settles-with-native-artist-danielle-seewalker-who-brought-free-speech-lawsuit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The work consisted of 45 interconnected blow-up forms with flashing strobes and a continuous soundscape created from real audio of warfare in Ukraine.</p>\n    <p>General producer Vitaliy Deynega wrote on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=25215304464725556&amp;set=a.578137725535572\">Facebook</a> that although the installation was intended to withstand such weather conditions, it was torn apart in less than 15 minutes. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/black-cloud-install-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/black-cloud-byebye-1200x800.png?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>“It was a feeling I experienced only once before — in February 2022, when I woke up to explosions and sirens,” Deynega said in a statement shared with <i>Hyperallergic</i>.</p>\n    <p>The powerful dust storm, accompanied by 50 mph winds, has <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/dust-storms-heat-thunder-burning-man-attendees-face-wild-weather-rcna226971\">reportedly</a> resulted in at least four minor injuries at Burning Man so far. It comes two years after torrential rainfall transformed the desert cultural festival into an <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/843424/searing-memes-about-burning-mans-muddy-fiasco/\">enormous mud pit</a> that stranded over 70,000 festival attendees in the temporary encampment. <i>Hyperallergic</i> has contacted Burning Man for comment.</p>\n    <p>Despite the damage, the team behind “Black Cloud” has confirmed that the installation is slated to be rebuilt for a European tour. Dates and locations have not yet been announced.</p>\n    <p>“Black Cloud” wasn’t the first Burning Man artwork to draw attention to the horrors of Russia’s war on Ukraine. At last year’s festival, Deynega and other Ukrainian artists <a href=\"https://imfine.ukraine.ua/\">unveiled</a> “I’m Fine,” a more than 2,000-pound sculpture made of street signs from across the nation that were damaged by bullets and shrapnel. </p>\n    <p>Since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion more than three years ago, the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has <a href=\"https://ukraine.un.org/en/299761-number-civilians-killed-and-injured-ukraine-reaches-three-year-monthly-high-july-2025-un\">documented</a> 13,883 civilian deaths, including 726 children. Donald Trump’s recent meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have yet to yield a ceasefire or peace deal.</p>\n    <p>“Perhaps this storm has taken the threat with it,” said the “Black Cloud” building team in a statement. “A quiet hope on Ukraine’s Independence Day … drifting away on the desert winds.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036943/dust-storm-blows-away-ukrainian-artwork-at-burning-man/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>I met someone mid-flight and we immediately hit it off. Rather than try to keep in touch, we imagined what our lives would have been like if we were together. It was almost as good.</h3>\n<p><i>We’ve been publishing  the winners of our True Romance Writing Prize collaboration with Belletrist and actress Emma Roberts these past few weeks. So far, we’ve shared the grand prize–winning essay in the shortread category, by Maggie Hart, and the longform winning story, by Olivia Shaffett. We’re elated to be bringing you the first shortread finalist this week, a banger of a piece from Katharine Coldiron. This is what Katharine had to say about how the piece came together: “This was the first piece I’d written on a prompt in years. I read the call for entries and thought immediately of this tale. I worked it through in the shower and put it down in a rush. I polished it a little, et voila.” A great reminder to follow a spark and go for it!</i> </p>\n<p>I was 19 or 20, a smoker, on a plane from New England to New Orleans. Next to me sat a man, around 19 or 20, a smoker. We looked at each other and liked what we saw; we talked to each other and liked what we heard; we, simply, hit it off.</p>\n<p>And not as friends. In that way that enlivens your whole body. Chemistry, pheromones, attraction. Whatever you call that, when the person is someone whose skin you badly want to touch from the first moments of meeting them.</p>\n<p>As we talked, we realized there was no way we’d ever meet again. I was visiting my mother for the summer in a place I would never live permanently. He was laying over in New Orleans on the way back to Wyoming or Oklahoma or North Texas, I don’t remember. I don’t even remember his name. I know he came from a place I’d never been and seemed unlikely to visit: a landlocked place. All my experiences had been coastal, due to my Navy father — I never lived anywhere you couldn’t park a 40,000-ton ship near.</p>\n<p>We told the truth. We made each other laugh.</p>\n<p>There was no social media then, and we both had precisely the quantity of life experience that advised us not to persist or pursue this connection. A little less and our romantic sides would have tried to build faith in a long-distance something; a little more and we would have recognized that such an instant, holistic connection is too rare to waste.</p>\n<p>Instead, we had the plane ride, and that was all.</p>\n<p>How will I remember you? I asked, or something less obvious that posed the same question.</p>\n<p>He dug in his pocket. I just bought this, he said. It was a rectangular Bic lighter with a picture of a cowboy on it, either at dusk or sunrise.</p>\n<p>I unzipped the front pocket of my backpack and pulled out an oval Bic lighter. It was a paisley design with a lot of purple in it. I’d chosen it because it was eye-catching and pretty without any pink.</p>\n<p>We traded.</p>\n<p>As we taxied, he said to me, I wish I could kiss you.</p>\n<p>Silence for a minute.</p>\n<p>Let’s pretend to be together, I said. As we’re getting off the plane, let’s pretend that we’re boyfriend and girlfriend. We’ll hold hands and talk about where to go for dinner. Then you’ll go to your gate and I’ll go to baggage claim.</p>\n<p>Yeah, he said.</p>\n<p>And you could kiss me then, I said. But not, like, really dramatically, like in the movies. Just like you do it all the time.</p>\n<p>He nodded.</p>\n<p>That was right. That was the right thing.</p>\n<p>I tried not to be sad.</p>\n<p>I still have that lighter. I find it in boxes of old stuff I go through from time to time, trying to discard what I no longer need. It’s been 15 years since I smoked, but I will not throw away that lighter.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/well-always-have-the-plane-ride\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He’s a husky guy, with sand-colored hair, who can down beer after beer without losing his faculties, a practice that gives him cred with this crowd.

After announcing the winners a few weeks ago, we’re excited to finally share the first piece of the bunch, the grand prize–winning essay in the shortread category, which comes to us from Maggie Hart. Maggie opened up a bit about writing this piece and others like it: “After I completed my chemo treatments, I felt awkward and ugly in my baldness, convinced I’d never be able to exist normally again, much less date. But finding small moments of humor and lightness helped me get through. I think lots of people view serious illness as something that only happens later in life, which just isn’t true — so I like sharing my stories about navigating the weirdness of cancer survival and young adulthood all at once.” Congratulations again, Maggie! And readers — you’re in for a treat. </i>\n    </p>\n<p>“I’m sorry,” I said to Nick, who stood staring at me in the dim light, his bare chest rising and falling with quickened breaths, his lips swollen from my kissing them. “It’s just that…well, I’ve been really racking my brain here, and I just don’t think there’s a sexy way to do this.”</p>\n<p>My fingers lingered at my forehead, on my hairline. My wig gripped my scalp like a barnacle on a boat, the scratchy fibers relentlessly digging into my skin, one of many small, manageable pains I had in those days. It had to come off for what was about to happen, I knew that. There was really no way around it. Leaving it on was impossible — I had a profoundly humbling vision of the wig abandoning ship mid-action, slipping loose and tumbling onto the floor in a sad, sweaty heap. It had also been quite an investment — although I still do not understand why a bunch of fake hair costs multiple hundreds of dollars — so I didn’t want it to get hopelessly matted. And what if, in the throes of passion, he forgot that the hair was fake and tried to <i>pull it</i>…</p>\n<p>No. No! Obviously, it had to come off. But <i>how, </i>exactly? I wished he’d look away, spare me, if only partially, from the humiliation of my baldification, the world’s least seductive strip tease.</p>\n<p>Nick smiled at me encouragingly. He was kind and tattooed and had long dark hair that was beginning to streak with gray. I’d never been with a man who had hair longer than mine, although, that winter, any man with any hair at all had hair longer than mine.</p>\n<p>Four months after my last round of chemotherapy, I decided that it was time I put myself out there, that I date. Why not? The chemo had, miraculously, worked. My blood counts were relatively normal, I hadn’t needed a platelet transfusion in weeks and my oncologists gave me the all-clear, so it was time that I shifted my attention away from my no-longer-imminent death to something much more invigorating: the pursuit of reassurance. I needed to know that my body worked, that I still knew how to have a conversation that was not about being sick, that this whole cancer thing had not rendered me sexless and unlovable at just 25 years old. So, I went where every woman in her 20s goes when she needs reassurance: the apps.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/unexpected-challenges-dating-cancer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
