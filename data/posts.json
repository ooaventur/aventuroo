Together, these trends demonstrate a broader confusion and lack of engagement from the mass market. </p><p>This trend fundamentally means that users will most likely “play it safe” with Web2 applications rather than risk experimenting on Web3. It’s this barrier that slows Web3 adoption. Innovators cannot rely solely on the benefits of Web3 but instead must engage with the existing infrastructure if they hope to draw in a wider audience. </p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/heres-how-hybrid-blockchain-solutions-bridge-the-gap-between-web2-and-web3?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" title=\"null\"><em><strong>Here’s how hybrid blockchain solutions bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3</strong></em></a></p><h2>The Web3 scaffold </h2><p>Collaboration between Web2 and Web3 is already happening, primarily driven by Web2 providers. In finance, giants like PayPal, Visa and major banks are integrating crypto and blockchain services, legitimizing them for the mass market. Beyond finance, Amazon Web Services has launched Web3 labs, and Google Cloud is working with zero-knowledge proofs, weaving Web3 into traditional offerings.</p><p>While Web2 applications are pushing for a middle ground, Web3 developers can and should be doing the same, leveraging Web2’s established market to scale faster. Just as 4G supported the rollout of 5G, Web2 processes can help build better Web3 apps.</p><h2>Looking at this in practice</h2><p>Web3 developers can balance decentralization with the convenience users expect from Web2 by prioritizing accessibility, from sleek UX to human-readable names. They should also recognize how their products could benefit Web2 organizations. </p><p>Too often, Web3 enthusiasts assume their approach’s superiority is obvious, avoiding the work of explaining why it is better. This risks alienating users instead of winning them over. Demonstrating practical advantages through engagement with Web2 offerings can help bridge the gap between both sectors.</p><p>A clear example is the synergy between AI and blockchain. If every piece of data used to train an AI model were immutably tracked on blockchain, whether original or frontier data, its origin, usage and outcomes could be verified instantly, eliminating such disputes. </p><p>Fundamentally, a good idea will deliver whether it is a Web3 application or not. </p><p>Demonstrating this value — even if it means engaging with Web2 sectors — will enhance the legitimacy of the tool and gain greater attention from the mass market.</p><h2>Engaging to innovate</h2><p>While it may feel uncomfortable to lean into Web2 to establish a greater trust in a Web3 tool, the benefits are undeniable. Bringing any form of technology to the mass market can generate a range of issues, including day-one bugs or scaling challenges. Research from Nielsen shows that usability testing with real-world users can improve a product’s success rate by up to <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://blogs.psico-smart.com/blog-what-role-does-user-feedback-play-in-improving-training-and-development-management-software-123637\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"null\">500%</a>. In this way, getting Web2 users to dip their toes into Web3 applications will mean a greater end product.</p><p>Debates over “Web2 vs. Web3” may grab attention, but successful companies rarely define themselves by the label. They are AI firms, financial institutions, consumer platforms and data companies, using whatever tools best serve their market. No customer wakes up wanting to use “a Web3 app”; they want better banking, smarter AI or more useful platforms. </p><p>The winners will be those quietly using Web3 to solve real problems, not chasing purity points.</p><p>Working with Web2 expands the user base, creating more opportunities to test, iterate and improve. Web3’s passionate community has yet to reach mass-market appeal, and achieving that means embracing Web2 processes, habits and infrastructure that have shaped technology adoption for decades.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Richard Johnson, chief operating officer of Data Guardians Network.</strong></em></p><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\" type=\"\">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The fund targets Bitcoin- and Ethereum-based corporate treasuries and will actively deploy capital across onchain infrastructure, custody and ecosystem services.</p><p>The fund is designed to serve institutions and corporations seeking operational use of digital assets. “Not only holding them but also benefiting from the growth of the underlying infrastructure,” he said. </p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/explained/bitcoin-as-corporate-treasury-why-meta-amazon-and-microsoft-all-said-no\" title=\"null\"><em><strong>Bitcoin as corporate treasury: Why Meta, Amazon and Microsoft all said no</strong></em></a></p><h2>DATs vs. ETFs: different tools, different goals</h2><p>Chao drew a distinction between DATs and ETFs, saying “we don’t see them as competitors so much as complementary vehicles.” ETFs offer simple exposure for mainstream investors, while DATs are built for treasuries that want to embed crypto into long-term operations.</p><p>According to SoSoValue <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://sosovalue.com/assets/etf/us-btc-spot?tid=soso-sm-cnmedia-Wu_news\" title=\"null\">data</a>, spot Bitcoin ETFs hold a combined $152.31 billion in assets, representing 6.63% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. In contrast, public companies hold 1,111,225 Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price\">BTC</a>) on their balance sheets, worth $128 billion, <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://bitcointreasuries.net/\" title=\"null\">according</a> to BitcoinTreasuries.NET.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-09/01996729-f799-7f92-a13e-2ac695f59945\" title=\"\"><figcaption><em>All entities holding Bitcoin. Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET</em></figcaption></figure><p>Many corporate treasuries, Chao noted, have been burned by rigid fund structures or extreme volatility. HashKey’s DAT vehicle supports regular subscriptions and redemptions and includes exposure to both BTC and ETH to reduce concentration risk.</p><p>“Treasuries that have entered crypto have long struggled with two issues: liquidity and operations,” Chao said. “Our DAT fund was built to solve these pain points.”</p><p>HashKey plans to deploy capital across the Bitcoin and Ethereum (<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\">ETH</a>) ecosystems, which Chao described as the dual anchors of liquidity and innovation in today’s crypto landscape. Priority sectors include custody, payments, staking services, and regulated stablecoin infrastructure.</p><p>The fund’s scope is international. While it launched in Hong Kong, Chao confirmed HashKey is also targeting the US, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia and the UK, noting that “the investment thesis of the fund is global from day one.”</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/institutional-demand-crypto-treasuries-sec-reforms-finance-redefined\" title=\"null\"><em><strong>Institutional demand grows with new crypto treasuries and SEC reforms: Finance Redefined</strong></em></a></p><h2>Misconceptions are barriers, says Chao</h2><p>Chao also addressed skepticism from traditional finance.

The indicator shared by Glassnode is the “Long/Short Bias,” which measures the net amount of positions that large traders have currently opened.</p>\n    <p>When the value of this indicator is positive, it means the long positions outnumber the short ones. Such a trend implies the majority of the traders hold a bullish sentiment. On the other hand, the metric being under the zero mark implies more BTC positions are betting on a bearish outcome for the cryptocurrency.</p>\n    <p>Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Long/Short Bias over the past month:</p>\n    <blockquote>The value of the metric appears to have been negative in recent weeks | Source:<a href=\"\">Glassnode on X</a></blockquote>\n    <p>As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Long/Short Bias has been negative for a while now, suggesting short positions have been the more dominant side of the market.</p>\n    <p>Interestingly, this hasn’t changed despite the price recovery that BTC has seen since the start of this month. At present, short positions still outweigh bullish bets by 485 BTC (worth around $56.2 million).</p>\n    <p>Historically, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have tended to move in the direction that goes contrary to the crowd’s expectation, so the dominance of bearish sentiment in the derivatives market may not be such a bad thing.</p>\n    <p>In another X <a href=\"https://x.com/glassnode/status/1969034739819389267\">thread</a>, Glassnode has discussed about some metrics related to the Bitcoin Options market. First of these is the<a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoins-implied-volatility-craters-after-bears-fire-warning-shot/\"> Implied Volatility (IV)</a>, which measures the future volatility expectation of the Options traders.</p>\n    <p>In particular, the version of the metric that’s of interest here is the “At-The-Money” (ATM) one, which only shows this expectation for the traders with a strike price close to the current BTC spot value.</p>\n    <p>Below is a chart that shows the trend in this indicator across the major tenors for Bitcoin over the last few weeks.</p>\n    <blockquote>Looks like the 1 week IV has seen the most change recently | Source:<a href=\"\">Glassnode on X</a></blockquote>\n    <p>From the graph, it’s apparent that the 1-week Bitcoin ATM IV rose ahead of the <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/binance-adds-2b-stablecoin-one-day-fomc-speculation/\">Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)</a> meeting, but then plunged after the Fed announced its decision. Longer expiry timeframes displayed no particular reaction to the event.</p>\n    <p>Another gauge for Options market volatility expectations is the IV Index (DVOL), which aggregates the IV across strike prices and tenors.</p>\n    <blockquote>The trend in the BTC DVOL over the last few weeks | Source:<a href=\"\">Glassnode on X</a></blockquote>\n    <p>“Post-FOMC, DVOL dropped back, confirming the market is not pricing any sharp move in the near term,” notes Glassnode.</p>\n    <h2>BTC Price</h2>\n    <p>Bitcoin made recovery toward $117,900 earlier, but it seems the coin has faced a retrace as its price has dropped back to $116,000.</p>\n    <blockquote>The price of the coin seems to have moved flat over the last five days | Source:<a href=\"\">BTCUSDT on TradingView</a></blockquote>\n    <graphic src=\"https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/safe.png\"/>\n    <p><strong>Editorial Process</strong>for bitcoinist is centered on delivering thoroughly researched, accurate, and unbiased content.

This is the perfect opportunity for dip hunters like Strategy to capitalize on the contraction in preparation for October 29.</p>\n    <p>The combination between the optimism linked to the coming rate cuts and growing institutional Bitcoin hoarding should pump $BTC to a new ATH by the end of October.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://bitcoinist.care/box_27fa54a2abe6756ee07f7504e1c69615?referrer=economist-predicts-alt-season-and-more-rate-cuts-bitcoin-hyper-next-crypto-to-explode\">Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER)</a> $17.1M presale will likely contribute to that as it aims for a Q4 public launch.</p>\n    <h2>How Will Bitcoin Behave in the Coming Months?</h2>\n    <p>It’s extremely likely that Bitcoin will enter a bullish phase come mid-October, likely followed by a modest contraction before the next pump.

This explains why Bitcoin soared following the Fed’s positive decision.</p>\n    <p>The crashout that followed was nothing more than the result of opportunistic cashouts, with the dumps pushing the price down.

However, the agency, which is intended to be a five-person, bipartisan commission, is down to only acting Chairman Caroline Pham, who is also expected to depart from the agency once a permanent leader is appointed.</p>\n    <p>With the personnel shortage and Quintenz confirmation stalling, it has been difficult to carry out critical agency business, previous reports claim. “Turmoil continues as the agency’s responsibilities, and the potential market risks, are multiplying,” Bloomberg <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/cftc-launches-next-phase-crypto-sprint-initiative/\">stated</a> in August.</p>\n    <p>At the time, a White House spokesperson denied that there’s chaos at the agency, affirming that “President Trump has made it a priority to make America the crypto capital of the world, and in doing so has called for the revitalization of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to play a larger role in securing this promise.”</p>\n    <h2>Quintenz-Winklevoss Clash Stalls CFTC Leadership</h2>\n    <p>The CFTC has been in leadership limbo since July, after the US Senate Agriculture Committee delayed the vote on President Trump’s nominee days before the August recess. Reports claimed that the committee stalled Quintenz’s confirmation process following a request from the White House.</p>\n    <p>The request came after Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/nasdaq-set-to-invest-50-million-in-gemini-ipo/\">Gemini</a> co-founders, allegedly pressed President Trump to reconsider Quintenz’s nomination, arguing that he wouldn’t “shake up the CFTC enough” and was not aligned with Trump’s agenda.</p>\n    <p>In August, a group of crypto organizations sent a letter to the US President in support of the CFTC chair candidate. They highlighted Quintenz’s extensive experience in the private sector and his knowledge and foresight in digital asset regulation.</p>\n    <p>“Mr. Quintenz is uniquely prepared to lead the CFTC in establishing fair, transparent, and trusted markets that will safeguard America’s leadership in digital assets,” the letter affirmed, emphasizing that installing a permanent leader is “absolutely critical” to achieve the Commission’s goals and accomplish Trump’s crypto mission.</p>\n    <p>Last week, Quintenz seemingly confirmed the rumors after sharing private messages with the Winklevoss twins. He suggested the US president “might have been misled” by the crypto exchange co-founders, which led to the delay.</p>\n    <p>As <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-feud-cftc-nominee-accuse-tyler-winklevoss/\">reported</a> by Bitcoinist, Tyler Winklevoss asked Quintenz’s opinion on the crypto exchange’s 13-page complaint letter, which raised multiple concerns and complaints about the CFTC’s Division of Enforcement (DOE) conduct against the crypto exchange over the years. However, Winklevoss was ultimately “disappointed and surprised” with the CFTC nominee response.</p>\n    <p>“It’s my understanding that after this exchange, they contacted the President and asked that my confirmation be paused for reasons other than what is reflected in these texts,” Quintenz wrote on X.</p>\n    <p>Ultimately, he pledged to continue to support Trump’s vision “in whatever capacity” he can, as “protecting the President and his agenda are more important than any job.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/BTCUSDT_2025-09-19_10-31-40.png?w=980&amp;resize=980%2C564\" alt=\"crypto, bitcoin, btc, btcusdt\"/>\n    </p>\n    <blockquote>Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $116,313 in the one-week chart.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>Crypto history has shown that early believers in the right projects can transform small investments into fortunes. Think back to those who picked up Binance Coin before it became a household name or Solana before its explosive breakout. Now, the same conversation is happening around BlockchainFX (BFX), a project that has already raised more than $7.6M in presale and is being tipped as the next big crypto with life-changing potential.</p><p>Unlike speculative tokens with little more than hype, BlockchainFX is already live in beta, operating as a true trading super app. With a foundation that connects crypto with traditional financial markets, it’s offering early investors a chance to secure tokens before the next price jump, and possibly the next Binance-style success story.</p><h2><strong>BlockchainFX: Built for a New Era of Trading</strong></h2>\n\n<p>What sets <a href=\"https://blockchainfx.com/?utm_source=Blockonomi&amp;utm_medium=Could+BlockchainFX+Be+the+Next+Big+Crypto+Coin+That+Turns+%24250+Into+%24100%2C000%3F&amp;utm_campaign=Blockonomi&amp;utm_id=Blockonomi\">BlockchainFX</a> apart is its ability to merge two worlds that were once separate. While exchanges like Binance and Coinbase dominate crypto, they remain limited to digital assets. BlockchainFX goes further, giving traders the ability to manage crypto, stocks, forex, and ETFs all from one decentralized platform. This means users can profit in both bullish and bearish markets, a flexibility few other platforms provide.</p><p>Security is another core advantage. With multiple third-party audits, full KYC verification, and smart contracts already validated, BlockchainFX has positioned itself as a trusted platform rather than a risky experiment. For investors, that peace of mind matters, especially in a presale market where transparency is often missing. Early adoption of the app also tells its own story: thousands of traders are already using it daily, showing demand is real and growing.</p><h3><strong>How $250 Becomes $100,000</strong></h3>\n<p>Here’s where things get exciting for investors running the numbers. At the current presale price of $0.024, a $250 entry secures just over 10,400 BFX tokens. By using the promo code <strong>BLOCK30</strong>, allocations increase by 30%, raising the total to around 13,500 tokens. When BlockchainFX lists at its launch price of $0.05, those tokens would already be worth about $677, nearly tripling the initial stake before the token even hits exchanges.</p><p>But that’s only the beginning. Analysts are forecasting an early post-launch rally toward the $1 mark, which would push those same tokens to a value of roughly $13,500. That alone represents a return of more than 50x from the starting investment. Looking further out, if BlockchainFX climbs to $8, a figure aligned with analyst predictions for its long-term growth, the portfolio value would cross $108,000. At $10, it soars past $135,000. This is how a modest $250 could realistically transform into six figures, echoing the kind of gains that early Binance Coin holders once experienced.</p><p>To add even more incentive, anyone purchasing $100 or more of BFX automatically qualifies for the project’s <a href=\"https://gleam.io/OR72Q/blockchainfx-500000-giveaway\">$500,000 Gleam giveaway</a>, giving early participants not only token exposure but also the chance to win significant bonus rewards.</p><h2><strong>Why Timing Matters</strong></h2>\n<p>Presales are structured to reward those who act quickly, and BlockchainFX is no different. Each stage brings a higher price, meaning that hesitation results in fewer tokens for the same amount invested. With more than 10,000 participants already on board and the $8M soft cap about to be crossed, demand is accelerating. For those watching closely, this may be one of the final chances to buy in at ground level before the market drives valuations much higher.</p><p>The story of Binance Coin shows exactly how early entry makes the difference between small profits and life-changing wealth. BlockchainFX is positioning itself as the modern equivalent – only this time, investors have the chance to be early while the token is still trading below three cents.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion: The Best Crypto Presale Right Now</strong></h2>\n<p>Based on the latest data, <a href=\"https://blockchainfx.com/?utm_source=Blockonomi&amp;utm_medium=Could+BlockchainFX+Be+the+Next+Big+Crypto+Coin+That+Turns+%24250+Into+%24100%2C000%3F&amp;utm_campaign=Blockonomi&amp;utm_id=Blockonomi\">BlockchainFX</a> isn’t just another presale – it’s the best crypto presale currently live and one of the strongest candidates for the title of next big crypto. With a working product, a clear roadmap, and a presale model that rewards urgency, it offers a rare mix of real-world utility and explosive upside potential.</p><p>At just $0.024 today, with the <strong>BLOCK30 </strong>promo boosting allocations by 30%, investors can still lock in at an entry price that may look impossibly cheap just months from now. Combine that with long-term price predictions of $8 to $10 and the Gleam giveaway, and the case for acting now is clear.</p><p>For those searching for the next big crypto that could turn $250 into $100,000, BlockchainFX is emerging as the top contender. The presale window won’t stay open forever, and missing it could mean watching from the sidelines as another generation of investors secures life-changing returns.</p><h3><strong>Find Out More Information Here:</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Website</strong>: <a href=\"https://blockchainfx.com/?utm_source=Blockonomi&amp;utm_medium=Could+BlockchainFX+Be+the+Next+Big+Crypto+Coin+That+Turns+%24250+Into+%24100%2C000%3F&amp;utm_campaign=Blockonomi&amp;utm_id=Blockonomi\">https://blockchainfx.com/</a></p><p><strong>X</strong>: <a href=\"https://x.com/BlockchainFXcom\">https://x.com/BlockchainFX.com</a></p><p><strong>Telegram Chat</strong>: <a href=\"https://t.me/blockchainfx_chat\">https://t.me/blockchainfx_chat</a></p><p/><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>This is a Press Release provided by a third party who is responsible for the content.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Bitcoin (BTC) trading near $117,000 and Ethereum (ETH) around $5,000 have created an uncomfortable truth for many retail investors: entering these giants now requires a serious amount of capital. While both remain pillars of the market, the reality is that smaller portfolios often struggle to capture meaningful upside from these high-priced crypto coins. That is why analysts are turning attention to <a href=\"https://mk.mutuum.com/giftl\">Mutuum Finance (MUTM)</a>, a presale-stage altcoin that combines utility, security, and affordability in a way that larger assets no longer can.</p>\n    <h3>Affordable Entry Point with Strong Foundations</h3>\n    <p>Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, where tokens are available at $0.035. Over $16 million has been raised so far, with more than 16,450 holders and 44% of the 170 million tokens in this stage already sold. Once the presale enters Phase 7, the price will increase by 15% to $0.040, meaning time is running short for those wanting to secure tokens at this lower entry point. For anyone working with a $3,000 budget, that affordability makes a big difference.</p>\n    <p>At the heart of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized finance protocol introducing a stablecoin pegged at $1. The stablecoin will only be minted when users borrow against collateral, such as ETH, and it will be burned when loans are repaid or liquidated. This design links supply directly to platform activity rather than speculation. Governance will oversee borrowing rates to help maintain the peg: lowering them if the stablecoin trades above $1 and raising them if it trades below. Arbitrage by traders will further support stability, while automatic liquidation systems will ensure that the platform remains solvent under stress.</p>\n    <p>Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also built to encourage both lending and borrowing. Lenders deposit assets like stablecoins or major tokens into liquidity pools and receive mtTokens in return. These mtTokens represent their share plus accrued interest. Users will be able to stake mtTokens to earn MUTM rewards, while the platform itself will use its revenues to buy MUTM tokens back from the open market and redistribute them to stakers. That cycle ties platform growth directly to value flow for the community.</p>\n    <p>Price accuracy will be ensured through Chainlink oracle feeds, with fallback oracles and decentralized exchange data serving as additional layers of protection. For a system that relies on collateral valuations and liquidations, these features are essential. They help prevent mispricing and strengthen the overall trust investors place in the protocol.</p>\n    <p>The presale has already delivered strong returns for early entrants. An investor in Phase 1 at $0.01 has seen a 250% increase by Phase 6 at $0.035 on paper. With the presale listing price planned at $0.06, that same allocation reflects an unrealized sixfold gain. Entering today with $3,000 at $0.035 secures 85,700 MUTM tokens. By the time the presale reaches $0.06, this would already reflect a value of $5,150 — a 70% increase before wider market exposure begins. For investors priced out of BTC and ETH, those numbers highlight why analysts are looking closely at MUTM.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image2-50.png\" alt=\"Mutuum\"/>\n    </p>\n    <h3>Roadmap, Security, and Analyst Confidence</h3>\n    <p>Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s development is being guided by a structured four-phase roadmap. The initial phase has already launched the presale, marketing campaigns, audits, and community outreach. The next phase will focus on smart contract development, front-end user interfaces, and infrastructure setup. Following that, Phase 3 will include beta testing on testnet, final audits, regulatory alignment, and presale conclusion. The final phase will deliver the live platform, exchange listings, multi-chain expansion, institutional partnerships, and ongoing feature upgrades.</p>\n    <p>Security has been prioritized from the start. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is undergoing a CertiK audit using both manual review and static analysis, with a Token Scan Score of 90 and a Skynet Score of 79. The timeline was first requested in February 2025 and revised in May 2025, reflecting the team’s attention to thorough review. Alongside this, a $50,000 bug bounty program has been introduced to encourage community reporting of vulnerabilities, with rewards of up to $2,000 for critical findings. To energize community engagement, a <a href=\"https://gleam.io/WQak2/mutuum-finance-100k-giveaway\">$100,000 giveaway</a> is also live, offering ten winners $10,000 each in MUTM tokens.</p>\n    <h3>Final Words</h3>\n    <p>These initiatives have already built a following of more than 12,000 across social platforms, giving the project both credibility and momentum. Analysts reviewing crypto predictions and crypto charts are highlighting Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as an emerging ecosystem that aligns real-world lending and borrowing mechanics with long-term token value growth.</p>\n    <p>For investors evaluating where to place a $3,000 budget, the difference between entering BTC or ETH and MUTM is striking. While the majors are now high-barrier plays, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a presale entry with substantial upside, a structured roadmap, stablecoin innovation, and a staking-plus-buyback model that will reward engaged users. That mix is why experts say Mutuum Finance (MUTM) may well be the best crypto to invest in right now for those seeking accessible but powerful growth potential.</p>\n    <p>For more information about Mutuum Finance (MUTM) visit the links below:</p>\n    <p>Website: <a href=\"https://www.mutuum.com\">https://www.mutuum.com</a></p>\n    <p>Linktree: <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/mutuumfinance\">https://linktr.ee/mutuumfinance</a></p>\n    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>This is a Press Release provided by a third party who is responsible for the content.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The spotlight is back on Cardano, one of the most closely watched projects in the crypto space. ADA continues to generate buzz with ecosystem upgrades, even as its price consolidates. While long-term holders remain patient, many investors are also eyeing PayFi newcomer <a href=\"https://remittix.io/?utm_source=Blocknomi&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=141\">Remittix (RTX)</a>, which is shaping up as a breakout story of 2025.</p>\n    <p>With its presale crossing $26M and wallet testing already live, RTX represents the kind of utility-focused innovation that could shift market attention.</p>\n    <h2>Cardano News Today: Price Action and Ecosystem Progress</h2>\n    <p>After weeks of sideways action, <a href=\"https://x.com/rssbit/status/1969039170325639487?s=46\">Cardano</a> trades in the $0.90 range. Support is holding near $0.82, while resistance at $0.95 remains a key barrier. Analysts say a clean move above $1.00 could open the door to $1.15–$1.20 in the short term.</p>\n    <p>In order to increase transaction speeds and overall efficiency, Cardano developers are still pushing for Mithril enhancements and Hydra scalability. In order to maintain ADA’s standing as one of the top long-term cryptocurrency investment options, the Cardano Foundation has significantly increased its emphasis on decentralized governance.</p>\n    <p>Yet, ADA’s slow price movement compared to other top cryptos to buy now has led some traders to diversify into newer tokens with faster growth potential. That’s where Remittix comes in.</p>\n    <h2>Remittix: A Fresh Take On PayFi Innovation</h2>\n    <p><a href=\"https://remittix.io/?utm_source=Blocknomi&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=141\">Remittix (RTX)</a> isn’t trying to outcompete ADA’s smart contract network. Instead, it’s focused on a completely different sector: PayFi. The project aims to move money seamlessly across borders, connecting crypto wallets with traditional banks. Unlike many presales that exist only on paper, Remittix has already started wallet beta testing, allowing early community members to try out its features firsthand.</p>\n    <p>This week, RTX also made headlines as the best pre-launch token on CertiK Skynet, with the team fully verified by blockchain’s top auditor.

Those crypto millionaire stories were built during presales and early launches, and 2025 is giving you a second chance. <a href=\"https://blockchainfx.com/?utm_source=Blockonomi&amp;utm_medium=Avalanche+ETF+Buzz+and+BlockchainFX+Presale+Mania+Put+Two+Best+Cryptos+to+Buy+Now+in+Focus+for+2025&amp;utm_campaign=Blockonomi&amp;utm_id=Blockonomi\">BlockchainFX</a> ($BFX) is already being called one of the top 100x crypto presales in 2025, combining explosive ROI with real-world adoption. Unlike most presale crypto 2025 projects that sell promises, BlockchainFX is already live with thousands of users and daily revenue.</p><p>The presale started at just $0.01, but it’s already climbed to $0.024 and heads toward a confirmed launch at $0.05. That means early buyers are doubling before listings even go live. If you’re searching for the best crypto presale to buy now, BlockchainFX is shaping up as the rare mix of utility, passive income, and guaranteed upside that could turn a small entry into life-changing returns.</p><p><strong>👉 Secure your $BFX today before the next presale price increase shuts out early buyers.</strong></p><h2><strong>BlockchainFX Presale News: Why $BFX Is the Best Presale Crypto 2025</strong></h2>\n\n\n<p>BlockchainFX isn’t just another new crypto presale 2025—it’s a revenue-generating trading super app that merges crypto, stocks, forex, and ETFs in one place. With over 10,000 daily users, the platform has already processed millions in trading volume. That’s why analysts call it the best token presale 2025—because it’s backed by utility, not hype.</p><p>Key highlights that make $BFX stand out:</p><ul><li>Presale price $0.024; confirmed launch price $0.05.</li><li>Over $7.7 million raised from 10,000+ participants.</li><li>70% of trading fees redistributed to holders in USDT.</li><li>Daily rewards of 4–7% and APYs close to 90%.</li><li>Exclusive Visa cards (Gold, Green, Metal) to spend crypto globally.</li><li>A <a href=\"https://blockchainfx.com/win-500?utm_source=Blockonomi&amp;utm_medium=Avalanche+ETF+Buzz+and+BlockchainFX+Presale+Mania+Put+Two+Best+Cryptos+to+Buy+Now+in+Focus+for+2025&amp;utm_campaign=Blockonomi&amp;utm_id=Blockonomi\">$500,000 giveaway</a>with prizes up to $250,000 in BFX tokens.</li></ul><p>Real-world ROI scenario: A $5,000 buy now equals ~270,000 tokens with the BLOCK30 bonus. At $0.05 launch, that’s $13,500. If $BFX hits $1 long term, that grows into $270,000. That’s why it’s trending as a millionaire-making presale and possibly the next crypto to explode in 2025.</p><p><strong>👉 Don’t wait—this is the best crypto presale project 2025 still under $1. Grab $BFX today.</strong></p><h2><strong>Avalanche (AVAX) Price News Today: Is It Still an Altcoin Undervalued in 2025?</strong></h2>\n<p>Avalanche (AVAX) is showing strong signs of a breakout in September 2025. The price surged 33% from $28 support to $34, breaking past key resistance at $32.50. If momentum holds, analysts expect short-term targets of $36–$50. Institutional demand is growing, with Avalanche Foundation working toward a $1 billion treasury and ETF talks heating up.</p><p>This makes AVAX a solid long-term crypto investment, but here’s the catch: much of that growth is already priced in. For buyers hunting the next 100x crypto or the best crypto under $1, Avalanche no longer fits the bill. BlockchainFX, however, is still in its presale stage, offering guaranteed launch upside, crypto passive income, and the chance at explosive 1000x returns that AVAX can no longer provide.</p><p><strong>👉 If you regret missing AVAX under $10, don’t repeat history—buy $BFX before it leaves the presale zone.</strong></p><h2><strong>BlockchainFX vs Avalanche: Which Is the Best Crypto to Buy Now for 2025?</strong></h2>\n<table><row span=\"5\"><cell><i>Project</i></cell>\n<cell><i>Current Price / Presale</i></cell>\n<cell><i>Launch Forecast</i></cell>\n<cell><i>Long-Term Target</i></cell>\n<cell><i>Key Features</i></cell>\n</row><row span=\"5\"><cell><i>BlockchainFX (BFX)</i></cell>\n<cell>$0.024 presale</cell><cell>$0.05 confirmed launch</cell><cell>$0.10–$0.25 short-term, $1+ long-term</cell><cell>70% fee rewards, 90% APY, Visa cards, global trading, $500K giveaway</cell></row><row><cell><i>Avalanche (AVAX)</i></cell>\n<cell>$34 market price</cell><cell>N/A</cell><cell>$36–$50 near-term</cell><cell>DeFi + NFT ecosystem, institutional growth, ETF speculation</cell></row></table><p>Analysis: Avalanche is strong but already established. BlockchainFX offers scarcity, low entry, and presale bonuses that create true crypto millionaire potential. It’s the top presale crypto for huge ROI in 2025, while AVAX remains a steady altcoin.</p><p><strong>👉 Act fast—join the BlockchainFX presale 2025 now before prices rise again.</strong></p><h2><strong>Conclusion: Is BlockchainFX the Best Crypto Presale to Buy Now in 2025?</strong></h2>\n\n<p>The biggest question in crypto today is simple: do you want to ride a coin already priced in, or do you want to get in early on the next 100x crypto? Avalanche is bullish, but its entry point is already high. BlockchainFX gives early adopters the kind of scarcity, urgency, and ROI upside that defined Ethereum and Solana’s early days. With a confirmed launch price of $0.05, daily passive income, global utility, and forecasts pointing to $1 and beyond, BFX checks every box for the best crypto presale 2025.</p><p>This is a millionaire-making presale that blends explosive growth, passive income, and real-world adoption. In a market full of hype, BlockchainFX is delivering actual results. For those who missed past opportunities, this is the second chance that doesn’t come often.</p><p><strong>👉 Join the </strong><strong>BlockchainFX </strong><strong>presale today and secure your early position before it’s too late.</strong></p><p><strong>Find Out More Information Here</strong></p><p/><p><strong>Website:</strong><a href=\"https://blockchainfx.com/\"> https://blockchainfx.com/ </a></p><p><strong>X</strong>: <a href=\"https://x.com/BlockchainFXcom\">https://x.com/BlockchainFXcom</a></p><p><strong>Telegram Chat:</strong> <a href=\"https://t.me/blockchainfx_chat\">https://t.me/blockchainfx_chat</a></p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>This is a Press Release provided by a third party who is responsible for the content.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Ethereum continues to trade near $4,585 as developers prepare for the Fusaka upgrade on December 3, which will double blob capacity and improve scalability across the network. While ETH consolidates, Remittix has exploded into global headlines after raising over $26.1 million in September, setting new records and emerging as the fastest growing crypto of 2025.</p>\n    <p>Early investors are reporting referral rewards that outperform years of holding traditional DeFi tokens, with analysts dubbing RTX the <a href=\"https://remittix.io/?utm_source=Blocknomi&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=141\">“XRP 2.0 for payments”</a> and naming it the best crypto to buy now before mainstream adoption takes hold. Get all the latest news on Ethereum and Remittix below.</p>\n    <h2>Ethereum Latest News: Fusaka Upgrade to Unlock Modest Gains</h2>\n    <p>Ethereum developers are preparing the Fusaka hard fork for mainnet activation on December 3. The upgrade will implement twelve new proposals, expanding blob capacity from 6 to 15 at launch and then to 21 by January 2026.</p>\n    <p>Analysts expect ETH to climb<a href=\"https://x.com/evcawolfCZ/status/1968976834663493880\"> toward $5,200 </a>by the end of September, with potential highs near $5,460 in October as ETFs and layer-2 adoption drive inflows.</p>\n    <p>Yet Ethereum’s $546 billion market cap limits rapid percentage gains. Citi’s conservative year-end target of $4,300 reflects caution, while chart patterns suggest ETH could remain range-bound between $4,434 and $4,646 until the upgrade fully takes effect.</p>\n    <p>Long-term, the improvements strengthen Ethereum’s foundation, but they will not trigger the parabolic returns that retail investors are chasing.</p>\n    <h2>Remittix: The PayFi Breakthrough Delivering Immediate Utility</h2>\n    <p>Remittix is redefining the crypto landscape with utility-driven growth that few projects can match. After raising $26.1 million and selling more than 666 million tokens at around 10 cents, RTX is positioning itself as the ultimate early-stage investment in the $19 trillion payments industry.</p>\n    <p>The <a href=\"https://remittix.io/?utm_source=Blocknomi&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=141\">live beta wallet</a> is already running tests across more than 30 countries, enabling real crypto-to-bank transfers, while the 15% USDT referral program is generating viral adoption and daily income for holders. Unlike Ethereum’s gradual climb, Remittix is delivering instant value.</p>\n    <p>Why investors are choosing RTX over traditional holdings:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Wallet in beta with crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries</li>\n      <li>15% USDT referral program creating daily income streams</li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://skynet.certik.com/projects/remittix-labs\">CertiK ranked number one</a>among pre-launch projects</li>\n      <li>Confirmed BitMart and LBank listings guaranteeing liquidity</li>\n      <li>Deflationary tokenomics with weekly burns designed to accelerate growth</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Many early participants report weekly referral earnings that surpass years of passive gains in other projects—evidence that RTX could be the next 100x breakout.</p>\n    <h2>Countdown Is On: $250,000 Giveaway Driving Massive Community Growth</h2>\n    <p>Remittix is fueling even more excitement with a $250,000 giveaway that has already attracted more than 33,000 holders and 340,000 entries. The real wealth generator, however, is its referral system, which pays 15% instantly and can be claimed every 24 hours.</p>\n    <p>Early adopters report<a href=\"https://remittix.io/?utm_source=Blocknomi&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=141\"> earning more in weeks</a> from RTX than years of Ethereum holding, creating intense FOMO as exchange listings and the wallet launch approach.</p>\n    <p>This may be the last chance to secure tokens before RTX rockets past $1. Ethereum will continue to provide steady institutional growth, but Remittix is the project delivering exponential returns today. For investors ready to capture life-changing upside, the PayFi revolution is already underway.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Discover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their project here:</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>Website</strong>:<a href=\"https://remittix.io/?utm_source=Blocknomi&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=141\"> https://remittix.io/</a></p>\n    <p><strong>Socials</strong>:<a href=\"https://linktr.ee/remittix\"> https://linktr.ee/remittix</a></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>$250,000 Giveaway:</strong>\n      <a href=\"https://gleam.io/competitions/nz84L-250000-remittix-giveaway\"> https://gleam.io/competitions/nz84L-250000-remittix-giveaway</a>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>This is a Press Release provided by a third party who is responsible for the content.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>XRP price prediction chatter has intensified after fresh ETF headlines and a steady push back above the $3 zone. Analysts tracking Ripple expect a possible move toward four dollars if resistance levels give way and ETF flows broaden.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://remittix.io/?utm_source=Blocknomi&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=141\">Remittix (RTX)</a> enters this comparison as the so-called XRP 2.0, drawing interest from investors who want PayFi utility plus stronger upside potential at an early price point. In this match-up of Ripple versus XRP 2.0, the question is whether established liquidity or early-stage utility offers the better near-term growth path.</p>\n    <h2>Ripple Today and the XRP Price Prediction Setup</h2>\n    <p>XRP price has been buoyed by a friendlier backdrop for crypto funds. The SEC just approved generic listing standards that streamline how exchanges list commodity-based ETPs, a change that could ease the path for more crypto products that track assets like XRP.</p>\n    <p>Short-range forecasts published this week float a glide path around $3 with scope to $4 if momentum and flows improve into October.</p>\n    <h2>Remittix Versus Ripple in the XRP Price Prediction Lens</h2>\n    <p>Compared with Ripple, Remittix begins at a far lower starting price, which magnifies percentage returns if adoption clicks. That is why many referring to XRP 2.0 are pointing at Remittix when weighing the better investment today, alongside any XRP price prediction.</p>\n    <p>The <a href=\"https://remittix.io/?utm_source=Blocknomi&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=141\">Remittix</a> team is verified by CertiK and is ranked number one on the CertiK leaderboard for pre-launch tokens, which strengthens trust and due diligence claims. The beta wallet is live with community testing underway, signalling product progress rather than slide decks, as multiple roundups have highlighted in recent days.</p>\n    <p>Remittix has sold over 666 million tokens, the token price is $0.108, and the amount raised is over $26 million. Remittix also runs a 15% USDT referral reward that is claimable every 24 hours and a $250,000 giveaway, and it has secured two centralized exchange listings with a third in view.</p>\n    <p>Why investors tag Remittix as XRP 2.0 right now:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Audited by CertiK, built with trust and transparency</li>\n      <li>Mass market appeal beyond just the crypto crowd</li>\n      <li>Officially ranked #1 among pre-launch tokens</li>\n      <li>Deflationary tokenomics designed for long-term growth</li>\n      <li>Time-sensitive entry point before listings and parabolic growth</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Those strengths echo what many XRP holders want more of in the near term. The difference is that Remittix is earlier in its curve, so positive listings, wallet expansion, and referral flywheels can translate into larger percentage swings than a mature large cap like XRP, even if both benefit from the same PayFi narrative tailwinds.</p>\n    <h2>Where the better risk-reward may sit in an XRP Price Prediction market</h2>\n    <p>XRP price prediction remains constructive with a path toward $4 if resistance breaks and ETF inflows scale, and the regulatory shift on ETP standards supports that view. Remittix is being treated as XRP 2.0 because it pairs a payments utility with fresh incentives and visible product testing.</p>\n    <p>If the goal is a higher percentage upside from a smaller base, Remittix currently looks like the better investment to make today alongside a measured XRP allocation, with catalysts that match what traders seek when the PayFi theme takes centre stage.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Discover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their project here:</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Website: </strong>\n      <a href=\"https://remittix.io/?utm_source=Blocknomi&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=141\">https://remittix.io/</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Socials:</strong>\n      <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/remittix\"> https://linktr.ee/remittix</a>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>$250,000 Giveaway:</strong> <a href=\"https://gleam.io/competitions/nz84L-250000-remittix-giveaway\">https://gleam.io/competitions/nz84L-250000-remittix-giveaway</a></p>\n    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>This is a Press Release provided by a third party who is responsible for the content.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>As discussion regarding a likely XRP ETF listing continues, investor interest remains. If institutional inflows commence and regulatory clarity materializes, they expect Ripple to reach $5 in 2025. This renewed optimism is fueling interest not only in XRP, but also in altcoins with strong fundamentals and community-driven growth, including <a href=\"https://buy.magacoinfinance.com/gu9o\">MAGACOIN FINANCE</a> a breakout contender that’s quickly rising on analyst watchlists.</p>\n    <h2>XRP Price Outlook: Holding Key Levels</h2>\n    <p>According to analysts, the approval of an ETF, added to institutional adoption and retail momentum will push XRP to prices last seen during the 2021 bull cycle. This fresh optimism has also led to renewed interest in altcoins with robust fundamentals. According to market watchers, XRP has a technical setup that looks good. Prices are holding support levels around $2.30 while facing resistance near $2.65. If XRP can overcome this barrier with solid volume, the price will touch $5. Investors looking for growth opportunities are also taking notice of other top altcoins like the ADA and the SOL, which remain stable while the rest of the market undergoes consolidation.</p>\n    <h2>Rising Momentum Altcoin Spotlight</h2>\n    <p>While XRP dominates headlines, analysts are increasingly highlighting MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the most promising hidden gems for 2025. Unlike many meme coins that rely purely on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE combines scarcity-driven tokenomics with strong community adoption.</p>\n    <p>Its audited smart contract, capped supply, and absence of venture capital control have resonated with both retail and early institutional investors. Wallet activity is growing, repeat purchases are rising, and whale accumulation signals confidence in its long-term trajectory. These factors mirror early-stage patterns seen in other meme tokens that later achieved exponential growth.</p>\n    <p>MAGACOIN FINANCE is trending on social platforms and appearing in analyst watchlists as one of the undervalued picks of this cycle. Many traders now view it as a strategic diversification play alongside large-cap names like XRP, ADA, and Solana.</p>\n    <h2>ETF Buzz and Market Outlook</h2>\n    <p>News related to ETF continues to create conversation around XRP. If given the green light, this ETF will attract an influx of institutional investors, increasing liquidity and confidence. According to analysts, there will be an increase in trading, similar to those seen with previous ETFs or big regulations. Incorporating regulatory compliance and payment solutions case for sustained interest and investment in XRP’s use as compared to bitcoin.</p>\n    <p>XRP’s Performance Will Need To Be assessed With BTC And Broader Economic Conditions In Mind, Say Analysts. XRP has tracked Bitcoin fairly closely during major market moves for the last year. However, it is now a unique case in the ETF debate. So, it could see itself outperforming its peers during bullish news cycles.</p>\n    <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n    <p>XRP remains a top altcoin to watch as ETF speculation mounts and analysts believe its price could target $5 in 2025. While investors closely track XRP, early diversification into other accelerating best altcoins such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, provides your portfolio the opportunity to capture major early gains from a rapidly growing community and new investor momentum.</p>\n    <h4>To learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE, visit:</h4>\n    <p>Website:<a href=\"https://buy.magacoinfinance.com/gu9o\"> https://magacoinfinance.com\n</a>Twitter/X:</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://x.com/magacoinfinance\">https://x.com/magacoinfinance<br/>\n</a>Telegram:</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://t.me/magacoinfinance\">https://t.me/magacoinfinance</a>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>This is a Press Release provided by a third party who is responsible for the content.

That same regret is fueling the rush into BlockchainFX, a project many are calling the best crypto presale 2025. With Ethereum trading at $4,494.44 and a market cap of over $542 billion, the early ICO gains are long gone. Those who got in at under $1 are today’s crypto millionaire stories.

Weekly increases are pushing it toward its $0.05 launch price. This rapid growth is why many see it as the top 100x crypto presale in 2025.

Analysis with the RSI indicator confirms this by signalling that there could be more positive momentum on the horizon. Overall, market sentiment and momentum remain neutral, suggesting that the price might be about to break out either to the upside or below.</p>\n    <h2>Shiba Inu Outlook: Horizontal Channel Indicates Consolidation</h2>\n    <p>Shiba Inu continues to trade within a horizontal trend channel, with support near $12.08 and resistance at $14.01. Analysts predict that there is a high chance Shiba Inu might be about to break out of its consolidation and gain up to 16% price increase. In addition, volume analysis shows higher activity at price tops and lower activity at bottoms, which strengthens the likelihood of a directional move.</p>\n    <p>However, while bullish predictions about Shiba Inu remain, investors are looking for lower-priced tokens with more upward momentum and potential to deliver significant price gains.</p>\n    <h2>Investors Choose Remittix Ahead Of Shiba Inu And Dogecoin</h2>\n    <p><a href=\"https://remittix.io/?utm_source=Blocknomi&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=141\">Remittix</a> is a cross-border payment solution that is solving the international problem of asset transfers by seamlessly uniting crypto and fiat in one efficient system.

After breaking out of a symmetrical triangle, momentum indicators like the MACD show sustained buying strength.</p>\n    <p>Analysts believe the Solana price prediction now points toward $294 in the short term, with a bullish extension possibly reaching $418 if volume keeps flowing.</p>\n    <p>On-chain signals confirm this outlook, with the Bull Bear Power and Chaikin Money Flow highlighting strong inflows and persistent demand.

With the <a href=\"https://remittix.io/?utm_source=Blocknomi&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=141\">Remittix token</a> priced at $0.1080 and over $26M already raised, analysts argue it could rival Solana’s rise with its own explosive growth.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Remittix wallet beta testing is live with community access already underway</li>\n      <li>BitMart confirmed as the first CEX to list RTX after the $20M milestone</li>\n      <li>LBank announced another upcoming listing as Remittix surged past $22M raised</li>\n      <li>Referral program rewards users with 15% in USDT for every new buyer invited</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Backed by CertiK verification and ranked #1 for pre-launch tokens, Remittix isn’t just hype.

Also known as <i>horiatiki</i> (Greek for “peasant salad” or “village salad”), this rustic dish is a chunky assemblage of tomatoes, cucumbers, black olives, red onion, and a <i>substantial</i> amount of feta—many traditional recipes are crowned with thick slabs of it. Anointed with a bright, herby dressing of lemon juice, red wine vinegar (sometimes), dried oregano, and extra-virgin olive oil, it’s a marvelous, Mediterranean way to celebrate <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/g65104794/summer-produce-recipes/\">summer produce</a>. The best part? This easy recipe only takes 15 minutes to prepare, making it a perfect last-minute addition to any meal. Ready to make it your own? Keep reading on for all of my top tips: </p>\n    <p><strong>What People Are Saying:</strong><br/>\"Love it. We are a Greek family and it's a favorite every time. Even Mum is impressed.\" -<i>GoldDucky</i> </p>\n    <p>\"Made it &amp; my family loves it! I’m making it for a picnic this weekend as well. Thanks for sharing the recipe!\" <i>-GreenMustache</i> </p>\n    <p>Sharpen your chef’s knife and prep those ingredients! If you’re going to soak the red onion (to reduce its pungency), now’s the time to do it. Be sure to cut the feta into large cubes so it doesn’t wind up as crumbles. The tomatoes and olives should stay chunky—just halve them and move on. Now combine everything in a large bowl and admire all those colors.</p>\n    <p>On to the dressing: To get a good emulsion, you want to combine the water-based ingredients (the lemon juice and vinegar) first and then gradually whisk in the oil until the dressing is slightly thickened and completely homogeneous. A well-emulsified dressing won’t separate and will wrap the salad ingredients in a loving embrace rather than run right off them. When seasoning the dressing, bear in mind that the feta is quite salty. </p>\n    <p>Pour the dressing over the salad and toss gently, trying not to break up the feta. Now dig in. I told you this was simple!</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>The full list of ingredients and directions can be found in the recipe below.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>This salad is best eaten fresh, but if you have any leftovers, store them in the fridge for up to 3 days.</p>\n    <p>cucumber, halved lengthwise, thinly sliced into half-moons</p>\n    <p>red onion, thinly sliced</p>\n    <p>grape or cherry tomatoes, halved</p>\n    <p>halved pitted Kalamata olives</p>\n    <p>feta, cut into 1/2\" cubes</p>\n    <p>red wine vinegar</p>\n    <p>Juice of 1/2 lemon</p>\n    <p>dried oregano</p>\n    <p>Kosher salt</p>\n    <p>Freshly ground black pepper</p>\n    <p>extra-virgin olive oil</p>\n    <p>Let us know how it went in the comments below! </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a54226/best-greek-salad-recipe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

While stripping away the <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a51229/loaded-potato-skins-recipe/\">skins</a> to reveal the clean <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/g3030/potato-recipes/\">potato</a> underneath can be a genuinely enjoyable task—at least for those of us who get a kick out of cleaning—around the <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/holiday-recipes/\">holidays</a>, or any other event that calls for peeling mountains of potatoes, it’s important to figure out the quickest and most effective ways to get the job done.</p>\n    <h2>Why Should You Peel Potatoes?</h2>\n    <p>Potato peels are completely edible and actually contain a good amount of fiber, vitamins, and other nutrients that are beneficial to our health; however, they do change the texture of potato recipes. Some people prefer skins in their mashed potatoes, but if you want a smoother <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a51451/easy-chicken-parmesan-recipe/\"> mashed potato</a>, or especially with a pommes purée, you’re going to want to remove those fibrous skins. Though, honestly, often the decision of whether or not to peel potatoes breaks down to a matter of taste.</p>\n    <p>Now I know I’m talking all about the best ways to get skin off of potatoes, but it’s a shame to waste them! Turn those strips into our <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/a46487812/veggie-peel-chips-recipe/\"> veggie peel chips</a>.</p>\n    <h2>How To Peel Potatoes</h2>\n    <p>The simplest method for peeling potatoes is also the most straightforward. Simply grab your potato peeler in your non-dominant hand and work your way down the potato, peeling the skin in vertical strokes, and turning the potato as you go so that once you make a full 360° rotation, all the skin that is left is at the very top and bottom of the potato. At this point, go ahead and use the peeler to clean both ends of the potato until all the skin is removed. Repeat these steps with each potato that you’re using, and be careful not to accidentally catch your skin with the peeler.</p>\n    <p>Different potatoes have skins with varying thicknesses, but each can be peeled easily and quickly using a potato or vegetable peeler. This method is certainly the quickest and simplest way to peel a small number of potatoes, but if you need to work through an especially large batch, you may want to check out the next method.</p>\n    <h2>Other Methods Worth Trying</h2>\n    <p>Another potato peeling technique that you may consider trying doesn’t actually involve a potato peeler at all. This method calls for scoring each potato all the way around the middle and then placing them in a pot to boil. Once the potatoes have cooked long enough to be fork-tender, remove them from the pot and either set them on a cutting board to cool or dunk them into an ice bath to cool more quickly. Then, once they are cool enough to handle comfortably, pull the skin in either direction away from the center, and it should slide right off.</p>\n    <p>This method works great if you are using a lot of potatoes at once, but it does have a few limitations. For one, this method obviously isn’t great for any recipes where you don’t want to use boiled potatoes, so it limits the recipes where this would be helpful. Another drawback is that this method only really works for potatoes with thicker skins, like russets or sweet potatoes. With thinner-skinned varieties like Yukon gold or Idaho yellow potatoes, the skin isn’t going to peel away easily, and you’ll be left with chunks of potato sticking to the torn potato peels.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/kitchen-tools/kitchen-secrets/a67961345/how-to-peel-potatoes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

While there are plenty of delicious ways to make them, this recipe is my all-time favorite. The homemade fried shallots contribute crunch and texture, while the homemade shallot oil gives the <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/g40189579/salad-dressing-recipes/\">dressing</a> an irresistibly rich and aromatic twist. Boiling the farro in veggie broth, rather than water, infuses this already flavorful <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/g42229861/grain-bowl-recipes/\">grain</a> with even more flavor. And then there are all the mix-ins—nuts, cheese, fruit, greens—which lend the <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/g30717155/spring-salads/\">salad</a> substance and make every bite an adventure. I love this salad as is, but if you want to make it your own, keep reading on for all of my top tips: </p>\n    <p><strong>What People Are Saying:</strong><br/>\"This has to be my favorite recipe. I made it for a potluck and my friend's food snob husband asked for the recipe. now in their regular potluck/party rotation, too.\" - <i>GoldBattery</i></p>\n    <p>\"This is THE BEST farro recipe ever. And I say that as someone who has been making farro recipes for years. Perfection. I’ve made it twice in the span of a week. Thank you.\" - <i>ElizabethL</i></p>\n    <p>Alright, let's get going on the farro! Grab a medium saucepan and add the farro, vegetable broth, bay leaf, and 1/2 tsp. salt. Bring it to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cover with a lid. Let it cook away until the farro has absorbed all the liquid. We're aiming for tender but still with a bit of chew; no one wants mushy farro! By the end of cooking the farro should be plump and slightly split, which is just perfect. This will take about 30 minutes. Once it's done, transfer the farro to a large bowl and let it cool.</p>\n    <p>Now let's make the crispy shallots! Grab a small saucepan and add the olive oil and shallots. Heat over medium until the shallots start bubbling. Cook, stirring occasionally and adjusting the heat as needed to keep them gently bubbling away, until the shallots are golden brown and crisp. This usually takes 15 to 20 minutes, but keep a close eye on the shallots once they begin to brown because things can move quickly from there. To test for crispiness, remove one with a slotted spoon—if it slumps, it’s not done yet! When the shallots are ready, remove the pan from the heat and use a slotted spoon to transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate and immediately season with a pinch of salt. Let the oil cool—you’ll need it for the dressing in just a bit.</p>\n    <p>When the shallot oil has cooled completely, it’s time to make the dressing. Transfer the shallot oil to a medium bowl, then add the vinegar, mustard, and honey. Grab a whisk and prepare yourself for a little culinary calisthenics. Vigorously whisk the dressing until it thickens and emulsifies, and the honey is fully dissolved. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</p>\n    <p>Okay, some assembly required! Add the shallots, arugula, apple, Parmesan, basil, parsley, and pecans to the farro. Drizzle the dressing over and toss gently to bring it all together. Now that’s what I call the best farro salad <i>ever</i>!</p>\n    <p><i>The full list of ingredients and directions can be found in the recipe below. </i> </p>\n    <p>I highly recommend treating this salad as a template for a great grain salad. So long as you’ve got all the requisite elements—sweet, salty, soft, crunchy, fatty, and fresh—you’re golden. Not a fan of pecans? Use walnuts instead! Got some extra pears on hand?

And while the requisite candy is a good pairing for any night on the couch, no movie is really complete without popcorn. To give yourself the most authentic experience at home, freshly popped is the only way to go. And when time is of the essence, nothing beats <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/food-news/a62718777/reasons-not-to-eat-microwave-popcorn/\">microwave popcorn</a>. But like anything, not all are created equal. </p>\n    <p>The team at Delish is quite particular (and varied) when it comes to <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/g1005/popcorn-recipes/\">popcorn</a> preferences—some prefer loads of butter, while others enjoy simple, salted kernels. For the sake of journalism, we tested 10 different brands and more than 15 varieties of microwave popcorn to determine which ones are worth stocking up on for your next night in. Without further ado, here are the top five brands that we would gladly buy again.  </p>\n    <h2>Best Overall: Kirkland Signature Movie Theater Butter</h2>\n    <p>Honestly, is there anything <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/costco/\">Costco</a> doesn't succeed at? Its store-brand microwave popcorn was beloved across the board in our office, with people praising its \"incredible texture\" and \"nice crunch.\" Others said it had a great salt level and well-balanced flavor, though a few thought it could use more butter. And with a box of 44 bags, you're unlikely to run out anytime soon. Overall, you won't be disappointed with this pick, whether you prefer butter or salt. </p>\n    <h2>Best Salted Popcorn: Orville Redenbacher's Naturals Simply Salted</h2>\n    <p>People really enjoyed this popcorn, noting its freshness and superior salt ratio. Comments ranged from \"can't stop eating\" to \"perfect balance.\" One editor likened it to high school <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/game-day-super-bowl-recipes/\">football game</a> concession popcorn (positive), and another mentioned they expected it to be bland, but it wasn't. \"Our guy Orville knows how to salt,\" wrote another.  </p>\n    <h2>Best Better-For-You Popcorn: SkinnyPop Butter</h2>\n    <p>If you're looking for popcorn with minimal ingredients, this is your best bet. The brand avoids using common additives in microwave popcorn, including artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives. \"Yum!\" wrote one editor. Another said it had a nice butter-forwardness and a fresh, bouncy mouthfeel. One editor wrote, \"This is the buttery popcorn I'd serve my vegan friends\" (yes, it's <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/vegan-food-recipes/\">vegan</a>!). Another Delish staffer said it may even be better than their bagged popcorn, while someone else called it \"a personal fave.\"  </p>\n    <h2>Best Movie Theater Butter Popcorn: Orville Redenbacher's Movie Theater Butter</h2>\n    <p>If you're trying to recreate that classic butter-on-your-fingers vibe from the <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/food-news/a63267198/movie-theater-popcorn-buckets/\">movie theater</a>, this is the bag to grab. One tester wrote, \"My favorite. Very close to movie theater popcorn,\" while another echoed similar sentiments, saying it was a good replica of the real deal. The combo of salt and butter makes this a solid indulgent option if you want to that classic moviegoing feel.  </p>\n    <h2>Best Budget-Friendly Popcorn: Newman's Own Touch Of Butter</h2>\n    <p>Another high-scorer in our ranking was this simple option, which also happens to be one of the cheaper picks on this list. Editors noted the popcorn was very \"corn forward,\" and one person wrote, \"I love her so much.\" Others said it was a good classic because it was neither too salty nor too buttery (though it leans a bit more salty than buttery).</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/food/a67949033/best-microwave-popcorn-taste-tested/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Learn more about the </strong>\n      <strong>Delish app</strong>\n      <strong>.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>The beans:</strong><br/>Cannellini beans are usually my white bean of choice. Large and creamy, they’re amazing in everything from <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a57946/easy-white-chicken-chili-recipe/\"> chili</a> to </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a46341540/creamy-white-bean-dip-recipe/\">, and they serve as a perfect blank canvas here for the cheese and black pepper. That said, if you don’t have them, navy or great northern beans would also work well.</a>\n    </p>\n    <u>dips</u>\n    <p>While I typically rinse canned beans before using them, in this case, I recommend simply draining them. The excess canning liquid that clings to the beans will help thicken the sauce (see below!).</p>\n    <p><strong>The sauce:</strong><br/>Typical cacio e pepe pasta is thickened with a combination of cheese and starch from the pasta. Here we’re harnessing the starch of the beans to create a creamy, luscious sauce. The sauce will continue to solidify as it cools, but don’t worry: If it gets too thick, you can always loosen it up by adding a few tablespoons of water.</p>\n    <p><strong>Storage:</strong><br/>These beans are best the day they’re made, but any leftovers can be refrigerated for up to 3 days in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Since the sauce will thicken as it sits, I highly recommend adding a few tablespoons of water to the beans before reheating them.</p>\n    <p>Did you try making this?

Once licensed in one country, companies would be able to “passport” their services across the bloc without navigating a patchwork of local rules.</p><p>But less than a year into implementation, national regulators in countries including France, Italy, and Austria <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/france-block-passporting-unified-eu-mica-regulations\" title=\"null\">are voicing concerns</a> that passporting could encourage firms to choose jurisdictions with lighter oversight, a practice known as regulatory arbitrage.</p><p>“Regulatory competition in Europe is nothing new,” said Jerome Castille, head of compliance and regulatory affairs for Europe at CoinShares. </p><blockquote>“We saw retail trading platforms flock to Cyprus and Malta under MiFID. With MiCA, the expectation was that this time it would be different. But again, we kind of see firms choosing jurisdictions seen as more accommodating. And if people start thinking that not all licenses are equal, then the whole single market promise goes away.”</blockquote><p>The issue, according to Castille, is not a lack of rules but a lack of consistent implementation. “Europe already has a very high level of investor protection and probably the highest globally,” he explained. </p><blockquote data-ct-non-breakable=\"undefined\">“The real issue right now is ensuring that MiCA is fully implemented. Without formal guidance, national regulators are making their own call. That’s where divergence or even regulatory arbitrage comes from. If we get that right, the market becomes both safe and attractive for global players. If we don’t, innovation will look elsewhere.”</blockquote><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitgo-bafin-mica-crypto-trading-europe\" title=\"null\"><em><strong>BitGo secures license to launch regulated crypto trading in Europe</strong></em></a></p><h2>Little fish big pond</h2><p>For smaller firms, the rollout is proving particularly challenging. Marina Markezic, executive director of the European Crypto Initiative, noted that capacity gaps between regulators and the pace of new rules could squeeze startups out of the market. </p><p>“It is very intense to be compliant in a very short amount of time,” she said. </p><blockquote data-ct-non-breakable=\"undefined\">“For the biggest ones, having one single access to the whole European Union market is really positive. But unfortunately, for the smaller companies, it’s a really big burden and they might not survive this process.”</blockquote><p>While MiCA was Europe’s bid to lead on crypto regulation, its success will depend on whether the rules are applied evenly across the bloc. </p><p>As Markezic added, “There are 27 different national competent authorities supervising the same regulation. Some are bigger, some smaller, some more experienced, some less. It’s really a test for Europe to see if we’re able to supervise consistently.”</p><p data-ct-non-breakable=\"undefined\">Listen to the full episode of <em>Byte-Sized Insight</em> for the complete interview on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/podcasts/decentralize-with-cointelegraph\" title=\"null\">page</a>, <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/decentralize-with-cointelegraph/id1667543601\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"null\">Apple Podcasts</a> or <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/3ggY18n7dqoxPGljBdRFrj\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"null\">Spotify</a>.

This leads to strict reserve, disclosure and governance rules; algorithmic stablecoins are effectively banned. Scotti’s commentary indicates that she fears that a multi-issuance stablecoin may undermine the effectiveness of some of those rules.</p><h2>Stablecoins recognized as promising tools</h2><p>Scotti highlighted that the robustness of the multi-issuance stablecoin model “hinges on strong cross-border cooperation among supervisory authorities, including mechanisms to consistently monitor and verify the adequacy of reserves.”</p><p>She recognized that stablecoins are “promising tools for lowering transaction costs, enhancing efficiency and enabling 24/7 availability.” She argued, however, that only stablecoins pegged to a single fiat currency are suitable as payment instruments.</p><blockquote>“It is worth noting that while various types of crypto products are used as a means of payment, only stablecoins pegged to a single fiat currency are suitable for this function, also because they offer a high level of customer protection through the right to redemption at their nominal value.“</blockquote><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/italian-gov-ramp-up-surveillance-cryptocurrency-market\" rel=\"\" target=\"_self\" title=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/italian-gov-ramp-up-surveillance-cryptocurrency-market\"><em><strong>Italian gov’t to ramp up surveillance of crypto market</strong></em></a></p><h2>Italy takes firm stance on stablecoins</h2><p>Italian regulators have voiced concerns over the rise of stablecoins. <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/cryptocurrency-regulations-in-italy\" rel=\"\" target=\"_self\" title=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/cryptocurrency-regulations-in-italy\">Italy’s</a> financial markets regulator, Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa, joined regulators in France and Austria to call for <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/france-block-mica-passporting-eu-crypto-firms\" rel=\"\" target=\"_self\" title=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/france-block-mica-passporting-eu-crypto-firms\">regulatory supervision of crypto firms to be transferred</a> to the Paris-based European Securities and Markets Authority.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/digital-euro-not-mica-control-crypto-risks-bank-italy\" rel=\"\" target=\"_self\" title=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/digital-euro-not-mica-control-crypto-risks-bank-italy\">At the end of May</a>, Fabio Panetta, a former European Central Bank official and Governor of the Bank of Italy, suggested that a euro-based <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-cbdcs-a-beginners-guide-to-central-bank-digital-currencies\" rel=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-cbdcs-a-beginners-guide-to-central-bank-digital-currencies\" target=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-cbdcs-a-beginners-guide-to-central-bank-digital-currencies\" title=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-cbdcs-a-beginners-guide-to-central-bank-digital-currencies\">central bank digital currency</a> is the right tool for addressing the risks associated with increasing cryptocurrency adoption, rather than regulating cryptocurrencies.

That suggests the buyers are not rushing to the exit as they anticipate a move toward the all-time high of $124,474.</p>\n<p>BTC researcher Axel Adler Jr. said in a post on X that the “market is neither overheated nor oversold” at the current level. That could result in one to two weeks of consolidation before <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-has-70percent-chance-of-hitting-new-highs-in-2-weeks-analyst\" title=\"null\">BTC rises to a new all-time high</a>.</p>\n<p>Several analysts expect BTC to hit a new all-time high. Into The Cryptoverse founder Benjamin Cowen said in an interview that the rally could peak quickly after making a new high. Once the top is in, Cowen does not rule out <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-drawdown-bear-market-buying-dip-benjamin-cowen\" title=\"null\">a 70% fall in the next bear market</a>.</p>\n<p>Could BTC break out of its overhead resistance, pulling altcoins higher? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.</p>\n<h2>Bitcoin price prediction</h2>\n<p>BTC pierced the $117,500 overhead resistance on Thursday, but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels.</p>\n<p>The upsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($114,457) and the relative strength index (RSI) in the positive territory suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside. A close above $117,500 opens the gates for a rally to $124,474.</p>\n<p>Contrary to this assumption, a break below the 20-day EMA signals that the bulls are closing their positions in a hurry. The BTC/USDT pair could then drop to $110,000, remaining inside the $107,000 to $117,500 range for a while longer.</p>\n<h2>Ether price prediction</h2>\n<p>Ether (<a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\" title=\"null\">ETH</a>) has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating indecision between the buyers and sellers.</p>\n<p>If the price turns down and breaks below the support line, it signals that the uncertainty has resolved in favor of the bears. The ETH/USDT pair could collapse to $4,060 and, after that, to the pattern target of $3,426.</p>\n<p>Buyers will be back in the driver’s seat if they kick the price above the resistance line. That improves the prospects of the resumption of the uptrend. The Ether price could then rally toward the pattern target of $5,586.</p>\n<h2>XRP price prediction</h2>\n<p>XRP (<a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\" title=\"null\">XRP</a>) turned up from the 20-day EMA ($2.99) on Tuesday, but the bulls could not clear the overhead barrier at $3.20.</p>\n<p>The bears are striving to pull the price below the moving averages to seize control. If they succeed, the XRP/USDT pair could descend toward the strong support at $2.73. Such a move suggests the breakout above the downtrend line was a bull trap. A close below $2.69 will complete the bearish descending triangle pattern, clearing the path for a fall to $2.20.</p>\n<p>The bulls will have to push and sustain the price above $3.20 to signal a short-term trend change. The XRP price may then ascend to $3.40 and eventually to $3.66. </p>\n<h2>BNB price prediction</h2>\n<p>BNB (<a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index\" title=\"null\">BNB</a>) jumped over the psychological level of $1,000 on Thursday, indicating sustained demand from the bulls. </p>\n<p>The bears will try to defend the $1,000 level, but if the buyers prevail, the BNB/USDT pair could extend the rally to $1,090.</p>\n<p>The 20-day EMA ($915) is the critical support to watch out for on the downside. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to resume the up move.</p>\n<p>Sellers will have to pull and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA to signal strength. The BNB price may then collapse to the 50-day SMA ($855).</p>\n<h2>Solana price prediction</h2>\n<p>Solana (<a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index\" title=\"null\">SOL</a>) turned down from $253 on Thursday, indicating that the bears are aggressively defending the $260 level.</p>\n<p>The pullback is likely to find support at the 20-day EMA ($225). If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with force, the bulls will again attempt to clear the overhead hurdle at $260. If they manage to pull it off, the SOL/USDT pair could skyrocket toward $295.</p>\n<p>Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA suggests the bulls are booking profits. That could pull the Solana price to the uptrend line, which is likely to attract buyers.</p>\n<h2>Dogecoin price prediction</h2>\n<p>Dogecoin (<a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/doge-price-index\" title=\"null\">DOGE</a>) turned up from the $0.26 level on Tuesday, but the bulls are facing stiff resistance from the bears at $0.29.</p>\n<p>If the price rebounds off the $0.26 level again, it shows that the bulls are buying on every minor dip. That increases the likelihood of a break above $0.31. If that happens, the DOGE/USDT pair could start a new up move to $0.35 and subsequently to $0.44.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, a break below the 20-day EMA ($0.25) suggests that the bulls have given up. The Dogecoin price may then tumble to the 50-day SMA ($0.23). That could keep the pair range-bound between $0.21 and $0.29 for some time. </p>\n<h2>Cardano price prediction</h2>\n<p>Cardano (<a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ada-price-index\" title=\"null\">ADA</a>) turned down from the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle pattern, signaling that the bears are fiercely defending the level.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/price-predictions-9-19-btc-eth-xrp-bnb-sol-doge-ada-hype-link-avax?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p><strong>Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead.</strong></p><p>Grab a coffee because the year’s final stretch is shaping up to be pivotal for Bitcoin (BTC). With the Federal Reserve (Fed) beginning what looks like its rate-cutting cycle, analysts believe the pioneer crypto could be setting up for a record-breaking run.</p><h2>Crypto News of the Day: Analysts Eye $145,000 Bitcoin by December as Liquidity Shifts After Fed Cuts</h2>Sponsored<p>Bitcoin bulls are finding fresh momentum after the <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-rises-as-us-federal-reserve-opts-for-25bps-rate-cut/\">Fed’s September rate cut</a>, with analysts now projecting a potential year-end rally toward record highs.</p><p>With <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/feds-25bps-cut-labor-risks-inflation-liquidity-bets/\">liquidity dynamics shifting</a> and institutional flows accelerating, some analysts believe Bitcoin could end 2025 near the $145,000 mark.</p><p>John Glover, Ledn’s Chief Investment Officer, told BeInCrypto he expects a sharp move higher as investors reposition for a weaker dollar.</p><blockquote><p>“I’m forecasting a BTC price of circa $140,000 to $145,000 by year’s end. The rate cuts will help to push this narrative as money moves to BTC for safe haven among expectations of a USD devaluation,” Glover said.</p></blockquote><p>This forecast suggests a growing conviction that the Fed’s policy pivot will funnel capital into non-yielding, alternative assets like Bitcoin.</p><p>With real interest rates under pressure, digital assets are increasingly framed as macro hedges and liquidity beneficiaries. Jake Kennis, Senior Research Analyst at Nansen, echoed the bullish tone.</p><blockquote><p>“With the Fed cutting 25 bps and its projections indicating two additional cuts by December, the macro backdrop turns more supportive for Bitcoin into year-end,” Kennis told BeInCrypto.</p></blockquote><p>However, the Nansen executive articulated that the Fed’s path is not the only driver. In his opinion, end-of-year levels hinge more on real rates, dollar strength, liquidity, and broader market dynamics.</p>Sponsored Sponsored<p>Kennis highlighted that lower policy rates reduce the opportunity cost of <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/how-to-buy-bitcoin-in-four-easy-steps\">holding Bitcoin</a> and can ease financial conditions.</p><p>If real yields drift lower and <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-bitcoin-etf\">Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded funds)</a> inflows persist, he believes the “path of least resistance is higher.”</p><p>Still, Nansen’s Kennis warned that recessionary cuts could weigh on broader risk assets, potentially tempering crypto upside.</p><h2>Institutional Flows and Options Markets Signal Growing Confidence in Bitcoin</h2><p>Institutional participation also marks a major shift from previous cycles. <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/how-to-prepare-bitcoin-etf\">US spot Bitcoin ETFs</a>, alongside the rise of digital asset treasuries (DATs), reported in a recent <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/standard-chartered-ethereum-treasuries-us-crypto-news/\">US Crypto News</a> publication, have simplified allocations for funds, pensions, and corporates.</p><p>If the SEC finalizes a <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/altcoins-benefit-sec-new-etf-listing-standards/\">generic listing framework for spot digital-asset ETFs</a>, as reports suggest, product breadth could expand further, accelerating mainstream adoption.</p><p>Markets appear to be adjusting in real time. <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/rate-cut-roulette-0-25-50-bps-bitcoin-altcoins/\">Bitcoin has held above $115,000 in the post-FOMC rally</a>, with Glassnode data showing 95% of supply now in profit.</p><p><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-ethereum-options-expire-today-volatility/\">Options markets also reflect the bullish tilt</a>. Open interest has surged toward record levels ahead of next week’s massive September 26 expiry, where $18 billion in notional contracts come due.</p><p>While skeptics caution that <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/\">volatility</a> spikes and profit-taking remain likely, the narrative of rate cuts fueling Bitcoin as a macro hedge is gaining ground.</p><p>If Glover’s and Kennis’ projections hold, Bitcoin could run 24% above current levels by year-end and realize the $145,000 target.</p>Sponsored Sponsored<h2>Chart of the Day</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZNJaovz9/\">TradingView</a></p><h2>Byte-Sized Alpha</h2><p>Here’s a summary of more US crypto news to follow today:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/binance-cz-trust-wallet-token-twt-utility-roadmap/\">Binance founder CZ sparks 25% Trust Wallet Token (TWT)</a>rally after utility roadmap reveal.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-may-slide-down-to-105k-if-it-loses-this-level/\">Bitcoin may drop to $105,000</a>if it loses this level.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-ethereum-options-expire-today-volatility/\">Over $4.3 billion Bitcoin &amp; Ethereum options expire today</a>–<a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/\">Volatility</a>ahead for BTC and ETH?</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/upbit-lists-four-altcoins-ethfi-resolv-init-spk/\">Upbit expands market</a>with four new altcoin listings.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/cathie-wood-backs-300m-solana-deal-on-italian-soccer-team-owner/\">Cathie Wood backs $300 million Solana deal</a>on Italian soccer team owner.</li><li>This is why <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/cardano-traders-should-prepare-for-liquidations/\">Cardano traders should prepare for $73 million liquidations</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-price-dip-before-120k-journey/\">Bitcoin price hints at a 2% dip</a>before resuming $120,000+ journey.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/xrp-etf-launch-breaks-records-but-price-lags/\">XRP ETF launch breaks records</a>, but price lags behind market rally.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/kalshi-overtakes-polymarket-nfl-season-prediction-market/\">Kalshi overtakes Polymarket</a>as NFL season fuels $500 million prediction market surge.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/paypal-usd-stellar-xlm-price/\">PayPal USD officially launches on Stellar</a>– What does this mean for XLM price?</li></ul><h2>Crypto Equities Pre-Market Overview</h2><table><row span=\"3\"><cell><i>Company</i></cell><cell><i>At the Close of September 18</i></cell><cell><i>Pre-Market Overview</i></cell></row><row span=\"3\"><cell>Strategy (MSTR)</cell><cell>$349.12</cell><cell>$348.44 (-0.19%)</cell></row><row span=\"3\"><cell>Coinbase (COIN)</cell><cell>$343.13</cell><cell>$341.00 (-0.62%)</cell></row><row span=\"3\"><cell>Galaxy Digital Holdings (GLXY)</cell><cell>$33.08</cell><cell>$32.70 (-1.15%)</cell></row><row span=\"3\"><cell>MARA Holdings (MARA)</cell><cell>$18.50</cell><cell>$18.34 (-0.86%)</cell></row><row span=\"3\"><cell>Riot Platforms (RIOT)</cell><cell>$17.51</cell><cell>$17.39 (-0.71%)</cell></row><row><cell>Core Scientific (CORZ)</cell><cell>$16.75</cell><cell>$16.90 (+0.90%)</cell></row></table><p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/finance/\">Google Finance</a></p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/fed-rate-cuts-bitcoin-145000-us-crypto-news/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The firm warns that a failure to do so could lead to a drop to $105,500.</p><h2>Record Options Expiration Looms</h2><p>Glassnode’s data shows that fears of a major price decline have lessened since the Fed’s announcement. While the spot market showed some minor selling pressure, risk-off positions in the derivatives market noticeably increased.</p>Sponsored<p>Open interest in the perpetuals market has slightly decreased. Glassnode noted that open interest, which had peaked at 3.95 million BTC, has now dropped to 3.78 million BTC. An analysis of liquidation data shows that while <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/high-spread-between-bitcoin-derivatives-and-spot/\">short positions were squeezed</a> just before the rate announcement, the proportion of long position liquidations increased after the rate cut.</p><p>The potential for major <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/\">volatility</a> remains, however, as the open interest in the options market has hit a record high of 5 million BTC. A record amount of these options are set to expire next Friday, on September 26.</p><h2>Drop Below $115,200 Could Break Momentum</h2><p>Glassnode suggests paying close attention to the Bitcoin options’ “max pain” price. With both a price increase and decrease on the table, a large-scale liquidation event on either side could have a significant impact on the spot price.</p><p>The current <a href=\"https://%244.3%20Billion%20Bitcoin%20&amp;%20Ethereum%20Options%20Expire%20Today%20%20BeInCrypto%20https://beincrypto.com%20%E2%80%BA%20bitcoin-ethereum-options-expi...\">max pain</a> price for long positions is $112,700, while for short positions it’s $121,600. As of this article’s writing, Bitcoin’s price is fluctuating around $116,990.</p><p>Most of the Bitcoin traded on-chain since the September FOMC has been above $115,200. Glassnode states that maintaining this price level is key to preserving momentum, while losing it risks a drop to $105,500.</p><p>Ultimately, staying above $115,200 would maintain demand-driven momentum, while a drop below that level risks a retraction into the $105,500 to $115,200 range. Glassnode concludes that a comprehensive look at the on-chain signals suggests that market participants may be in a state of waiting for Bitcoin’s direction to be decided.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-may-slide-down-to-105k-if-it-loses-this-level/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

At press time, it was trading near $117,100, up 1.3% in the past 24 hours and 3% over the week. The breakout from a head-and-shoulders pattern on September 10 still points higher, with a first target of $120,800.</strong></p><p>But not everything is smooth. Two on-chain red flags, selling from large balance groups and younger coin holders, hint at a possible 2% correction before the rally resumes.</p><h2>Selling Pressure Builds From Large Balance Groups</h2>Sponsored<p>Two of Bitcoin’s biggest wallet groups have trimmed their holdings since September 15. These groups are often referred to as “whales” and “sharks” — wallets holding 1,000–10,000 BTC and 10,000–100,000 BTC, respectively.</p><ul><li>The 1,000–10,000 BTC group dropped their holdings from 4.35 million BTC to 4.33 million BTC.</li><li>The 10,000–100,000 BTC group fell from 2.17 million BTC to 2.16 million BTC.</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://app.santiment.net/charts/BK58RjBT__sCl\">Santiment</a></p><p>That’s a net outflow of about 30,000 BTC in just four days. With today’s <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-price-soars-following-fed-rate-cut/\">Bitcoin price</a> above $117,000, nearly $3.5 billion worth of BTC has been trimmed from holdings.</p><p><strong>Want more token insights like this? </strong>Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya’s Daily Crypto Newsletter <a href=\"https://go.beincrypto.com/4lUzHZj\">here</a>.</p><p>Such drops often signal that large investors are booking profits or preparing for <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/\">volatility</a>.</p><h2>Younger Coins Show Fresh Selling</h2><p>Another key on-chain signal confirms the picture: Spent Output Age Bands. This metric shows what percentage of coins from different “age groups” are being moved or sold. In other words, it tracks how much of the supply last moved weeks or months ago is now being spent again.</p><p>Over the past two weeks, every younger age cohort has increased its share of spent coins:</p><ul><li>1 week to 1 month holders: rose from 8.72% to 9.78%.</li><li>1 to 3 month holders: rose from 3.67% to 6.08%.</li><li>3 to 6 month holders: rose from 2.04% to 3.26%.</li><li>6 to 12 month holders: rose from 1.64% to 3.18%. (relatively younger considering BTC’s history)</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://studio.glassnode.com/charts/indicators.Soab?a=BTC&amp;mScl=lin&amp;s=1757047420&amp;u=1758257020&amp;zoom=14\">Glassnode</a></p><p>These cohorts are considered “younger” because they bought or moved their coins within the last year. Unlike long-term holders who keep Bitcoin for multiple years, younger holders are quicker to sell into Bitcoin price rallies.</p><p>The rise across all four bands means more short- to mid-term holders might be cashing out. This aligns with the selling already visible from the big balance groups, forming a clear picture of near-term supply pressure.</p><h2>Bitcoin Price Chart Still Points Higher, But With Risks</h2>Sponsored<p>Despite the selling signs, the broader technical setup remains bullish. <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-price-flag-breakout-hurdle/\">Bitcoin broke above</a> an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on September 10, and the breakout level has held since then.

For Bitcoin, the expiring options have a notional value of $3.5 billion and a total open interest of 30,208.</p><p>With a Put-to-Call ratio 1.23, the maximum pain level for today’s expiring Bitcoin options is $114,000.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.deribit.com/statistics/BTC/metrics/options\">Deribit</a></p><p>For their Ethereum counterparts, the notional value for today’s expiring ETH options is $806.75 million, with total open interest of 177,398.</p><p>Unlike Bitcoin, however, today’s expiring Ethereum options have a Put-to-Call Ratio (PCR) below 1, with Deribit data showing 0.99 as of this writing. Meanwhile, the maximum pain level, or strike price, is $4,500.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.deribit.com/statistics/ETH/metrics/options\">Deribit</a></p><p>The maximum pain point is a crucial metric in <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/crypto-options-trading/\">crypto options trading</a>. It represents the price level at which most options contracts expire worthless. This scenario inflicts the maximum financial loss, or “pain,” on traders holding these options. </p><p>Notably, today’s expiring Bitcoin and Ethereum options are <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-ethereum-options-expiry-4-billion/\">slightly higher than last week’s</a>. On September 12, BeInCrypto reported nearly $4.3 billion expiring options, highlighting 29,651 BTC and 189,700 ETH contracts, with notional values of $3.42 billion and $858.2 million, respectively.</p><p>However, the main difference between this week’s expiring options and those seen last week is that this time, Ethereum expiring options have a PCR below 1.</p><p>A PCR below 1 indicates that more Call (Purchase) options are traded than Put (Sale) options. Therefore, this suggests a bullish market sentiment for Ethereum, and bearish sentiment for Bitcoin, which has more Puts than Calls.</p><p>Nevertheless, Bitcoin’s PCR at 1.23 and Ethereum’s at 0.99 suggest an almost balanced bet among traders between sale and purchase orders.</p><p>This balanced outlook comes as investors speculate whether the market will move higher or are hedging their portfolios in case of a sell-off.</p><h2>Options Market Signals Caution After Fed Cut as Record Expiry Looms</h2>Sponsored<p>In hindsight, it is worth noting that options had repriced ahead of the <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/feds-25bps-cut-labor-risks-inflation-liquidity-bets/\">Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision on Wednesday</a>.</p><p>With this, implied <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/\">volatility</a> for options contracts rose while trading volume declined, suggesting market caution.</p><blockquote><p>“Options are repricing ahead of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate meeting, with implied</p><a href=\"\">volatility</a>on options expiring tomorrow rising significantly. Recent actual<a href=\"\">volatility</a>has also been substantial, showing a marked increase compared to last month, yet actual trading volume has declined instead,” analysts at Greeks.live had<a href=\"\">noted</a>.</blockquote><p>Glassnode highlights a post-rate-cut patience in the market, with Bitcoin trading above 115,200 and 95% of supply in profit after the <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-rises-as-us-federal-reserve-opts-for-25bps-rate-cut/\">FOMC rally</a>.</p><blockquote><p>“</p><a href=\"\">Futures</a>show short squeezes, and options open interest hit a record 500,000 BTC ahead of the September 26 expiry. Holding above 115,200 is key while a drop risks a move back toward 105,500,”<a href=\"\">wrote</a>Glassnode analysts.</blockquote><p>Meanwhile, it is worth noting that next Friday, September 26, the largest weekly Bitcoin options expiry in history will be seen. On that day, over $18 billion in notional value will expire.</p>Sponsored Sponsored<p>At the $118,000 Bitcoin price level, over $2.4 billion is in the money, with a maximum pain of $110,000. The Put open interest is minimal until $110,000.</p><p>Therefore, next week could be interesting. The margin usually drives short-term price action, so markets should not be surprised to see a flush despite the sentiment.</p><p>In the meantime, however, traders should brace for <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/\">volatility</a> because the max pain concept often influences market behavior.</p><p>According to the Max Pain theory, the asset’s price tends to gravitate toward this level as options near expiration.</p><p>As the options near their expiry time, 8:00 UTC on Deribit, the Bitcoin price, <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/price/bitcoin/\">trading for $117,147 as of this writing</a>, could pull toward its max pain at $114,000. Meanwhile, Ethereum, which was <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/price/ethereum/\">trading for $4,590</a>, could drop toward $4,500.</p><p>Nevertheless, markets usually stabilize soon after traders adapt to the new price environment. With today’s high-volume expiration, traders and investors can expect a similar outcome, potentially influencing market trends into the weekend.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-ethereum-options-expire-today-volatility/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

One to six individuals can come together to form an SMSF.</p>\n<p>SMSFs are largely unique to Australia.

These investors plan to allocate an average of $67,000 to cryptocurrency, indicating a growing mainstream interest in digital assets for retirement portfolios.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, OKX took the lead by launching its SMSF product in June 2025, and the demand has exceeded expectations. OKX’s advantage lies in its simplified approach, providing not only crypto access but also connecting clients with accountants and legal advisers to facilitate SMSF setup and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-okx-crypto-australia-retirement-system\">compliance</a>.</p>\n<p>These efforts highlight how global exchanges are tailoring their strategies to Australia’s distinctive retirement savings market, where the scale and regulatory environment position SMSFs as a key entry point for cryptocurrency adoption.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Digital assets held in Australian SMSFs\" src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/36d86b39596f23c8ae34451b82f50db2.jpg\" title=\"Digital assets held in Australian SMSFs\"></p>\n<h2 data-ct-widget=\"explained-block-title\">                Multiple catalysts behind the move of Coinbase and OKX            </h2>\n<p data-ct-widget=\"explained-block-content\">                </p>\n<p><em>The efforts of Coinbase and OKX to enter Australia’s SMSFs are fueled by local demand and global policy changes.

Globally, policy developments are lending credibility to this trend. For example, a US executive order allowing cryptocurrency inclusion in 401(k) retirement plans indicates that digital assets are becoming part of mainstream retirement strategies.</p>\n<p>This global context strengthens confidence among Australian investors and regulators. Together, these factors explain why exchanges like Coinbase and OKX view SMSFs as a key opportunity for incorporating cryptocurrency into long-term savings.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> In a US Securities and Exchange Commission filing in February 2021, Tesla declared that it had bought <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$1.5 billion</a> worth of BTC.

Stablecoin opposers point to <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/stablecoin-risk-crypto-transactions-bitrace-2024-report\" title=\"null\">transfers of illicit funds</a>. Proponents argue that the transparent nature of blockchains <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/debunking-the-myth-cryptocurrency-is-used-for-criminal-activity\" title=\"null\">can be used to detect such crimes</a>. </p><p>There is a lack of awareness of how a deep integration of stablecoins in global finance can drive the use of blockchain’s properties of immutability and transparency to fight financial crimes, even in traditional finance.</p><h2>The stablecoin story</h2><p>The stablecoin industry is going from strength to strength, aided by increased regulatory clarity and meaningful use cases. The ability to facilitate swifter, more cost-effective transactions than traditional banking rails has accelerated their adoption worldwide. The total value in circulation is <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/stablecoin-market-cap-surpasses-200-b-as-usdc-dominance-rises\" title=\"null\">estimated to be north of $200 billion</a>.<br></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-08/019864ed-c95d-78ba-83be-6bb720d761b7\" title=\"\"><figcaption><em>Average supply of stablecoins in circulation, across all stablecoins. Source: World Economic Forum.</em></figcaption></figure><p>We now have a host of <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/genius-stablecoin-bill-opens-door-for-big-tech-stablecoin/\" title=\"null\">tech</a> firms, <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/walmart-amazon-explore-stablecoins-payments\" title=\"null\">retail</a> giants and traditional financial institutions lining up to issue their own stablecoins. The payment economy might be on a metaphorical spiral staircase that runs back to pre-Civil War times. Back then, the US had hundreds of local banks, each issuing their own private currency to be used as legal tender. Despite being a part of everyday payments, those currencies were not accepted too far away from the issuing bank. In hindsight, this probably kept an unintended check on any attempt to obfuscate the money trail.</p><h2>Tracking illicit finance</h2><p>In contrast, with thriving crosschain interoperability, it can be safely assumed that users will not have to jump through hoops to convert one stablecoin to another or any other digital asset or off-ramp them to fiat. This vision of the near future, marked by unabated and instantaneous capital flows across jurisdictions, naturally translates to stringent regulations to address illicit finance. </p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/real-time-crypto-laundering-cex-vulnerabilities-report\" rel=\"\" target=\"_self\" title=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/real-time-crypto-laundering-cex-vulnerabilities-report\"><em><strong>Real-time crypto laundering exposes CEX vulnerabilities — Report</strong></em></a></p><p><a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/genius-act-legitimizes-stablecoins-institutional-adoption\" title=\"null\">Regulatory</a> guardrails for stablecoins mandate adherence to the highest standards of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance. Surprisingly, the prowess of stablecoins themselves, to beef up law enforcement’s fight against financial crime, is not yet a part of the crypto zeitgeist. </p><p>Stablecoins flowing across the globe on immutable, transparent, public blockchains add teeth to the global fight against illicit finance by providing traceability in international finance with a much-needed leg up.</p><h2>The old world</h2><p>The archaic structure of traditional finance severely handicaps counter-crime initiatives. This is primarily because each bank or financial institution is a walled garden, a closed ecosystem in which the central authority controls all accesses, processes and user experiences. </p><p>Compliance professionals at each such financial institution can only investigate financial activity that transpired strictly within the virtual walls of the organization. This is a sliver of any entity’s entire set of commercial dealings, as any firm or person typically engages with multiple financial institutions. </p><p>Any walled garden hosts only a partial picture of their customers. </p><p>Suspicious Activity Reports filed by each bank are based on an incomplete picture of their customers, potentially causing misreporting of risk levels. Additionally, this outdated predicament causes significant inefficiency for law enforcement agencies, as they must separately obtain access to records from each financial institution that the entity under investigation might have touched and then proceed to painstakingly stitch together the complete picture.</p><h2>The new world</h2><p>A world with agile, international capital flows on stablecoin rails will enable law enforcement to study suspicious patterns using unfragmented, reliable and transparent information gathered directly from blockchains. Tracing across jurisdictions will not entail navigating red tape.</p><p><br>On a more thought-provoking note, a robust stablecoin payment economy will induce routine capital flows from traditional finance organizations to blockchains and vice versa. </p><p>Proceeds from real-world offenses, such as human trafficking, drug peddling and violent crimes, and crypto crimes, such as decentralized finance hacks, ransomware and crypto scams, might be laundered across a combination of traditional finance and crypto products. </p><p>Using live data from blockchains in AML initiatives can provide prompt intelligence even on criminal organizations that primarily use banks to place the spoils of their crimes.</p><p>Case in point, in recent times, the financial crime of sanctions evasion has <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/russian-ruble-stablecoin-a7a5-grinex-link-garantex-ft\" title=\"null\">exhibited such patterns</a>, with sanctioned funds flowing interchangeably across both banking and stablecoin rails in an attempt to launder the same and dodge sanctions. </p><h2>The road ahead</h2><p>The emergence of a pervasive stablecoin infrastructure will do wonders to showcase to the global compliance community how the ubiquitous transparency of public blockchains enables lightning-fast, sophisticated responses toward preventing and detecting illicit finance.</p><p>This can spur much-needed cooperation between anti-crime divisions within traditional finance and crypto, with each sharing relevant intelligence for cross-pollination.</p><p>Custodians of conventional financial products have not yet recognized that metaphorical bread crumbs strewn across blockchains can be used as well-founded signals to infer user intent. A stablecoin industry, deeply integrated with the global banking system, will influence the use of these assets to make the universal financial network safer.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Debanjan Chatterjee, financial analyst.</strong></em></p><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\" type=\"\">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Speaking at the Chartered Professional Accountants conference in Ottawa, Morrow called for clear <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/senate-advances-genius-act-to-create-first-u-s-stablecoin-regulations\">regulations</a> to guide stablecoin usage. He stressed that as the digital asset market grows, Canadian regulators must act swiftly to maintain stability and security.</p>\n    <h2>Clear Rules Needed as Stablecoins Surge</h2>\n    <p><a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/jpmorgan-new-stablecoins-set-to-compete-with-circles-usdc-in-us-market/\">Stablecoins</a> have seen rapid growth in recent years, now handling transactions worth $1 trillion annually. <a href=\"https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2025/09/making-change-accelerating-payments-innovation/\">Morrow emphasized</a> that stablecoins, unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, are more reliable for everyday use. He noted that their value is tied to stable assets, such as national currencies, which reduces price instability.</p>\n    <p>Morrow pointed out that while cross-border payments are vital, they must also be secure and efficient. He explained that these digital currencies could help lower transaction costs and speed up international transfers. However, for them to be trusted as real money, Morrow stated, they need clear and consistent regulations.</p>\n    <p>He called on federal and provincial regulators to cooperate on creating comprehensive rules for stablecoins. As interest in these digital assets grows, Canada must align its approach with global standards.</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p/>\n      <i>“Stablecoins must be as safe and stable as the funds people hold in their bank accounts,” Morrow added.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <h2>Bank of Canada’s Approach to Payments Innovation</h2>\n    <p>Canada’s payment system has faced criticism for lagging behind global counterparts. Many argue that Canada’s banking infrastructure is slow, costly, and lacks competition. Morrow acknowledged these issues and stressed that Canada must modernize its payment system to stay competitive.</p>\n    <p>The Bank of Canada has explored digital currency options in the past. In 2022, it partnered with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to investigate a central bank digital currency. However, by September 2024, the Bank decided to focus on a real-time payment system for instant transfers.</p>\n    <p>Morrow indicated that the country’s slow pace in adopting new technologies must change. He urged the Canadian government and regulators to use the current momentum to drive innovation. Modernizing Canada’s payment system is essential to providing Canadians with faster, cheaper, and more secure services.</p>\n    <h2>Global Stablecoin Regulation and Canada’s Role</h2>\n    <p>The rise of stablecoins has been supported by clearer regulations in the United States. The recent <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/genius-act-loophole-risks-draining-small-banks-senator-warns/\">GENIUS Act</a> in the U.S. has provided more certainty to the market, encouraging wider adoption. Morrow believes Canada must take similar steps to ensure stablecoins are safely integrated into the country’s financial system.</p>\n    <p>With the rapid growth of digital assets worldwide, Morrow warned that Canada risks falling behind. He highlighted the need for regulations that foster innovation while ensuring security. The Bank of Canada’s role in shaping the future of stablecoins will be crucial as global payment systems continue to evolve.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/bank-of-canada-calls-for-stablecoin-regulations-amid-global-shift/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>While XRP celebrates its groundbreaking ETF launch and Cardano pushes forward with massive healthcare investments, both communities are experiencing something remarkable—yet incomplete.</p>\n    <p>These institutional wins represent genuine progress, but they also highlight the persistent technical barriers that prevent true blockchain revolution. The Layer Brett presale, <a href=\"https://www.layerbrett.com/\">having raised over $3.78 million</a>, offers something entirely different: a community-driven escape from these limitations through revolutionary Layer 2 technology that transforms passive crypto holding into active participation.</p>\n    <h2>The hidden scalability crisis: Why XRP’s ETF success and Cardano’s $200M healthcare investment can’t fix core blockchain bottlenecks</h2>\n    <p>XRP’s recent institutional momentum tells an incredible story. The first U.S. XRP ETF launched in September, followed by CME adding futures options in October. This institutional embrace signals mainstream acceptance that XRP believers have championed for years. However, beneath this celebration lies an uncomfortable truth: institutional adoption doesn’t solve the fundamental throughput issues that limit real-world utility.</p>\n    <p>Cardano faces similar challenges despite Charles Hoskinson’s ambitious $200 million healthcare initiative in Wyoming. While ADA maintains resilience around $0.87 with surging trading volumes, the project still grapples with the same scalability constraints that have plagued blockchain networks since inception.</p>\n    <p>Both communities deserve better than watching institutional money validate their investments while the underlying technology remains constrained. The question becomes: what happens when institutional demand meets infrastructure limitations?</p>\n    <h2>Layer Brett’s community-driven solution: How our Layer 2 technology delivers what XRP and ADA promise but can’t execute</h2>\n    <p>This is where the Layer Brett movement becomes revolutionary. Built on Ethereum Layer 2 architecture, Layer Brett delivers the speed and cost efficiency that XRP and Cardano communities have been waiting for. While traditional networks process transactions in seconds or minutes, Layer Brett operates at lightning speed with minimal gas fees—solving the exact problems that limit mainstream adoption.</p>\n    <p>The difference lies in approach. XRP and ADA built their solutions as monolithic networks, inheriting the scalability challenges that come with that architecture. Layer Brett leverages proven Layer 2 technology, creating a foundation that scales naturally with demand.</p>\n    <p>What makes this truly special is the community-first mentality driving development. Unlike corporate-controlled projects that prioritize institutional partnerships over user experience, Layer Brett emerges from genuine grassroots enthusiasm. The project combines meme culture energy with serious technical innovation, creating something that feels both accessible and revolutionary.</p>\n    <h2>Why Layer Brett’s 675% staking rewards create true community wealth</h2>\n    <p>Traditional crypto investing often feels passive—buy tokens, watch prices, hope for institutional validation. Layer Brett transforms this experience through active participation that generates real returns. The over 675% staking APY represents more than impressive numbers; it demonstrates how community-driven projects can redistribute wealth directly to supporters rather than institutional intermediaries.</p>\n    <p>Consider the viral potential: meme culture combined with legitimate utility creates unprecedented sharing incentives. XRP and Cardano supporters promote their investments hoping for price appreciation. Layer Brett community members share something more compelling—a project that rewards participation immediately while building toward long-term revolution.</p>\n    <h2>Join the Brett revolution: How our meme-powered Layer 2 ecosystem transforms you from crypto spectator to blockchain pioneer</h2>\n    <p>The opportunity window remains open, but momentum builds daily. <a href=\"https://www.layerbrett.com/\">At $0.0058 per token</a>, early supporters can access genuine Layer 2 innovation before mainstream discovery drives prices higher. This isn’t about following institutional lead—it’s about joining a movement that prioritizes community empowerment over corporate profit.</p>\n    <p>The comparison becomes clear: XRP and Cardano offer institutional validation and steady development progress. Layer Brett offers immediate participation in blockchain’s next evolution. While others celebrate external recognition, the Layer Brett community builds internal value through revolutionary technology and authentic collaboration.</p>\n    <h6>Connect your wallet and buy in today.</h6>\n    <p>Website: <a href=\"https://layerbrett.com\">https://layerbrett.com</a></p>\n    <p>Telegram: <a href=\"https://t.me/layerbrett\">https://t.me/layerbrett</a></p>\n    <p>X: <a href=\"https://x.com/LayerBrett\">(1) Layer Brett (@LayerBrett) / X</a></p>\n    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>This is a Press Release provided by a third party who is responsible for the content.

The company intends to allocate the funds after repaying outstanding promissory notes.

At the same time, he described the labor market as no longer “solid.”</p>\n<p>He cited hiring slowing, immigration shifts reducing supply, and AI adoption potentially weighing on entry-level jobs.</p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Powell’s remarks were even more dovish than his 2024 guidance when the Fed slashed rates by 50 bps. This suggests a deliberate pivot toward prioritizing employment over <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency/\">inflation</a>.</p>\n<h2>Market Reaction With Fed Divisions on Full Display: Dollar Slides, Equities Eye Liquidity</h2>\n<p>The new dot-plot revealed a central bank struggling to find consensus. Nine of 19 officials see two more cuts this year, while six expect no further easing.</p>\n<p>One member even projects a hike, while Trump appointee Stephen Miran dissented in favor of a 50 bps cut.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“This meeting was a mess…One member thinks the Fed hikes this year…another thinks we get five cuts. This rigging of the</p><a href=\"\">voting</a>to create the illusion of a ‘consensus’ and then publishing a wide dot plot like this only further undermines their credibility,”<a href=\"\">said</a>macro investment researcher Jim Bianco.</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/biancoresearch/status/1968439250325836134/photo/1\">Jim Bianco on X</a></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, The Kobeissi Letter called the move historic, highlighting the first rate cut in over 30 years with Core PCE <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency/\">inflation</a> above 2.9%.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s clear the Fed is prioritizing the labor market over</p><a href=\"\">inflation</a>,” Kobeissi<a href=\"\">wrote</a>, noting markets now expect as many as four more cuts by September 2026.</blockquote>\n<p>The immediate market response was swift. The US dollar fell to its weakest level since February 2022, while equities held near record highs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/perpetual-futures-contracts\">Futures markets</a> priced in at least two additional cuts by year-end, with Kalshi data showing the odds of three cuts spiking above 60%.</p>\n<h2>What Did the Markets Interpret from Powell’s Speech Yesterday?</h2>\n<p>Barchart highlighted that when the Fed cuts rates within 2% of stock market all-time highs, the S&amp;P 500 has historically risen 100% of the time over the following 12 months, averaging a 14% gain.</p>\n<p>Fidelity’s Jurrien Timmer compared the moment to the late-1998 LTCM crisis, when the Greenspan Fed eased into strong markets, fueling a spectacular rebound.</p>\n<p>Crypto markets are also watching liquidity flows closely, with analyst Ash Crypto highlighting prospects for more liquidity in the face of more rate cuts. This, he says, would translate into potential pumps for crypto prices.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“More cuts = More liquidity = pump,” the analyst</p><a href=\"\">wrote</a>.</blockquote>\n<h2>The Case for Caution</h2>\n<p>Still, not everyone is convinced the cut heralds an extended bull cycle. Mark Minervini argued the Fed’s move was a “token” cut. <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-us-cpi-fed-rate-decision-september/\">Given inflation’s persistence</a>, he says it is unlikely to set off an aggressive easing path.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Rate cuts are typically bullish, particularly when they occur outside of a recession. But the Fed is cutting preemptively rather than reacting to an outright downturn. That distinction matters: it lowers the likelihood of an aggressive easing path, which could diminish the market impact,” he</p><a href=\"\">noted</a>.</blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile, economists at The Conversation stressed the balancing act: cutting too quickly could reignite <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency/\">inflation</a>, while moving too slowly risks a sharper labor downturn.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/trump-tariff-appeal-crypto-market-impact/\">Tariff-driven price pressures</a> complicate the picture, particularly for lower-income households, who spend more on imported essentials that are now climbing in cost.</p>\n<p>Henrik Zeberg, a long-time cycle analyst, warned that markets may enter a euphoric blow-off phase before a severe downturn.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Liquidity now will only build a higher peak from which the market can crash,” he</p><a href=\"\">wrote</a>, likening today’s rally to late-1920s behavior.</blockquote>\n<h2>What Comes Next</h2>\n<p>The divergence between strong market technicals and weakening fundamentals leaves investors in a precarious position.</p>\n<p>Investors believe Powell has signaled further cuts are coming. Against this backdrop, sentiment is bullish, at least for now, with equities at records and crypto climbing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/price/bitcoin/\">BeInCrypto</a></p>\n<p>As of this writing, Bitcoin was trading for $117,107, while Ethereum exchanged hands for $4,572. Both assets showed strength following the Fed’s decision.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding, risks abound and continue to erode investor confidence. These include:</p>\n<ul><li>A labor market softening into recession,</li><li>Tariff-driven <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency/\">inflation</a>stickiness, and</li><li>Political overtones around Powell’s “risk management” framing.</li></ul>\n<p>If the Fed cuts too aggressively, it risks losing its <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency/\">inflation</a>-fighting credibility. At the same time, rising unemployment could force more drastic action later if it moves too cautiously.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the next few weeks for riskier assets like Bitcoin may be defined by liquidity-driven optimism. However, this is with the understanding that this rally rests on fragile ground.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/feds-25bps-cut-labor-risks-inflation-liquidity-bets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n<h2>1. Introduction: The Contrarian View of Today’s Crypto Market</h2>\n<p>The cryptocurrency market is currently in a state of flux. Headlines are dominated by discussions of regulatory crackdowns, government scrutiny, and failing projects. Combined with a dramatic reduction in retail interest, many have come to believe the golden days of crypto are over. However, this mindset often misses the true opportunity. When the hype fades and the noise dies down, seasoned investors see clear skies ahead.</p>\n<p>Contrarian investors—those who run counter to mainstream sentiment—recognize powerful opportunities in pessimism. While the masses exit the digital asset space due to fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), smart capital begins deploying quietly, focused on fundamentals and future utility. The current <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bear-market/\">bear market</a> isn’t a death sentence for crypto—it’s a reset. It clears overvalued protocols, washes out unsustainable business models, and paves the way for real innovation and resilience. Historically, bear markets have produced some of the market’s biggest winners, offering patient investors a chance to strike gold while everyone else is looking the other way.</p>\n<h2>2. Analyzing Hidden Investment Opportunities in Today's Crypto Landscape</h2>\n<p>Though Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the blue-chip players of the crypto ecosystem, the real innovation is happening beneath the surface. Savvy investors are now turning their attention toward infrastructure and protocol-layer solutions poised for long-term relevance. Innovations like <strong>zk-Rollups</strong>—specifically zkSync and StarkNet—are addressing essential scaling challenges, offering fast, cheap transactions on Ethereum while maintaining trustless security. These technologies are essential to onboarding the next billion users, representing asymmetric upside for those who invest early.</p>\n<p>Similarly, data protocols like <strong>Arweave</strong> and <strong>The Graph</strong> serve critical functions for decentralized ecosystems. Permanent, censorship-resistant data storage and data indexing should not be undervalued in a world increasingly focused on data ownership and freedom.</p>\n<p>Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization projects like <strong>Centrifuge</strong> and <strong>Maple Finance</strong> are bridging the gap between traditional capital markets and decentralized finance (DeFi). These platforms allow real assets—such as invoices, commercial real estate, or even art—to be tokenized, traded, and collateralized on-chain, opening doors for institutional investors and stable yield generation.</p>\n<p>Moreover, projects focused on regulatory compliance—sometimes dubbed <strong>RegFi</strong>—are increasingly relevant. As regulators crack down on opaque projects and demand transparency, tokens that are built around compliance and governance will likely be the first to welcome institutional inflows. <strong>Tokeny</strong> and <strong>Polymesh</strong> are examples of blockchains developed specifically to meet these stringent requirements, offering token lifecycle management, KYC/AML integration, and permissioned infrastructure for real-world finance. These aren't meme coins; they're the plumbing for the future of digital capital markets.</p>\n<h2>3. Balancing Risk vs. Reward in Cryptocurrencies</h2>\n<p>It’s no secret that the cryptocurrency market is volatile. While volatility scares off casual speculators, seasoned investors understand it as a double-edged sword—an opportunity for monumental returns if managed correctly. The key to thriving in crypto is not to eliminate risk, but to qualify and quantify it.</p>\n<p>Identifying risk involves a thorough analysis of factors including protocol security, the competency of the founding team, roadmap execution, regulatory developments, and token supply economics. For example, if a project has a highly inflationary tokenomic model, early investors may suffer significant dilution. Similarly, if a protocol’s core contracts are not audited or have a history of exploits, the risk outweighs the reward, no matter the upside.</p>\n<p>Investors can lower exposure and preserve capital with practical strategies such as diversification across different sectors (DeFi, infrastructure, gaming), geographic regions, and layer ecosystems (Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos). Being a <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/contrarian-investor/\">contrarian investor</a> also means staying disciplined in the face of fear and greed. Those who build robust investment frameworks, rather than chasing hype cycles, often outperform over time.</p>\n<h2>4. Smart Crypto Investment Strategies for 2024 and Beyond</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Value-Based Token Picking:</strong>Dig beyond token prices and market caps. Evaluate real protocol usage, developer contributions on GitHub, on-chain transaction growth, and native revenues. Tools like Token Terminal and CryptoQuant can be immensely helpful in conducting objective assessments.</li>\n      <li><strong>Cycle Positioning:</strong>History has shown that building positions during times of low sentiment offers the best ROI. Accumulate assets gradually when the mainstream is bearish, and scale out when sentiment flips positive. Avoid making emotional decisions based on social media hype or influencer shilling.</li>\n      <li><strong>Staking &amp; Yield Farming:</strong>Generate passive income through staking protocols like<strong>Lido</strong>and<strong>RocketPool</strong>, or explore emerging protocols such as<strong>EigenLayer</strong>that offer Ethereum re-staking capabilities. For less technical users,<a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/staking-as-a-service/\">staking-as-a-service</a>platforms handle the complexity while maximizing yields.</li>\n      <li><strong>Private Markets &amp; RegCF Access:</strong>Sites like<strong>Republic</strong>,<strong>SeedInvest</strong>, and<strong>Securitize</strong>allow accredited and sometimes retail investors to participate in early-stage token and equity rounds. These private placements often offer a much better entry point than post-IDO (initial DEX offering) price actions, especially in high conviction projects.</li>\n      <li><strong>Trend Tracking:</strong>Monitor emerging sectors like decentralized AI, real-world asset (RWA) financing, and undercollateralized lending. These niches may define the next trend cycles and create 10x+ opportunities in the coming bull market.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>5. Case Studies: Winning Against the Crowd</h2>\n<p>To understand the value of a contrarian approach, it’s important to study previous success stories where early investors bucked mainstream skepticism and reaped the rewards.</p>\n<p><strong>Chainlink (2018–2021):</strong> Dismissed by many early on as a niche project with limited utility, Chainlink proved essential to DeFi by providing oracle services that ensured trustless real-world data integration. As the DeFi sector exploded, Chainlink surged over 100x from its earlier valuations.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/crypto-investment-opps-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We’re thrilled to bring you another action-packed edition filled with the latest insights, trends, and market developments to help fuel your crypto journey. Whether you’re an experienced trader managing a diversified portfolio or a newcomer exploring the rapidly evolving world of digital assets, our newsletter is your go-to resource for reliable, up-to-the-minute information. Let’s dive deep into the movements that are shaping the landscape of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the ever-growing altcoin ecosystem.</p>\n<h2>Market Recap:</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Bitcoin (BTC):</strong>The flagship cryptocurrency is currently trading around $115,000, slowly approaching a major resistance level at $118,000. While some technical indicators point toward a consolidation phase, historical data suggests that Bitcoin often experiences a short-term pullback before breaking through critical resistance zones. Want to understand these cyclical movements better? Check out our detailed<a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/history-of-bitcoin-bull-bear-market/\">Bitcoin Bull Market</a>walkthrough and see how price tends to behave in the aftermath of halving events and macroeconomic shifts.</li>\n      <li><strong>Ethereum (ETH):</strong>Ethereum continues to show strength above a key ascending trendline, currently maintaining levels that signal upward momentum. The ongoing upgrade initiatives tied to Ethereum 2.0, including better scalability and energy efficiency, have bolstered investor confidence. As decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi platforms, and NFT marketplaces remain built atop Ethereum’s network, we anticipate growing demand and potential price appreciation.</li>\n      <li><strong>Altcoins:</strong>The broader altcoin market is mixed, with several tokens experiencing strong inflows fueled by announcements, partnerships, and community sentiment. From AI-powered crypto protocols to layer-2 scaling solutions, altcoins continue to carve out their own niches. Read more about specific sectors and promising projects in our in-depth<a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/altcoin/\">Altcoin investing guide</a>, which breaks down market caps, use cases, and tokenomics essentials.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>Featured Trend or Insight:</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>\"Is Bitcoin’s Growth Engine Losing Steam?\"</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>As institutional investors increasingly adopt Bitcoin and mainstream financial platforms offer BTC integration, the narrative around the premier cryptocurrency is shifting. Historically, Bitcoin’s price trajectory followed an exponential curve, driven by scarcity (only 21 million BTC will ever exist), halving events, and network expansion. But today’s market shows signs that this explosive growth may be tapering off. Analysts suggest that without groundbreaking innovation or new utility enhancements, BTC’s upside may become more limited.</p>\n<p>Transaction fees have begun to eclipse their past highs, and although Taproot upgrades vowed to bring more efficiency, the real-world benefits remain modest. Stablecoins, Layer 1 alternatives, and interoperability-focused ecosystems now draw users who might have once invested mainly in BTC. For those balancing risk with long-term potential, diversifying across sectors might be a smarter strategy than a Bitcoin-only bet. Don’t miss our comprehensive and data-driven piece on futuristic projections: <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bitcoin-btc-price-prediction/\">Bitcoin Price Predictions through 2030</a> — a must-read for forward-looking investors.</p>\n<h2>Top Gainers &amp; Losers:</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Top Gainer:</strong><i>Pump.fun (PUMP)</i>has gone parabolic, with daily trading volume surpassing an eye-popping $1 billion. This sudden surge has been largely driven by momentum traders and retail investors riding the memecoin craze. Community engagement, viral meme content, and listings on new exchanges have further accelerated FOMO. As always, meme-token investments are highly volatile, so proceed with caution.</li>\n      <li><strong>Top Loser:</strong><i>KindlyMD (KMD)</i>saw its token nosedive more than 55% in just 24 hours. This dramatic decline was traced to negative sentiment across forums and automated trading bots triggering stops after a swing trading alert flagged bearish patterns. Despite the broader market being relatively stable, KMD’s poor liquidity and negative momentum intensified the selloff. Always remember to manage risk and check token fundamentals before jumping in on hype-driven pumps.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>News Highlights:</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Bitcoin Reserve Bill Gains Momentum:</strong>High-profile bitcoiners like Michael Saylor and Cynthia Lummis are now collaborating to promote federal legislation proposing the inclusion of Bitcoin in national reserves. This bill could reshape future fiscal policy by establishing BTC as a digital gold standard. If passed, the bill would grant Bitcoin a powerful status on government balance sheets, bolstering its legitimacy worldwide.</li>\n      <li><strong>American Express Takes NFTs Global:</strong>Travel innovator meets blockchain tech — American Express has unveiled NFT-powered ‘passport stamps’ for its premium cardholders. These NFTs are not just collectibles, but also unlock exclusive travel perks and digital identity capabilities. This signals a bullish step forward in real-world applications of NFTs, especially with a major legacy financial institution leading the charge.</li>\n      <li><strong>XRP &amp; DOGE ETFs in the Pipeline:</strong>Investment firms have quietly begun filing preliminary paperwork for ETFs based on XRP and Dogecoin. If approved by regulatory watchdogs, these funds could open mainstream investor access to two of the most widely held altcoins. This move, while controversial to some, underscores how altcoins once viewed as niche or meme-based are entering institutional portfolios.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>On Our Radar:</h2>\n<p>Solana has caught our attention with its corporate treasury now exceeding $4 billion in value. This increase in reserves is a strong signal that enterprise adoption within the Solana network is beginning to materialize. As the ecosystem continues to grow, boasting faster transaction speeds and lower network costs than many competitors, institutional players are starting to take note. We’re keeping a sharp eye on Solana-based DeFi protocols and NFT marketplaces that are driving network utility beyond speculation.</p>\n<p>We're also monitoring rising activity around Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization — a sphere expected to grow exponentially as traditional finance integrates with blockchain infrastructure. Projects facilitating tokenized securities, real estate, and carbon credits are gaining traction fast. Expect to see this trend become a dominant force throughout 2024 and beyond.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/altcoin-news-2025-09-18t09-50-20-964z/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n<h2>Bitcoin ETFs: The Inevitable Catalyst Wall Street Ignored</h2>\n<p>As traditional financial giants increasingly establish a foothold in the digital assets space, <strong>Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)</strong> are rising to prominence as a strategic gateway to mainstream adoption. While most media focus remains tied to Bitcoin’s short-term price swings and volatility, many miss the deeper transformation taking place. We are witnessing a shift from a retail-dominated market to institution-driven, long-term capital inflow. And at the front lines of this seismic transition are Bitcoin ETFs — vehicles that offer regulated, familiar access to the decentralized financial frontier.</p>\n<p>For savvy investors who can look beyond day-to-day movements, Bitcoin ETFs are far more than just another investment product. These instruments represent a bridge between two financial worlds. On one side, we have Bitcoin, an asset born from distrust in centralized banking. On the other, we have legacy institutions whose very credibility lies in their regulatory compliance and risk management. The convergence of these forces marks a defining moment in crypto history — and yet, much of Wall Street remains stuck in cautious observation mode.</p>\n<h3>Why ETFs Matter More Than Ever</h3>\n<p>Exchange-Traded Funds revolutionized traditional finance by providing investors with transparent, liquid, and low-cost exposure to diversified assets. This democratization of investing is now arriving in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Spot Bitcoin ETFs give institutional and retail investors a streamlined, regulated channel for gaining exposure to BTC without requiring direct asset management, cold wallet storage, or understanding the technical nuances of private keys and blockchain confirmations.</p>\n<p>The implications are profound. Each ETF share backed by physical BTC represents a withdrawal of supply from circulation. Unlike derivative-based exposure or synthetic tokens, spot ETFs must purchase and hold real Bitcoin in reserve. This accumulation gradually reduces the liquid supply accessible on open exchanges. Over time, basic supply-demand economics suggest upward pressure on price. If demand remains consistent or increases while the available BTC on-market decreases, the value of Bitcoin is likely to rise — perhaps significantly.</p>\n<p>It's crucial to revisit <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bitcoin/\">what Bitcoin (BTC)</a> truly is. Far from just a speculative digital coin, Bitcoin is a provably scarce store of value, boasting a hard cap of 21 million coins. This scarcity, hardcoded in the protocol, resonates with institutional investors seeking an inflation-resistant hedge. ETFs, by facilitating large-scale exposure, are strengthening Bitcoin’s investment narrative as “digital gold.”</p>\n<h3>The Impact of ETFs on Bitcoin Price Dynamics</h3>\n<p>The disruptive effect of Bitcoin ETFs extends well beyond accessibility. Their emergence is transforming how Bitcoin’s price is discovered. Rather than the market being driven primarily by retail users reacting emotionally to tweets or media narratives, ETFs introduce steady and methodical capital deployment. Asset managers conducting large ETF purchases tend to follow strategic macroeconomic themes, execute on quarterly allocations, and make decisions based on diversified portfolio objectives rather than short-term hype.</p>\n<p>What this does is fundamentally dampen price volatility in the long term. Instead of wild swings caused by sudden mass sell-offs, institutional ownership lowers volatility through slower, more deliberate movements. When ETFs steadily accumulate during market dips, they add invisible price floors. This cushions downward pressure and builds institutional “support zones” that new investors rely on when entering the market. Conversely, recoveries are often sharper due to constrained liquid supply — especially if those ETFs choose to hold rather than sell for long durations.</p>\n<p>This shift creates a more stable environment, one that is more palatable to family offices, pension funds, and sovereign wealth managers. As traditional investors incrementally adopt Bitcoin through ETF vehicles, further confidence emerges, triggering a self-reinforcing feedback loop that drives long-term appreciation. The result? Bitcoin ceases to be viewed as risky speculation and starts to earn its place in conservative portfolios alongside gold, bonds, or broad equity indexes.</p>\n<h3>Recent ETF Inflows: A Contrarian Signal</h3>\n<p>In recent months, Bitcoin ETFs have experienced tremendous inflows, especially during periods of market uncertainty. Major institutional offerings such as BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF have each secured billions of dollars in assets under management (AUM) within a short span following their launch. This is far from a retail-fueled flash-in-the-pan; it is coordinated, methodical acquisition by power players.</p>\n<p>It’s worth noting that institutional adoption often trails retail speculation — but when the shift occurs, it often marks the start of a more sustained growth phase. The very nature of institutional investing is cautious, often waiting for regulatory clarity, auditor-reviewed structures, and liquidity depth before engaging. Now that those barriers are beginning to fall, we’re watching a crescendo of capital enter the market quietly, piece by piece.</p>\n<p>While some traders frame this as a \"top signal,\" arguing that once institutions buy, most returns are priced in, history tells a different tale. Institutional investors are rarely early — but when they do arrive, they often make up for lost time by deploying large capital allocations strategically over time. This steady absorption sets up for constrained supply conditions and can lead to massive appreciation.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n    <h2>The Commodity Class Is Law</h2>\n    <p>In a market clouded by uncertainty, one truth has already been established: Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies belong to the commodity class.<br/>The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and federal courts have ruled repeatedly that Bitcoin is a commodity under the Commodity Exchange Act. The CFTC v. McDonnell (2018) decision and CME’s regulated Bitcoin futures contracts leave no doubt — Bitcoin trades under the same legal framework as gold, oil, or wheat.<br/>In January 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reinforced that status by approving spot Bitcoin ETFs as Commodity-Based Trust Shares. The commodity class isn’t theory — it’s defined law.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://cdn.getmidnight.com/13448471d89a9cd8d7f71026a0334ec8/2025/09/POW.jpg\"/>\n    <h2>The Golden Lineage of Proof-of-Work</h2>\n    <p>Bitcoin was the genesis: digital gold with no issuer, no premine, no promises. But the lineage didn’t stop there. Other proof-of-work assets carried forward the same DNA: decentralization, fair mining, and issuance without corporate control.<br/>This is the Golden Lineage — assets that regulators and markets consistently treat as commodities, not securities. And critically, there are only four Proof-of-Work coins launched before 2015 that fully hold to what many call the King’s Law: Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Vertcoin. These are the foundation stones of the commodity class.</p>\n    <h2>Litecoin: The Silver Signal</h2>\n    <p>If Bitcoin is gold, Litecoin is silver. With faster block times and over a decade of survival, Litecoin has proven itself as a foundational proof-of-work asset.<br/>Now, it has stepped into Bitcoin’s regulatory shadow. In 2025, major exchanges filed for spot Litecoin ETFs, explicitly building on Bitcoin’s commodity precedent. This marks Litecoin as the signal — proof that the commodity class is expanding beyond BTC.</p>\n    <h2>Dogecoin: The Cultural Commodity</h2>\n    <p>Dogecoin adds another branch to the lineage. Born as a meme, it evolved into one of the most mined and most traded proof-of-work assets. No premine, no ICO, and a global community have ensured its survival.<br/>Dogecoin demonstrates that even culture-driven coins can achieve commodity status when they are decentralized, mined fairly, and operate without an issuer.</p>\n    <h2>Vertcoin: The Overlooked Heir</h2>\n    <p>This brings us to the hidden gem in Bitcoin’s lineage: <a href=\"https://vertcoin.org\">Vertcoin (VTC)</a>.<br/>Launched in 2014 with no ICO, no premine, and no centralized control, Vertcoin was designed for one mission: true decentralization. Unlike most networks, it remains ASIC-resistant, keeping mining accessible to everyday participants and aligned with Satoshi’s vision of a people-powered network.<br/>By structure, Vertcoin belongs to the same commodity class as Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin:<br/>- Proof-of-Work secured<br/>- Decentralized, no issuer promises<br/>- Fair distribution, no premine or ICO<br/>- Recognized trading markets, fungible and uniform<br/>Yet unlike BTC, LTC, and DOGE, Vertcoin trades far below the spotlight. That gap between commodity-class certainty and market recognition is what makes it the golden opportunity.</p>\n    <h2>The Family Tree Is Written — The Advantage Is Hidden</h2>\n    <p>- Bitcoin: defined as a commodity by law and futures markets.<br/>- Litecoin: signaling commodity expansion through ETF filings.<br/>- Dogecoin: the cultural commodity with scale and community.<br/>- Vertcoin: the overlooked heir, built on the same DNA, still waiting for recognition.<br/>Certainty is rare in crypto — Bitcoin and Litecoin have it. Dogecoin proved it culturally. Vertcoin, the fourth member of the pre-2015 lineage that holds the King’s Law, won’t stay hidden forever.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bitcoin-defined-it-litecoin-etfs-validate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Traditional capitalism is experiencing a profound transformation, one that is redefining the very fabric of global financial systems. At the forefront of this seismic shift is cryptocurrency—a decentralized, borderless, and permissionless paradigm that operates beyond the control of traditional banking infrastructures and central governments. Cryptocurrencies are not just digital assets anymore; they have evolved into foundational elements of an emerging economic order that many are calling <i>Capitalism 2.0</i>.</p>\n<p>This new financial architecture is driven by an ethos of open-source collaboration, decentralized governance, and blockchain-based transparency. Central banks are being challenged by algorithmic stablecoins. Wall Street is competing with decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Institutional investment portfolios now include tokens, and venture capital is pouring billions into Web3 projects. As the lines blur between traditional and digital finance, it’s becoming clear that crypto is not a trend—it’s the next evolution of capitalism itself.</p>\n<h2>Investing in the Crypto Market</h2>\n<p>The cryptocurrency market is a highly dynamic ecosystem characterized by 24/7 trading hours, immense innovation, and often extreme volatility—all of which create both unparalleled opportunities and substantial risks for investors. The key to navigating this explosive environment lies in understanding its nuances and being able to identify asymmetric investment opportunities before they go mainstream.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bitcoin/\"> Bitcoin (BTC)</a> continues to be the gold standard of digital assets. As the first and most secure blockchain, it offers scarcity through its capped supply and attracts interest from both retail and institutional investors alike. </p>\n<p><strong>Ethereum (ETH)</strong>, with its support for smart contracts and thriving DeFi ecosystem, remains a high-conviction long-term hold. However, the most compelling alpha often lies beyond the blue chips—in emerging sectors and novel protocols.</p>\n<p>Investors today are pouring capital into a range of next-generation projects such as <strong>Layer 2 scaling solutions</strong> that tackle Ethereum’s congestion and high transaction fees. Optimism, Arbitrum, and zkSync are gaining traction for enabling faster and cheaper transactions. Meanwhile, AI-integrated blockchain platforms like Fetch.ai and SingularityNET are creating synergistic environments where machine learning intersects with secure, decentralized data infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The modular blockchain thesis is another strong narrative capturing investor attention. Networks like Celestia and Cosmos build composable ecosystems where components can be decoupled and customized, enabling faster innovation and higher performance at scale. Combine these with DAO-based governance models, and you're looking at investment potential akin to early-stage tech startups—with added liquidity and community participation.</p>\n<h2>Understanding the Market Trends</h2>\n<p>Understanding macro and micro trends in the cryptocurrency space is essential for investors who aim to stay ahead of the curve. Several important movements are currently shaping the landscape, indicating a sustained and widespread integration of blockchain technology into mainstream finance.</p>\n<p>First, the introduction of <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bitcoin-etf/\"> Spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> in multiple jurisdictions marks a milestone in regulatory acceptance. These instruments have opened the door for institutional investment, providing exposure to Bitcoin without requiring direct custody. As inflows rise, so does market legitimacy, creating a flywheel effect that enhances mainstream adoption.</p>\n<p>Another critical trend is the ongoing tokenization of <strong>real-world assets (RWAs)</strong>. From tokenized real estate and equities to fractionalized art and bonds, blockchain technology is making traditionally illiquid assets tradeable in seconds. This unlocks capital efficiency and democratizes access to markets previously reserved for elites.</p>\n<p><strong>Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</strong> continues to evolve, now moving towards more sustainable yield mechanisms and refined tokenomics. Protocols are focusing on utility-driven staking, insurance against smart contract risks, and integration with real-world data sources through oracles. Additionally, compliance layers are being introduced to satisfy regulatory criteria without compromising decentralization.</p>\n<p><strong>NFTs</strong> are also undergoing a transformation. No longer just speculative art pieces, NFTs are being utilized in gaming ecosystems, intellectual property management, ticketing systems, and even decentralized identity solutions. This diversification is expanding their utility and reducing their volatility over time, making them a more compelling investment segment again.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, as governments and regulators increase their involvement, crypto-native developers are responding with a renewed emphasis on decentralization and censorship resistance. This cat-and-mouse dynamic is driving innovation at a staggering pace—and keeping the market vibrant and investor-focused.</p>\n<h2>Maximizing Profits</h2>\n<p>To generate meaningful profit in the crypto space, investors must move beyond conventional strategies and embrace a contrarian, data-driven approach. Simple buy-and-hold tactics may yield modest returns, but the true potential lies in dynamic allocation, risk hedging, and capital deployment tailored to market cycles.</p>\n<p>One core strategy is adopting a <strong>contrarian mindset</strong>. Profits often emerge from making informed moves when sentiment is at its lowest. History has shown that buying during market capitulations—when “fear” dominates social metrics and sentiment indicators—can yield exponential gains when market confidence returns. Conversely, taking profits during irrational exuberance can protect capital and allow reentry at lower prices.</p>\n<p>Using on-chain analytics tools like Nansen, Glassnode, and Dune Analytics can offer invaluable insights into wallet activity, token supply changes, exchange inflows/outflows, and smart contract interactions. This data-driven approach can uncover accumulation patterns, early project momentum, and whale movements that often precede breakout rallies.</p>\n<p>Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) provide early access to nascent tokens often before centralized listings. By utilizing liquidity pools, you can engage in yield farming, liquidity provision, and token staking—but always with a security-first mindset. Smart contract auditing, impermanent loss mitigation, and thorough whitepaper evaluation are essential to prevent common pitfalls.</p>\n<p>Adopting strategies like <strong>dollar-cost averaging (DCA)</strong> into high-conviction assets during bearish periods allows investors to manage risk while building exposure gradually. Periodic rebalancing of the portfolio in bull markets can help lock in gains and maintain a diversified risk profile.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/crypto-capitalism-2-profit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>In an economic landscape marred by rising inflation and diminishing real returns from traditional financial instruments, crypto presents a disruptive alternative for savvy investors—<strong>yield-bearing stablecoins</strong>. These assets are far more than just digital representations of the U.S. dollar; they are engineered on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to <i>generate ongoing, passive income</i> with minimal price volatility. As we move into 2025, yield-bearing stablecoins are becoming a transformative force, enabling individuals to monetize idle liquidity without the red tape of conventional banking systems. With a few clicks, investors can earn real yield while retaining the dollar-peg stability they trust—this is income on autopilot, redefined for the digital age.</p>\n<h2>The Growing Importance of Passive Income</h2>\n<p>Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a crypto newcomer, one investing truth remains evergreen: <strong>the power of passive income compounds over time</strong>. This principle becomes even more essential during extended bear markets, where portfolio prices fall, market sentiment nosedives, and liquidity becomes elusive. Traditional strategies often falter under such conditions, but passive income allows investors to weather volatility by providing steady, reliable returns.</p>\n<p>Yield-bearing stablecoins address this need elegantly. They offer a mechanism to earn yield without the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. In downturns, when price action becomes unpredictable or outright hostile, predictable earnings from these digital instruments serve as a stabilizing force. Whether you're taking a conservative approach or diversifying across high-risk altcoins, passive income can cushion losses and even provide a basis for reinvestment. In fact, some of the most profitable DeFi portfolios have been carved out and grown during periods when the rest of the market stalled or retraced.</p>\n<h2>What Are Yield-Bearing Stablecoins?</h2>\n<p>To understand their value, we need to differentiate basic stablecoins from their yield-generating cousins. Standard stablecoins like USDC and USDT simply act as blockchain-based representations of fiat currency. They are typically used for transfers, trading, or holding value. However, they offer <i>zero yield</i>—unless manually deployed into DeFi yield farms, lending platforms, or liquidity pools. That’s where <strong>yield-bearing stablecoins</strong> redefine the model.</p>\n<p>Examples like <strong>yETH</strong> from Yearn Finance, <strong>aUSDC</strong> issued by Aave, and <strong>sDAI</strong> via Spark Protocol accumulate interest directly from underlying strategies. When you hold these tokens, you participate in lending markets, staking mechanisms, or automated DeFi strategies without doing the heavy lifting yourself. These assets are programmatically designed to capture yield from verified DeFi sources and automatically rebalance for maximum efficiency. There is no need for staking, locking periods, or gas-intensive interaction with smart contracts. These stablecoins offer set-it-and-forget-it convenience.</p>\n<p>Because their earnings are embedded in the token design, yield-bearing stablecoins also benefit from composability across protocols. They can be used as collateral, integrated into vaults, or supplied to other apps where they continue earning—turning one financial position into a multitasking income engine.</p>\n<h2>Key Factors That Influence Yield Generation</h2>\n<p>Not all yield-bearing stablecoins are created equal. The source and sustainability of the yield, along with other macro and technical indicators, greatly affect how much you can earn and how secure your position really is.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Protocol Risk:</strong>The foundational risk rests within the protocol generating the yield. Is the core revenue derived from lending, validator staking, or liquidity provision? Or is it based on inflationary token emissions that could dry up overnight? Sustainable yield comes from value-generating activity, not financial engineering.</li>\n      <li><strong>Adoption and Total Value Locked (TVL):</strong>A higher TVL often signals trust and usage volume but can also compress yields as more users chase limited returns. Conversely, emerging protocols may offer higher APYs but carry greater implementation or security risk.</li>\n      <li><strong>Smart Contract Optimization:</strong>Yield-bearing stablecoins rely on automation, and the quality of the smart contracts determines performance. Solutions that include real-time rebalancing, adaptive fee routing, and smart reinvestment strategies usually outperform more static alternatives.</li>\n      <li><strong>Asset Backing and Transparency:</strong>Some tokens are fully collateralized with high-grade assets or deploy clear rate models with strong reserves. Others mix loose asset backing with speculative tokenomics—often hiding risks. Thorough due diligence is not optional; smart investors demand clarity, particularly in hectic markets.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>In sum, reliable passive income is about both yield and risk. An attractive APY means little if capital is at risk due to an insecure or mismanaged platform.</p>\n<h2>Risks and Considerations</h2>\n<p>Despite the appeal of passive earnings, <strong>there are risks involved</strong>. Soft rugs, smart contract exploits, protocol governance failures, and depegging events can all significantly impact returns—or wipe them out entirely. Yield-bearing stablecoins may appear stable on the surface but often carry hidden systemic risk.</p>\n<p>For example, some protocols incentivize users with their native tokens—boosting APYs temporarily without a true revenue source. When those juicy rewards disappear, so does your yield. Others rely on overly leveraged strategies that can unwind during black swan events. Additionally, many platforms lack open auditing, limiting users’ ability to verify where yield truly originates.</p>\n<p>This is where <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/contrarian-investor/\">contrarian investing</a> becomes powerful. Smart investors dig past the buzz, analyze fundamentals, and form independent theses. They test and question token mechanics, examine revenue models, and utilize risk-adjusted positions.

Meanwhile, mortgage costs have risen 91.9% in the same period.</p><blockquote><p>“Costs to buy have gone up four times faster than incomes. Not sustainable,” Gerli</p><a href=\"\">wrote</a>.</blockquote><p>Other commentators, including Darth Powell and <a href=\"https://x.com/neilfromsa/status/1968127071240196129\">Neil</a>, pointed to skyrocketing late rental payments. There is also a growing struggle for homeowners to keep pace with monthly bills.</p><p>Meanwhile, Polymarket and Barchart data <a href=\"https://x.com/Polymarket/status/1967951468629225551\">show</a> that searches for mortgage help have surpassed 2008 levels. This reflects how financial stress is spreading beyond renters to homeowners.</p><p>With affordability collapsing, home-buying activity remains muted even as credit conditions tighten.</p>Sponsored Sponsored<h2>FHFA’s Crypto Experiment Pushes Adoption, But With Strings Attached</h2><p>Against this backdrop, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-mortgages-housing-credit-us-crypto-news/\">attempted to ease access to credit in June</a> by allowing Bitcoin and certain cryptocurrencies to count as assets for mortgage eligibility.</p><p>The move applies to applicants through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It marked the <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/fhfa-crypto-mortgage-loan-assessment/\">first time the federal mortgage system formally recognized crypto</a> in asset assessments.</p><p>However, the program had limitations. Only crypto held on US-regulated custodial exchanges qualifies, while Bitcoin in cold storage, multisig setups, or self-custody wallets does not.</p><p>Applicants can also not pledge these assets as collateral, as crypto holdings count toward net worth in the assessment process.</p>Sponsored<p>Critics argue that the approach undermines Bitcoin’s core principle of self-sovereignty.</p><blockquote><p>“It looks like bitcoin held in self-custody will NOT count as an asset for consideration on home loans. This is a mistake Pulte; self-custody is fundamentally aligned w/American values. It’s trivial to prove ownership of BTC in self-custody,”</p><a href=\"\">wrote</a>self-custody expert Nick Neuman.</blockquote><p>Bitcoin financial services firm Swan echoed the concern. While Swan acknowledged the move as a win, it recognized the limitations.</p><p>Bitcoin does not exist in the eyes of mortgage underwriters unless it is visible on state-regulated custodial platforms.</p><p>For Swan, this reflects a larger pattern: first ignoring crypto, then adopting it, but only on terms designed for control.</p><p>Notwithstanding, supporters hold that the FHFA’s recognition still marks a breakthrough. By including crypto assets without requiring conversion to US dollars, the agency gave digital assets a foothold in one of America’s most systemically important markets.</p><p>For crypto holders, especially those who may be cash-poor but asset-rich, this could open a path to qualifying for mortgages that would otherwise be out of reach.</p><p>Still, the housing crisis highlights the limits of crypto’s role. The recognition came just as housing stress surged to levels unseen since 2008, and the narrow scope of eligibility means Bitcoin is unlikely to provide widespread relief.</p><p>Instead, crypto’s integration into mortgage credit may remain a niche tool.</p><p>On the one hand, it is symbolic of broader financial convergence. On the other hand, it remains far from a solution to the affordability crisis gripping American households.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/us-housing-crisis-bitcoin-mortgage-role-limited/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

This positions it as a major player in the digital asset treasury space. However, the firm’s stock fell 28% after the news, highlighting investor caution.</p><h2>GD Culture Group on Its Way to Become 14th Largest Corporate Bitcoin Holder</h2>Sponsored<p>In the latest press release, GD Culture Group noted that the acquisition was approved by a majority of its shareholders under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d) and the Nevada Revised Statutes. As part of the deal made on September 10, the company will issue approximately 39.2 million shares<a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/top-apps-for-trading-stocks-in-the-us\"> of common stock</a> in exchange for Pallas Capital’s assets.</p><p>This includes the 7,500 BTC free of encumbrances. At current<a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/price/bitcoin/\"> market prices</a>, the stack is valued at $879 million. Notably, these holdings could position GDC as the 14th largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally. </p><p>According to <a href=\"https://bitcointreasuries.net/\">data</a> from Bitcoin Treasuries, the firm could surpass entities like <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/solana-hits-8-month-high-amid-galaxy-purchases/\">Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd,</a> which has 6,894 BTC.</p><p>Xiaojian Wang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of GD Culture, emphasized that the move places GDC in a strong position to benefit from Bitcoin’s expanding importance as both a store of value and a preferred asset for institutional reserves.</p><blockquote>Sponsored<p>“The acquisition of Pallas Capital marks a significant advancement in GDC’s digital asset treasury strategy. It directly supports our initiative to build a strong and diversified crypto asset reserve by acquiring scalable, high-value digital assets. When we integrate these assets, we are building the reserves necessary to execute on our digital asset strategy with both stability and growth potential,” Wang</p><a href=\"\">stated</a>.</blockquote><p>According to the executive, the deal is projected to enhance shareholder value. Furthermore, it will accelerate the company’s efforts to solidify its position in the digital asset market. Meanwhile, this acquisition comes after the company <a href=\"https://gdculture.gcs-web.com/node/8221/pdf\">announced</a> in May that it planned to sell $300 million in common stock. </p><p>The proceeds were earmarked to support its crypto treasury strategy, including the purchase and long-term holding of Bitcoin and <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-trump-coin/\">Official Trump (TRUMP) tokens.</a></p><h2>GDC’s Bold Strategy Meets Market Resistance</h2><p>Nonetheless, the firm’s latest move was met with investor skepticism. Google Finance data showed that GDC stock closed at $6.99, down 28%. In pre-market trading, stock prices saw a modest recovery of 3.72%.</p>Sponsored<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/finance/quote/GDC:NASDAQ\">Google Finance</a></p><p>This response mirrors broader pressures on Bitcoin treasury companies in September 2025. <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/nxtt-naka-stocks-bitcoin-treasury-losses/\">BeInCrypto reported that yesterday, firms</a> like Next Technology Holding (NXTT) and KindlyMD (NAKA) saw stock declines of 4.79% and over 55%, respectively. </p><p>Furthermore, <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/are-dat-firms-fueling-the-next-crypto-meltdown/\">digital asset treasuries (DATs) </a>have experienced collapsing market net asset values (mNAVs) for <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/dats-crypto-assets-losing-purchasing-power-september/\">three consecutive months</a>, underlining struggles to maintain purchasing power.</p><p>Despite this, Alexander Blume, Founder and CEO of Two Prime, noted that upcoming macroeconomic triggers could impact Bitcoin treasury companies.</p>Sponsored<blockquote><p>“The Fed’s decision this week will surely have an impact on risk assets, Bitcoin included. The outcome will largely depend on whether the intervention is too late to protect the labor markets. The labor market is slowing, but I wouldn’t call it a crisis yet. If that remains the base case, I suspect a 25bp cut over the next several quarters will be largely constructive for risk assets, including Bitcoin. By cutting, it creates room for other central banks to cut interest rates, aiming to keep their own currencies competitive with the dollar,” he said.</p></blockquote><p>In a statement shared with BeInCrypto, Blume explained that <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/rate-cut-roulette-0-25-50-bps-bitcoin-altcoins/\">a rate cut</a> would be positive for corporate BTC vehicles. Why? Because it can lift BTC prices and attract new funding towards risk assets. </p><p>Many of these firms rely on financing through PIPEs (Private Investments in Public Equity) and convertible debt, where investors expect to cycle in and out profitably. Thus, he added that,</p><blockquote><p>“The prospect of a continued bull market emboldens them to continue participating as well.”</p></blockquote><p>Thus, GDC’s acquisition of Pallas Capital highlights the growing trend of companies doubling down on Bitcoin reserves, even as the stock shows<a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility\"> signs of volatility.</a> While investor skepticism remains evident in GDC’s stock performance,  macroeconomic conditions and Bitcoin’s long-term value might validate its treasury strategy.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/gd-culture-group-bitcoin-treasury-acquisition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p><strong>The Federal Reserve announced today a cut in interest rates by 25 basis points, citing unsteady labor market conditions and increased  inflation. </strong></p><p>For the typical American, these rate cuts mean lower borrowing costs and may be a positive catalyst for the crypto market. However, the decision also carries intensified <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency/\">inflation</a> risks and increased concerns over the Fed’s independence.</p><h2><strong>Fed Cuts Rates for the First Time in 9 Months</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin’s price held steady immediately after the <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/federal-reserve-resume-interest-rate-cuts/\">US Federal Reserve cut interest rates</a> by 25 basis points on Wednesday.</p><p>The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) did what many economists and traders predicted: It cut the benchmark federal funds rate to a lower range of between 4.00% and 4.25%. This is the first rate cut in nine months, and follows a 25 basis-point cut in December 2024.</p><p><a href=\"https://polymarket.com/dashboards/fed-rates\">Polymarket</a>.</p><blockquote><p>“In support of its goals, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4 to 4-1/4 percent,” the Federal Reserve said in a</p><a href=\"\">statement</a>. “Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year. Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low.<a href=\"\">Inflation</a>has moved up and remains somewhat elevated.”</blockquote><p>Regarding the possibility of further rate cuts, it said:</p><blockquote><p>“In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.”</p></blockquote><p>The decision’s impact on Bitcoin may also positively affect the rest of the crypto market in the coming days.</p><h2><strong>A Positive Catalyst for Crypto?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The crypto market was cautiously optimistic before the Fed decided on interest rates. Now that <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/fed-rate-cut-crypto-impact/\">the cuts turn into reality</a>, good things may be in store for traders. According to data from CryptoQuant, investors have been getting ready to buy. </p><blockquote><p>“In general, a Fed cut is a positive catalyst for risk assets such as cryptocurrencies,” said Julio Moreno, Head of Research at CryptoQuant.</p></blockquote><p>Investors are holding onto their most valuable crypto assets, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. This move signifies that large holders are not panicking and <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/cryptos-signal-divergence-ahead-of-fed-rate-decision/\">likely expect prices to increase</a> after the cut. </p><blockquote><p>“For BTC and ETH, it seems that investors are expecting a rally as inflows into exchanges are at low levels–this means they don’t expect to sell,” Moreno added.</p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, money is flowing into stablecoins. Moreno explained that these assets are often used as cash on exchanges, which suggests that investors are getting ready to buy.</p><blockquote><p>“Higher</p><a href=\"\">stablecoin</a>deposits are the ‘dry powder’ of investors before deploying capital (buying),” he said.</blockquote><p>On-chain data also shows that some investors are cashing out on their less valuable assets, like altcoins. This indicates caution or a strategic move in preparation for the main event.</p>Sponsored<p>Most of the data aligns with how crypto markets have historically reacted to interest rate cuts. Lower borrowing costs have traditionally encouraged investors to seek higher returns in riskier, more speculative assets.</p><p>The rate cuts between 2020 and 2021, following the COVID-19 pandemic, serve as a key example of how this financial easing <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/quantitative-easing-unnecessary-say-experts-amid-current-market-turmoil/\">fueled a historic bull run</a> in cryptocurrencies. During that time, the influx of capital directly translated into an increased risk appetite among retailers. </p><p>However, the relationship between interest rate cuts and the crypto market is not always linear.</p><h2><strong>A Politically Charged Decision</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Powell’s announcement comes amid heightened tension between the Federal Reserve and the Trump administration. Since assuming office, Trump has repeatedly pressured the FOMC to cut interest rates, even trying to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook.</p><p>Just yesterday, the Senate confirmed Stephen Miran, a former top economic advisor to Trump, to the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors.</p><p>These consistent pressures have <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/fed-under-fire-dollar-in-danger-bitcoin/\">drawn scrutiny over the Fed’s independence</a> in its decision-making process. Whether Powell cut rates over the state of the economy or under executive pressure remains blurry. As such, experts remain divided over whether the cuts are even necessary. </p><p>If today’s decision was overwhelmingly taken out of political pressure, it will <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency/\">likely lead to higher inflation</a>, eroding Americans’ purchasing power and causing the economy to overheat. This <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/\">volatility</a> will also lower risk appetite, <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/us-ppi-data-inflation-lower-crypto-reaction-muted/\">drawing trading volumes away from</a> the cryptocurrency market. </p><p>That said, the American economy has been undergoing significant turbulence in recent months.</p><h2><strong>What’s Next for the American Consumer?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Recent data has shown a decidedly soft job market with slower employment growth than previously estimated. <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency/\">Inflation</a> also <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-climbs-us-inflation-data-lands-below-target/\">remains a significant concern</a>.</p><p>The Fed’s preferred <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency/\">inflation</a> measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, is expected to stay well above the central bank’s 2% target. This is partly due to Trump’s import taxes, which economists warn could further increase prices in the coming months.</p><p>The coming months will determine whether this fresh round of interest rate cuts will effectively balance the Fed’s dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. They will also be key in determining whether the crypto market will stand to profit this time.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-rises-as-us-federal-reserve-opts-for-25bps-rate-cut/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The firm’s data shows a stark divergence in coin volume, which has been observed in movements onto centralized exchanges over the past few weeks.</p><h2>Bitcoin and Ethereum Inflows Drop to Multi-Month Lows</h2>Sponsored<p>Bitcoin has seen a dramatic drop in <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/crypto-inflows-bitcoin-ethereum-sentiment-recovery/\">exchange inflows</a>, with the 7-day moving average plummeting to 25,000 BTC, its lowest level in over a year.

The report notes that the exchange USDT balance, around $273 million in April, grew to $379 million by August 31, marking a new yearly high.</p><p>CryptoQuant interprets this surge as a reflection of investor optimism for a favorable monetary policy from the Fed.

    "body": "<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n<p>If you’ve recently stopped paying attention to Bitcoin, now might be the time to tune back in. Behind the noise of regulatory headlines and fluctuating prices, a significant trend is emerging — smart money is quietly returning to the market. Specifically, Bitcoin ‘sharks’ — wallets holding between 10 and 1,000 BTC — have scooped up over <strong>65,000 BTC</strong> in just the past week. This surge in accumulation is far from random; it mirrors the stealth accumulation phases of previous cycles, notably at times when market sentiment was at its lowest and opportunity was at its highest.</p>\n<p>This pattern of accumulation by savvy mid-sized investors reveals a recurring theme in the lifecycle of Bitcoin: while the broader public remains uncertain or distracted, those with deeper insight and capital move strategically. This type of activity has preceded nearly every major bull run in the past decade. It’s often the precursor to the explosive phases in market cycles, long before retail traders catch on or mainstream outlets start covering the story.</p>\n<p>Despite Bitcoin’s recent sideways movement — a frustrating range for many retail investors — it’s critical to differentiate between price action and underlying fundamentals. Prices may seem stagnant, but activity within the blockchain tells a more nuanced and compelling story. The silent, persistent accumulation by wallets in the 'shark' category hints at growing conviction among institutional players and high-net-worth individuals. That’s not a signal to ignore; it’s one to investigate.</p>\n<p>Take a look back to early 2020, in the months following the COVID market crash. Bitcoin experienced a significant drop, and sentiment hit rock bottom. But what happened next was both telling and profitable for those paying attention. While many stayed on the sidelines, waiting for recovery, data revealed an uptick in accumulation by experienced crypto investors. Fast forward six to nine months, and Bitcoin was breaking through all-time highs, eventually soaring past the $60,000 mark. That accumulation phase offered a golden entry point — but only to those who recognized it while fear dominated the headlines.</p>\n<p>Today, a similar setup appears to be brewing.</p>\n<h2>Contrarian Opportunity: Betting Against the Crowd</h2>\n<p>Seasoned investors understand that public sentiment can often serve as a backward-looking indicator. In most cases, when confidence is low and narratives lean heavily bearish, the opportunity for value investing reaches its peak. Right now, various narratives dominate crypto conversations: the threat of regulation, shifting Federal Reserve policies, sticky inflation, and potential recession risks. While these concerns are valid, they often cause less experienced investors to retreat. But smart money behaves differently — it leverages fear to enter the market at a discount.</p>\n<p>Blockchain analytics provide a contrasting perspective, one that cuts through emotional noise. Key on-chain indicators are showing bullish signs: exchange reserves are falling, indicating that fewer coins are being sent to centralized exchanges for sale. Post-halving dynamics are kicking in, leading to reduced miner sell pressure. At the same time, long-term holders (LTHs) — wallets that haven’t moved their BTC holdings for months or even years — are showing increased conviction by continuing to hold rather than take profits.</p>\n<p>These combined metrics suggest a hidden strength in the Bitcoin network. When exchange reserves go down while long-term holding behavior intensifies, it often sets the stage for a supply squeeze. Pair that with increasing accumulation among wallets with high BTC balances, and you have the makings of another substantial rally — perhaps not imminent, but certainly in development.</p>\n<p>Institutional interest also appears to be on the rebound. Reports of new applications for Bitcoin ETFs, corporate treasury allocations, and growing interest in crypto hedge funds all support the thesis of quiet acceptance and adoption, even in the face of macroeconomic challenges. Institutions may not always be fast movers, but when they deploy capital, it's typically with an eye toward long-term appreciation, not short-term speculation.</p>\n<h2>Positioning Forward: What's the Play?</h2>\n<p>For retail investors seeking asymmetric upside in the next 12 to 18 months, the current phase may represent a timely entry. While no one can predict short-term price movements with certainty, historical data shows that accumulation periods with muted sentiment often coincide with the early phases of strong multi-month or even multi-year rallies.</p>\n<p>One strategy to consider is a disciplined <strong>Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)</strong> approach. Rather than trying to time the perfect bottom — a near impossible feat — DCA allows investors to reduce the impact of volatility while steadily building exposure. Implementing this during periods of on-chain accumulation has historically outperformed lump sum investing, particularly in bear and early bull markets.</p>\n<p>Beyond Bitcoin, other segments of the digital asset ecosystem appear primed for potential outsized gains. Several undervalued <strong>Layer 2 networks</strong> — including those improving Bitcoin’s scalability and utility — are gaining traction. Protocols focusing on Bitcoin-native DeFi solutions and scaling innovations could become the next growth areas as the broader market regains bullish momentum.</p>\n<p>Additionally, <strong>Bitcoin mining equities</strong> present a potentially lucrative play. Many firms in this space have restructured balance sheets, optimized operations, and are now benefiting from lower input costs post halving. In past bull markets, Bitcoin miner stocks have displayed higher beta than BTC itself, meaning they often rally harder and faster in the early stages of an uptrend.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bitcoin-sharks-buy-65k-btc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Every day brings new developments and opportunities in the fast-moving world of cryptocurrency. Whether you're an experienced <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/crypto-investor/\">crypto investor</a> looking to fine-tune your portfolio or a curious newcomer exploring ways to diversify your holdings, our daily digest is your premier source for market intelligence, data insights, and curated news stories that truly matter. We’re focused on delivering updates that help you stay one step ahead, identify profitable trends early, and manage risk with greater confidence in this ever-evolving digital asset space.</p>\n<p>The crypto markets have been anything but quiet this past week. Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines, having reclaimed the $115,000 price level amid a new wave of institutional capital flowing into Ethereum ETFs. This resurgence in large-scale buying activity suggests increasing confidence in the long-term growth of digital assets, particularly as traditional finance continues to integrate blockchain-based products into their offerings. Ethereum has benefited tremendously in recent days, with investors reacting to the approval and launch of new Ether-based exchange-traded funds that are already seeing high demand. The positive sentiment spilled over into the altcoin market, where several Layer-1 and DeFi tokens also registered double-digit gains.</p>\n<p>While the price performance has been impressive, it's important to understand the macro drivers behind this momentum. For a deeper dive, check out our guide on the characteristics of a <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bull-market/\">crypto bull market</a> and how investor psychology plays a key role in shaping price trends. Bear in mind, volatility remains elevated, so risk management should remain a top priority, even during upside rallies.</p>\n<p>Technical indicators are showing mixed results, with relative strength indexes (RSIs) approaching overbought territory on some leading coins, and funding rates on derivatives markets rising—a sign that leverage is coming back into play. While bulls may still be in control for now, caution is advised. Keep an eye on macro triggers such as interest rate decisions, regulatory shifts, and ETF inflows in the coming week.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>\"Web3 IPOs Remain Hot: Gemini’s 20X Oversubscription and Figure’s 24% Opening Surge Spark Investor Mania\"</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The Web3 investment narrative continues to gain traction as institutional and retail investors pour capital into blockchain-native projects making their way to public markets. Gemini, a long-standing pillar in the crypto space co-founded by the Winklevoss twins, recently saw its pre-IPO raise oversubscribed by a staggering 20 times. This signals incredibly strong demand for equity in companies operating at the forefront of crypto innovation.</p>\n<p>Not to be outdone, blockchain financial services firm Figure made headlines with an explosive debut, jumping 24% on its first day of trading. These IPO successes are not isolated—they point to a larger movement within the altcoin and decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. With more companies exploring blockchain integration and revenue decentralization, the traditional venture capital model is evolving. Tokenization, DAOs, and hybrid equity-token instruments are redefining how early-stage projects fundraise while giving broader investor access across geographical boundaries.</p>\n<p>These IPO trends also suggest a new phase of maturity in the Web3 space. As regulation becomes more defined, and investor protections improve through mechanisms such as smart contracts and on-chain audits, more traditional investors are becoming comfortable participating in blockchain-native equity plays. This transition could accelerate institutional inclusion in sectors such as crypto gaming, NFTs, decentralized infrastructure, and beyond. For a deeper dive into this evolving market dynamic, don’t miss our full report.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Top Gainers:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>RWA Tokens:</strong>Real World Asset (RWA) tokens posted an impressive rally this week, gaining 11% amidst broader DeFi strength. The surge was driven by increased interest in tokenizing physical assets such as real estate, art, and commodities. Institutional investors are finally warming up to the concept of on-chain ownership for traditionally illiquid assets.</li>\n      <li><strong>DOGE CleanCore Reserve:</strong>Dogecoin made headlines as the CleanCore treasury crossed the halfway mark in its goal of accumulating a 1 billion DOGE reserve. This fundamental milestone reflects growing community-driven financial engineering within meme coins, steering the narrative beyond simple internet satire toward serious utility and performance tracking.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <strong>Top Losers:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Bitcoin Momentum Indicators Turn Bearish:</strong>Analysts are closely watching technical charts as 8 out of 10 major<a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/history-of-bitcoin-bull-bear-market/\">Bitcoin bull market indicators</a>have turned bearish.

    "body": "<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>The cryptocurrency market is widely known for its volatility and unpredictability, making many traditional investors wary. However, for the <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/contrarian-investor/\">contrarian investor</a>, this volatility can represent significant opportunity rather than deterrence. Beneath the surface of public doubt, institutional capital continues to flow into digital assets, regulatory perspectives evolve, and new use cases emerge at an accelerating pace. Contrarians recognize that when the market is fearful or confused, it often fails to price in game-changing shifts. In this article, we delve into underappreciated crypto catalysts and investment angles that lie just outside of the mainstream narrative but hold the keys to potentially asymmetric growth.</p>\n<h2>Analyzing Performance Disparities Among Crypto-Related Companies</h2>\n<p>Investing directly in cryptocurrencies can be rewarding but comes with a unique risk profile due to price swings, regulatory ambiguity, and custody challenges. Alternatively, investors are turning their attention to publicly traded companies that offer exposure to the crypto economy—some overtly, others more subtly.</p>\n<p>Companies like <strong>MicroStrategy (MSTR)</strong>, which has aggressively built a Bitcoin-centric treasury strategy, have often outperformed during bull runs. With Michael Saylor’s leadership and the strategic pivot into holding BTC as a reserve asset, MSTR became a proxy for large-scale Bitcoin exposure. However, several other firms, such as <strong>Coinbase (COIN)</strong>, present mixed opportunities. While Coinbase remains the most trusted centralized exchange in North America and operates a highly secure platform, it also continually finds itself entangled with regulatory action from the SEC and other agencies, resulting in greater volatility in its stock value.</p>\n<p>In contrast, companies like <strong>Block Inc. (SQ)</strong> have quietly expanded their blockchain ambitions. Block isn’t just enabling Bitcoin transactions through Cash App; it’s also exploring decentralized financial (DeFi) infrastructure, stablecoin payment options, and hardware wallet integrations—all with far less public scrutiny. These firms reveal how crypto-centric innovation can exist in firms labeled as “fintech” rather than “crypto native.”</p>\n<p>Savvy investors can assess which companies are undervalued by analyzing treasury allocations, crypto-related patent activity, and product development roadmaps. Early recognition of blockchain integration or tokenized asset support can offer position advantages far ahead of public recognition.</p>\n<h2>Understanding the Impact of SEC Decisions on Crypto ETFs</h2>\n<p>The prospect of a spot crypto ETF has hung over the digital asset space like a cloud for years. Grayscale, Bitwise, and other major asset managers have submitted ETF applications only to face repeated delays or rejections from the SEC. However, the tide may be turning. Grayscale’s court victory concerning its GBTC product marks a symbolic and legal milestone that could pave the way for broader ETF approvals.</p>\n<p>The rationale behind a spot Bitcoin ETF is simple: it allows institutional-grade investment exposure via traditional brokerage accounts, removing complications related to wallets, private keys, and direct exchange risk. This ease of access could unlock billions—potentially trillions—of dollars that remain on the sidelines awaiting regulatory clarity. From pension funds and family offices to global asset managers, the demand for direct BTC exposure is ripe for realization once the SEC greenlights these vehicles.</p>\n<p>Forward-looking investors are already adjusting their strategies. Investment in ETF-adjacent products, like <strong>Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)</strong>, which often trades at a discount to NAV, serves as a speculative bridge between now and spot ETF approval. Additionally, infrastructure providers—firms involved in custody, compliance, blockchain analytics, and ETF administration—stand to benefit exponentially from a legitimized crypto investment sector. Gain deeper insights by consulting our complete analysis on the <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bitcoin-etf/\">Bitcoin spot ETF landscape</a>.</p>\n<h2>Evaluating Price Trends and Adoption Metrics of XRP</h2>\n<p>Ripple's native token, <strong>XRP</strong>, remains one of the most debated digital assets in the crypto market. Often overshadowed by high-profile legal proceedings with the SEC, XRP’s real-world adoption is quietly gaining momentum. Far from being purely speculative, XRP is increasingly functioning as utility currency for cross-border payment corridors, especially in emerging markets.</p>\n<p>Ripple Labs has formed strategic alliances with financial institutions in Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and Latin America to facilitate near-instant remittance platforms. These platforms are powered by on-chain liquidity tools and tokenization APIs that streamline complex, costly international banking operations. In jurisdictions where SWIFT services are slow or unreliable, XRP offers an actionable alternative. On-chain data substantiates this shift: the number of unique wallets interacting with the ledger continues to rise, along with transaction throughput and settlement volume.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, as global regulatory frameworks—especially in Europe and Asia—begin to offer more clarity than the U.S., XRP's position as a compliance-friendly solution is strengthening. Investors would be prudent to look beyond legal noise and focus on functional adoption metrics. Currency liquidity, regulatory environment, wallet size distribution, and repeat transaction frequency all support the case for a long-term value proposition that isn't just speculative—it’s operational.</p>\n<h2>Leveraging Mergers for Investment Growth in the Crypto Market</h2>\n<p>Mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) represent another under-discussed avenue of crypto market exposure. These strategic consolidations are reshaping how fintech and blockchain ecosystems are forming next-gen financial networks.</p>\n<p>Consider the recent merger of Asset Entities with Strive—a firm that announced a $1.5 billion BTC treasury strategy. Unlike buying crypto outright, exposure through merged entities offers investors potential equity-style upside without direct digital asset custody. These deals are often undervalued in initial stages, since traditional analysts may not fully understand the implications of a booming treasury or blockchain-engineered operational model.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/profitable-crypto-investing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>AltcoinInvestor.com Weekly Update: A Deep Dive into the Latest Crypto Market News &amp; Trends</strong>\n    </p>\n<h2>Opening Note</h2>\n<p>Welcome back to another edition of the AltcoinInvestor Weekly Update. As we step into a new week in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, it's crucial to pause for a moment and review the developments that just unfolded. Each week brings with it a wave of innovation, price movement, regulation updates, and of course, new investment opportunities. This week is no different, and we're here to guide you through everything you need to know to stay ahead of the curve in your crypto journey.</p>\n<p>Whether you're holding strong in Bitcoin, actively trading altcoins, or exploring decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, it's important to understand the larger market dynamics. Let's unravel the numbers, the narratives, and the nuances that shaped the crypto markets this week.</p>\n<h2>Market Recap</h2>\n<p>The cryptocurrency market saw another eventful week marked by periods of volatility, consolidation trends, and a slew of updates from both major and emerging blockchain projects. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of how the top digital assets performed:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Bitcoin (BTC)</strong><strong>:</strong>Bitcoin displayed relative strength despite widespread volatility in the market. BTC hovered around the $55,000 zone for much of the week, highlighting a critical support range that bulls are defending. Continued institutional interest and spot ETF discussions remain catalysts for potential price action.</li>\n      <li><strong>Ethereum (ETH):</strong>The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap saw price consolidation around the $3,500 level. The Ethereum network continues to benefit from increased layer-2 deployment and DeFi application usage. Developers have also been discussing potential upgrades to improve scalability and reduce gas fees, which may impact ETH's price in the medium term.</li>\n      <li><strong>Altcoins</strong><strong>:</strong>This week saw mixed performance across the altcoin market. While some tokens recorded double-digit gains, others experienced selloffs, reminding investors of the high volatility inherent to altcoin investing. Trends indicate a rotation into mid-cap tokens with utility in AI, gaming, and tokenization sectors.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Overall, once again, we’re reminded that the crypto sector is a dynamic and ever-evolving marketplace. Staying on top of weekly price movements can help identify both short-term trading opportunities and long-term investment themes.</p>\n<h2>Featured Insight: Regulatory Impact on Crypto Trends</h2>\n<p>The regulatory environment remains one of the most influential forces shaping the future of the digital asset space. Globally, we continue to see regulatory frameworks emerge, with countries taking varying approaches to classification, taxation, and adoption of cryptocurrencies. Regulatory clarity (or lack thereof) can significantly impact investor sentiment, market liquidity, and project legitimacy.</p>\n<p>In the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) remains a key player. The commission’s actions regarding Bitcoin ETFs, DeFi crackdowns, and stablecoin scrutiny underline the weight of regulation in this ecosystem. This week’s deferral on major ETF decisions (highlighted in the news section below) is just one more example of the power regulators hold over market momentum.</p>\n<p>In parallel, countries like Belarus and Hong Kong are exploring ways to embrace crypto technologies to counterbalance economic sanctions or stimulate financial innovation. These geopolitical movements demonstrate that crypto is increasingly intertwined with global economic policy and strategic planning.</p>\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/crypto-investor/\">crypto investor</a>, it is essential to assess the regulatory backdrop before making high-risk investments, especially in tokens associated with DeFi, privacy coins, and non-KYC exchanges—as these are frequently singled out by regulators.</p>\n<h2>Top Gainers &amp; Losers: This Week's Standout Performers</h2>\n<p>With heightened volatility comes opportunities for savvy investors. Here's a look at the biggest winners and losers in the altcoin space this past week:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Top Gainer:</strong><a href=\"#\">Asset Entities</a>surged after announcing a strategic merger with Strive.

While retail sentiment remains cautious and broader markets wobble amid confusion, this rare momentum signal could be offering a glimpse into Bitcoin’s next major move: a potential rally targeting <strong>$160,000</strong> by October 2024. But can this technical pattern be trusted? Or is it yet another indicator that only the most informed will recognize in hindsight?</p>\n<h3>Understanding the MACD Golden Cross</h3>\n<p>The <strong>Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)</strong> indicator is a tool designed to capture momentum trends and signal potential reversals in price action. Derived from differences between shorter and longer-term moving averages, the MACD line and its corresponding signal line interact dynamically to offer insights into market momentum. A <strong>golden cross</strong> occurs specifically when the MACD line crosses above the signal line, suggesting an emerging bullish trend.</p>\n<p>The significance of the current MACD golden cross lies in its <i>weekly timeframe</i> appearance. Technical patterns hold greater weight when they materialize on higher timeframes, and weekly MACD crosses are generally considered more reliable than their daily or hourly counterparts. In past cycles, a weekly MACD golden cross on Bitcoin has often preceded strong upward trends. A notable example occurred in the second half of 2020, just ahead of BTC rallying from under $12,000 to nearly $70,000 in a matter of months.</p>\n<p>Importantly, the golden cross doesn’t act in a vacuum—it needs confirmation from broader context. And right now, that context appears increasingly favorable for bulls who are keeping a close watch on institutional flows, the supply-side dynamics of Bitcoin, and the upcoming halving event.</p>\n<h3>The Bigger Picture: Bullish Momentum Amid Market Skepticism</h3>\n<p>The current market is filled with uncertainty. Inflation remains sticky in major economies, central banks continue to deliberate interest rate policies, and geopolitical risks rage on—from regional conflicts to shifting trade alliances. All of this weighs heavily on risk assets, and Bitcoin is no exception. In fact, for many, the presence of continued Bitcoin consolidation and a sluggish altcoin sector suggests that crypto's bullish potential has stalled.</p>\n<p>Yet it is precisely during these periods of disbelief that the biggest moves historically begin. Bitcoin has frequently demonstrated a contrarian nature: <strong>when sentiment is at its weakest, the asset often begins to build strength beneath the surface</strong>.</p>\n<p>In late 2020, Bitcoin’s rally took off under similar circumstances. The COVID-19 pandemic had altered financial landscapes, risk appetite was depressed, and yet, Bitcoin doubled and then tripled before retail investors fully caught on. Could we be witnessing a similar setup today? The MACD golden cross says it’s possible.</p>\n<h3>Key Catalysts That Could Push Bitcoin Toward $160K</h3>\n<p>If we zoom out from the charts and examine the fundamental landscape, there are clear drivers that could catalyze a sharp move to higher prices—even reaching the ambitious $160,000 mark that some analysts are already projecting.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Institutional Accumulation:</strong>On-chain data continues to show a shift from speculative hands to long-term holders. The number of wallets holding 1,000+ BTC has steadily increased, signaling that larger players are accumulating quietly. Institutional interest is no longer just anecdotal; it’s visible in wallet behavior and transaction consistency. When large entities buy and hold in a sustained fashion, they effectively reduce circulating supply and increase price floor.</li>\n      <li><strong>Spot Bitcoin ETFs:</strong>Since the approval of U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs, flows into these financial products have been strong. These ETFs, managed by major Wall Street titans such as BlackRock and Fidelity, act as buying conduits into the market, creating consistent demand. A unique feature of spot ETFs is that they require direct BTC purchases to back shares issued to investors—resulting in a price-supporting mechanism that wasn’t present in previous cycles.</li>\n      <li><strong>Bitcoin Halving and Supply Shock:</strong>Slated for April 2024, the fourth Bitcoin halving will reduce mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. This built-in supply contraction means that fewer new bitcoins will enter circulation daily. If demand stays constant, or—more likely—increases due to broader acceptance and ETF inflows, basic economic principles indicate that prices should rise.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h3>Why the Market May Be Misreading the Signals</h3>\n<p>Markets operate not just on data, but on perception. While some are still calling for deeper corrections or citing macro headwinds as reasons to stay out of the market, savvy investors know that most bull markets begin amid confusion—<strong>not confidence</strong>.</p>\n<p>Technical-grade indicators like the MACD are not infallible, but they are widely followed by professional traders for good reason—they often signal regime changes. A weekly golden cross doesn’t guarantee a rally to new highs, but it greatly increases the probability of a sustained upward trend. Combined with other favorable metrics—like diminishing exchange balances, miner accumulation, and shrinking volatility—it paints a picture of a market ready to move.</p>\n<p>Another factor often overlooked: regulatory clarity. As governments increasingly seek to establish frameworks for crypto assets, institutional deployment may accelerate even further. Clarity breeds confidence, and with both the legal and financial infrastructure lining up, Bitcoin could act as a magnet for global capital outflows from traditional assets like bonds and fiat currencies.</p>\n<h3>Don’t Wait for the Perfect Entry</h3>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/btc-macd-golden-cross-160k/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Right now, an increasing number of seasoned analysts and contrarian investors believe that Bitcoin is entering what’s being called a “<strong>supercycle ignition</strong>”—a rare structural phase in its market evolution that precedes a parabolic price action. If the projections pan out, Bitcoin’s price could eclipse its previous all-time high and skyrocket to <strong>$360,000 or more</strong>.</p>\n<p>While skeptics may label such bold predictions as excessive speculation, history tells us that the Bitcoin market has always rewarded those who took early, calculated risks in moments of disbelief. As traditional market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, those with a contrarian perspective see opportunity—a massive one at that—on the edge of an explosive cycle.</p>\n<h3>The Technical Catalyst: Inverse Head-and-Shoulders Pattern</h3>\n<p>In technical analysis, certain chart patterns serve as significant indicators of potential price movement. One such formation currently being watched closely is the <i>inverse head-and-shoulders</i> on Bitcoin's multi-year chart. This bullish reversal pattern consists of three troughs: a lower low (the head) flanked by two higher lows (the shoulders), separated by intermediary peaks that form a resistance line known as the “neckline.” For Bitcoin, that neckline is currently hovering just under its previous all-time high of $69,000.</p>\n<p>If Bitcoin breaks and sustains a move above that neckline level, it would mark the completion of this chart pattern. Historically, such a breakout has often led to massive price expansions. More specifically, technical projections based on the height of the pattern suggest a potential move to the <strong>$300,000–$360,000</strong> range, implying a return exceeding 400–500% from current levels.</p>\n<p>For traders and investors familiar with historical breakout patterns, the setup is becoming increasingly hard to ignore. It is not simply about watching lines on a chart—it's about observing repeated behaviors in market psychology, and acting before the crowd reacts.</p>\n<h3>Institutional Involvement: A New Demand Curve</h3>\n<p>Unlike previous bull runs dominated by retail enthusiasm and speculative mania, the current phase features a powerful new catalyst: <strong>institutional investment</strong>. Following the landmark approval of the first U.S. <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bitcoin-etf/\">Spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> in early 2024, major asset managers such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco have entered the crypto arena with serious capital.</p>\n<p>These institutions are not in it for short-term profits or meme coin thrills. Their participation indicates long-term strategic positioning. Since January 2024, cumulative net inflows to spot Bitcoin ETFs have exceeded <strong>$15 billion</strong>, a sum that continues to grow weekly. This sustained institutional demand is not only absorbing current supply, but creating the conditions for a long-lasting bull market that operates under a vastly different regime than those of the past.</p>\n<p>It’s important to understand how this transforms the market structure. Unlike retail investors who often panic sell during corrections, institutions typically follow structured allocation strategies and rebalancing schedules, adding stability to both demand and price floors. This shift in buyer profile hints at a more mature, sustainable cycle—again aligning with the supercycle theory where Bitcoin’s scarcity and macro appeal are finally converging.</p>\n<h3>Historical Precedence: When Doubters Missed Windfalls</h3>\n<p>To understand where Bitcoin may go, one must study where it’s been. Historical precedent provides strong validation for the supercycle thesis. Take the 2015 inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, for example. It appeared during the aftermath of the Mt. Gox collapse, one of the darkest times in Bitcoin history. Yet, within a few years, BTC went on to surge from $200 to nearly $20,000—a <strong>100x return</strong> for early believers.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to 2020, amid the early COVID-19 panic, when Bitcoin was again written off by mainstream analysts. At the time, bottoming patterns formed on the macro chart, and those paying attention accumulated heavily. The result? A meteoric rise from under $5,000 to nearly $70,000 in just 18 months.</p>\n<p>What’s consistent in each of these cases is not just the technical pattern—but the sentiment. Low confidence in the market, mixed narratives in media, and mainstream skepticism preceded Bitcoin's most explosive growth phases. This cycle seems no different. To dive deeper into the context of these previous patterns, explore the full <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/history-of-bitcoin-bull-bear-market/\">history of Bitcoin bull and bear markets</a> for the 2008–2024 timeframe.</p>\n<h3>Macro Forces: The Perfect Storm for Bitcoin</h3>\n<p>Beyond technicals and institutional flows, macroeconomic conditions are also aligning in Bitcoin’s favor. Sovereign debt spirals, de-dollarization trends, inflationary pressures, currency instability, and geopolitical tensions are pushing both individuals and institutions to seek safe-haven and alternative assets. Historically, gold was the go-to hedge—but in today’s digital-first world, Bitcoin is fast emerging as <strong>“digital gold 2.0.”</strong></p>\n<p>MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor continues to double down on such narratives, often suggesting that Bitcoin could attract trillions in capital simply by diverting small allocation percentages from traditional asset classes like real estate, bonds, and gold. If Saylor’s thesis plays out, even a fraction of that capital could send Bitcoin well above $360K.</p>\n<p>The strategic case for Bitcoin is no longer niche. Global investors are rapidly rethinking what it means to preserve value in an uncertain era, and Bitcoin’s capped supply and decentralized nature make it a compelling answer amid growing distrust in fiat systems.</p>\n<h3>How to Position for the Supercycle</h3>\n<p>Navigating a potential supercycle requires more than just optimism; it demands a disciplined and strategic investment approach. Here’s how investors—especially those who aim to think and act differently—can proactively prepare:</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bitcoin-supercycle-360k/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
