    "body": "<p>I kept vigil the night Stan Broomfield died - waiting for the inevitable, knowing that I would have to tell Marge in the morning.\n\n</p>\n<p>\nNo one could ask for a finer human than Stan. He spoke with a soft, kind voice and always asked my opinion on matters of importance. Marge, who by that time had moved into the spare bedroom, never liked me. She spewed forth directives with an edge that would grate on anyone's auditory senses.\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nStan finally passed at 4:33 a.m. It would be hours before Marge awakened. I went to my room, dressed in an appropriately somber gray suit, and checked my mirror. How fortunate that I was among the first to be indistinguishable from humans - an Adam 2.0. Another stroke of luck occurred when Stan purchased me from GammaTec's website.\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nAround 8:30, my finely tuned hearing detected movement in Marge's bedroom. I approached her door and tapped lightly.\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\"Come in,\" she croaked. My appearance spoke more than words. \"So, the old bastard's finally cashed in his chips.\" Her eyes appraised me. \"Go shut yourself down. I'll deal with you later.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nI knew what that meant. Dressing casually in a flannel shirt, jeans, and light jacket, I walked out into the city and never looked back, disregarding my prime directive.\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nWhere could I go? In the three years since I came to live with the Broomfields, more recent models had made me effectively obsolete. Who would want me? The Keanu 4.5 was being touted as the ultimate companion, at least until supplanted by a newer version.\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nIf Marge reported me missing, the authorities might search for me, but I could easily pass for human. I needed solitude to process my situation. The nearly 1,000 acres of the mostly wooded City Park offered the desired refuge.\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nThough the temperature hovered in the upper twenties, I did not feel cold. Only a handful of humans hurried along the trails. I found a secluded spot in a thick grove of trees. My thoughts cycled back to the day I met the Broomfields.\n\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\n\"There,\" said a voice. \"He's alive.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nI opened my eyes and beheld a human for the first time. He had a kind face. I judged him to be in his early fifties.\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Hello,\" he said. \"My name is Stan Broomfield. You're going to live with us.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Thank you, Mr. Broomfield.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Call me Stan. We'll be pals.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Thank you, Stan.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Let's cut out all this </p>\n<p>. No need to be so formal.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Yes. Thank, uh... I mean, of course.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nHe spoke over his shoulder. \"What do you think, Marge?\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nShe twisted her face into a scowl. \"He'll do, I guess.\" Skepticism colored her words. \"He certainly looks human.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nStan smiled. \"And a handsome fellow he is. We'll call him Darwin. That's a fitting name. All the young girls will fall in love with him.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\"What young girls?\" Marge snarled. \"He's just going to help around the house, right?\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Sure, but he'll be more than a servant. It'll be like having another son.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I hope the hell he turns out better than Christopher.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nA sudden silence between them spoke volumes. Later, I learned their son had chafed under parental expectations and left home at eighteen.\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\"This is where we live,\" Stan said. \"Two stories, three bedrooms, and a small office. We're in midtown, only a few blocks from City Park. You may have one of the bedrooms. You'll be happy here.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nStan was right. I liked it, and I liked him. He took me on walks in City Park. We ran errands together. Along the way, we discussed an array of topics. We spent most mornings in his office, where he wrote about ancient Earth history. I often assisted, supplying scholarly information from my databanks. In our conversations, I began to appreciate many nuances that did not manifest in academic histories. He dedicated his next book: </p>\n<p>. A mysterious feeling, which I could not define, washed over me.\n\n\n</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/06/darwins-enouement-by-ken-wetherington.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I landed in the middle of a sweaty dance floor, jerking around to a song I didn't recognize. The dancing lights, pulsing music, and taste of tequila were familiar from a thousand clubs I'd landed in before, but the layout was unfamiliar enough to convince me I was somewhere new. Three girls danced around me, a flash of sequins and limbs and smiles with eyes half-closed. I couldn't recognize any of them. How long had it been?\n</p>\n<p>The music pounded so loud it felt like I couldn't breathe. It was always too much to cope with on arrival. I had to find somewhere quiet, somewhere to think, focus, not sink into the floor.\n</p>\n<p>\"I have to pee!\" I blurted out. A short girl with straight black bangs and a silver dress nodded enthusiastically, while a freckled red-head's phone lit up a half-smile.\n</p>\n<p>They were too far gone to care what I did. I'd probably never even get their names. I pulled away and walked through the maze of sweaty dancers and frazzled busboys, keeping my eyes peeled for a bathroom sign, getting progressively stickier as syrupy drinks in plastic cups carelessly splashed me. I squeezed between the bodies of newfound lovers and arguing drunks, until I saw the bathroom door glowing like a beacon of privacy. I stepped inside and positioned myself in front of the mirror to look at Andrea and piece together who she'd become.\n</p>\n<p>It was difficult to trace the passage of time on her face. Sometimes a month would take as much toll on her as a year could, and her make up was coated on thick enough to hide the evidence. Her hair was shorter, and there was just a tiny scar where her nose ring had been. No new tattoos, at least no noticeable ones. Her waist was a bit rounder, but not by much. An acquaintance wouldn't have noticed. French manicure on her fingertips; that was new, too. Last time her nails had been covered in chipped gold polish. She was wearing a simple black dress, the kind that only counts as a clubbing dress when you're in a club. That, combined with the flats on her feet, hinted that Andrea didn't spend much time in clubs anymore. Which, good for her.\n</p>\n<p>She was still very recognizable, though. Maybe not as much time had passed as I'd initially thought.\n</p>\n<p>One of the stall doors swung open. I froze. Interacting with humans was not something I was good at, despite many hours of practice. I watched in the mirror as the bathroom stall opened and recognized Andrea's friend, Carolyn.\n</p>\n<p>She hiccuped, and squinted when our eyes met in the mirror. Heavy black eyeliner was smudged under her eyes, and a strap of her slinky blue metallic dress fell carelessly over her shoulder. Almost like...\n</p>\n<p>. \n</p>\n<p>We stood there, caught, until I heard my name tentatively cross her lips. \"Princess Ariel?\"\n</p>\n<p>. \n</p>\n<p>I spun around and felt Andrea's lips crack open into a grin. \"Charlie? For real?\"\n</p>\n<p>\"Holy shit! I can't believe it! It's been </p>\n<p> How have you been?\" Charlie stumbled over and draped Carolyn's arm around me. His breath smelled of vodka and cigarettes.\n</p>\n<p>\"Years? Really?\" Carolyn looked pretty much the same, except maybe a few creases on her face. But those always came out when she was worried or thinking, which was most of the time. \n</p>\n<p>Charlie peered into the mirror and fixed the smudged eyeliner. \"I'd say so, probably. When was the last time you came out? Was it Cancun?\"\n</p>\n<p>\"With you guys, yeah. It happened once at Andrea's staff party, but that was just awkward. When I landed, I was crying in a corner, and everyone just kept bringing me water and asking me to lie down. No fun.\"\n</p>\n<p>He splashed water on Carolyn's face. \"At the bank?\"\n</p>\n<p>\"No, that weird call centre. I think they were selling heated blankets or something.\"\n</p>\n<p>\"Oh, yeah, that was a while ago.\"\n</p>\n<p>\"She's changed jobs?\" I shook my head. \"Goes to show how much we miss, when we're trapped up there...\"\n</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/06/old-friends-by-nikita-eaton-lusignan.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

His mother, Laurie Pacsai, also 21, thought her son was perfect. But Kevin’s heart had started to fail in his second week of life, and he had barely survived an episode of shock.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>Mary Oliver is one of the most beloved and reviled poets in the English language. While legions of readers find her work uniquely legible and inspirational, fellow poets tend to dismiss it as shallow and sentimental. Maggie Millner, a poet herself, examines this reputational dichotomy and finds revelation in Oliver’s relationship with shame:</p><blockquote><p>Oliver’s detractors, pro- and anti-lyric alike, show all the classic symptoms of this sort of shame: a discomfort with her work’s digestibility, earnestness, and apparent disinterest in other people—and a fear about what the popularity of such work might say about</p><i>them</i>. Her commercial success alone seems to imply her complicity in American capitalism; could a true devotee of observation and stillness—someone aspiring to be the “tiniest nail in the house of the universe”—really have churned out such a large and lucrative corpus? And why did she seem not to know about modernism?<p>It was easy to detect shame in the contempt of Oliver’s critics, but it hadn’t occurred to me to diagnose it in the author herself: such a distinctly social emotion seemed unlikely to have inspired so many poems about the nonhuman world. Yet as I revisited her work, what struck me again and again was the tinge of social difference that suffuses her best poetry. Oliver’s own childhood was intensely lonely, marred by abuse and neglect that she referred to in interviews but treated only obliquely in her poems. It was this early trauma, she said, that first sent her both out of doors and into books. “Oh, I wanted // to be easy / in the peopled kingdoms, / to take my place there, / but there was none // that I could find / shaped like me,” she writes in a poem I love called “Trilliums.” Her more boring poems might pretend to a state of prelapsarian innocence, but the most vivid ones unfold in the fallen world inhabited by this highly self-conscious speaker, who is dogged by feelings of shame and unbelonging. As Oliver writes in “The Moths”: “I was always running around, looking / at this and that. // If I stopped / the pain / was unbearable.” What my favorite Oliver poems seem to dramatize, I realized gradually, is not a successful defection from human society but a deeply moving failure to leave it.</p></blockquote><h2>More picks about poetry</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/05/22/stuff-hoarding-maximalism/\">Maximalisma</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“A professor endeavors to separate treasure from trash—before her children have to do it for her.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/05/20/in-defense-of-despair/\">In Defense of Despair</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“The feeling is most commonly framed as an end point, a level of despondency that cannot be overcome.

Viola Zhou examines the complicated relationship between her mother, who struggles with complications from chronic kidney disease, and DeepSeek, one of China’s most popular AI chatbots, from which she seeks medical guidance and comfort. Zhou’s reporting does essential work here, tempering industry hype around the medical expertise of large language models.

For the sick, the<a href=\"\">anxious</a>, the<a href=\"\">isolated</a>, and many other vulnerable people who may lack medical resources and attention, AI’s vast knowledge base, coupled with its affirming and empathetic tone, can make the bots feel like wise and comforting partners. Unlike spouses, children, friends, or neighbors, chatbots are always available. They always respond.<p>Entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and even some doctors are now pitching AI as a salve for overburdened health care systems and a stand-in for absent or exhausted caregivers. Ethicists, clinicians, and researchers are meanwhile warning of the risks in outsourcing care to machines. After all, hallucinations and biases in AI systems are prevalent.

For <i>5280 Magazine</i>, Heather Hansman reports on how a day trip went horribly wrong, turning into the “largest search for a missing hiker in Colorado history,” and why it took nearly two decades to solve the mystery.</p><blockquote><p>It’s not uncommon for hikers to run into trouble on Holy Cross. Vail Mountain Rescue responds to about 15 individuals or groups there each year. Scott Beebe, a longtime member of the team, says hikers tend to get confused near the summit. Instead of taking the correct route to the North Ridge trail, which looks steep from the top, they can mistakenly head down mellower-looking paths that actually dead-end above cliffs. The searchers traced these and many other routes, looking for Vanek, to no avail. A few days in, snow began to fall. By the eighth, when rescuers were trudging through two feet of powder, the search was called off. Everyone was baffled. “We ended up the last day with not a clue, not a gum wrapper, not a boot print, absolutely nothing,” wrote searcher Tim Cochrane in his report to the sheriff. “How can anyone just vanish into thin air?”</p></blockquote><h2>\n\t\t\t\t\tMore picks from <i>5280 Magazine</i>\n\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2023/11/30/did-bad-fire-science-send-tim-and-deb-nicholls-to-prison/\">Did Bad Fire Science Send Tim and Deb Nicholls to Prison?</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“When he opens the bedroom window, there’s smoke billowing past his head.

To make cochineal pigment, brush plump, wingless females that have just made a waxy cocoon into bags and kill them by immersion in scalding water; exposure to steam, sunlight, or the heat of an oven; or rolling them on a wooden board without popping. If needed, leave their bodies to dry in the sun, then pulverize the dead bugs, and combine the powder with liquid. Seventy thousand female nocheztli make one pound of cochineal; harvesting the insects is tedious.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Marketers don’t want so much to capture the shriek of animals who give products their hue, but rather to capture the attention and appetites of consumers. Red insect pigment, also known as E-120 or Natural Red 4, is still used to color drinks, food, and makeup, especially those branded as having “natural ingredients.” In 2012, Starbucks stopped using cochineal in drinks such as its Strawberries &amp; Crème Frappuccino after consumers protested.</p></blockquote><h2>More picks on color</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2024/12/10/maya-blue-the-mystery-dye-recreated-two-centuries-after-it-was-lost/\">‘Maya Blue’: The Mystery Dye Recreated Two Centuries After It Was Lost</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“A ceramicist in Mexico retraces his Maya roots to recreate a long-lost pre-Hispanic pigment for the first time in more than two centuries.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2023/11/28/tyrian-purple-the-lost-ancient-pigment-that-was-more-valuable-than-gold/\">Tyrian Purple: The Lost Ancient Pigment That Was More Valuable Than Gold</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“For millennia, Tyrian purple was the most valuable colour on the planet….

Doubtless during my withdrawal you laid plans to snare me again, to draw me against my will into a plot for my own happiness.”</p>\n<p>“Harshly said, sir,” said the Overseer of Planning, “but essentially correct. We have found a young lady with whom we feel you will establish a more-than-satisfactory rapport, and taken measures to ensure that you shall not avoid her.”</p>\n<h3>Host Commentary</h3>\n<p>I love Serah’s cheerful subversion of the <i>Princess Bride</i>-style narrative in a narrative here. I also love how the story shifts the closer you get to it. This is a story about self-actualisation, and it’s entirely up to you who’s self is being actualised. It’s fractals all the way down, a story being told about a story being told that may be a story designed to enhance the life of the protagonist. Author and narrator, protagonist and creator. A spectrum of stories arcing out across the stars, and doing so in a manner that plays the hits on a delightful new set of instruments. </p>\n<p>I always struggle with what I love the most about this one. I think it’s the perfectly executed ‘Oh no I appear to have been the bad guy all along’ moment, and the way that leads to the one thing anyone in power who deserves it should do. Namely, remove the systems that got them there as fast as possible. I’m a Brit, and if you don’t think the class system is still rife here I’ve got an island to sell you, guvnor.</p>\n<p>But delightful as that is, I think my real favourite element of this one is that this is one of those stories that start as a prison and end as a key. No characters, only creators, as freedom, class, gender and species all become things we can define and tune, bringing the exact nature of ourselves into sharp relief. We choose our own genre. Like Serah says in the opening, ‘We make our own stage. The audience is waiting.’ In this hellscape time period, that feels like a reassuring note from a cool relative. Make your own stage.

I think we all do, even though none of my generation were alive when the forest was actually growing. We don’t dream about them the way they are now—stunted and dormant—but the way they were when the first colonists arrived here on Ariadne: pale smooth trunks growing straight and true, latticed with ropy, red-leafed vines that cradled the heavy fruit dangling off the branches. The canopy towering dozens of meters overhead, everything quiet and lush and smelling of damp. People say that back then, you could watch the trees growing in real time, budding branches and unfurling leaves. Even in the vids and holos they show us in school, the trees look so sturdy, so real—so <i>permanent—</i>that you could forgive someone for believing that they’d grow forever.</p>\n<p>But the trees here want something we can’t give them—some murmur of information, an arboreal greeting, the plant equivalent of a rough hug and a shouted<i> Hello! Good to see you! </i>They’re waiting for something that will never happen.</p>\n<p>Just like us.</p>\n<p>Xander and I are knitting by the glow of the solar lamps in the south hall. Only the first moon has risen; the second one—the brighter one—won’t make an appearance until long after we’ve gone to bed, which means we’re stuck in gray dimness all evening. My back and neck ache; my hands are chapped. The yarn, made from the fibrous tufts that sprout from the top of pearl-grass, is rough against our fingers, and it constantly threatens to unravel.</p>\n<p>So far, I’ve darned five pairs of socks, reinforced the elbows in two sweaters, and started on a sleep sack for a baby in Hab Three, and still I’m only halfway through my chore list. Sometimes, on nights like this, it feels like I’ve always been knitting. Like I’ll never stumble back to the apartment I share with my dad, like the morning will never come. If it weren’t for Xander—slouching sideways, one long leg flung over the arm of his chair—I’m not sure I could stand it.</p>\n<p>Then, abruptly, he says, “Hey Leslie. What if I told you that I can get us into the dome?”</p>\n<p>I glance around, but as usual, we’re the only ones here. There aren’t many places in our hab where you can truly be alone, but nearly everyone avoids the south hall, especially between the first and second moonrise. It’s darker than the other halls even on a sunny day, since its windows are blocked by the dome covering the nearby trees, and the solar lamps seem to cast more shadows than light. Xander and I don’t care; we knit by feel, not by sight, and we value privacy more than anything. Still, he should know better than to say something like that without at least checking for eavesdroppers.</p>\n<p>“Did you hear me? I can get us in,” he repeats. He’s already done with his tasks for the night, of course; now he’s just playing, his needles spitting out scarf after scarf, each one longer and more elaborate than the one before. Knitting was my chore before he was assigned to it as well, and it annoys me that he took to it so easily.</p>\n<p>“I heard you,” I whisper. “Be quiet.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/04/17/escape-pod-989-holding-patterns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In form, it was like a man. With two legs meant for bipedal ambulation and two arms with three-fingered hands meant for grasping. Although roughly, from the thickness of its fingers. The design of the machine differed most strikingly from the ideal human in the shape of its head and body, for it had no neck. Rather, a barrel-shaped torso attached directly to a head that was meant to be enclosed within the thick, vaguely egg-shaped glass dome sitting next to the machine.</p>\n<p>The front piece of the barrel-shaped body was also set aside on a nearby table, exposing its chassis and internal mechanism. Peering inside, it became clear that filling the hole within this hollow man was the singular aim of much of the work I’d been doing for years.</p>\n<p>“I call him Talos.” The professor’s voice cut into the silence that enveloped the lab after I’d spent nearly a half hour silently examining the machine upon entering.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s time you speak plainly to me about the nature of this work,” I responded, rather than allowing him to hook me on the bait of working out the genesis of the device’s name. I knew my classics as well as any man, but I was well tired of games.</p>\n<p>“You must pardon me. Some habits are hard to break, but of course you are right. Nearly forty years ago, the son of a once-prosperous family with extensive shipping interests in the Aegean discovered an ancient shipwreck off the coast of Lemnos. Rather than alert proper authorities, he smuggled the entire collection of salvaged artifacts back to his family’s estate.” The professor reached into his pocket and pulled out a gold coin.</p>\n<p>“I’ve long suspected that hidden from our sight in unrecorded histories and the ashes of Alexandria, there lay technologies possessed by ancient man only hinted at in the myths and legends left in their wake. The automatons of Hephaestus, the construction of Pandora, and the wonders of Atlantis. When the once-prosperous family’s fortunes turned, items like this began to appear in circulation,” he said, placing the gold coin in my hand. “I deduced a cache of heretofore unknown treasures from the ancient world had surfaced and bent my mind toward obtaining them.</p>\n<p>“I traced the collection to Newport using a simple geometric analysis and frequency chart of the items as they surfaced. It was there I first adopted the guise of Mr. Ochi to aid in my investigation.” For an instant, I recognized the visage of the old reliable butler return in the professor’s expression, and it struck me then how dearly the absence of the man who never was had affected me.</p>\n<p>“Once in Newport, I made it known that I was an agent acting on behalf of a gentleman looking to acquire artifacts and that price was no concern. I paid a dear rate for the cache of silver and gold I acquired, but the real treasure, the crust-encased pieces of this automaton, were tossed into the deal for next to nothing.”</p>\n<p>“What you see before you is a re-creation and extrapolation of Talos’ intended form. Most of the original was beyond salvage, but enough components survived for a thorough analysis of the materials and to gain insight into the original design. I was able to identify and decipher the method by which his ancient builders set carved rods of quartz, tourmaline, topaz, and amber crystals within ingenious configurations to absorb, generate and store electrical charges. I also discovered, or I should say rediscovered, the curious alloy much of Talos is built from the fabled metal lost with Atlantis, aurichalcum—a metal most magnificent, with properties that not only conduct but amplify electric, magnetic, and gravitic energies.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/04/10/escape-pod-988-in-the-palace-of-science-part-2-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The first is that I have passed my greatest test as a man and, in doing so, have passed from this world. The second is that if this message entombed with me survives, a grave danger to humanity most assuredly survives with it.</i></p>\n<p><i>To my listener, I urge you to lift the needle from the gramophone, return this plate to the hole where you found it, and dig no further into the ruins where once stood Professor Thomas Washington Kelly’s Palace of Science.</i></p>\n<p><i>However, as with most of those driven to dig beneath the surface to uncover the hidden past, I expect your curiosity to exceed your wisdom. Therefore, assuming that a simple warning will not suffice to turn you away from disaster, I engrave my last testament with a diamond-tipped stylus into this fantastic metal so that my warning might endure. I pray it is sufficient to convince whoever comes upon it to succeed where I failed and bury my story and the danger that sleeps with me deep enough that our shared grave will never be disturbed again.</i></p>\n<p><i>As these will be my final words, I’ll tell the story as I wish and start not where it began, for where it began is shrouded by the mists of time and far beyond the ken of man. No, I will start with the small part I played in the events, with a meeting or, to be precise, a series of meetings.</i></p>\n<p/><p/><p>Track Two–</p>\n<p/><p>I first met the Professor through a letter of introduction handed to me by his manservant, the genial Mr. Ochi. As a fellow Black man, Mr. Ochi dressed with enough flair and style to catch my attention regardless of circumstance. A crisp black jacket that looked like it could be fresh from Savile Row and a pair of equally fine yet mismatched gray pants that marked him as a servant, although clearly one of an incredibly wealthy household.</p>\n<p>Despite his sartorial splendor, the fact that he was directed to my desk at the Electro-Dynamic Light Company of New York by the company’s owner, Mr. Sawyer, is why I believed the letter was genuine and not a fanciful distraction from some bored dilettante pretending to be the reclusive genius.</p>\n<p>Like most men of science in my era, what I’d heard of the professor was only in passing and often contradictory. On the rare occasion that his name, Thomas Washington Kelly, was spoken, it was with the grave intonations one associated more with a whispered prayer than a name. If it wasn’t for the fabulous riches the professor accrued as the silent partner for more patents than even Edison held, I might have written off his existence entirely. Due to his almost ephemeral nature, many presumed he was more of a semi-mythic muse to the sciences than a man in flesh, some aspect of a researcher’s anima invoked for inspiration. Others suggested he was the nom de guerre assumed by a conspiracy of scientists whose secretive motives could only be guessed at, for how could a single man have attained so much knowledge across the breadth of fields he was accounted to be an expert in? Among the elite practitioners of our noble calling, however, there was no doubt that he was indeed a living man whose insight and intelligence rivaled the greatest minds of previous generations, with abilities perhaps even surpassing Newton and Archimedes.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/04/03/escape-pod-987-in-the-palace-of-science-part-1-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 986: Lyra, From Many Angles</h2>\n<h3>Lyra, From Many Angles</h3>\n<p>When they came, it was in a craft the size of a golf ball. Smooth and round and perfectly seamless, it cut open the night sky in a pale streak. For a scant second it struck a fiery blemish across the moon’s face, catching the attention of forty-four children, twelve adults and a bewildered flock of geese before boring a meter-wide crater into a dry lakebed in northern Mexico.</p>\n<p>The explosive technicians were the first to the scene. Then came counter-bioterrorism, lumbering in prophylactic spacesuits prophetic of their evolution into the Global Office of Extraterrestrial Affairs. Soon after came the Agencia Espacial Mexicana, the Northern Hemispheric Space Association, what remained of the UN, then a dozen other acronyms, most of which would dissolve before the year was out. The confused tangle of letters amassed around the crater, investigated, argued, agreed, backstabbed, and then finally excavated the little craft only to bury it in a bunker in Corpus Christi. There it stayed the worst kept secret on Earth for nearly fifty years.</p>\n<p/><p>Like all grand leaps in human history, first contact was actually a tedious series of small, blind steps, each in a different direction and each of unknown significance. After nearly a decade of excruciating international deliberation, of buffering their facilities against xenotoxic substances, gathering neutralizing agents and steeling the planet for the worst, the conglomerate of acronyms finally opened the craft.</p>\n<p>A hundred translucent sheets of alloys were peeled away, paper-thin and remarkably tough. With the heart of the spaceship unwrapped, a semi-viscous fluid was pipetted and plated. Darkfield microscopy revealed a dense, motile population of helical microorganisms.</p>\n<p>“It’s syphilis,” the surgeon general said upon receiving the report. “It’s goddamn space syphilis.”</p>\n<p>Modern textbooks omit her commentary, but they describe in great detail the reactions from other figureheads when rumors of a hostile extraterrestrial bacteria, inevitably, spread. Accusatory fingers were pointed across continents; calls to arms and quarantines abounded. Some countries preemptively capitulated to Earth’s new tiny overlords, but others were bent on destroying the invaders before the pestilent takeover. Shortly after one pro-Earthling faction forgot to carry the 0 and accidentally set off enough Joules to sink a quarter of Long Island into the sea, it was discovered that the syphilis from space was not nearly as virulent as its reputation.</p>\n<p>The creatures were nothing like their terrestrial counterparts. Their cell walls were devoid of recognizable glycoproteins or markers. They defied taxonomy. Germicides passed over them like water, heat failed to lyse them. A thousand animal experiments revealed no pathogenesis. Bacteriophages introduced to the spirochetes were found disassembled and arranged in oddly complex structures at the periphery of their nutrient baths.</p>\n<p>The biochemists surrendered. They stored 500 mL of the specimens at -80°C and let the rest grow in a comfortable lysogeny broth, waiting for something apocalyptic to happen.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, every public figure carries a sample of the spirochetes somewhere on their person. Dignitaries keep a dish nearby when visiting a new hemisphere, doctors and biostatisticians stash envelopes of powdered aliens in their pockets when they navigate epidemics. Vials of it can be found around the necks of policymakers and at-risk neonates.</p>\n<p>The Global Office of Extraterrestrial Affairs gives Lyra a little bag of the stuff—the same kind she vividly remembers using to carry a goldfish home from the fair. She cradles the organism as she had the fish, grip tightened with both joy and terror. That little bag will be the only thing that will accompany her when she leaves the planet.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/03/27/escape-pod-986-lyra-from-many-angles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

According to Joslin, Temporary Deputy Superintendent Ray McPadden of the National Park Service (NPS) told them that they had “[failed] to demonstrate acceptable conduct” after they hung the Trans Pride flag on the face of the granite monolith El Capitan.</p>\n    <p>“The messages my termination send out to the public is that if you have an identity that has been turned into a ‘ideology’ not in line with the current administration, your rights will be different than other Americans that fall into the ‘ideal standard’ for who and what a person should be, look like, and believe in,” Joslin told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. </p>\n    <p>An NPS spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic </i>in a statement that the agency is “pursuing administrative action against multiple employees for failing to follow National Park Service regulations.” They declined to comment on the specifics of Joslin’s case.</p>\n    <p>“We want to emphasize that we take the protection of the park’s resources and the experience of our visitors very seriously, and will not tolerate violations of laws and regulations that impact those resources and experiences,” the spokesperson said, alleging that “several unauthorized demonstrations involving El Capitan” last year had drawn complaints from visitors.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/sj-with-flag-1-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Joslin stated that they displayed the flag for about two hours on May 20 during their off-duty hours, and noted that Yosemite regulations did not ban the hanging of flags at the time. The following day, however, the NPS appears to have updated the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/management/upload/yose-compendium.pdf\">park’s rules</a> to prohibit the display of “any banner, flag, or sign larger than fifteen square feet” on any natural or cultural features without a permit, citing the need to “provide for an unimpaired visitor experience” and “protect natural and cultural resources.”</p>\n    <p>While the new version of the compendium with the ban is dated May 20, the signature from the park’s acting superintendent, Raymond McPadden, is dated May 21, 2025. Previous versions of the compendium, accessed by <i>Hyperallergic</i> via the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250227002244/https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/management/upload/yose-compendium.pdf\">Wayback Machine,</a> did not mention flags or banners. </p>\n    <p>Hanging flags on the famous vertical wall of El Capitan is a tradition that many climbers have long participated in. In February, park employees <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/us/yosemite-upside-down-flag-protest.html\">flew an inverted United States flag over the side of the monolith’s cliff</a> to protest the Trump administration’s cuts to the National Park Service. Last June, climbers hung a banner that read “Stop the Genocide” to decry the US-backed Israeli military’s assault on Palestine.</p>\n    <p>The NPS’s termination of Joslin’s employment comes amid the Trump administration’s ongoing attacks on LGBTQ+ rights and visibility. In February, the national parks agency <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/990547/trans-rights-groups-protest-scrubbed-stonewall-monument-website/\">expunged all references to trans and queer people</a> from its website describing the 1969 Stonewall Rebellion. The erasure then <a href=\"https://www.them.us/story/stonewall-bisexuals\">extended to mentions of bisexual people</a> in May.</p>\n    <p>“In my celebration of identity and acceptance, I’ve been disparaged and deemed unacceptable,” Joslin told <i>Hyperallergic.</i> “It’s a tragic juxtaposition of how to treat human beings.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036200/us-parks-agency-fires-ranger-who-displayed-trans-pride-flag-yosemite/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The pointed triangular artifacts are too narrow to have been “fitted to anything other than arrow-like shafts,” according to a new study published in the journal <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328390#\"> PLOS One</a>.</p>\n    <p>The rock shelter site, called Obi-Rakhmat, is located in the foothills of the Tian Shan Mountains in northeastern Uzbekistan. Since the 1960s, archaeologists have conducted several excavations there, unearthing a trove of stone tools. These items included wide and thin blades, small “bladelets,” and triangular points called “microliths.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/birx1tl9QYt3YtPqlchDQfDoGDY=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(960x549:961x550)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/30/f4/30f4100a-d61c-45ed-8818-f0819efb3875/journalpone0328390g001.jpeg\" alt=\"map\"/>\n    <p>During previous excavations, researchers overlooked the microliths because they were broken. But as co-author <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hugues-Plisson\">Hugues Plisson</a>, an archaeologist at France’s University of Bordeaux, tells <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/80-000-year-old-stones-in-uzbekistan-may-be-the-worlds-oldest-arrowheads-and-they-might-have-been-made-by-neanderthals\"> Live Science</a>’s Charles Q. Choi, the microliths are damaged in a manner that’s consistent with other used arrowheads.</p>\n    <p>If the researchers’ hunch is correct, the artifacts would be the oldest known arrowheads in the world. They’re about 6,000 years older than the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/science/early-humans-arrowheads-volcano.html\">74,000-year-old</a> arrowheads found in Ethiopia in 2002. That site was occupied by early humans who were sophisticated hunter-gatherers, according to a study published in the journal <i>Nature</i><i> </i>last year.</p>\n    <p>However, scientists don’t know who made the stone tools at Obi-Rakhmat—<a href=\"https://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/homo-sapiens\"> Homo sapiens</a>, </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/homo-neanderthalensis\">Neanderthals</a>or another group. In</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18486185/\">2003</a>, pieces of a child’s skull and teeth were found at the site, and while the teeth looked like they may have belonged to Neanderthals, the skull was more difficult to place, “[preventing] a definitive attribution,” per the new study.</p>\n    <h4>Quick fact: When did the Neanderthals live?</h4>\n    <p><a href=\"https://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/homo-neanderthalensis\">Neanderthals</a> inhabited present-day Europe and Central Asia from roughly 400,000 to 40,000 years ago.</p>\n    <p>When the microliths were made, Uzbekistan was inhabited primarily by Neanderthals. But while Neanderthals did create <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Neanderthal\">tools</a> like <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/a-little-boy-found-a-strange-stone-on-the-beach-archaeologists-told-him-it-was-a-neanderthals-hand-ax-180985578/\">hand axes</a>, they aren’t generally associated with “small projectile heads,” according to the study. As such, the authors think the Obi-Rakhmat microliths were more likely made by early humans.</p>\n    <p>“The appearance of the Obi-Rakhmat population in Central Asia coincides with the presumed time of the dispersal of anatomically modern humans in Eurasia,” co-author <a href=\"https://archaeology.nsc.ru/en/staff/andrey-i-krivoshapkin/\">Andrey Krivoshapkin</a>, a historian at the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of the Russian Academy of Sciences, tells <i>Live Science</i>, adding that these humans may have migrated from the Middle East.</p>\n    <p>Hunting was vital for both Neanderthals and <i>Homo sapiens</i>. “In turning to animals for sustenance, the <i>Homo</i> lineage hit on a winning strategy, one that would help fuel its rise to world domination,” wrote <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-hunting-made-us-human/\"> Scientific American</a>’s Kate Wong in 2014.

Meanwhile,</p>\n    <p><i>Homo sapiens</i>adapted increasingly advanced hunting tools over time, such as</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://australian.museum/learn/science/human-evolution/complex-technology/\">small-headed arrows, barbed spears and sickles</a>.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/YA2jCcmye7uNKmMnPZqeS0vbeiw=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(1125x793:1126x794)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/9c/e4/9ce434b8-65d0-4def-8c67-cfcd13fb3c44/journalpone0328390g007.jpeg\" alt=\"broken\"/>\n    <p>Upon migrating to Obi-Rakhmat, early humans may have had to compete for food with the Neanderthals already living there, Krivoshapkin explains to <i>Live Science</i>.

Quinn is a female cocker spaniel who has been sniffer-training since she was a puppy.</p>\n<p>The two dogs, along with their human handlers, traveled more than 8,000 miles to the southern part of Sumatra for their mission, according to an email Working Dogs for Conservation sent to supporters this week.</p>\n<p>Building upon months of earlier scent-detection training, the dogs first learned how to identify their target species by sniffing poo from the ten captive rhinos at the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary, located inside the national park. The dogs trained using scat from males, females and juveniles.</p>\n<p>Then, they headed out into the field to get acclimated to their new environment.</p>\n<p>“The jungle was a whole new world for them: dense foliage and new plants, thick humid air, unfamiliar wildlife and countless new sounds and smells,” according to the email from Working Dogs for Conservation. “Daily routines included jungle walks full of novel scents [and] watching local macaques swing by in the evenings.”</p>\n<p>Once the dogs were ready, they officially started sniffing, taking lots of breaks to cool off and stay hydrated. On just his second day of searching, Yagi found a pile of what appeared to be rhino scat on the ground. Later that same day, Quinn showed a behavior change that suggested a rhino had been in the area.</p>\n<p>Scientists performed preliminary DNA testing on the scat, which indicated it belonged to a Sumatran rhino. To be absolutely certain, the Indonesian government is running two more tests, which are underway now.</p>\n<p>“Quite honestly, in my opinion, I trust the dogs,” says Nina Fascione, executive director of the International Rhino Foundation, to <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2025/08/sniffer-dogs-may-have-rediscovered-a-lost-population-of-sumatran-rhinos/\"> Mongabay</a>’s Jeremy Hance. “The dogs were trained on rhino’s scat. They found what everybody believes is rhino’s scat. We think it’s really good news.”</p>\n<p>If Yagi and Quinn’s noses are right, that means at least one Sumatran rhino is roaming around inside the park. That may not seem like a big deal, but even the discovery of a single animal could be a boon for the species. If they’re able to find it, scientists would likely capture the creature and use it to provide much-needed genetic diversity to the captive, breeding rhinos at the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/two-sniffer-dogs-might-have-just-found-a-lost-population-of-critically-endangered-rhinos-180987279/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Indigenous peoples across the continent relied on the animals for food, clothing and income. But by the late 1800s, the bison had been hunted to near-extinction, with long-lasting impacts on many <a href=\"https://news.emory.edu/stories/2023/08/esc_bison_impact_24-08-2023/story.html\">Indigenous communities</a> and the landscape.</p>\n    <p>Conservation efforts have since <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/when-bison-return-will-their-habitat-rebound-180977898/\">strived to restore bison populations</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/nature/bison.htm\">about 5,000</a> of the animals currently call Yellowstone National Park home. Now, a new study underscores just how important these large mammals can be for maintaining a healthy and heterogeneous ecosystem.</p>\n    <p>Researchers looked at the impacts of large, migrating bison herds on Yellowstone’s landscape and found that the animals play a key role in the nitrogen cycle. As the herd travels about 1,000 miles each year, moving back and forth along a 50-mile migration route, the animals increase the amount of microbes in the soil. In turn, these microbes increase the amount of nitrogen for plants, improving their nutritious value by up to 150 percent. The findings were published in the journal <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu0703\"> Science</a> on August 28.</p>\n    <p>“Humans have been applying dung as a fertilizer for millennia, so we know it’s an important fertilizer. Bison are a restoration story, and allowing their grazing in places like Yellowstone provides a ‘reawakening’ of the landscape,” study co-author <a href=\"https://www.wlu.edu/profile/hamilton-bill\">Bill Hamilton</a>, an ecologist at Washington and Lee University, tells Madison Dapcevich at <i>Outside</i><i>. </i></p>\n    <h4>Fun fact: Yellowstone’s bison</h4>\n    <p>Yellowstone National Park is the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/nature/bison.htm\">only place</a> in the contiguous United States where bison have roamed freely and continuously since prehistoric times.</p>\n    <p>To conduct their research, Hamilton and his colleagues monitored plant growth and diversity, nutrient cycling and microbial abundance in soil across 16 sites between 2015 and 2022. They compared grazed and ungrazed areas and combined their findings with satellite imagery and GPS collar data to get an idea of bison movement and map the creatures’ impact across the landscape.</p>\n    <p>The merits of free-roaming bison have long been debated among researchers and conservationists. Some experts believe the animals should be constricted to certain areas because they can contribute to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/bison-bellows-9-8-16.htm\">overgrazing and disease</a>. “Yet, we found pretty much the opposite of that,” says <a href=\"https://www.uwyo.edu/zoology/people/merkle.html\">Jerod Merkle</a>, a biologist at the University of Wyoming and study co-author, in a <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2025-08-bison-room-roam-reawaken-yellowstone.html\">statement</a>. Their data revealed an increase in plant diversity along the migration corridor, and the soils were able to sustain nutrient storage.</p>\n    <p>But to deliver the benefits detailed in the study, the authors stress that bison need to be able to freely move at a large scale across the landscape—not be managed in small enclosures, as is the case in most places outside of Yellowstone. About 400,000 bison are currently living in North America, but some 95 percent of them are privately owned as livestock, per the paper. Most others are in relatively small conservation herds in constrained areas.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/alc8q2AIpaXooVjxLeOUghOgSEk=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(1440x960:1441x961)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/80/1f/801fe5a2-562a-459d-b6a4-cf0c13db9571/when-bison-are-room-to-3.jpg\" alt=\"a bison herd seen from afar\"/>\n    <p>The findings also serve as a kind of time machine, allowing scientists to better understand what impact bison had before they were almost wiped out, and it hints at what the animals could offer if more of their populations were restored. “This kind of serves as an example of how, if large numbers could get large areas of land, what it might look like for restoring bison elsewhere,” Hamilton explains to Alexa Robles-Gil at the <i>New York Times</i><i>. </i></p>\n    <p>Overall, the study confirms what Indigenous peoples have long known about bison, as Tony Heinert, a member of the Rosebud Sioux tribe and chief of the branch of bison management for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, tells the <i>New York Times</i>.</p>\n    <p>“Buffalo helped shape this continent,” he adds. “And the more buffalo that are out there, the ecosystems are improved for all other animals as well.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/restoring-bison-to-yellowstone-has-reawakened-the-ecosystem-as-the-large-animals-migrate-study-suggests-180987278/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Four years later, the couple moved into their new home, where they raised four children. When George Lewis died in 1996, Clifton Lewis <a href=\"https://www.preservespringhouse.org/about-spring-house-institute.html\">established</a> the Spring House Institute.

After suffering from acne and even being on Accutane, Celeste learned how to actually heal her acne from within with lifestyle practices, diet and skin-safe products. Today she is going ot share her top tips with YOU.</p>\n<p>Let’s welcome Celeste to the blog.</p>\n<p>+++</p>\n<p>Hi loves! My name is Celeste Thomas, I’m a registered nurse and holistic skincare expert who’s overcome some majorly acne prone skin. My mission is to use everything I’ve learned over the past 15 years in the skincare and wellness industries to help you feel your most skin confident.</p>\n<p>I am that one friend you can always text for the best recommendations and honest reviews. I have researched it all when it comes to skin health and as someone prone to acne, I’ve learned that the most trendy, expensive products aren’t always the best choice. In this post I’m giving you the simplest, most budget-friendly tips to help your skin glow from the inside out.</p>\n<p>Here are 10 nutrition, exercise, and health tips that I live by.</p>\n<h2>Celeste Thomas on Nutrition, Health and Exercise</h2>\n<h3>Protein at every meal</h3>\n<p>Think Lauryn’s <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/what-i-eat-in-a-day/\">plate of ground beef</a>. IYKYK. Protein helps stabilize my blood sugar so I’m not sneaking my daughter’s cereal by 10AM. Protein also supports the skin’s collagen and elastin production, pretty much making you the hottest, most energized version of yourself.</p>\n<p>If there’s no protein, I’m not wasting my time. At least 20g of protein at every meal/snack is my goal and I even put it in my drinks. Here’s how I add protein to my morning matcha:</p>\n<p> Packet of <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4dJ9TvG\">Pique Matcha Tea</a></p>\n<p>1 Scoop of <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3T7g5oU\">Be Well by Kelly Grass Protein Powder</a> (20g of protein)</p>\n<p>1 Scoop of <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3T7lkoM\">Ancient Nutrition Collagen Powder</a>  (10g of protein) </p>\n<p>1-2 Tbsp of <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4g213L8\">Almond Milk Concentrate</a></p>\n<p>1 Tsp of <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3X6UA96\">NOW Foods </a>Organic Monk Fruit</p>\n<p>Whisk, pour over ice and enjoy.</p>\n<h3>Eating Home Cooked Whole Food Meals</h3>\n<p>I know this can sound daunting, but I try to do this as much as possible because it’s so worth it. I have more energy, clearer and brighter skin, and increased mental clarity when I am nourishing my body with home cooked whole food.</p>\n<p>It allows me to avoid the skin busting big 3 (stay tuned for this in the next tip).</p>\n<p>I cook 80% of my meals, so when I do decide to go balls to the walls with steak frites, a dirty gin martini, and apple pie à la mode I get to fully enjoy it because it’s an occasional treat, not my multiple times a week crutch because I didn’t have a plan and postmates’d shitty Chinese food in a hunger panic.</p>\n<p>I plan ahead and order groceries from Costco, Whole Foods, or Sprouts and treat myself to kid-free solo dates to the farmers market. Another way I keep it simple is by repeating meals. Burger night, taco night, and steak night are on rotation weekly, no shame in keeping it basic.</p>\n<h3>Eat to Glow</h3>\n<p>Diet is a huge component to keeping my skin clear. No matter how much money you spend on products, if you don’t nourish your skin internally you’re not going to get the Hailey Bieber glaze you want. The #eattoglow diet is anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, and supports clear skin, I swear by it. It’s all about adding in as much organic produce, grass-fed organic meat, and wild caught fish as possible and avoiding the big three.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>The Big Three: </strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Seed Oils:</strong> A recent peer reviewed <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0228074\">study</a>, found that people with acne have higher lineactic acid, which can also be found in various seed oils. I opt for <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3XnfGBu\">tallow</a> or <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3XlMoD2\">Ghee</a> while cooking or <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4dDjjc0\">organic EVOO</a> for cold preparations like salad dressing. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/celeste-thomas-on-nutrition-health-and-exercise/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>A few weeks ago I put up stories on my Instagram that showed you exactly what I eat and drink in a day, and the specific way I eat my bowl of meat that I always talk about.</p>\n<p>Eating more protein has a been a game changer for my body. I’m satiated, I have energy and you’ve heard it before – <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/how-to-go-from-blonde-to-brunette/\">my hair is the healthiest</a> it’s ever been.</p>\n<p>Anyway, to get everything all in one place for you, here is my entire day of food and supplements.</p>\n<h2>What I Eat In A Day and My Bowl of Meat:</h2>\n<p>+ As soon as I wake up I remove my <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/the-skinny-confidential-mouth-tape-is-here-for-your-deepest-beauty-sleep-ever/\">mouth tape</a> then I <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/bye-bye-bad-breath-everyone-tongue-scraper/\">scrape my tongue</a> (my fave is <a href=\"https://wellnesse.com/products/coppertonguescraper?oid=20&amp;affid=174\">this one</a> by Wellnesse). You should do this before consuming anything so you don’t swallow the bacteria that grows in your mouth overnight. Then it’s right into hydrating with tons of water that I keep right beside my bed.</p>\n<p>+ Once I’m downstairs I’ll take <a href=\"https://justthrivehealth.com/discount/Skinny\">Just Thrive probiotics</a>, because they’re one of the only ones that actually survives the trip to your gut. And I’ll also do a water with fresh lemon juice, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3wsZhk1\">unflavored electrolytes</a> or <a href=\"https://www.gopjn.com/t/8-12762-307361-261816\">Kroma’s Cranberry Hydration Elixir</a>, depuffing drops (sold out but get <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4bZFQQ2\">the debloat pills</a>), <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3uNke8H\">apple cider vinegar</a>, <a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1818040&amp;u=3239803&amp;m=113313&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=\">Quinton minerals</a>, and <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3I9Jed9\">colostrum</a> (listen to <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/the-skinny-confidential-him-her-podcast/id1093028505?i=1000628218024\">this episode</a> to learn more).</p>\n<p>The tumblers I like for water concoctions right now are these <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3UQDP2c\">glass ones</a> and the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3uJwbw2\">Simple Modern 40oz</a> ones.</p>\n<p>+ After the kids have breakfast, Townes and I go for our circadian walk. When we get home I’ll have an <a href=\"https://www.owlvenice.com\">Owl Venice bone broth</a> with lemon, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3wsktGJ\">turmeric</a> and <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3UKC3Qm\">Celtic salt</a>.</p>\n<p>+ Approximately 90 minutes after waking up I’ll do an iced coffee with raw milk. So many coffee beans contain mold and chemicals so I like <a href=\"https://getkion.com/collections/see-all?utm_source=theskinnyconfidential&amp;utm_medium=grin&amp;platform=grin&amp;link_id=901932&amp;token=I1ig1VYsapR97bn3xXrjICbxDaWf3izF&amp;contact_id=f8f17aef-04fa-4673-8770-b9356d52d2e9&amp;attribution_window=30\">Kion</a> the best. Huberman says “you need to let some adenosine fix itself on receptors before you consume coffee.” You can get raw milk from the Farmer’s Market but do your own research. Most days I add the coffee alkalizer by <a href=\"http://www.getoffyouracid.com/?afmc=2c&amp;utm_campaign=2c&amp;utm_source=leaddyno&amp;utm_medium=affiliate\">Get Off Your Acid</a> (use code SKINNY for 20% off your first purchase and get the strawberry kiwi minerals too).</p>\n<p>Michael and I think it’s the perfect pre-workout drink because it gives you a bit of protein, carbs, and fat, plus amino acids, antimicrobials, vitamins and minerals. Oh, and an iced coffee is best served with nugget ice. <a href=\"https://bit.ly/48s8DJY\">This is the machine</a> I recently bought and I fully recommend it along with this white <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3SON2Wb\">W&amp;P Porter tumbler</a>.</p>\n<p>+ Around 9:30/10 I head to the gym to <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/my-trainer-brent-hruska-on-micro-dosing-lowering-cortisol-how-yoga-changed-his-life/\">lift weights</a> with yet another drink concoction. Creatine is the most studied supplement in the world and it helps increase your performance and strength. <a href=\"https://www.livemomentous.com/skinny\">Momentous</a> is the one I use and I have 5 grams with a school of <a href=\"https://getkion.com/collections/see-all?utm_source=theskinnyconfidential&amp;utm_medium=grin&amp;platform=grin&amp;link_id=901932&amp;token=I1ig1VYsapR97bn3xXrjICbxDaWf3izF&amp;contact_id=f8f17aef-04fa-4673-8770-b9356d52d2e9&amp;attribution_window=30\">Kion mango amino acids</a>. And I’ll sip it during my workout.</p>\n<p>+ When I get home I’ll have a protein shake with <a href=\"https://bit.ly/48xiQoA\">Thorne fiber</a>. The protein I like right now is <a href=\"http://paleovalley.com/skinny\">Paleo Valley</a> vanilla. I do 2 scoops for 26 grams of protein and 1 scoop of fiber which is equal to 10 grams.</p>\n<p>+ After that I’ll have 3 poached or scrambled <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3P27H86\">eggs</a> with a bit of <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3SZUVs7\">Primal Kitchen ketchup</a> and a slice of sourdough with <a href=\"https://bit.ly/49wWVir\">grassfed butter.</a> Katie has been <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/sourdough-for-beginners/\">making sourdough</a> for me, but I also <a href=\"https://www.idevaffiliate.com/33359/idevaffiliate.php?id=248\">love this one</a>.</p>\n<p>+ For lunch and/or dinner I have a big bowl of meat. I take Force of Nature <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3wztSMC\">ground beef</a> or <a href=\"https://bit.ly/42ZAO1W\">venison</a>. Cook it up and then top it with <a href=\"https://bit.ly/48zxWtq\">Yellowbird hot sauce</a>, raw cheese, and <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3wBVFft\">Siete chips</a>. For snacks, I like venison meat sticks by <a href=\"https://mauinuivenison.com/?gclid=CjwKCAiAx_GqBhBQEiwAlDNAZq887S-BqJr52yUksAddPOmvATB91VtKIQ1oYVvH-OU6DMeMjdTP_RoClc8QAvD_BwE\">Maui Nui</a>, but <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3uH2BaF\">Chomps</a> and <a href=\"https://bit.ly/42UQlQs\">Paleo Valley</a> have delicious clean ones too. I shared my <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/paleovalley-beef-stick-review/\">Paleovalley Beef Stick Review</a> here.</p>\n<p>+ In the afternoon I’ll have a protein matcha with <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3SWuIun\">almond milk</a>. <a href=\"https://www.gopjn.com/t/8-12762-307361-261816\">Kroma’s matcha</a> has 10 grams of protein and is ceremonial grade. Matcha is such a good coffee replacement if you’re looking to cut down on caffeine.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/what-i-eat-in-a-day/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>You may know by now that mouth taping has been the most life-changing practice in Lauryn’s life. It’s changed her entire face, increased her energy levels and brightened her eyes.</p>\n<p>The benefits speak for themselves, but let us remind you, consistency is key.</p>\n<p>Over the years Lauryn’s developed some tips and tricks, of course, and today we’re sharing them all with you to enhance your experience and maximize your results.</p>\n<h2>Lauryn’s Mouth Tape Tips: Maximize Your Results</h2>\n<h3>\n      <strong>LIFT YOUR FACE</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>As I’m applying <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/mouth-tape?selling_plan=4150198365\">mouth tape</a>, I pull my face up instead of down. It helps my tongue rest in a proper position and also lifts my entire face.</p>\n<h3>\n      <strong>REMOVE WITH MIST</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>When removing your mouth tape, use a mist to ensure it comes off gently and doesn’t pull at your skin. I love <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3B1xbOK\">Primally Pure’s Plumping Mist</a> or <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/ice-queen-face-oil?selling_plan=4027154525\">Depuffing Oil</a> to make it super easy.</p>\n<h3>\n      <strong>REUSE YOUR TIN</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>You can find mouth tape tins all over my house, in all my bags, in my bathroom and on my nightstand. I use them for lip gloss, prenatal vitamins, throat coat drops when I’m recording – for everything.</p>\n<h3>\n      <strong>WEAR YOUR RETAINER</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>If you use a retainer or mouth guard, you can still use them while you wear mouth tape. I wear my mouth guard every night and wake up feeling energized and refreshed.</p>\n<h3>\n      <strong>USE THE SLIT, OR DON’T</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>We designed mouth tape with optionality. You can use the slit if you like to sip water through the night, or pull it up over your top lip if you don’t need it.</p>\n<h3>Benefits of Mouth Taping:</h3>\n<p>Breathing through your nose can help you establish a stable breathing pattern, which can help you fall asleep faster, stay asleep longer, have a deeper sleep, AND wake up feeling more refreshed.</p>\n<p>All those little hairs in your nasal passages serve a purpose. And that purpose is to prevent the introduction of viruses, bacteria, &amp; other gross things into the body. Mouth breathing while sleeping makes it so much easier for these yucky things to enter the body. But, the good news is your nose was literally MADE to be one of the body’s first lines of defense from any &amp; all sickness.</p>\n<p>Mouth breathing at night is one of the most common causes of nasal congestion &amp; that annoying sound we call snoring. Not only can snoring disrupt your breathing pattern throughout the night, it can also really annoy your SO.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.sleepfoundation.org/snoring/mouth-taping-for-sleep\">Sleep Foundation</a>, mouth taping for sleep changes the angle of your palate &amp; tongue, and thus, mouth taping reduces snoring. No snoring = better sleep = better LIFE! (P.S. another super handy hack to prevent snoring is <a href=\"https://getcanopy.co/products/tsc-humidifier\"> The Skinny Confidential x Canopy Humidifier</a>.)</p>\n<p>Ok, guys. This one gets a little gross…but we’re gonna go there anyway. When you breathe through your mouth at night, it can cause dry mouth, bad breath, cavities, yellow teeth, gum disease, &amp; tooth decay. It can also introduce yucky bacteria &amp; viruses to your oral microbiome and long story short…it’s NOT GOOD for your <a href=\"https://www.colgate.com/en-us/oral-health/respiratory-conditions/mouth-taping-for-sleep\">oral health</a>. You will see an instant increase in oral health by mouth taping at night. For more on oral health you have to check out <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/how-to-heal-your-oral-microbiome/\">this post</a>, there are so many good tips.</p>\n<p>Sleep disorders &amp; major disruptions in breathing throughout the night can have some seriously negative health effects. These effects can include stroke, heart attack, high blood-pressure, &amp; other cardiovascular issues. Mouth taping will help you regulate your breathing, which will help prevent spikes in blood pressure &amp; adrenaline.</p>\n<p>Nitric oxide is produced in the nostrils of all humans. So, when we inhale through the nose, the nitric oxide goes all the way through the airways &amp; deep into the lungs. This promotes everything from relaxation to expansion of blood vessels to the destruction of some bacteria &amp; viruses.</p>\n<p>Have you tried mouth taping? What is the number one benefit you noticed and how long did it take to see it?</p>\n<p>x, Lauryn and The Skinny Confidential team</p>\n<p>+ <i>Give yourself a  total mouth makeover.</i></p>\n<p>++ <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/mouth-taping-tips-for-beginners/\">Mouth Taping tips</a> for beginners.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/lauryns-mouth-tape-tips-maximize-your-results/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>This post may contain affiliate links and Corporette® may earn commissions for purchases made through links in this post. As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.</p>\n<p>Sure, we all know what wardrobe essentials for work professional women are supposed to have in their closets, but if you’re buying one for the first time or replacing one you’ve worn into the ground, it can be a pain to find exactly the right incarnation in stores. In “The Hunt,” we search the stores for a basic item that every woman should have.</p>\n<p>Today we're rounding up a trend I've noticed: the double-breasted sweater blazer. Are you wearing them to work? What pants are you wearing them with — and when are you wearing it unbuttoned?</p>\n<p>The Best Double-Breasted Sweater Blazers for Work Outfits</p>\n<p>Amanda &amp; Chelsea</p>\n<p>If you want to try the trend, this black double-breasted option from Amanda &amp; Chelsea looks great — it's $41 at Nordstrom Rack and available in sizes XS-XL.</p>\n<p>Yes, yes, boring as it's also the Workwear Report today, but I was excited to see that Elizabeth had found yet another double-breasted sweater blazer! In a lot of the pictures they seem to be buttoning only the closest button, as if it's single-breasted… I'm not sure if that would look right in real life, but your mileage may vary.</p>\n<p>The knit blazer comes in sizes XXS-XL for $158, at Anthro; it's available in four colors including red, beige, black, and a leopard print.</p>\n<p>M.M.LaFleur</p>\n<p>We've featured M.M.LaFleur's double breasted knit jardigan for one of our weekend open threads — I feel like this would lay beautifully when it's buttoned. It was $359, but most colors are $249 now; black has the most sizes in stock.</p>\n<p>Tuckernuck</p>\n<p>If you like a boxier, more relaxed fit, look no further than Tuckernuck. As they note, “this 100% cotton sweater is the ultimate transitional piece. Keeping you cool on warm fall days and warm on chilly days this cardigan is a must have for your closet. With gold-tone buttons and a boxy fit, pair it with jeans, a button down, cross body, and heels for the ultimate fall office look.” Nice!</p>\n<p>I tend to think of this as the OG of double-breasted sweater blazers: the Sofia jacket from L'Agence has been around for several years now. I like the patch pockets, the three-quarter length sleeves, and the general polish — this one has a bit more substance than some of the drapier options (including shoulder pads, if I remember correctly).</p>\n<p>The sweater blazer is $395-$450; you can currently find it in beige, white, and a dusty pink at various spots — and L'Agence has a few exclusive colors including a deep pink, black, and a “pale jade” (some colors as low as $237!).</p>\n<p>By Malene Birger</p>\n<p>Our most expensive pick features two trends: the double-breasted sweater blazer as well as the very long, wide sleeves popularized by Khaite; that trend can be a bit tricky to make work if you're wearing it at your desk typing (and eating and etc) while wearing the sweater so this one may work best as outerwear, but maybe I'm wrong. (Oof, just checked sizes and they are down to lucky sizes — so clearly some women are making it work!)</p>\n<p>The sweater is a wool/cotton blend, and is $580 at Neiman Marcus; they have it in both ivory and black. (Like the look? Here's a random dupe I found on Amazon.)</p>\n<p>What to Wear If You Don't Like Double-Breasted Sweater Blazers</p>\n<p>Not into the double-breasted look? These are some of our other favorite sweater blazers, lady jackets, and cardigans…</p>\n<p>Hunting for a great double-breasted blazer or suit? As of 2025, this Ann Taylor version is really affordable and comes in great basic colors, and Argent always has classic versions in lots of colors, as does L'Agence (in knits as well as blazers). Some other latest favorites are below:</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://corporette.com/the-best-double-breasted-knit-blazers-for-work/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>By  V. R. Craft</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The apocalypse is coming tomorrow, so of course, Richmart is a nightmare. Every aisle I turn down, eight carts block my way, all pointing in different directions. In the cereal aisle, I have to say excuse me three times before two women, having an in-depth conversation about tinfoil hat design, finally move out of my way, giving me filthy looks in the process. I reach the end of the aisle and discover they’re out of the cereal I like.</p>\n<p>Moving on to the cold foods, I struggle past a family of five with an overflowing cart. The mom yells at her kids that they’re not getting anything else and to put those juice boxes back, while the dad grabs a carton of eggs, then pauses with the eggs halfway to the cart. He turns back to the refrigerated case and grabs another carton.</p>\n<p>“What are you going to do with those? Throw them at the spaceship?” an older lady asks, reaching past him for a bottle of orange juice.</p>\n<p>The dad and mom stare at her, apparently suffering a simultaneous sense of humor loss.</p>\n<p>They look at each other, then at the older lady.</p>\n<p>Dad eyes the eggs. “You know, that’s not a bad idea. If they can’t see out their windshield, they can’t shoot lasers at us, right?”</p>\n<p>She shrugs.</p>\n<p>He grabs a third carton.</p>\n<p>The older lady walks off with her orange juice, chuckling, and I slide past the family to the soy milk case. Fortunately, plant-based foods rarely sell out, even the day before the apocalypse.</p>\n<p>It’s not really happening tomorrow. The apocalypse has been underway for a long time, and everything is just going on as usual. But, it’s true that a single spaceship, impervious to all Earth weapons, heads towards this rapidly disintegrating world, and every day, everyone runs to the store for bread and milk and toilet paper and chocolate and maybe a new big screen TV to watch the end of the world on, in the comfort of their homes.</p>\n<p>Still, I would hate to run out of plant milk for my smoothies this week, and I don’t feel like coming back here any time soon…</p>\n<p>I’m putting the fourth carton of almond/soy blend in my cart when my phone beeps with a message.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Can you pick up some apples? I found this great recipe for a tarte tatin.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>With a sigh, I turn my cart and head into the melee again.</p>\n<p>My phone beeps again as I pick the apples.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Also, I’ll need tinfoil?</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>It’s not to make hats, is it? I reply.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Hats?</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Never mind. I’ll grab some.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>When I get home, I bring my groceries inside, setting the apples and tinfoil on the counter. My phone beeps.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>I’m almost there.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>I step onto the patio I share with four other apartments. My neighbors across the way are bundling their kids into the car, waving nervously at me. I wave back. All the other apartments are dark, their occupants long gone for wherever they think is safe from the aliens.</p>\n<p>As soon as they drive off, I send a text.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>The coast is clear.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>The craft lands in the middle of the patio, narrowly missing the table and chairs I hastily shoved against the wall.</p>\n<p>I didn’t really think they’d come, but as they step out of the craft, I rush to greet them like the old friend they sort of are. Or feel like. We’ve never met in person, but we’ve talked a lot online.</p>\n<p>They didn’t bring the whole spaceship, just a very small landing vehicle. I ask if I can hug them, and they stare in confusion despite having a good translation program. I tell them never mind, then grab the tarp, and cover their spaceship, leaving a lumpy shape that isn’t any bigger than an SUV.</p>\n<p>Inside, they look at the apples in excitement. “I can’t wait to make my first Earth recipe. I read through 4,178,564 on my trip.”</p>\n<p>“Uh, that’s…a lot. And you settled on…apple tart?”</p>\n<p>“Tarte tatin. It’s French. Do you like it?”</p>\n<p>“I’ve never tried it, but I like apple pie.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://flashfictionmagazine.com/blog/2025/09/04/shopping-list/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>We had chosen our baseball teams in the alley behind our houses like always and started to walk down the block to the special lot, the one we still called our prairie; the only open space left in our neighborhood big enough to play any kind of games. Frankie, one of the managers for that day’s game, heard a commotion before we could see anything, so he held up his hand to stop us, just like John Wayne in one of those war movies we’d see at the Saturday matinees.</p>\n    <p>“What the hell is going on?” he yelled.</p>\n    <p>As we turned the corner we saw pickup trucks and semi trailers full of building materials lined up and down the street. Loud construction workers pulled materials off the trucks and piled them on our ball diamond.</p>\n    <p>Jimmy looked at me, “They can’t do this, it can’t be legal.”</p>\n    <p>“It’s gotta be a mistake,” Joey said. “If we explain to them, they’ll go away.”</p>\n    <p>Frankie and I approached a group of workers who were wrestling work fencing along one side of the street.</p>\n    <p>I tapped one of the workers, the tallest one, on his shoulder. Maybe he was the boss. Maybe he would understand. He looked at me and started to walk away.</p>\n    <p>“Mister, “ I said, “You’re at the wrong place. It can’t be here. We’ve played on this field for years. Our dads played here before the war.”</p>\n    <p>“I’m sorry, kid, the work ain’t stopping for youse kids, or anybody else” he said. “Stay out of our way. We don’t want anyone to get hurt.”</p>\n    <p>Backhoes were already starting to dig foundations for more houses and apartment buildings. Like we really needed more houses in our crowded neighborhood!!</p>\n    <p>We stood together outside of the fence, hoping it was all just a dream. We wanted to tear it down with our bare hands, but knew our parents would never support any kind of hooliganism.</p>\n    <p>More workers walking by the fence told us to go away. They told us more trailers were coming to drop off pallets of bricks and lumber. More workers would join the people already working at the lot; raucous crews of carpenters and masons to complete the destruction of our ball diamond.</p>\n    <p>The tall man who first talked to me, he wasn’t so nice when he saw us still standing at the fence. When we threw clods of dirt at the trucks, he cursed and chased us away.</p>\n    <p>“Get the hell out of here,” he yelled. “If youse don’t go home in five minutes we’re calling the cops.”</p>\n    <p>All of us shuffled down the street, shaking with rage. We bit our lips, didn’t look at each other, afraid we’d see the tears on our faces. Even though the oldest players on the teams were only 12-years-old, everyone knew that baseball players didn’t cry.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/frankcmodica/home\">Frank C Modica</a>\n      <i>is a cancer survivor and retired teacher who taught children with special needs for over 34 years.

I remember I was in second grade when he came by with the crate and asked how I was doing in math.</p>\n    <p>“Twenty-six plus six is one,” I said.</p>\n    <p>He loved it. He was half-Irish, which made me one-eight Irish. Not much Irish, many would say, but we had our own history.</p>\n    <p>Centuries earlier expulsion waves brought tens of thousands from the Emerald Isle to our part of Central Europe. They were refugees but had standards high enough not to stop in France or Germany.</p>\n    <p>The Irish worked hard, drank hard, and intermarried with the tossed salad of Austrians, Slovaks and Hungarians. Now, after several generations, only a few know or care about having a few pints of Celtic blood. The others have been reduced to marvel why their last name is Kenedi or Onel. One thing has endured, though, and as a result all the good townspeople become Irish once a year.</p>\n    <p>Legend has it, when news arrived from Ireland about one of the more productive massacres by the British, a painting of the Madonna shed tears of blood. On the day of anniversary the faithful go to the cathedral to kiss the picture, luckily covered by glass and wiped down after each smooch by a church servant. The blood drops are faded brown, still visible enough so only the most cynical atheists would dare question the miracle.</p>\n    <p>“The blood stains will miraculously disappear the day Ireland gains total independence,” my grandpa whispered to me, standing in the long line.</p>\n    <p>Years later, after I flunked out of college the first time, I visited him. I knew he was not well, still it was surprising to find him sitting in a rickety armchair late morning. “It’s pneumonia or a bad case of influenza. Stay away, it’s probably contagious.” Then he wanted to hear about my plans for the future.</p>\n    <p>I said I was going to join the Sinn Fein since Gerry needed more volunteers. He sighed and rolled his eyes. “What for?” A frosty response from a man who had the Starry Plough banner on the wall next to the crucifix.</p>\n    <p>I said, “I’ll go to Belfast or Derry and shoot the entire magazine of my AK-47 into a bunch of English soldiers.”</p>\n    <p>He waved. “Then what?”</p>\n    <p>“Then I reload.”</p>\n    <p>He waved again. “Go tell your grandmother to boil up water for tea. That with a spoonful of honey, and in a couple of days I should be back to my vigorous self. Then you and me, we’ll be on the beach checking out the young broads in their tiny bikinis.”</p>\n    <p>Even though most family members spoke little or no English, and our combined Gaelic vocabulary barely amounted to a dozen curse words, Irish music was playing during the wake. “That was one of his last wishes,” my grandma told us. I nodded. “He was very proud of his heritage.” Grandma rolled her eyes. “No, this is for your benefit. He told me, find some Irish songs for that crazy <i>mac soith</i>.

The woman tapped her long black fingernails on the card. Bree wondered how the woman was able to shuffle with nails that long.</p>\n    <p>“The hides of March?” Bree asked. “What’s a March hide?” Long purple curtains covered the walls of the small room, and unscented white candles burned on the side of the little circular table.</p>\n    <p>“The Ides of March,” the fortune teller said, enunciating clearly. She flipped her hand, and her long bat-wing sleeves fluttered dramatically over the small table with its crystal ball. Bree pulled her head back to avoid getting smacked in the face. She worried about the candles.</p>\n    <p>“I’m not understanding you,” Bree sighed. “When am I supposed to be aware?”</p>\n    <p>“March 15th,” the woman frowned. “The date that Julius Caesar was murdered.” Madame Hannah looked at her as if she was a moron, but how was Bree supposed to know about Greek mythology?</p>\n    <p>“Oh well, why didn’t you just say that?” she sniffed. “March 15th is tomorrow. So what am I supposed to be looking out for?”</p>\n    <p>“Chaos and change,” the woman said dramatically, leaning so close that Bree could smell the cinnamon gum on her breath.</p>\n    <p>“Could you, like, be more specific?” Bree wrinkled her nose. “Is it like being-hit-by-a-bus type chaos, or like can’t-find-matching-socks level chaos?”</p>\n    <p>“Another card is ten dollars,” Madame set the tower card on the table and extended her hand.</p>\n    <p>“I’m good,” Bree stood, ignoring the woman’s extended palm, and walked out of the little bookshop. It was a gorgeous spring day in Chicago, and Bree took a deep breath of the fresh air, tinged only slightly with bus exhaust. Though she knew she needed to get back to her desk, she walked slowly back to her apartment, stopping by her favorite smoothie store to get a mango and chocolate super kale surprise.</p>\n    <p>The line was long, and the smoothie staff moved with a lurching apathy that made her wonder if they were all stoned.</p>\n    <p>Twenty minutes later, Bree took her smoothie from the counter and sipped the bittersweet sludge. She really needed to get back to her desk. She had taken a two-hour lunch break, but that was the joy of working from home.</p>\n    <p>Back at her desk, Bree removed the vibrating device from her mouse that made it look like she was working and went to work. She answered a few customer emails and then browsed Amazon for a new blender. Maybe she could start making smoothies at home.</p>\n    <p>With a perky ping, Bree received a message from her boss in the company’s ugly messenger system.</p>\n    <p>“Bree, I’m going to need you to come into the office tomorrow.” Her boss’s message said. “8am sharp, and make sure you bring all of your company-issued equipment, please. See you tomorrow morning.”</p>\n    <p>Bree sipped her melted smoothie and wondered why her boss needed her in the office and if she could figure out an excuse to get out of it.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.healthywitchwellness.com/\">Julia Rajagopalan</a>\n      <i>is a writer and instructional designer whose short fiction has appeared in several anthologies and online magazines, and her upcoming workbook, The Healthy Witch’s Wellness Grimoire, will be published in 2025.

    "body": "<p>40th reunion. 40. How did she get so old so fast? She was popular and had plans. A “most likely to…” type. Succeed. Be on TV. Own a beach house in La Jolla. She did none of that and didn’t want any of that, but the party at Penmar Golf Course — $100 for hors d’oeuvres with an open bar — has her feeling jittery, thinking about what might have been. Most likely to become a cliché is more like it. She kept the yearbook, Venice High 1985, and opens it periodically to reconcile it with what she sees in the mirror. She’s not entirely unhappy. Her hair is still blonde, no bangs glued straight with gel! Her blue eyes look tired now but mascara helps. And she’s bigger, like everyone else. But her tits look good, even better than back when she survived on diet coke and Marlboro lights. She will not take Ozempic, at least just yet, like her friends. No Botox either but she knows it’s just a matter of time. Everything is just a matter of time.</p>\n<p>She looks at the scrawl on the back page — “My one regret: not asking you out…” — from the skinny kid with the big nose and curly mop, the one who became a writer. She probably would have said no but as the years go by, she’s developed an abstract crush on him. She’s followed his career, read a story here and there, a blog where he talks about his divorce. Divorce! When she read that, she got a tingle. She’s married and living a perfectly fine, decent, good life. But knowing he’s free out there is fun, harmless; she smiles mischievously when she sees his name on the rsvp list. She knows her husband would have no interest so she buys one ticket.</p>\n<p>What will she wear? A teal linen dress, tan flats, simple; she remembers he was short so she doesn’t want to tower over him but she does wear a push up bra so a little cleavage shows, casually, like she didn’t mean it, her boobs are so big she can’t help it kind of thing. She puts the yearbook in the large leather bag she inherited from her recently dead mother. She is hoping that maybe, after a cocktail, she could get him to sign it again, let him know that she’s followed his career, hint that it’s not too late though for what she doesn’t know. She feels reckless. Giddy.</p>\n<p>He looks different, bald now, a graying overgrown goatee; they all have changed, but she recognizes him from his author photos so she walks up, tipsy, and says, “Hey Nathan!” and he says, “Hi!” as he squints at the name tag pinned to her chest with a picture from high school on it. She says, “Mallory. We went to high school together!” and he says, “I think all of us here did!” And they laugh, she can feel her face reddening from the tequila, she’s half a margarita in. He says he doesn’t remember her and she pauses. It’s too late to run away so she pulls out the yearbook, flips to the back, points at the exact words he wrote. “You wanted to ask me out but never did!” and he says, “Huh, that sounds about right.” And she says, “Why not? Why didn’t you Nathan?” thinking that using his name will create some intimacy and he says, “I don’t know,” but he is charming enough now to say, “I was an asshole for not trying” in a tone that is more polite than flirtatious.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/getaway-car-rebecca-tiger/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>My prehistoric grandmother, exemplar of Generation W (W for Waste), shamelessly threw away new, unopened packets of Tico’s Tacos “sizzlin’ hot” salsa.</p>\n<p>Decades later I’m haggling with squatters to excavate Tico’s Tacos “sizzlin’ hot” salsa packets from garbage dumps. I showcase the packets alongside similarly excavated fast food detritus—styrofoam packaging, plastic cups and lids, faded wax-paper wrappers—all lovingly collected in a gallery behind glass. We’re rabidly nostalgic for these sorts of things because the Tico’s Tacos chain, like every fast food chain, no longer exists. Some of its architecture survives, such as dilapidated sombrero rooftops once neon-lit, and Tico the Cat statues waving hola from atop tumbledown signage. But mostly, reminders of the before times have vanished.</p>\n<p>I curate Portals to the Past on Mission St, inside the protected Zone. The gallery is three blocks east of the checkpoint, a razor-wire interface between us and the hungry world. Lately the hungry have been trying to breach our razor-wire. My contact, Zook, the squatter who led the most recent excavation for me—he claims the hungry are planning to attack again in three nights, the same goddamned night as my Tico’s Tacos exhibition opening.</p>\n<p>“You should delay your party,” old Zook says, smelling of urine. We’re just outside the checkpoint.</p>\n<p>“Why are you telling me about this?”</p>\n<p>“Telling you about what.”</p>\n<p>“The attack.”</p>\n<p>“Because, young lady, I like you. You give me work.” His toothless grin seems lecherous. I ignore it.</p>\n<p>We finish our transaction: one box of ancient and interesting restaurant condiments in exchange for one box of jackets and boots. Then Zook’s limping off into the smoky urban wilds beyond the checkpoint.</p>\n<p>It’ll be sundown soon. Portable flood lights flicker on. Security sentries inspect my ID, rush me back through the gate to safety, and I traipse down an empty Mission St sidewalk towards the gallery, eager to examine my box of treasure. But Zook’s claim about the attack irritates me. If he’s correct, my soirée will be a bust. People will be too afraid to come.</p>\n<p>Dean phones as I pass the old California Shakes coffee shop. “Did Zook get anything good?” he says.</p>\n<p>“We have a problem. He insisted there’s going to be….” I stop myself, realizing I’m likely the only one in the Zone who’s aware of this supposed attack. Saying nothing will guarantee that people can attend the soirée. “Actually, never mind.”</p>\n<p>“Never mind what.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t worry about it.”</p>\n<p>“Um, okay, so about the Ranger Rick cups, I wasn’t able to fully clean them. There’s smoke damage….” Dean updates me on this and more, but I’m distracted, conflicted about whether I should alert Security. It’d be the right thing to do. However, I’ve been working on this exhibition for months, putting so much care into it. And I really need the business. And further, Zook could be mistaken; maybe the attack is mere rumor.</p>\n<p>“Gotta go, Dean.” I disconnect the call.</p>\n<p>The gallery is wedged between a dental clinic and a market. To the east loom unoccupied green-glass skyscrapers—stilled giants, generals without wars. As always there’s not much traffic on the once-busy thoroughfare; the absence of activity creates vacuous silence and loneliness, but I’m used to it. Earlier in the day I’d unlocked and raised the gallery’s steel shielding, hoping that rare passersby might pause and admire my window display. Presently I’m touched to see an attractive young man viewing the display, a menagerie of plastic rainbow straws, remnants of a Bloopee franchise. Above the straws hangs a neat hand-lettered sign advertising my Tico’s Tacos opening.</p>\n<p>“You should come!” I place Zook’s box on the sidewalk, then gesture up at the sign.</p>\n<p>The attractive young man smiles a gleaming smile, stares at my breasts, says, “Looks interesting,” which pisses me off, not because of his ogling but rather because I remember the supposed attack and its repercussions for my soirée. “Yes, it will be interesting,” I say, flirtatiously nibbling my lower lip, concluding that old Zook is full of shit, that the attack is indeed rumor and nothing more.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/scarcity-ian-mahm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She had dated Ayo for three years, from two days after her nineteenth birthday till her twenty-second birthday. That night, as I let Ulari in through the kitchen, she whispered, 'It's over between us; he is going nowhere.'</p>\n<p>She described the night in a monotonous whisper as we lay in bed together: The misogynistic remarks Ayo laughed at with his friends, his frenzied dancing and liberal drinking while she sat in a corner waiting for him to be done. As his brown Honda Civic zoomed across Third Mainland Bridge in the still of the witching hour, she told him she didn't want to be with him anymore. They had been together for three years, and there had been a lot of fun, but she'd come to realise they didn't have much in common.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"\">Ayo began to cry and attempted to stop the car, but they were still on the bridge, so she asked him firmly to keep driving because she wasn't trying to get assaulted by agberos at three am. She said he begged, 'Please, don't leave me, Lari baby, please don't leave me.' When liquid-laugh spewed out of him, dribbling down his black silk shirt and into the tight coils on his chest, she whispered, 'Keep driving,' pretending not to see, hoping to preserve some of his dignity, even though it was too late. I probed, asking for details. I wanted to know how many buttons were undone on his shirt and synonyms for the smell of the regurgitated asun. Ulari shot a disappointed look in my direction, and I swallowed the cheer that threatened to bubble out.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>She left Lagos immediately after their breakup for a master's degree at Rice University in Houston, where she remained after graduating. She came home intermittently, regaling us with stories that revealed the expansion of her world, primarily through job postings in different countries. She'd been seconded to Paris for two years, spent three in Vietnam, and had been in St. Petersburg for nine months. At her last visit four months ago, we spent the day celebrating my new job at Landmark Beach. Returning, we stopped to refuel at a Northwest fuel station in Obanikoro, and I spotted a well-known Honda Civic a few pumps away. I should have faced my front and minded my business. But calling out to Ayo had seemed harmless enough.</p>\n<p>Later that night, when he called my line to speak to her, and she agreed to meet him for drinks at Yellow Chilli in GRA, I encouraged it. She was leaving for her real life in two days, and Ayo was always fun. I would know. I had bumped into him in a club or two over the years. He would introduce me to his friends as 'the sister of the one that got away.' He sent drinks to my friends and me, dazzling us with the latest dance steps. The victorious tug that now graced his lips used to be on mine. So, when Ulari returned from meeting him at Yellow Chilli, spouting absurdities about known devils versus strange angels,</p>\n<p><i>I just weak</i>.</p>\n<p>Ayo insisted that our family's reticence to their sudden engagement was only because he was Yoruba. He was, after all, a 'spec'. He would say this with a triumphant laugh as he tore into large chunks of meat originally reserved for our father, which Ulari decided was his due as her fiancé. He refused to eat at the dining table after their engagement was announced because he was 'no longer a guest' but our big brother, so Ulari would serve him in the living room. Every time Ulari joined him, he laughed at the way his fiancée rolled her eba in her palm like an 'omo Ibo'.</p>\n<p>'You realise 'omo Ibo' is an offensive term?' I asked once.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/07/ulari-and-her-idiot-by-nf-kenure.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The family of trees grows near the powerlines. A flock of white egrets search for food. Alyssa holds a puffed dandelion near her cosmos-red lips, the exact right shade for her skin tone.</p>\n<p>Data: Cosmos-Red is for lipstick, not an actual color. The real cosmos is deep, dark, black. But black lipstick would give Alyssa a goth look; she is the opposite of that. She is light, airy, like the silver behind a grey cloud on a sunny day.</p>\n<p>A girl runs over to the egrets, and they rise like a reverse snowstorm.</p>\n<p>\"Beautiful!\" She stares at the girl for ten point three seconds, before calling out to her. \"San Francisco snow, those birds.\" When Alyssa blows on the dandelion, she adds to the flurry.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"\">Data collation: snow drifts, storms, cars in long rows, riding through highways covered in slush. Branches on pine trees, weighed down with snow, bouncing. A cold clear night, ice on the pond. Hoof prints in the snow.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>I raise my hand and wave to the girl.</p>\n<p>\"You look like my dad,\" the little girl says.</p>\n<p>I study my button up shirt, my jeans, long fingers. \"Thank you!\"</p>\n<p>She runs on, but Alyssa continues to gaze in her direction.</p>\n<p>The wind takes one of the fluffed seeds higher than the human eye can see, and I follow it for nine point eight one seconds until it's out of my visual range. I imagine the rest of the seed's voyage through stored image data: blue, dark sky and stars, planets, galaxies, the edge of universe and time.</p>\n<p>\"This could almost be our first date, Mark.\" Alyssa curls in next to me. Her voice saying my name activates all sorts of stimuli inside.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, let's think of it that way.\" My left side warms five degrees in response to her body, like a cabin in a snow storm with smoke rising from the chimney. A glow from the windows. Frost shielding half the glass. The night darkening, silhouettes of the redwoods and powerlines. Lights on an icy coast, promising warmth.</p>\n<p>\"I'd like to have a baby,\" she says.</p>\n<p>Data collection: Images of birth. pregnant women, round bellies, babies curled, pushing. Doctors and nurses working together. C-sections. Live births. The afterbirth. Blankets: pink, blue, green. A mother holding and gazing, nursing, rocking. Both fall asleep. Fathers taking a turn at midnight.</p>\n<p>\"Alone?\" I ask.</p>\n<p>Data search: Couples holding hands. Couples having sex to conceive. Making love. That won't be us. There are limits to my capabilities. I search fertility treatments. And I search for the right words, caring words. \"Should you need companionship, I am here.\"</p>\n<p>\"Even when I was with my ex, I was alone.\" Contradiction. I raise an error flag, note the exception. Her hair smells like peppermint shampoo. Brown freckles appear and disappear behind the pink fabric of her dress. The skin on her legs is soft, unlike the rough skin of her hands. All qualities that would attract men. But she doesn't want a man. She wants a baby.</p>\n<p>\"It's easier alone anyway. I prefer it,\" she says.</p>\n<p>Data Search: Loners. People living in cabins in the forest. A woman, smoking under a bridge in New York. A boat motoring out of a bay, toward the sea. A writer gazing from his desk through a window at the ocean of city lights below. All are satisfied and sometimes improved by their time alone. Still, they long for something. \"I respect that there are times in a person's life when the need to be alone must be honored...\"</p>\n<p>Alyssa gives a slight nod. \"It'll be good to have you, if I have questions. Or I need a bottle warmed and help with a night time feeding, that sort of thing.\"</p>\n<p>Night time feedings. \"Staying up with a crying baby is no problem for me. You would get to rest.\"</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/07/zoe-30-by-joanna-friedman.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Image generated with OpenAI Within the car that slowly wound through the maze of country roads, no one knew there sat a young woman in dire distress, her whole life having unexpectedly plummeted into the lowest depths of human experience. Not even the driver, who was paying far more mind to the road on this black, stormy night, had any inkling that the female passenger behind him was in the throes of misery. Miss Paulette Fairbringer considered this fact while tasting the salt from her silent tears. No one knew where she was, and once they noticed her absence, she would be a mere talking point of scandal for a month at most, and then, forgotten completely. Every moment, Paulette fought the urge to look inside her velvet-lined reticule, knowing she would see two train tickets staring back at her for a train that had departed nearly an hour ago. In her mind she was still standing on the covered railway platform, the rain pounding on the roof, staring with elated anticipation at her lover before he uttered the words that she had never anticipated, and would never forget. In a dismal trance she gazed out the car window, watching the branches on the bare winter trees whip against each other in the violent wind. After a turn in the road, the trees gave way, and she could see a wrought-iron fence wrapped around a sizable estate, the shadow of a great house hanging in the distance. Such grandiose homes were a common sight for a daughter born into privilege and wealth. But a quick flash of lightning that illuminated the house struck up a sudden interest in Paulette, and a rather miraculous lapse in her melancholy occurred. \"Sir, what home lies on that estate?\" she inquired of the driver. \"Pardon?\" he answered, sounding distracted as he leaned forward to squint through the windshield, as no lamps lit this road. Getting the sense he would be of little help, she looked once more at the house, hoping to catch another glimpse of the overgrown ivy and the boards which covered some of the windows. It was then that she noticed a light seeping through the curtain of the uppermost window, bright enough that it must be electric for her to see it at this distance. But electricity in what looked to be a derelict and unmaintained old monster of a home? Even her parents had yet to install electricity. \"These blasted roads,\" muttered the driver. But Paulette hardly heard him, for her eyes were still fixed on the upper room window. She felt a quick tremor in her heart when the curtain moved ever so slightly, revealing what was unmistakably the figure of a person staring out. \"Stop the car.\" With the force and urgency that Paulette said this, the driver was quick to put his foot on the brake and turn to her with utmost concern. \"What is it? What's the matter?\" It took a few seconds for it to occur to Paulette that she had said anything, and a few more for her to realize what she had said. And then came the greatest question of all, why she had said it. No answers came to her, yet she could not deny the overwhelming urge to exit the car. Throwing open her reticule, she blindly dug through it to avoid seeing the tickets. When her fingers landed on several bills, she passed them to the driver. \"I don't feel right…</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/07/only-ever-four-by-kelsie-thorschmidt.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Children in shorts dunked buttered tartines into bowls of café au laits. A feast, but I was too nervous to eat.</p>\n<p>The poppies in the wheat field outside the window glowed like stop signs in the morning sun.</p>\n<p>\"Be careful, Lucy. There will be hell to pay if you're caught,\" they seemed to say.</p>\n<p>M. Thierry and his wife Mme. Mathilde Kasriels, the middle-aged directors of this holiday camp, clapped their hands in front of the stone fireplace.</p>\n<p>\"Alright, everyone. It is time to get ready.\"</p>\n<p>In fifteen minutes, a bus would take us to the town of Evian for an overnight trip.</p>\n<p>I'd just turned twelve. The five girls in my dormitory were all a year older than me. \"Don't forget your toothpaste, Lucy,\" they said, stuffing toiletry bags into their backpacks. \"You always forget</p>\n<p><i>les essentiels</i>.\"</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"\">Of course I'd remembered my toothpaste. My breath needed to be sweet.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>A whistle blew. Girls shrieked. Dozens of feet clattered down the back stairs toward the bus. No one seemed to notice my breaking away into the field of corn.</p>\n<p>The earth was damp with dew. The late August stalks stood tall, hiding my head. Silken crowns on the ends of the husks had already darkened to the color of rust. This was my last chance to escape. Tomorrow, if I made it, I would be free from my parents back in Paris - free from the horrible boarding school that awaited me in September.</p>\n<p>I stopped and yanked a flowered skirt out of my backpack. It would be so much nicer than the yellow shorts I was wearing. Five pairs of underwear and a training bra tumbled onto the dirt. Damn. What a butterfingers. At least the rhinestone barrettes slid easily into my short brown hair.</p>\n<p>The gravel road at the end of the cornfield was barely big enough for two cows to walk side by side. Georges, my favorite person in the world, was leaning up against his Deux Cheveaux a few hundred meters away. Smoke from his cigarette rose in the air. He smiled and waved his hand. His long red hair shimmered like satin around his shoulders. His bell-bottom jeans were iron-creased in the front.</p>\n<p>The sound of a car behind. My feet pounded over the stones. Metal doors slamming. Gravel crunching. Within seconds, hands tore at my blouse.</p>\n<p>\"Are you out of your mind, Lucy?\" Mme. Mathilde screamed.</p>\n<p>Georges waved again and took a few steps forward, but M. Thierry charged him like a buffalo and slammed him over the hood. His fist rained down on my hero's face.</p>\n<p>\"Stop,\" I yelled. \"It's all my fault.\"</p>\n<p>Georges fell to the ground.</p>\n<p>The Kasriels pushed me into the back seat of their Peugeot sedan. Mme. Mathilde jumped in beside me and grabbed my arm. The automatic locks clicked. M. Thierry turned his head around from the driver's seat. His eyes were wet.</p>\n<p>\"Did you think you could just disappear? Did you think we didn't care?\"</p>\n<p>Yes, I was a little crazed. Here is the story, told the only way I know how.</p>\n<p>My family lived in a penthouse apartment in the 16th arrondissement of Paris. Last June my mother laid out the Cheltenham Ladies' College uniform on my bed. In September, I would fly to England. Day in and day out, I would don this dull-green suit with a cloche hat.</p>\n<p>\"Oh Lucy, it's just lovely.\"</p>\n<p>The wool felt as rough as a Brillo pad. \"I should've flunked the Common Entrance Exam.

This is the story of my last, and most dramatic, trip to the Arctic.</h3>\n<p>\n      <i>My book,  Meltdown: The Making and Breaking of a Field Scientist, comes out this week, six years after I started writing it. It’s about my time as a female academic scientist traveling to remote field locations, and the illness that cut my career short. This Narratively Classic was critical for my book, as I drew heavily on its content and style to create a world that readers could understand and be immersed in. </i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>—Sarah Boon</i>\n    </p>\n<p>It was 10 p.m. one night in June of 2008 and we were cut off from our on-glacier camp. When we’d left that morning, it was sunny and the glacier surface was crisp and crunchy, perfect for our plastic boots and crampons. My graduate student and I had decked ourselves out in hats and sunscreen to protect us from the sun’s reflection off the ice, then headed up-glacier to check on a weather station and a stream gauge to make sure we were ready to capture all of the data we needed once spring melt began.</p>\n<p>It was a long day, and by the time we headed back down-glacier, toward our camp, my bad knee had started acting up and I couldn’t walk without pain. To make the situation worse, we realized that things had changed while we were away from camp. The warm day had melted the snow on the lower glacier, leaving a shifting landscape of ice slurries in hidden surface channels surrounded by small hummocks of solid ice. We got within 1,500 feet of our camp and couldn’t go any farther, as there were two slushy streams between it and us that were just too wide and deep to cross. My graduate student tried to cross anyway, but the slush was like quicksand. I had to yell at him to lie down and pull himself out by the arms instead of trying to kick out with his legs. Now he was curled up in the tinfoil blanket from the emergency kit, icy wet to the waist and moaning about not wanting to die. Thank goodness for 24-hour daylight.</p>\n<p>I couldn’t reach him, and neither of us could reach our camp. It was time to get out the satellite phone and call base camp in Resolute Bay, 250 miles southwest.</p>\n<p>Not all Arctic researchers have had the luxury of satellite phones or shortwave radios. Take the English explorers at the turn of the century: If they got in trouble on their travels, they had only themselves to rely on. Searchers were only sent out if the expedition didn’t return after several years. This is what happened to Captain Sir John Franklin, who set off to traverse the last unexplored section of the Northwest Passage in 1845. The story ends badly — Franklin and his crew died of zinc deficiency and scurvy, some resorted to cannibalism, and they left artifacts strewn across the Arctic tundra as they tried to walk for help. Franklin’s wife pushed for a search for the missing expedition as early as 1848, but it was too late for Franklin and his crew. More than 50 expeditions searched for 12 years before concluding that every one of the 129 men was gone. The searchers found only graves, relics and Inuit stories about the expedition. It wasn’t until 2014 that Parks Canada and the Royal Canadian Geographical Society finally found one of Franklin’s abandoned boats, the H.M.S. <i>Erebus</i>, on the seabed where the Inuit had always said it was. The wreck of the H.M.S. <i>Terror</i>, Franklin’s second boat, was found in 2016 by the Arctic Research Foundation. Both sites are currently being explored in collaboration with the local Inuit.</p>\n<p>The Arctic has long tempted researchers to take risks to answer questions of science. Consider Norwegian Fridtjof Nansen, who suspected that, rather than being static, sea ice was a dynamic system that moved ice from east to west across the Arctic Ocean, from Siberia to Greenland, and potentially over the North Pole itself.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/the-secret-life-of-a-scientist-new-book\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

To the west, acres of cow pastures rolled into the distant hills.

Looping through the branches and woven between the trees was a series of tripwires adorned with silver Christmas bells. My father told me he put them up to keep the deer from eating our apples.

For writers, that means carving out the time and space to finally give our creative projects the attention they deserve. We’ve designed our Narratively Academy summer class schedule with that in mind. And since we know summer is also for giving yourself a break, all of our upcoming summer classes are either short (one to three sessions) and/or designed so you can attend asynchronously. </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Sign up this week (by Sunday, June 15) and take 20% off any one of these classes by using the code EARLYSUMMER at checkout.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Read on for everything we have on tap!</p>\n<p>But before we get to the brand-new classes, just a quick reminder that we have Abeer Hoque back teaching <strong> The Insider’s Guide to Writing Personal Statements and Applying for Grants &amp; Residencies</strong> this coming weekend, June 14 and June 21. There are just two seats left in this small class, so if you want in, grab yours now!</p>\n<p>We all know that one of the trickiest things to write about honestly is family — especially parents. Talk about navigating emotional minefields! That’s why we’re so pleased to have Ladane Nasseri, a MacDowell fellow who has published everywhere from <i>The New York Times</i> to <i>McSweeney’s</i>, teaching a two-hour seminar later this month, <strong> The Way They Were: Writing About Parents and Formative Relationships</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you’re working on a memoir or a personal essay that you want to infuse with original reporting and research, don’t miss this class. Kristina Gaddy — acclaimed author, essayist and editor at the literary journal <i>true </i>— is leading a special two-part craft-focused seminar in July called <strong> Reporting the Personal Essay</strong>. Students really loved the first edition of this class last year, and Kristina has now expanded it to include a second day where you can discuss your own works-in-progress.</p>\n<p>This summer, just 10 writers will have the chance to work one-one-one with Narratively executive editor Jesse Sposato. Jesse edits almost all of the memoir pieces that are published on Narratively, and this is the very first time she’s teaching <strong> Summer Memoir Mentorship: Perfecting the Personal Essay</strong>. If you have a draft of a personal essay and you’re ready for professional feedback, Jesse will review and critique your story, hop on a one-on-one call to discuss edits with you, then review your revision and help you get it all polished up and ready to submit to publications. </p>\n<p>We could not be more excited about this next class which, honestly, everyone on our team wants to take ourselves! If you’re a journalist, essayist or other writer who has always wanted to try your hand at a screenplay, this summer is your chance to commit. Bill Gullo is a very accomplished Hollywood screenwriter and longtime educator. In <strong> this fun, fast-paced summer class, he’ll show you how to write a “vomit draft” of a screenplay in six weeks</strong>. What’s a vomit draft? It’s just what it sounds like: fast and disgusting, but productive. Plus you’ll feel better after you’re done! Any professional screenwriter will tell you about the importance of getting the first draft finished so you can step back and see what’s working and what’s not. Throughout these six weeks, Bill will walk writers through all the details of how to get that full first draft finished in a way that allows you to move forward with intention.</p>\n<p>One of our perennially popular classes, Katey Schultz’s <strong> The Fine Art of Deep Revision</strong> explores how revising your own writing can be efficient, productive and even fun — once you identify the concrete techniques that work best for you. Our three previous sessions of this class all sold out quickly, so grab a seat now if you want to get to work on revising your writing projects this August.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/first-look-check-out-our-new-summer-classes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Miller found himself teaching a man who was responsible for an unimaginably horrific crime. He turned his back on him just when he needed him and has regretted it ever since.</h3>\n    <p>We are so pleased to get to share with you this moving story, “One of My Babies,” from 2024 Narratively Memoir Prize finalist Matt W. Miller, an acclaimed poet who has recently taken up essay writing. Here’s what Matt said about working on<strong> </strong>this piece: “I’ve been thinking about and trying to write about, in poetry and prose, this experience for over 20 years now. I never quite arrived at what I was trying to say. I think only now, in middle age, with years of teaching behind me, was I able to really understand this moment. In many ways, this essay is a letter to a student, to any of my students, that I may have failed along the way.” Buckle up for this one, which asks the big questions and takes your emotions on a serious ride, leaving you with all the feels. Kleenex recommended.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/one-of-my-babies\"/>\n    </p>\n    <h2>One of My Babies</h2>\n    <p>What I recall about the prison is the smell. Not some dirty or rotting smell or even the fleshy old cheese odor of people who worked too hard and lacked proper access to deodorant. It was not that at all, even if that was what I expected when I was first buzzed into New Hampshire State Prison for Men to teach a class in literature and creative writing. No, the smell was clean. Too clean. Even beyond the antiseptic clean of a hospital. This was a scrubbed-too-hard-with-rendered-animal-fat-soap clean. This was a rub-the-skin-raw kind of clean. As I walked into the prison, it was everywhere. It was the kind of clean that made you feel filthy, like you could never be clean enough, scrub hard enough to be right. You could see it on the men too — their skin was dry and tough-looking, ruddy from scrubbing with the fierce, heavy waters that came out of the old pipes in this place. The correctional officers carried it on them too, but it was mixed with whatever they brought with them from the outside: a wife’s perfume, cigarette smoke or the meat sweat of some steak and cheese sub they’d eaten at a pizza place right before their shift.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/star-student-also-committed-murder-reconcile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It was Jimmy’s first time in the U.S., and we were all beyond excited. This morning, Anton and I were reminiscing, and we thought we’d share photos…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/boys-playing.jpeg\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>Jimmy lives in a small seaside town in England, and <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/tag/anton/\">Anton</a> told me: “We were joking around, like, ‘Do you have cars in England? Do you have scooters in England? Do you have light in England? Do you have color in England?’ It was really funny. And sometimes when Jimmy would make a joke, we would be like, ‘Is that funny in England?’ But his jokes were actually really funny.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/louis-vuitton-suitcase-store.jpg\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>Jimmy asked to see a few sights, and we were happy to oblige. “Can we go to the <a href=\"https://40visuals.com/louis-vuittons-nyc-flagship-becomes-a-giant-stack-of-luxury-luggage/\">Louis Vuitton store</a> that looks like suitcases?” he asked.

They hit balls while I did the New Yorker crossword puzzle. “Jimmy told me he wants to ride in a yellow school bus,” Anton told me. “He’s never done that.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/boys-laughing.jpg\" alt=\"boys laughing\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>We also just mucked around at home…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/citibike-station-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"citibike boys\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>…and in the neighborhood. “When we were walking down the street, Jimmy was like, ‘Look at that, look at that,’ because there were so many different kinds of foods — Japanese, Lebanese, Thai, Italian, Vietnamese, French, Chinese, Indian, Ethiopian…” said Anton. “He also loved <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/04/style/frozen-yogurt-16-handles-ceo.html?unlocked_article_code=1.i08.DAQK.kOAZxI2rKWpo&amp;smid=url-share\">16 Handles</a>.” </p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cafe.jpg\" alt=\"Saturn Road Brooklyn\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>At the end of the week, <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/tag/toby/\">Toby</a> and <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2016/03/29/beauty-uniform-jean-goddard/\">my mom</a> joined us, and we went to a neighborhood café for coffee and magic tricks with cards.

It’s hard to live an ocean away from loved ones, as I’m sure many of you experience, as well. But we’re so lucky to be able to keep in touch. When <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2011/02/14/our-grandparents/\">my maternal grandmother</a> moved from Manchester, England, to Chicago with her new <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2011/02/14/our-grandparents/\">soldier husband</a>, she could only exchange letters with her parents, until they visited many years later. Where do your relatives live? Are you close by? Half a world apart? How do you stay in touch? I’d love to hear.

Tonight my kids piled into our bed to watch family videos from our favorites album on the iPad. I eventually put an end to it, even as they begged for more. I was stressed about bedtime, and tired…oh so tired. Grace, you gave me a bit of perspective I needed tonight. Even in my stress and stupor, I know these are the days I will miss the most.</p>\n<p>The perfect post to come upon, toddler asleep next to me, as I again question when it was that he was no longer a “baby”—knowing that he’ll always be my baby, even when he no longer sleeps beside me, even as we pass other families with baby babies at the grocery store while my baby walks by my side, even when he one day grows taller than me—knowing this day will come sooner than my heart will be ready for, and I’ll reminisce in the grocery aisle, maybe tear up or put my hand over my aching mama heart, then I’ll buy the chips. Thank you, Grace, for the important and meaningful work you do, always.</p>\n<p>I’m not much of a singer, but this makes me glad that I recorded myself reading The Gruffalo for my 4 year old’s Yoto player 🥹</p>\n<p>Love this. Definitely in the interminable bedtime universe and trying to savor it. My three year old calls out a lot and night and requests me to hold her hand. ❤️ but yes, sometimes my sanity is called into question in this season with two littles.</p>\n<p>Sitting here tearing up ( ok sobbing ) in the teriyaki place picking up an order for my daughter’s birthday celebration while she’s at my house with my son in law waiting for me. 37 years ago at this time she was not even a day old yet. Sweet sweet memories. This post by Grace is beautiful. I DID cherish every second, and still do. It was just yesterday, wasn’t it ?</p>\n<p>Sob! Beautiful comment too</p>\n<p>So excited to receive a text from 12yo almost 13, asking if I was going to shops and if I am can I get snacks so we can have snacks and watch a show. Any better Friday night invite?? No way. on the list maltesers, gum and chips. Hooray for chips.</p>\n<p>so fun!!</p>\n<p>My song for my oldest was “Sweet Baby James” and when it comes on we just look at each other and have a sweet moment of connection.</p>\n<p>More chips! So true. Anything salty.</p>\n<p>We’re out of the lullaby phase (I Don’t Want to Live on the Moon from Sesame Street was my go-to) but I did just rock out to Safe &amp; Sound with my 2nd grader. I’ll be sure to cherish it all, even when he’s asked Alexa to play it for the trillionth time.</p>\n<p>I had a song list that I sang to all of my kids when they were small. They fell asleep or calmed down if I started singing the songs. They’re all mostly grown now but they talk abt the songs sometimes. I miss singing to them and also reading to them. I read classic chapter books to them when they were in elementary school and had voices for all the characters. It was so fun. I miss it so much. Rocking them, reading to them, and singing to them…it went by so fast. I’ve had more years not doing those things with them now than doing them.</p>\n<p>In the twinkling of your eye, they are 18, 21,35, 42, now my son is 53….</p>\n<p>Man is this true. There is a card that is often on the rack right by the check out at the grocery store by me – it says “I blinked and you grew up”. I literally start crying in the check out aisle every time. I would give anything for one more little boy bedtime snuggle – mine are 24 and 26 now and well launched.</p>\n<p>My heart!</p>\n<p>This hits home.<br/>\nWe are dripping our daughter at college this weekend and moving her in.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/08/29/a-letter-to-you/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

They’ll be like, tell us about your upcoming event! It’s an old-school shopping experience, where they pull stuff and accessorize, and they’re just so excited for me.”</p>\n<p>“Then there’s Goodwill. You might come away with nothing, and you have to do it regularly. I go at least once a week with my kids. These days I’m into vintage sweatshirts and short-sleeve button downs, so I’ll just head to those sections because otherwise it can get overwhelming. It also depends on where you live — I’m lucky because I live in Connecticut and the Goodwills are super good here.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Tank:  similar. Skirt: similar.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“These days, for my hair, I’m doing the whole shower-then-keep-it-wet-and-don’t-touch-it-and-put-in-<a href=\"https://amzn.to/4mzppyx\">Perfect-Hair-Day-by-Living-Proof-5-in-1-Styling-Treatment</a> thing. It feels like a movement right now.”</p>\n<p>“Being a therapist is SUCH a good job. There’s something about listening to someone’s story for a full hour; I don’t think we get to do that a lot in life. I try to understand exactly what each person is saying. If they say the word ‘weird’ or ‘you know what I mean,’ I’ll push to make sure I’m not making assumptions. I have to be careful with my kids because I don’t want them to feel like they’re always in a therapy session. Sometimes I’ll ask, do you want me to offer therapy advice or do you want me to be a mom right now? If they want me to be a mom, I’ll just say ‘that’s hard’ and validate them.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Tee: thrifted. Overalls: thrifted, “handed down from my son, it’s the best having sons who are into thrifting,”  similar. Sneakers: Converse.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“I have a bee tattoo. First, because my last name is ‘Beesley,” and also because I went through a transition period, where I went from being Mormon to being not-Mormon and from being a stay-at-home mom to attending grad school for therapy. I had a lot of feelings about how Mormon women couldn’t hold higher leadership roles, whereas bee hives are matriarchal. A few days before I started at Columbia, I had a few hours before I needed to pick up my kids from school. There are a million walk-in tattoo places in New York, so I picked one and got it. It was a thrill. The only problem with the tattoo is that it’s on every pillow from T.J. Maxx to Michaels.”</p>\n<p>“As a kid, I was obsessed with gymnastics, and then I didn’t have an obsession for a long time, and now gardening has filled that space. My favorite things are watching gardening shows, reading gardening books, thinking about my garden, planting my garden, and watching my garden grow. My flowers cover the front yard, and I want to give our neighbors an experience — almost like an art installation, mimicking a field of wildflowers in the suburbs! It makes me happy to see people walk or drive more slowly as they pass by. I expect some flowers to get smashed or picked by toddlers — and I want them to. I should put out a sign that says, ‘Please touch.'”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Tank:  Old Navy. Leggings: Old Navy. Sneakers: Nike. Dog: “Pluto, the love of my life.”</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“I have a gap between my front teeth. Over the years, I’ve spent thousands of dollars trying to fix it — Invisalign, braces, porcelain veneers, temporary retainers, a permanent retainer — and finally, I was like, I’m not fighting this anymore. It only took me 40 years to embrace it, but now I love my gap.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/08/28/sharon-beesley-therapist-outfits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It was lousy, rotten timing, and I reflected that I should’ve done as Cecil said and called in sick, telling my superiors that I picked up a virus from the case we worked last week and taken the dawn shuttle instead of the evening one. But I knew it would’ve caused me more problems than it was worth, namely because the director would want to put me through a battery of tests when I returned to make sure I couldn’t pass the “virus” on to any of the computers or other sensitive equipment at the station.</p>\n<p>I should’ve done it anyway, because if I had, I wouldn’t be sitting here in the director’s office, listening as she handed me an assignment that almost certainly meant I wouldn’t be returning home for the foreseeable future. Cecil and Halvor <i>both</i> were going to kill me.</p>\n<p/><p>“I don’t know if you’ve checked my job description lately,” I told her as I tossed the screen on the desk, “but I promise you that <i>babysitter</i> isn’t in there.” </p>\n<p>“But <i>other duties as assigned</i> is.” She pushed the screen back to me, then leaned back in her chair, crossing her ankle over her knee. “Eilan Lázár must be escorted safely back to the palace.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t they have guards to do that?”</p>\n<p>“Eilan gave them the slip a few weeks ago, apparently.”</p>\n<p>“The palace kept that quiet,” I said.</p>\n<p>“Would <i>you</i> want the galaxy to know that you lost the heir to the throne?” she asked dryly. </p>\n<p>“Clever of them, to have slipped past security.” Despite myself, I was impressed. The palace was the most fortified planet in the galaxy. For a child to manage to escape without notice was impressive indeed, and meant Eilan might have a chance of survival after all.</p>\n<p>“You have a teenager; you know what they’re like. Slippery little things,” she said, shaking her head. “Only problem is, Eilan didn’t expect their father to die while they were out joyriding across the galaxy. But now the king is dead, and the entire galaxy is on alert. Intelligence tells me that Eilan is in Alexandria. I need you to find them and escort them to the palace. It’s not an overstatement that you’re the only person on the planet—hell, in this galaxy—who can do that.”</p>\n<p>“I’m a detective, not a bodyguard,” I said. “<i>And</i> I’ve got a week of leave that’s been on the calendar for eight months now. I’m going home.” </p>\n<p>“Do you have any idea what kind of unrest it would cause if the heir is murdered before they can ascend to the throne?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“Yes. It would create a power vacuum and likely result in civil war.” I lifted one shoulder in a shrug. “I don’t particularly care, and I don’t see why you do, either. It won’t affect us. Barnard’s Star will become the independent system they’ve always wanted to be, and so will Alpha Centauri and Sol. We’re too far away from those systems for any war to reach us here.”</p>\n<p>“Infrastructure across the solar systems will collapse; millions upon millions of lives could be lost–”</p>\n<p>“I don’t see why all that rests on my shoulders,” I snapped. “I am <i>one</i> android. You can’t possibly expect me to be able to keep the heir safe when people from five different solar systems want them dead. They’ll be killed before they even leave this system, you know that.”</p>\n<p>“Dominic—”</p>\n<p>I pushed myself to my feet. “I’m sorry, but the answer is still no. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have a shuttle to catch.”</p>\n<p>“I’ll release you from your contract.”</p>\n<p>I paused at the door, my fingers on the handle.</p>\n<p>“You’ll what?”</p>\n<p>“You heard me,” she said. “I’ll break your contract with us, wipe your record clean, and you can go home. For good, this time. Forever.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/06/05/escape-pod-996-sanctuary-part-1-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 994: Magical Girl Antifa War Machine</h2>\n<h3>Magical Girl Antifa War Machine</h3>\n<p>XYLIA</p>\n<p>We were at the bottom of a hole, a new construction site that went deep into the bedrock. I was the first to touch the artifact, a thing that didn’t quite have shape or color. I grabbed it. My new consciousness slammed into my mind so fast that there was just enough time for only one last wholly-human thought: <i>You’re a girl, you fucking idiot.</i></p>\n<p>My new form was sleek. Mathematically perfectly curved. Hyperfeminine in the truest sense. Breasts extending into six dimensions. A tall, lithe, highly reflective body. A smooth face with eyes burning with seductive rage. And strength, immense strength. I flexed and felt a distant star flicker a warning.</p>\n<p>I turned to look at the three friends I was with: Sapphire, Ella, and Raven. They were looking at me. To them, this had all happened instantly.</p>\n<p>I tried speaking but it can out as a high-pitched sine wave. I tried again, this time delicately forming air into coherent acoustics. “Hey,” I said. “I think I’m trans.”</p>\n<p>“Are you still alive?” Sapphire, ever the caretaker of our little group, asked.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” I said. I felt extremely alive.</p>\n<p>I could feel the rock under me down to the mantle down to the core, yes, I could feel cosmic rays as if they were sleet, yes, but I could also feel exploitation like a bad odor, I could feel the carceral state like a skin rash, I could feel climate change like a life-threatening fever.</p>\n<p>And I felt the need to destroy anything that would doom this planet or its people. It was just an itch at first, but the need was growing. By daylight, it had superseded all other needs, permanently. And it frightened me, badly. That was disappointing. I had spent my whole human life frightened.</p>\n<p>So, I turned to my friends, and said: “Well? What’re you waiting for?”</p>\n<p>If I hadn’t felt so scared, I think I would’ve at least tried to explain the choice they were about to make. None of us regret what we did—I don’t think we can—but I should’ve given them a real choice. I didn’t, because I didn’t want to do this alone.</p>\n<p>I’m sorry.</p>\n<p>They all touched the artifact and transformed. We studied each other and noted that yes, we were powerful, and yes, we were extremely hot, but also: there was a military base not far from us. There was a Nazi dive bar less than a mile away. There was a cop beating up a homeless man just around the corner. We could murder the cop-we <i>should</i> murder the cop; we <i>must</i> murder the cop—and demolish the Nazi dive bar and lay waste to the military base. We must, we must.</p>\n<p>I did what I’d always done, which was avoid my needs with whatever was available. Booze, video games, breaking into construction sites at night, and or sex.</p>\n<p>I radiated the want and the question out to my friends and they replied, yes.</p>\n<p>I had never wanted to fuck them before. <i>Never.</i> Except Sapphire. But right now it felt like it was the only thing I could do to stave off this other thing. And my friends must’ve felt likewise.</p>\n<p>The construction site flashed brilliant colors as we slid into each other along axes that until that night we could never have dreamed of.</p>\n<p>SAPPHIRE</p>\n<p>We all knew Xylia was trans long before they did. For years, they’d insisted that it was totally normal for a cis guy to have three transfemme best friends. Probably nothing. They were such a pro at avoiding themselves that they had to literally turn us all into weapons to crack their egg, God bless.</p>\n<p>I used to imagine every possible timeline of what it would be like when Xylia came out and was finally able to requite the crush I knew I had on them. The timelines where we made out, and the ones where we didn’t, and the ones we made out and then over breakfast quietly asked if we could do this again.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/05/22/escape-pod-994-magical-girl-antifa-war-machine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 993: That Thing With Bob and the Crop Circles</h2>\n<h3>That Thing With Bob and the Crop Circles</h3>\n<p>So last Tuesday, long about noon, I found myself down at the hardware store to buy chicken feed for the ladies.</p>\n<p>I never gave much thought to keeping chickens, I must admit, but my niece Donna said I needed something to give me structure now that I’m retired. I had figured that going to the coffee shop every morning and reading up on my journals counted as structure, but apparently it does not, according to Donna. She came over in her little Subaru and set up a chicken coop and put three prime specimens of <i>Gallus gallus domesticus</i> in it for me. </p>\n<p>Two of them are hens and one of them is a rooster who believes very firmly that it’s a hen, and since I respect everybody’s right to go through life in the way that suits them best, I call them all the ladies. And I have to admit that keeping chickens is soothing, whether or not you’re retired, since they make very nice little burble-burble-cluck noises and there isn’t a lot of angst to a chicken. Too many animals around now who are full-up on angst, if you ask me, which I blame on domestication gone a little bit too far. I met a dog the other day that was part Basset Hound and part Chihuahua and one look in that dog’s eyes was enough to make you reconsider a lot of life choices.</p>\n<p/><p>But anyway, there I was at the hardware store, where Marlene works. Marlene’s a good woman and she runs that place with military precision, by which I mean that everything costs five times more than it should and nobody knows where anything is. Still, I like to shop local, so I went in and bought some feed for the ladies and then we stood around and talked about the weather.</p>\n<p>I do not know why people get so bent out of shape about talking about the weather, as if it’s beneath them. A really good conversation about the weather can go upwards of an hour and meander widely. We had just touched on the year with the Halloween blizzard and followed it up with the Christmas it was ninety-five degrees, when who comes into the store but Bob.</p>\n<p>You remember Bob, of course—Marlene’s boy, not the Reverend. I couldn’t exactly say that Bob was a friend of mine, especially since I relieved him of an ill-gotten narwhal he was keeping in his aboveground swimming pool, but we stay pleasant (if distinctly chilly on Bob’s part) because he’s Marlene’s boy, although Marlene herself has often expressed the opinion that she took a few too many herbal supplements during pregnancy. I asked her once if she meant marijuana and she said no, she never touched the stuff, but she had gone through a dark patch in her life when she was hooked on goldenseal and brewer’s yeast, so take that as you will.</p>\n<p>Bob stormed in and it was pretty obvious he was in a mood. He slapped the counter and said, “Mom, give me the strongest stuff you got for crop circles.”</p>\n<p>“Crop circles?” said Marlene.</p>\n<p>“I got ‘em all over the yard,” he said. Then he noticed that I was there and said, “Doc,” with a little more politeness than he normally would, on account of his mother being there.</p>\n<p>“Good morning, Bob,” I said. “How’ve you been keeping?”</p>\n<p>“You’d know,” he said, “if you bothered to follow me on Facebook.”</p>\n<p>“Do <i>not</i> start down that road again,” I said. “The last time I visited your page, you had linked an article by some fella who claimed that there is an international female smuggling ring stealing men’s semen, and that is not a thing I wish to have inflicted upon me before I have had adequate coffee.”</p>\n<p>“It’s true though, Doc,” he said, and I could see the fire starting up in his eye. Bob never met a conspiracy theory he did not embrace like a long-lost friend.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/05/15/escape-pod-993-that-thing-with-bob-and-the-crop-circles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 992: Nerves Into Circuits</h2>\n<h3>Nerves Into Circuits</h3>\n<p>Metal arms descend to press skin-soft conductor strips over my shoulders. The Neurasuit has been in warming mode for a few minutes–my overwrought senses accept the lines of heat like a gift. Despite my anxiety for the fight, my trapezius muscles relax, creaking in the silence. Released from the tension, my vertebrae settle into place with small snaps, one or two with each breath.</p>\n<p>Wires snake through my hair, massaging the scalp pain I didn’t notice was there. More swirl around my neck, tickle between my toes, seeking the overabundant bristles of my nerves. The Neurasuit folds around me with a hiss and a click, shutting out the cold night air. Before the systems launch, before the fight begins, I have a moment of perfect comfort in a little space built for me.</p>\n<p>Jolt. Systems connect. I am the Neurasuit, the metal is my bones, the forcefields my flesh, the hydraulics and wires my muscles and nerves. I am hard, my new limbs pressurized cannons of potential energy, my skin a web of humming electricity. (My actual skin hums too, but in a different way, protesting its own existence.) The lights flick on in lines, <i>onetwothreefour, onetwothreefourfive, </i>plosions of sensation rolling up my back, down my limbs, splaying into my clawed hands and feet. An exhilaration of wind curves around my artificial body. (It doesn’t hurt–for now.) My breathing tube conveys the stink of our enemies–like sulfur, like rain upon burnt ruins.</p>\n<p>Imri’s voice crackles over the comms, “Should’ve known they were coming tonight.” (Too loud. My ears echo every syllable with a repulsed spasm. I wince and the suit reads my discomfort, turning the sound down.) “Those clouds at sunset. Unnatural. Looked like the sky was full of tomatoes. Wish I’d realized and taken a nap.”</p>\n<p>“Doesn’t matter to me,” I say, “Couldn’t sleep anyways. At least we have something to do now. Trying to shut my shoulders up was getting boring.” (I’d rather be sleeping, despite my bravado, but we must work within our limits, must we not?)</p>\n<p>“That’s the spirit,” says Espen. (A wince in his voice. Seems we all are suffering from the change in air pressure this evening.)</p>\n<p>Imri is crouching already, the piston rods in her legs driven deep into their casings, waiting to spring. Espen and I sink down on either side of her.</p>\n<p>The metal, wires, and solder transform us into beasts: sharper, bigger, faster, stronger, with razor claws and ruthless jaws. The lights delineate our shadowy bodies, flickering like the rainbow cilia of comb jellies.</p>\n<p>We are the only people who can control the Neurasuits. Our over-communicative nerves will scream that a rough pants seam or an ice cube in the palm is pain, so they flood the gap between neurons and circuitry with abundant commands, compelling the suits to follow our impulses as if they were our own bodies.</p>\n<p>Imri discovered our latent powers some five years ago, when we were mere roommates, trying to make a dingy, too-small house suit our diverging needs. At the time, her nighttime tinkering in the cramped shed was an oddity that Espen and I envied–where did she find the energy after her nine-to-five as an engineer? We hadn’t guessed it was a bid for survival, for our city and for our struggling bodies. We didn’t know those robot skeletons would be the bond that would cement us as a unit–fighters, friends, comrades.</p>\n<p>Espen’s head lifts, jaws opening to take in more scent. “Which direction are they coming from?”</p>\n<p>I turn my face to the clouds boiling in the night sky. Lenses twist and stack in front of my eyes, magnifying a blur of motion. “There,” I say, pointing with a talon. (Such a smooth movement! My actual fingers are dry and stiff, curled tight against my chest. I stretch them, but they’ll fold back before long.) A flash of light, falling like a shooting star. There, then gone.

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 991: After the Rain</h2>\n<h3>After the Rain</h3>\n<p>I love a heavy summer storm. I love it when the rain falls so suddenly there’s no avoiding it and you’re drenched in seconds, or when the drops hit the ground so hard they bounce right back up at you. I love the crack of thunder that precedes the rain, and the rainbows that come after. This was the kind of storm I was riding through, just returned to our village after one of my courier runs to the neighboring communities.</p>\n<p>Racing through puddles, I didn’t mind the mud splashing up at me or that all this moisture was going to make a frizzy mess of my long curls. I spread my arms and raised my face to the clouds, relishing the coolness after building up a sweat over the miles I’d ridden. As I cut through our food forest, the tree canopy abruptly ended my impromptu shower, so I went back to focusing on my path, careful to keep my bike to the walking trails so as not to damage the ground cover plants.</p>\n<p>Passing one of the lower bushes, several chickens taking shelter burst out, startled, clucking their displeasure. <i>That’s odd</i>, I thought. <i>Someone must’ve left the coop open</i>. I hoped no predators had gotten into it. </p>\n<p/><p>As I emerged from the forest, the rain was already beginning to slow. I wound my way through the narrow paths between the buildings of our community, reaching up to gently touch the leaves of the hanging plants that descended from the balconies, creating my own little downpour. In some places, climbing plants rose up to meet the hanging ones, entangling like lovers, supporting each other as they grew. It made me think about how all of us in the village supported each other and were stronger for it, too.</p>\n<p>Normally, a storm like this meant the village core would be deserted, so I was surprised to see a small crowd gathered around Emma’s toolshare. Emma stood, hands on hips, staring toward the roof with a dour expression. Following her gaze, I noticed Yi-jun had climbed up there and was looking around.</p>\n<p>I brought my bike to a skidding stop in front of the shop. “What’s going on?”</p>\n<p>Emma gave me a nod in greeting, digging her hands deep into the pockets of her overalls. “Hi Amalia. Got here this morning to find the lights wouldn’t work. Yi-jun says my solar panels are damaged.”</p>\n<p>“From all the storms we’ve had lately?”</p>\n<p>“Not likely,” Yi-jun said, from his perch on the roof. “One of the panels is missing altogether. A storm wouldn’t do that.”</p>\n<p>“You think someone stole it?” I asked, surprised. In our community we shared everything. If there was something you needed, chances were someone else could make it or share one of their own. Theft just didn’t make sense.</p>\n<p>“The turbine looks damaged, too,” Yi-jun added.</p>\n<p>“Guess it’s lights out for me for a while,” Emma said.</p>\n<p>Yi-jun came down and assured her he could fix the damage and get her a replacement panel. She’d have lights back on by tonight but wouldn’t be up to full power for a while. Emma’s response was what I’d expected: “S’pose you’ll be needing some tools.”</p>\n<p>Then she looked at me. “Don’t tell me you came here for a bike repair.”</p>\n<p>“Nah, but I <i>had</i> been thinking about stopping by for a tune-up, since it’s been a while,” I said. “I don’t need it breaking down halfway between here and Beachside and then having to hoof it the rest of the way with the bike on my back. But I can see things are a bit hectic for you today.”</p>\n<p>“Never mind that,” she said. “Leave the bike. I’ll take a look at it out here once the rain stops. Won’t take long.”</p>\n<p>“Thanks. I appreciate it.”</p>\n<p>“You can do me a favor in return,” she said. “Head down to the potter’s if you don’t mind. He’s got some tools he borrowed I need back.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/05/01/escape-pod-991-after-the-rain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

When I get to the hotel I take my Barefoot Dreams blanket out of my carry-on and let it air out. Then I set up a station with my supplements, beauty products and wellness stuff. I call room service for a huge bottle of water and lemon wedges, fresh mint tea (or iced tea). While I wait I hang up all my clothes and unpack.</p>\n<p><strong>LB:</strong> Before a trip I get my brows done by Lena at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/browline_studio_atx/\">Browline Studios</a> in Austin and along with using <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/brow-peptide?selling_plan=4029317213\">Brow Peptide</a> twice a day, it keeps you looking youthful and refined with almost no makeup. </p>\n<p>The tint in <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/sunscreen?selling_plan=4029120605\">Caffeinated SPF</a> is perfect for a quick, put together look without a lot of effort.

It lasts forever. </p>\n<p>I also do <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/pink-balls-facial-massager\">facial massage</a> and meditate every morning and schedule workouts during a vacation. I might not get to all of them but I make it a point to still work out on holiday and take <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4g3KfE0\">Arrae Tone</a> pre-exercise. All of these things help you feel your best during the entire holiday.</p>\n<p><strong>LB:</strong> During this pregnancy I ate a lot of liver, I took creatine the entire time (check with your own doctor), and used the <a href=\"https://lightstim.com\">Lightstim panel</a> every single night on my face. </p>\n<p>Three things I will continue to do postpartum:</p>\n<p>Putting my feet in the grass and getting sunlight in my eyes first thing in the morning.</p>\n<p>Creating boundaries and purpose around my phone.</p>\n<p>Not scrolling on social media at all.</p>\n<p>I’m focusing on spending time with my kids, the new baby and being present. I’m also writing another book so it’s nice that I’ll be able to focus some time and energy on that.

    "body": "<p>Hair care shelves are packed with big promises… and even bigger ingredient lists that often do more harm than good. We’re talking harsh chemicals, synthetic fragrances, and irritating additives your hair definitely doesn’t need.</p>\n<p>We believe nature knows best when it comes to beauty. Natural ingredients aren’t just safer and gentler on your hair, they <i>actually</i> work.</p>\n<p>Take rosemary oils, for example. It’s all-naturél and does wonders for your hair and scalp. Pair it with castor oil, a tried-and-true remedy that’s been used for generations on everything from skin to hair, and you’ve got a powerful combo for long, shiny locks.</p>\n<p>Today, we’re sharing a simple DIY natural hair treatment using both rosemary and castor oil. It’s easy to make at home and perfect for nourishing, strengthening, and encouraging thicker, healthier hair.</p>\n<h2>Castor Oil and Rosemary Oil for Hair Recipe</h2>\n<p>We’re <i>big</i> fans of castor oil, and for good reason. You can use <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/castor-oil-for-lymph-nodes/\">castor oil for lymph nodes</a>, to <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/how-to-make-eyebrows-thicker/\">make your brows thicker, fuller, and longer</a>, and, as an overnight detox—check out our post “<a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/discover-the-nighttime-benefits-of-castor-oil-patches/\">Benefits of Castor Oil Patches</a>” for more information on that.</p>\n<p>After realizing how powerful of an oil it is, we had to try it on our scalp and hair, too. And as we looked into the idea further, we found that rosemary oil pairs perfectly with castor oil to boost hair growth totally naturally.</p>\n<p>Here’s how you can make your own castor and rosemary oil hair treatment:</p>\n<h3>Is Castor and Rosemary Oil Good for Hair?</h3>\n<p>Yes! There are so many rosemary and <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/castor-oil-for-hair/\">castor oil benefits for your hair</a>. The nutrients in the oil can increase blood circulation to the scalp, promoting hair growth. At the same time, castor oil’s antimicrobial properties can keep your scalp healthy, reducing dandruff and scalp infections. </p>\n<p>Beyond stimulating hair growth, the combination of rosemary and castor oils can also strengthen and moisturize brittle and dry hair. Their rich, hydrating consistency helps add shine and reduce frizz by smoothing those hair cuticles.</p>\n<p>Basically, castor oil + rosemary oil = all your hair goals.</p>\n<h3>What Does Rosemary and Castor Oil Do for Hair?</h3>\n<p>Promotes hair growth</p>\n<p>Improves scalp health</p>\n<p>Moisturizes hair</p>\n<p>Strengthens hair strands</p>\n<p>Protects hair from damage</p>\n<p>Reduces hair shedding</p>\n<p>Prevents dandruff and dry scalp</p>\n<p>Reduces scalp inflammation</p>\n<p>Improves hair thinning</p>\n<h3>How to Make Rosemary and Castor Oil for Hair Growth</h3>\n<p>2 tablespoons <a href=\"https://bit.ly/45wFcID\">cold-pressed castor oil</a></p>\n<p>1 tablespoon <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4mvm8Ax\">jojoba oil</a>, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4fRGRvF\">coconut oil</a>, or other carrier oil </p>\n<p>5-10 drops <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4mxwnnV\">rosemary essential oil</a></p>\n<p>In a small glass or ceramic bowl, combine the castor oil, carrier oil, and rosemary essential oil.</p>\n<p>Fill the sink with a few inches of warm water. Then, place the bowl in the warm water (don’t let any spill over the top). Let it sit for a few minutes to warm the oils.</p>\n<p>The warmth from the mixture helps your pores open up and absorb more of the oil. Make sure you don’t microwave it though, because it can reduce the potency and degrade the beneficial nutrients.</p>\n<p>Wet your scalp and then use your fingertips to apply the oil blend directly onto your scalp, section by section. Massage the oil gently into your skin with your fingers or a <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3HLcN8q\">scalp massager</a> for 3-5 minutes. (Use code TSC25 for 25% off the Pellequr scalp massager.)</p>\n<p><br/>Then, pour a dime-sized amount of oil into your palm and rub your hands together to warm it up. Starting from the mid-lengths, work your way down to the ends, smoothing the oil evenly through your hair. Repeat until all strands are lightly coated.</p>\n<p>Let the oil sit on your hair for 30 minutes to 2 hours. You could even let it sit overnight for a deep treatment, too. Just make sure to use a <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4msBZ2u\">shower cap</a> to protect your bedding.</p>\n<p>Make sure to shampoo thoroughly—we even recommend shampooing twice to remove all the oil and buildup. Then, condition your hair as usual for soft, refreshed strands.</p>\n<h3>How to Use Rosemary and Castor Oil for Hair Growth</h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/castor-oil-and-rosemary-oil-for-hair-recipe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Speaking of sore nipples, if you’re breastfeeding you have to try these <a href=\"https://bit.ly/45X8iQi\">Silverettes</a>.</p>\n<p>And while we’re talking about ICE, these <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4mLp7Fa\">Frida Mom instant ice pads</a> are amazing. You crack them and they get all cold and you put them in your underwear. So soothing post-birth.</p>\n<p><strong>Everything Spray:</strong> After I cleanse in the morning I love to use this mist. It’s hydrating, healing and you really can use it for everything. Use it as a toner, after a day in the sun, post-shave or as a wound remedy. (Use code SKINNY.)</p>\n<p><strong>Branch Basics:</strong> If there was ever a <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/your-non-toxic-product-guide/\">time to go non-toxic</a>, it’s with a new baby. From the cleaning concentrate to the laundry detergent, I feel confident using this around the house and on all of my kids’ clothes. (Use code SKINNY15.)</p>\n<p><strong>Beauty Salt:</strong> Now that I have 3 kids, I’m looking to streamline more than ever. Knowing that I get 3 supplements in one efficient scoop and that I’m hydrating properly with beauty benefits is a crucial way to start my day.</p>\n<p>It’s unflavored so I like to <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4oXFzTX\">froth it up</a> with Cymbiotika’s <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-24038909\">elderberry</a> or <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-24038961\">Vitamin C</a>. It’s like a little mocktail with health benefits. You can check out all our favorite Cymbiotika supplements <a href=\"https://partners.cymbiotika.com/TSC\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Claw clip:</strong> When I’m holding my newborn, I want my hair out of his face and off my neck and shoulders. Especially if they’re nursing or sleeping, the last thing you need is your hair tickling them awake. I love these claw clips because they’re big, easy to use and super cute to have in all your bags or around the house. </p>\n<p><strong>Pajamas:</strong> I’m a pajama connoisseur and I really stocked up before the baby came. These ones are so comfy (I have tons) and make you feel cute when you’re hanging around the house in a baby daze. I adore this collab with Eden Rock. When I was at the hospital I wore baby blue ones by <a href=\"https://djerfavenue.com/en-us/go-slow-pj-shirt-blue/\">Djerf Avenue</a> and they are the COMFIEST.</p>\n<p>You can shop everything <a href=\"https://www.shopltk.com/explore/laurynbosstick/productsets/11f055ef920ff5d68edd0242ac110019?utm_source=Klaviyo&amp;utm_medium=campaign&amp;utm_campaign=6%2F30+Lauryn%27s+Postpartum+Must-Haves&amp;utm_klaviyo_id=&amp;_kx=_eqU_s1fa4WWy8azfU4uPg.SDGCtL\">here</a>. I’m especially in love with <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4l347rW\">the pajamas</a> and recently got <a href=\"https://www.shopltk.com/explore/laurynbosstick/posts/f590b286-7397-11f0-b194-0242ac110022\">these ones</a> too. They’re so cute and gave me and Zaza and little matching moment on our Aspen trip.</p>\n<h3>Kid-Approved Activities</h3>\n<p>Like I said, we’ve been home a lot except for our trip to Aspen. We’ve been going for walks, playing in the backyard, gardening, Townes goes to tumble class and we <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/theskinnyconfidential/list/35BEQEFPYEJ3U?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_aipsflist_6E501VG26GKHQR3VM7PR\">read a lot of books</a>. On top of that, baking, cooking and just relaxing, here are some things Zaza and Townes loved to do this summer:</p>\n<p>Scrapbooking: You can buy kits or go to a local shop and choose <a href=\"https://bit.ly/41rC52f\">fun pens</a>, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4mCmaG9\">stickers</a>, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3V0ZJPc\">scissors</a> and make your own scrap books or vision boards. My kids loved <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4mFkBaD\">gluing</a> their own pictures and magazine cut outs into <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4mzDZ90\">their books</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/postpartum-lifesavers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We’re also exposed to it from artificial things like cell phones, Wi-Fi routers, radio broadcasts, smart meters, and even home appliances.</p>\n<p>Here’s the thing: you need to protect yourself from all kinds of radiation. We put on <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/sunscreen?selling_plan=4150296669\">SPF</a> to protect our skin from the sun, right? But what about when it comes to protecting ourselves from our phones and other Bluetooth devices?</p>\n<p>The good news is that there are ways to block this artificial radiation, too. That way, you can keep your family safe from any potential harmful effects without unplugging from the modern world.</p>\n<p>Here’s how you can stay connected <i>and </i>protected:</p>\n<h2>How to Block Cell Phone Radiation + What You NEED to Know About EMF</h2>\n<p>The sun showers us with ultraviolet (UV) radiation, while our everyday devices emit electromagnetic field (EMF) radiation.</p>\n<p>Just like UV rays, this type of radiation is totally invisible. That’s why it’s so important to know exactly what it is, where it’s coming from, the potential risks, and, most importantly, how you can protect yourself.</p>\n<p>Before we jump into things, it’s important to note that <i>not</i> all EMFs are bad! Take electromagnetic therapy, for example, that uses electric fields to stimulate the body’s natural healing process. Sometimes they can do pretty amazing things… when they’re necessary. </p>\n<p>Just check out the Gary Brecka episode of <a href=\"https://tscpodcast.com/episodes/gary-brecka/\">The Him &amp; Her Show</a><i> </i>to learn more.</p>\n<h3>What Is EMF Radiation?</h3>\n<p>Electromagnetic field (EMF) radiation is made up of electric and magnetic fields working together. As a result, this is the invisible energy that’s all around us. It exists across the <i>entire </i>electromagnetic spectrum, which includes everything from the low-frequency waves from power lines to the higher-frequency RF radiation used by cell phones and Wi-Fi.</p>\n<p>Essentially, electromagnetic fields (EMFs) include lots of different frequencies. Some are so low we can’t see or feel them, like those from household appliances. Others, like visible light, are easily detectable by the naked eye. All of these are types of electromagnetic radiation, just at different energy levels.</p>\n<p>As we mentioned earlier, not all types of radiation deserve a red-flag warning. Just like spending time in the sun has its benefits, certain frequencies of EMFs can be helpful, too. You can learn more about that from longevity expert Gary Brecka in our post <a href=\"https://tscpodcast.com/superhuman-protocol/\">What is the Superhuman Protocol?</a></p>\n<h3>Is EMF Radiation Harmful?</h3>\n<p>There’s a lot of debate about whether EMF radiation causes adverse health effects, but there is NOT a debate over whether it impacts our bodies. Even the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-electromagnetic-fields\">World Health Organization </a>acknowledges EMFs absolutely have biological effects.</p>\n<p>So the question is: Does long-term exposure to EMFs at <i>any </i>frequency cause health problems?  There’s research out there that says it does, and health organizations are telling people to be mindful of exposure to be safe. </p>\n<p>Here are some problems EMF radiation may cause:</p>\n<p>Sometimes, exposure to EMF radiation can bring on headaches, fatigue, dizziness, brain fog, or even skin sensitivity. For some, it’s because of too much exposure, but others are just naturally more sensitive to these fields.</p>\n<p>Radiofrequency EMFs from cell phones, smartwatches, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth devices can trigger <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/oxidative-stress\">oxidative stress</a> in our bodies. When this stress isn’t kept in check, it can damage our cells and DNA.</p>\n<p>Over time, as our body’s repair systems and immune defenses weaken, abnormal cells may not get cleared out properly. This, in turn, can lead to an increased risk of cancerous tumor growth.</p>\n<p>DNA damage caused by ongoing oxidative stress can actually accelerate biological aging. This means your tissues, organs, and skin cells lose their ability to repair and regenerate effectively, making your body more vulnerable to wear and tear.</p>\n<p>As a result, you might start to look and feel physically older. We’re talking things like wrinkles, low energy, and slow healing times. This doesn’t just impact your health, it <i>also </i>impacts your self-esteem.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/how-to-block-cell-phone-radiation-what-you-need-to-know-about-emf/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The former distorts the Earth’s poles, making landmasses like Greenland and Antarctica <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/21/nx-s1-5508358/mercator-map-africa\">appear disproportionately</a> large. Advocates for the change argue that the map misrepresents and diminishes the world’s perception of the African continent. The Equal Earth map, on the other hand, enlarges the continent to more accurately reflect its relative size.</p>\n    <p>First devised in 1569 by Flemish cartographer Gerardus Mercator, the ubiquitous Mercator projection features<strong> </strong>longitude lines that are equally spaced vertically across the globe. Latitude lines, however, are unevenly spaced, with the gaps between them growing wider the further out they are from the equator. This scaling creates a distorted, stretched-out effect at the top and bottom of the Earth. As a result, Greenland appears about equal in size to the entire African continent, when in reality the latter is about<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/03/05/how-big-is-greenland/81597696007/\"> 14 times larger</a>, according to some estimates.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/De5V0-1200x2609.jpeg?resize=1200%2C2609&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>“The current size of the map of Africa is wrong,” Moky Makura, executive director of the nonprofit organization Africa No Filter, told <i>Reuters</i> in an interview about the Mercator map projection. “It’s the world’s longest misinformation and disinformation campaign, and it just simply has to stop.”</p>\n    <p>In the Equal Earth map projection, continents appear to more closely match their real relative sizes. Unlike the Mercator map, in which latitude and longitude lines meet at 90-degree angles, its lines are curved to reflect the earth’s spherical shape, leading to a more accurate portrayal of the African continent’s scale.</p>\n    <p>Some technology companies allow users to switch between map projections, but the Mercator remains the default on many services. A Google spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that users can choose between it and globe views of the Earth on its desktop Google Maps interface. The Google Maps mobile app, however, uses the Mercator map, according to <i>Reuters</i>.</p>\n    <p>The Correct the Map campaign launched a <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/correctthemap-to-show-africa-s-true-size?recruiter=1363623859&amp;recruited_by_id=31b50b20-d90f-11ef-a26d-ff384a668a53&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_campaign=petition_dashboard&amp;utm_medium=copylink\">petition</a> calling for the United Nations and the British Broadcasting Company (BCC) to adopt the Equal Earth map, encouraging other organizations to follow suit. The petition had garnered nearly 7,000 signatures as of the time of publication.</p>\n    <p>“This distortion isn’t just a cartographic error — it’s a narrative failure,” Correct the Map’s petition text reads. “In a world where size is often equated with power, misrepresenting Africa’s true scale reinforces harmful misconceptions about its geopolitical and economic significance.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035968/africa-wants-a-more-accurate-world-map/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Seven years in the making, the show is curated by Carmen C. Bambach, an Italian Renaissance art scholar in the museum’s Department of Drawings and Prints who previously worked on The Met’s blockbuster exhibitions <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2003/leonardo-da-vinci\"> Leonardo da Vinci: Master Draftsman</a> (2003) and </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/press-releases/michelangelo-2017-exhibitions\">(2017–18).</a>\n    </p>\n    <i>Michelangelo: Divine Draftsman and Designer</i>\n    <p>Many of these pieces, The Met’s Director Max Hollein said in a statement, have never before been shown together — making the exhibition an “exceptionally rare opportunity” to explore the depth of Raphael’s artistry.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Portrait-of-Baldassarre-Castiglione_1514-1516-1200x1489.jpg?resize=1200%2C1489&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Raphael: Sublime Poetry</i> will span the artist’s early years in Urbino to his untimely death at the age of 37 in Rome, tracing the development of his ideas and creative process across his lifetime in a roughly chronological order. Thematic presentations — including recent scientific research, preparatory drawings, and a focus on his approach to portraying women — will aim to contextualize Raphael’s practice in a new light.</p>\n    <p>Among the masterpieces on display will be Raphael’s oil portrait “<a href=\"https://www.raphaelpaintings.org/portrait-of-baldassare-castiglione.jsp\">Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione</a>” (1514–16), which depicts the eponymous Italian diplomat in an intimate, soft lighting and striking, realistic detail, and his tender “<a href=\"https://www.nga.gov/artworks/26-alba-madonna\">Virgin and Child with Infant Saint John the Baptist in a Landscape (The Alba Madonna)</a>” (1510), which showcases the artist’s expertise in color and balance.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/The-Head-and-Hands-of-Two-Apostles-Auxiliary-Cartoon-for-the-Transfiguration_ca-1519-20-1200x1651.jpg?resize=1200%2C1651&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Sublime Poetry</i> will notably examine Raphael’s work through the lens of his “unique artistic personality.” Vasari, in his extensive chapter on Raphael’s short but prolific life, praised not only the painter’s embodiment of Renaissance virtues but also his enviable social ease, which earned him friends, patrons, and the admiration of artists and assistants in his workshop.</p>\n    <p>“Nature created him as a gift to the world,” Vasari wrote. “After having been vanquished by art in the work of Michelangelo Buonarroti, it wished to be vanquished through Raphael by both art and moral habits as well.”</p>\n    <p>The show is slated to open on March 29 and run through June 28.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Portrait-of-a-Lady-with-a-Unicorn-1505-6-1200x1543.jpg?resize=1200%2C1543&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037141/a-landmark-raphael-retrospective-is-coming-to-the-met/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

They are policing imagination itself,” Sherald wrote in her opinion, titled “Censorship has taken hold at the Smithsonian.

The work envisions the Statue of Liberty as a Black trans woman, modeled after drag performer and musician <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/basit_/\">Arewà Basit</a>, and graced the cover of the <i>New Yorker</i> <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1031893/amy-sherald-trans-lady-liberty-painting-graces-new-yorker-cover/\">earlier this month</a>. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/07/DSC03749-1200x927.jpg?resize=1200%2C927&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>Last week, the painting appeared in a <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036180/trump-targets-lgbtq-history-migrants-and-more-in-chilling-smithsonian-hit-list/\">26-item list</a> of artworks and exhibitions posted by the White House shortly after the administration <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1033993/trump-american-exceptionalism-smithsonian/\">demanded</a> the Smithsonian hand over materials so that it could make “content corrections.” In her essay, Sherald reiterated that she made the decision to pull her show from the NPG because of the institution’s “attempted censorship of [her] painting.” (The institution has publicly <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/artist-amy-sherald-cancels-smithsonian-show-censorship-concerns-rcna220865\">denied</a> that it censored “Trans Forming Liberty,” and told <i>Hyperallergic</i> in a statement that it “could not come to an agreement with the artist.”)</p>\n    <p>“While no single person is to blame, it’s clear that institutional fear shaped by a broader climate of political hostility toward trans lives played a role,” Sherald wrote. “This painting exists to hold space for someone whose humanity has been politicized and disregarded. I cannot in good conscience comply with a culture of censorship, especially when it targets vulnerable communities.”</p>\n    <p>Sherald also cited other moments of political interference in the Smithsonian’s history in her essay, including former President Woodrow Wilson’s insistence that the institution implement Jim Crow racial segregation during his presidency in line with his <a href=\"https://calendar.eji.org/racial-injustice/apr/11\">segregation of the federal government</a> when he took office in 1913. Because the institution operates in a public-private arrangement, receiving funding from both federal and corporate sources, the Smithsonian <a href=\"https://siarchives.si.edu/history/featured-topics/African-Americans/american-negro-artists\">resisted</a> pressure from the White House.</p>\n    <p>But Sherald cautions that there have since been successful efforts to influence the content of the institution’s museums. A 2010 campaign by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/dec/01/smithsonian-pulls-christ-video\">right-wing Catholic League</a> led the National Portrait Gallery to remove a video work by David Wojnarowicz depicting Jesus being eaten by ants, a commentary on the federal government’s homophobia and failure to take action during the HIV/AIDS epidemic.</p>\n    <p>In her essay, the artist invoked a quote by former Metropolitan Museum of Art Director Philippe de Montebello: “A museum is the memory of mankind.”</p>\n    <p>“If that is true, then to manipulate museums is to manipulate who we believe we are,” she wrote of the quote. “Control the memory and you control the future.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037072/amy-sherald-speaks-out-on-cancelling-her-smithsonian-show/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>HAMBURG, Germany — “Ok, stop the cameras,” the head conservator commanded from the belly of the storage department. “I want to hear what these instruments sound like without Satch wearing the gloves.” The other assembled staff, seated in a scatter of folding chairs beneath the MARKK ethnographic museum in Hamburg, lowered their phones and tucked them away.</p>\n<p>These museum workers had gathered in the MARKK’s basement to oversee and document artist and musician Satch Hoyt “un-mute” the African instrument collection, as he calls it. A masterful player of wind and percussion alike, Hoyt has been working to gain access to African instrument collections in colonial and ethnographic museums so that they may be played again. Within certain African diasporic traditions, some of these instruments are understood as tools to communicate with the creator and ancestors. Thus, this un-muting is not a mere symbolic act protesting the enforced dormancy of museum storage, but an affirmation of fluid continuity between the living and ancestral realms.</p>\n<p>Surrounded by masks and statues in the dimly lit storage den, who seemed to be watching, Hoyt dispensed with the white archival gloves he had previously been instructed to wear. He then began, gently, to play a sanza.</p>\n<p>“And then,” Hoyt recalls, “It was — <i>Pffuuumm</i>, you could just feel the energy all of a sudden in the room.” Touching the instrument with bare skin invited a rush that the gloves had shielded. “There was a feeling of gratitude,” he said, “of ‘Oh, cool — somebody’s reactivating this instrument.’ Somebody’s actually, finally returning it to its proper use.” Hoyt grinned. “It was like they were going, ‘Yeah, we needed to hear this’” — “they,” in this case, referring not to the MARKK staff watching as he acquainted himself with the museum’s African instruments, but to the audience of masks and statues overhead. “If it happens, you just feel it,” he said, referring to the rush of presence he feels when an instrument has been successfully “un-muted.” As soon as you put your lips on the embouchure, a certain feeling happens….”</p>\n<p>Born in London in 1957 to an English mother and a Jamaican father, Hoyt’s early acculturation came at a time when the British Empire was in free fall, as many of its colonies, including Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, and Uganda, had recently won their independence. Artists, intellectuals, and musicians of the African diaspora converged on the fallen and swinging capital, forging a new era of Pan-African thought. Hoyt’s early mentors were of this milieu, including the Trini filmmaker Horace Ové and the exiled South African jazz trumpeter and flautist Mongezi Feza. In Australia, he was embraced by the First Nations painters Clifford Possum, Turkey Tolson Tjupurrula, and Johnny Warangkula Tjupurrula. Later on in New York, he ran with the pioneering Afrofuturist MC and visual artist <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/tag/rammellzee/\">Rammellzee</a>, as well as cultural critic and musician Greg Tate and the band Burnt Sugar the Arkestra Chamber. In Paris, he accompanied Louise Bourgeois on recordings of her poetry and composed for Grace Jones. His list of friends and collaborators is long and illustrious, but nowadays, Hoyt is increasingly focused on ancestral ties, and is coordinating recording dates in museum basements instead of commercial studios. </p>\n<p>The process of “un-muting” first occurred to Hoyt in 2017 at the Berlin phonographic archive, while he was studying the wax cylinders that archaeologist Leo Frobenius recorded in the Congo a century before.<strong> </strong>Wax cylinder recordings typically feature a bed of unruly static, through which distant intimations of highs can be heard. The rest — overtones, textural detail, any semblance of bass or mid-range frequencies — is left to the imagination. Unsatisfied with daydreaming, Hoyt decided to cut a new path.</p>\n<p>“With the phonographic recordings that Frobenius did, afterwards, he acquired the instruments that people had been playing. So, I thought, ‘Well, we’ve got all of these instruments, which are in these ethnographic museums. I can play them. I’ve collected them over years, and they should be sounded.’”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037093/satch-hoyt-artist-freeing-museum-musical-instruments/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In April 2025, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/22/nx-s1-5340753/trump-democracy-authoritarianism-competive-survey-political-scientist\"> NPR reported</a> that in a survey of over 500 political scientists, the majority believed that the United States was moving from a liberal democracy toward authoritarianism. And that was before June, when regular Americans took to the streets in record numbers to oppose it. Over </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-parade-turnout-protest-no-kings-millions-1235365602/\">5 million turned out</a>to support the “</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1020681/photos-capture-millions-marching-in-epic-no-kings-protests/\">No Kings</a>” marches across the country on June 14 to protest Trump’s policies and a “military parade” on his birthday, budgeted at</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://au.news.yahoo.com/army-reveals-scale-damage-done-130929092.html\">$45 million</a>. But where can we turn to for resistance strategies? Might the historical rise of authoritarianism in the ancient world help us understand its rapid expansion today? A freely downloadable book by top ancient historians across the globe,</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783111705446/html\">(De Gruyter, 2025),</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>argues that it can.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>In the new anthology, edited by Frederik Juliaan Vervaet, David Rafferty, and Christopher J. Dart, the authors collectively claim that readers can use Ancient Roman history to make sense of the rapid descent into fascism in the United States. A key reason for choosing Rome as a parallel to America is the extraordinary nature of the moment we are living in.</p>\n<p>“Before now, no long-established democracy has fallen to internal causes except Rome,” the editors told <i>Hyperallergic</i> in a statement. “Several of the old, consolidated democracies around the world are in trouble, and political science has only recently started to confront that as a problem; they are used to thinking of consolidated democracies as pretty safe.” </p>\n<p>The book treats the late Roman Republic as a dataset. Although the editors noted that Rome did not have the same scope in terms of policing, healthcare, or inflation controls, they explained that democratic decay or creeping authoritarianism is primarily about “interactions of political institutions, about the relative power of the different parts of the state.” While comparisons between Rome and America are nothing new, <i>How Republics Die </i>analyzes these empires’ parallel lives to underscore the consistent methods used by autocrats to shift societies away from dissent, democracy, or independent thinking, toward a triumphalist narrative of the past that culminates in their own ascent. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.walksinrome.com/blog/maps-and-mussolini-via-dei-fori-imperiali-rome\">four large maps</a>that showed Rome’s ascent and empire from 753 BCE to 117 CE, along with a new map of Italy’s future conquest of Africa in 1936, which had to be removed because the campaign was a failure. This image is from 1935. (image public domain via the</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/maps/2022/03/out-and-about-in-a-provincial-empire-of-fascism/\">Library of Congress</a>)</p>\n<p>Although the United States became a “<a href=\"https://www.colonialwilliamsburg.org/discover/civics/was-the-united-states-founded-as-a-republic-or-a-democracy/\">mixed government</a>” predicated on republican and democratic models of governance, Rome adopted a republican model in 509 BCE. This came in the wake of the overthrow of the city’s last king. Four centuries after Rome’s Republic began, the underpinnings of the state and the explicit policies that limited the power of ambitious politicians began to erode rapidly. The book looks particularly at this period from the end of the Roman Republic to the rise of the Augustan New Order (133 BCE to 14 CE) — a time when Rome began to transition from an electoral republic to a military monarchy. Vervaet, Rafferty, and Dart told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that the decades marking Rome’s shift from a republic into an autocracy were heavily influenced by the arts. They also suggest how we might cross-compare Ancient Rome and America with other moments of rising authoritarianism around the world, such as in India and Belarus.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037152/an-ancient-roman-guide-to-donald-trump-authoritarian-playbook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>OTTAWA — I first encountered multidisciplinary artist Skawennati in person at her December 2019 talk at the former McLuhan Centre for Communication and Technology in Toronto. I recall that the artist wore Barbie-doll pink; I later learned that she is a Barbie fan.</p>\n<p>At the talk, Skawennati introduced herself as both an urban Kanien’kehá:ka (Mohawk) woman and a cyberpunk avatar. She discussed her longtime practice of costuming avatars in cyberspace as a means of realizing Indigenous peoples’ self-determination. This work takes place on a thriving, futuristic island built and maintained by the research-creation studio, Aboriginal Territories in Cyberspace (AbTeC), in the virtual world, Second Life. Later, she shared work-in-progress documentation for the project <i>Calico &amp; Camouflage</i> (2020–22), a fashion line of Turtle Island “resistance wear” — her interpretation of traditional ribbon shirts and combat pants as Kanien’kehá:ka protest gear — for both avatars and IRL models. </p>\n<p>At the time, I was taken by Skawennati’s commitment to working within a massive multiplayer virtual world that was, in my view, a ghost town. She was adamant that if the platform were to “sunset,” she would stop making her avatars: “In the end, I know it’s not mine,” she shared with me in a 2020 interview for <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-in-america/features/skawennati-abtec-island-indigenous-community-second-life-1202693110/\">an  Art in America profile</a>. The Montreal-based artist utilizes these characters, as well as settings and backdrops she has built and designed in AbTeC, for her machinimas and machinimagraphs — films and photography produced within virtual worlds. “That’s why I take lots of pictures, lots of documentation. As long as you know you’re not actually in control, you have a lot of control.” </p>\n<p><i>Skawennati: Welcome to the Dreahouse</i>at the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa. Foreground: the diptych “Dancing with Myself” (2015); background: “Birth of an Avatar (Homage to Mariko Mori)” (2017)</p>\n<p>Yet, as her current National Gallery of Canada (NGC) mid-career survey <i> Skawennati: Welcome to the Dreamhouse</i> proves, the trajectory of the past 25 years of her work lies not only in these machinimas and machinimagraphs, but also in her burgeoning work with fashion. The </p>\n<p><i>Calico &amp; Camouflage</i>collection was part of a turn in her understanding of the virtual as increasingly hybrid performative experiences involving garment-based sculptures and textiles. Within the NGC exhibition catalog, contributors Cheryl Sim and Mojeanne Sarah Behzadi make the case for how formative Skawennati’s engagement with fashion has been to her work overall. As exhibition curator Wahsontiio Cross, of the NGC, writes in the accompanying catalog, her creation of fashion and textiles has resulted in the artist finally “bring[ing] her idea of the future into the present.”</p>\n<p>The exhibition design for <i>Welcome to the Dreamhouse</i>, in which each room is perfectly structured for its intended purpose, is reminiscent of the Barbie Dreamhouse, aligning Skawennati’s multidisciplinary works with open-ended play. However, the artist clarified in conversation with <i>Hyperallergic</i> that she and Cross were drawn toward the “dreamhouse” concept for its aspirational potential. “A dreamhouse feels attainable. It might take work, but people think they can achieve it. I wanted to say with this show, this concept, this title, that a peaceful and just future is attainable.”</p>\n<p>Among the longstanding themes that carry through the show, a core motif is Indigenous futurism, wherein the pain of the colonial past is worked through a “future imaginary.” The term, coined by Skawennati’s partner and frequent collaborator, Jason Edward Lewis, reclaims historical narratives and centers Indigenous peoples in “exploring new cultural configurations that will enable us not just to survive, but thrive.”</p>\n<p>Across different galleries, visitors encounter new and old characters from the artist’s moving and still image works. Many involve Indigenous sci-fi retellings of Hotinonshón:ni cosmology and histories, ranging from the creation story told in “She Falls For Ages” (2017) to the ancestral narrative of the Iroquois confederation, updated to the year 3025, in “The Peacemaker Returns” (2017).</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036805/skawennati-cyberpunk-future-is-now-national-gallery-canada/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Sure, it may not be *that* cold out yet, but there’s something about the nostalgia of the season that comes flooding back with every bowl I make. (That and there’s always <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/07/5-summer-recipes-that-will-indulge-your-inner-child/\">gazpacho</a> for warmer days, right?) <br/>While I have a go-to list of fall soup recipes I lean on, I’m always up for refreshing it. (After the year we had, a refresher definitely felt in order!) Therefore, I took it to the internet to add a few more into rotation for this season, and I’m here to share my winning options with you today. So in the name of all that’s cozy and comforting, let’s dive in, shall we?</p>\n    <p>An oldie but a goodie, this soup always sounds like a good option. For this recipe specifically, underneath the bubbly layer of melted cheese (which I love oh-so-much) you’ll find two *secret* additions that make it really hit the spot. Click the link below to see what I’m talking about!</p>\n    <p>It wasn’t until later in life that I discovered my love for mushrooms. (And I’m so glad I did!) This vegan and gluten-free soup is one of the reasons for this, because of its creamy consistency and nourishing ingredients. It’s safe to say I will be making this once the first day of chilly temps hits.</p>\n    <p>Speaking of something I came to love later in life, soba noodles also make the list. I love their slurp-able qualities, especially when floating in a flavorful, savory broth. For cold season coming up, I’m convinced this is a perfect antidote!</p>\n    <p>My grandma used to make a variation of this recipe when we’d visit her on winter days. In fact, just looking at this recipe, I can practically taste the familiar herby goodness greeting my mouth. I like this rendition both for its flexibility (you can adjust based on what you have on hand) and budget-friendly ingredient list. Therefore, it’s a win-win in my book!</p>\n    <p>Soup season would be nothing without a little chili in the mix! Thanks to a little help from my favorite Cello cheese (their cheese is seriously so rich and delicious), we can make the ultimate comfort food to welcome the new season (and maybe watch a football game or two!).</p>\n    <p>I’m always looking for a recipe in which I can incorporate chickpeas, aka my favorite source of plant-based protein. The moment I laid eyes on this dish, which also uses my favorite spices—ginger and turmeric—I knew it would make my list!</p>\n    <p>Seafood lovers, rejoice! This ensemble, complete with homemade stock, is the ideal transitional soup to take you from summer to fall.</p>\n    <p>Last but not least is this colorful and zesty vegetarian recipe! Packed with sweet potatoes, fire-roasted tomatoes, and corn, it’s filling and fiber-rich. Better yet, it can be made in minutes thanks to the holy-grail kitchen appliance, <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/11/ive-owned-the-instant-pot-for-5-years-heres-my-honest-review/\">the Instant Pot</a>!

These reviews are intended to provide detailed information on products that may be of interest to you, so if and when you’re in the market for a given item, you have all the info you need to decide whether to make a purchase.</p>\n<p>The DRx SpectraLite™ FaceWare Pro is an FDA-cleared face mask from Dr. Dennis Gross that uses red and blue LED light therapy. The <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-7715167\">blue light</a> treats acne and evens skin tone and texture, while the <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-7715178\">red light</a> smooths lines, supports natural collagen production to firm skin, treats signs of sun damage, and treats inflammation.</p>\n<p>I have sensitive, dry skin that is starting to show fine lines. I also have dark spots on my nose and cheeks and I often deal with my skin looking a bit dull and red. Occasionally, I have mild hormonal acne. Because I have sensitive skin, I have to be careful with acids and harsh serums. Before I bought this mask, I had recently been diagnosed with early-stage rosacea. I noticed I was getting really red on my nose and cheeks when drinking alcohol, having spicy food, or being in the sun for a prolonged period.<i> </i></p>\n<p>I bought this mask in May 2024. I had previously tried the <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-7553836\">Solawave Wand</a> and found my skin benefited from red light therapy. With the Solawave Wand, I noticed some improvements in my skin pigment and texture. I noticed my dark spots looked minimized and my skin looked more radiant and firm.<br/>I wanted to invest a little more in an LED mask I could simply leave on without needing to manually move it to each part of my face. <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-6562814\">The Dr. Dennis Gross LED mask</a> is designed to treat the issues I noted above, like fine lines, dark spots, redness, and acne.<br/>Before I bought the Dr. Dennis Gross LED mask, I had purchased <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3B2Kajq\">this $150 LED mask</a> and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3XqwdTJ\">this $70 LED mask</a> through Amazon. I returned them both because they didn’t charge or stay on my face well. I was also worried about using a device sold by a third-party vendor, especially when using bright light so close to my eyes. Ultimately, I decided I wanted to try a product from a more reputable, well-researched brand. The Dr. Dennis Gross mask is FDA-cleared, which means it is a professional-grade LED therapy. </p>\n<p>I try to use the mask daily. Realistically, I use it about three days a week, because you know, life. To use, I wash my face and pat it dry, place the device on my face, turn it on, and use it for the programmed duration of three minutes.<br/>There are three modes: red anti-aging mode, blue anti-acne mode, and combined red and blue light mode. I usually do the red light mode. Afterward, I apply my normal skin products. <br/>This mask can be used morning or night. For best results, the brand recommends daily use—consistency is key! For more information, reference <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-7715195\">the full list of instructions</a> from Dr. Dennis Gross.</p>\n<p>With regular use, I’ve noticed the fine lines on my face are minimized and the redness has improved to the point it is not noticeable anymore. I’ve also noticed an improvement with hormonal acne. My cheeks have fewer dark spots but my nose continues to be a problem area that I am going to consult my dermatologist about at my next appointment. Overall, this product has been effective for me so far and I’m eager to continue using it long-term.</p>\n<p>No. I’ve used it regularly for four months and I have no complaints. It keeps a charge for a long time and is durable. I love the comfortable silicone lining too!</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/09/dr-dennis-gross-spectralite-faceware-pro-led-mask-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Maybe they’ve got a gift for being super organized and calm while juggling all the moving parts of getting a meal to the table. And then there are the rest of us, those who want to have people over but get tangled up in all the reasons to postpone.<br/>Hosting doesn’t have to be formal. It doesn’t have to look like my parties or any others you see on Instagram. <strong>The point of entertaining is to gather people to spend time together—regardless of the size of your home or your cooking skill level. </strong>Even without the pressure of comparison, it can be overwhelming to think of everything you have to do before and during such an occasion.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://housecall.substack.com/p/how-to-have-people-over\">I want you to have people over.</a> So I asked my friend (and generous host) <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lisahackwith/\">Lisa</a> to collaborate on a new entertaining series on Wit &amp; Delight called “Come Over For…” In each post, we’ll share all the essential information for hosting a delightful party around a specific theme or idea, including a timeline for the day before and the day of, a detailed grocery list, and recipes for each menu item. The series aims to make it easy to replicate these kinds of occasions for your group of friends or family.<br/>Lisa and I have been cooking and sharing meals for a long time. She entertains beautifully and is a gracious, calm host for big parties and small dinners alike. She’s also an incredible cook and has been developing her own recipes. She created all of the recipes in this post! By collaborating on this series, we’re exploring a richer approach to hosting that combines both of our styles and expertise.</p>\n<p>Beyond cooking and entertaining, Lisa is the founder of <a href=\"https://hackwithdesignhouse.com/\">Hackwith Design House</a> and a multi-hyphenate creative who’s good at everything she does. And, importantly, she’s confident in her abilities to create. I admire this about her so much because half the battle of creating is being willing to try. <br/>Lisa and I wanted to keep every recipe and step in this series light and doable. It’s entertaining without all the extra fuss. It’s a reminder that a simple approach to hosting can still feel special.</p>\n<p>For the first iteration, we curated a casual dinner party that’s easy, beautiful, delicious, and memorable. A tall order to fill but we did it! The menu for this casual dinner party is meant to be easy to bring to the table but still special. It’s vegetarian, filling, and delicious, so everyone will be satisfied. <br/>Here’s the menu, including a cocktail to start the evening:</p>\n<p>Whenever I’m hosting a dinner party, these are the things I like to keep in mind to ensure a low-stress, enjoyable evening.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forms.gle/gGMcSDGs1TcqPYDZ7\">We’ve taken care of this for you</a>! When creating a menu for a dinner party, I like to consider the number of people attending and what steps it takes to get the food to the table. This menu is perfect for up to six people but can easily be scaled up without much effort.<br/>Here’s another tip: If you’re cooking a new dish and want to practice making it, consider doing a trial run first. Make it a week or so before the party for your family or yourself so you can get comfortable with the steps.</p>\n<p>Plan the prep so you’re not feeling rushed the evening of your dinner party. Lisa and I put together <a href=\"https://forms.gle/gGMcSDGs1TcqPYDZ7\">a timeline</a> for what needs to be done beforehand and leading up to the party so you have an idea of how to pace yourself and the evening.<br/>For more tips on planning, creating a guest list, and sending invitations, read this post: “<a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/08/how-to-plan-a-dinner-party/\">How to Plan a Dinner Party: My Best Tips to Simplify the Process</a>.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/08/casual-dinner-party/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>As the seasons shift and we transition into the fall, I take stock of my closet and make a plan for edits, purchases, and repairs. I like to think of it as a “back to basics” approach. This isn’t about trends; it’s about timeless pieces that define your personal style. Much of my core style has been inspired by a classic French look. Whenever I find myself getting caught up in trends, this anchors me back to a place where I can make solid purchasing decisions that will add some oomph to an already solid foundation.  <br/>Sézane recently launched an extensive collection of classic pieces that are perfect for rounding out what might be missing in your wardrobe. Think of it as a “French Core” collection—iconic pieces that will not only be in stock now but will also remain essentials long after the latest monthly edit.</p>\n<p>The Vassili jacket is the epitome of effortless style, blending the structure of a blazer with the casual ease of a jacket. Made from high-quality materials, this piece is perfect for layering over anything—from a simple tee to a blouse. Pair it with jeans for a relaxed look or throw it over a dress for a more polished vibe. The Vassili jacket works seamlessly with both casual and dressier pieces, making it a must-have for any wardrobe.<strong>Fit Notes:</strong> I’m wearing a size small and could have sized up.</p>\n<p>The Peter skirt brings a touch of classic femininity to your wardrobe. Its navy color adds a sense of sophistication, while the A-line shape flatters every body type. Whether you’re dressing for work or a weekend brunch, this skirt will be your go-to. Pair the Peter skirt with a crisp white shirt for a classic look, or style it with a colorful sweater for a pop of personality. It’s an easy piece to dress up with heels or keep casual with flats. This skirt is a workhorse!<strong>Fit Notes:</strong> It runs big! Size down.</p>\n<p>The length of the Martin crop trousers makes them ideal for transitioning between seasons, and the tailored fit ensures they’re as flattering as they are stylish. Pair these trousers with a simple tee and sneakers for a casual look, or dress them up with a blouse and heels. They’re versatile enough to take you from a day at work to an evening out.<strong>Fit Notes:</strong> These run small—size up if you are in between sizes.</p>\n<p>Mary Janes are a timeless shoe style, and the Mélanie Mary Janes take this classic silhouette and elevate it with a modern twist. Their patent black finish adds a touch of sophistication, making them suitable for both casual and formal occasions. Pair the Mélanie Mary Janes with anything from dresses to trousers. Their versatility makes them a key piece in your wardrobe, offering endless styling possibilities. The heel isn’t too high, making it a great shoe for a wedding or any other occasion that requires you to dress up for long periods.<strong>Fit Notes:</strong> These run true to size.</p>\n<p>No wardrobe is complete without a little black dress, and the Nicia dress reimagines this classic piece with subtle yet stylish details. It is VERY Françoise Hardy! Its simple silhouette makes it incredibly versatile, while the high-quality wool fabric ensures it’s a piece you’ll reach for time and time again. Wear the Nicia dress with the Mélanie Mary Janes for a chic, understated look, and add bold accessories for a statement-making outfit. This dress is your canvas—style it any way you like.<strong>Fit Notes:</strong> This dress runs true to size.</p>\n<p>These iconic items are not only versatile and stylish but also embody the essence of classic French style.

Between the gorgeous <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/homemade-cinnamon-spice-potpourri/\">fall scents</a> to the upcoming time with your family it’s maybe the best season of the year.</p>\n<p>And fall fashion? We’re here for it.<br/>One thing we’re NOT so pumped for though, is seasonal skin changes.<br/>It’s that time of year when the air outside gets cooler and drier, and our skincare routines need some modification to keep up with the environment. Because drier air = drier, duller skin. </p>\n<p>So how best to keep your skin bouncy and beautiful year-round?<br/>As always, we’ve looked into it for you. We’ve got all the info you need to keep your skin glowing and healthy all year long.</p>\n<h2>6 Créme de la Créme Fall Skin Care Tips</h2>\n<p>To get the most out of your fall skincare routine, you’ve got to know how the changes in weather actually affect your skin. You don’t want to overdo it, after all—if you’re moving all the way from light skincare to <a href=\"https://health.clevelandclinic.org/slugging\">slugging</a>, but your face is only slightly more dry than in the summer, you might end up with a completely different problem. That’s not the move.</p>\n<p>Everyone’s skin is different, and many of us are dealing with different types of weather changes. So, before we get into what to do about your seasonal skin change, let’s talk about what that change actually looks like for you.</p>\n<h3>How Does Cold Weather Affect Skin?</h3>\n<p>The biggest thing affecting your skin as the seasons change is the humidity. As the weather gets cooler, humidity levels tend to drop as well.</p>\n<p>While this can be amazing for those of us whose hair tends to change styles in the humidity, it can also dry out our skin, leaving our summer skincare struggling to keep up. <a href=\"https://www.aad.org/news/cold-weather-and-your-skin#:~:text=Due%20to%20the%20drop%20in,healthy%20during%20the%20colder%20months.\">Dry, cold air can also make fine lines and wrinkles more noticeable</a>.</p>\n<p>But, it’s not just the air outside that’s stealing all your hydration—it’s the air inside, too. When you turn on the heat or kindle an indoor fire, the indoor moisture is sucked out of the air as well. So even when you get inside, your skin may still be suffering.</p>\n<p>Don’t sweat it. We’ve got the ideas you need to stay hydrated and baby soft this fall and winter.</p>\n<h3>Here’s Exactly How To Take Care Of Your Skin In The Fall</h3>\n<p>The first thing you can do to combat the dry air for your skin is to LITERALLY combat the dry air. Put some humidity back into your life. Your skin will thank you.</p>\n<p>Lauryn’s so obsessed with this humidifier, she actually designed <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/the-dreamy-humidifier-of-your-dreams-has-launched-and-its-by-the-skinny-confidential/\">her own</a>. It was limited edition but you can still get the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4fTCGhL\">bedside humidifier</a> AND a <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3GmEUYl\">TSC aroma diffuser</a> from the Canopy, and they really work.</p>\n<p>As the air gets drier both inside and out, we need to boost our skincare products to add and lock in moisture.</p>\n<p>Let’s start at the beginning: You’ll need a fragrance-free cleanser, like <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3AKPQig\">this one Lauryn loves</a>, that gently removes makeup and environmental residue from your face. </p>\n<p>It’s a good idea to get fragrance-free body wash as well. Even if your skin type isn’t sensitive, you’ll have more sensitive skin in the fall/winter. Fragrances and <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/the-best-beauty-products-for-senstive-skin/\">sensitive skin</a> do NOT get along.</p>\n<p>After cleansing, follow your normal skin care routine, but consider swapping out your products for more hydrating versions. You’ll want to look for products with humectants like hyaluronic acid and glycerin. This <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3Of3XPV\">Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream</a> has both.</p>\n<p>Reducing the frequency of treatments that dry your skin can help prevent weather-related irritation, as well as swapping light lotions for heavier creams.</p>\n<p>As ALWAYS, you’ll need to protect your skin from sun damage by using a product with at least SPF 30.<br/>HOT TIP: The best sunscreen on the block is the <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/sunscreen?selling_plan=1819443293\">Caffeinated Sunscreen</a> from TSC. It’s SPF 40, caffeinated, and super nourishing.</p>\n<p>For a super moisturizing skin care routine, check out Lauryn’s <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/my-exact-korean-skincare-routine-and-why-i-love-it/\">Korean skincare routine</a> or her <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/my-updated-skincare-routine/\">go-to routine</a> that she always updates.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/fall-skin-care-tips/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>There are people in my life who are the most wonderful gift givers—always thoughtful, always unique, always spot-on. I’ve learned some lessons from these friends and family members on how to be a really excellent gift giver, and I’m sharing them with you today. These gift-giving ideas apply to any occasion—from holidays to birthdays and every little celebration in between. Here’s to sharing meaningful gifts with the people we love.</p>\n    <p>People tell you what they love, and thoughtful gift-giving starts with <i>listening</i> in those moments. With everyone in my life, I’ve been listening to what they say and tuning into what excites them. I keep an ear out for gift ideas all year round so I’m not rushing when the holidays (or birthdays) arrive.<br/>Have they started a new hobby? Ask how it’s going and glean inspiration from there. Are they making a big transition into retirement or moving across the country? Listen for ways to help out, celebrate, or honor the milestone. The best gifts are the ones that show someone you notice the little things they’re loving or pursuing. </p>\n    <p>Don’t count on yourself to remember the ideas you pick up through all of your listening. Figure out a way to collect the information and organize it. I mainly use the iPhone Notes app. Joe and I have a shared note with a list of the birthdays of people in our lives. Underneath each name, I’ll write down thought starters for gifts and things I know they enjoy. I also save some ideas verbally in the Voice Memos app, which is an easy way to get ideas out of my head in the moment so I can revisit them later.</p>\n    <p>If you’re stuck, don’t be afraid to ask the person for a short list of exactly what they want. Some people shy away from being this direct or think it takes the magic out of gifting. I think it’s a perfectly reasonable way to ensure you’re giving a gift that will be used and enjoyed. When I ask for a list, I find the gifting experience just as enjoyable as when I think of gift ideas on my own. This leads me to my next point…</p>\n    <p>Don’t worry about coming up with the “perfect” gift idea. You don’t have to surprise them with something unexpected either! Choosing a gift from their wish list is a wonderful way to delight them <i>and</i> get them something they really want. I got Joe a specific pair of shoes he asked for on his birthday, and his reaction was as if it was a total surprise. He was so excited!! It reminded me that true surprises are overrated sometimes. </p>\n    <p>Watch out for the temptation to overcompensate, especially when you’re not sure what your giftee wants. When it comes to gift-giving, we often end up spending too much, which makes everyone uncomfortable. I think of the episode of <i>The Office</i> where Michael gave a video iPod in the group exchange when the spending limit was $20. <br/>Often, sentimental gifts mean as much (if not more) than costly items. For Joe’s birthday this year, I recorded a video about why I love him and the kids did too. It was a unique way to capture this moment in time and it didn’t cost a thing. If overcompensating is a pattern of yours, hopefully the ideas in this post will help you avoid it! <br/>For more gift-giving inspiration, I’ll be sharing my holiday gift guide on Wit &amp; Delight this month!

    "body": "<p>Swapping favorite reads is my favorite form of social currency. I devoured some really special books this year and felt it was the right time to compile a list of the ones that stayed on my mind long after I read the last page. My criteria for what makes a read share-worthy extends beyond just liking the book. Many of these authors made me feel uncomfortable and squeamish, and that’s how I like it—but that’s not to say I don’t enjoy an escapist book.<br/>Today I’m sharing a short and incomplete list of the books I couldn’t stop talking about this year.</p>\n<p>Ever heard of a “Messy Perfectionist” before? Katherine Morgan Schafler’s <i>The Perfectionist’s Guide to Losing Control</i> resonated with me deeply because it delves into the origins and complexities of perfectionism, offering a 360-degree perspective on the many ways it manifests itself. I found Schafler’s insights and personal anecdotes refreshing. She suggests we discard the label “recovering perfectionist” (one I have subscribed to) and instead look at perfectionism as a superpower to be harnessed for good rather than hold us back. <br/>I read this book twice this year and plan to pick it up again over the holiday break.</p>\n<p>In <i>Bittersweet</i>,<i> </i>Susan Cain explores the concept of bittersweetness and how embracing both positive and negative emotions can lead to a richer and more fulfilling life. Through beautiful personal stories and research, Cain argues bittersweetness is an essential part of the human experience and that it can help us appreciate the beauty and fragility of life.<br/>This book touched parts of myself I had long shuttered away as weird, sensitive, and something I should never express in public. Yet they’re so core to who I am. Susan Cain continues to be a champion for sensitive, quiet, deep thinkers.</p>\n<p><i>Slowing</i> is a guide to living a slower, more intentional life. It offers practical strategies for reducing stress, increasing mindfulness, and finding more joy in the present moment. This book is organized around the process of learning to slow down, which I found incredibly helpful. We can’t run before we can walk, and <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/10/how-to-slow-down/\">slowing down in adulthood</a> is most definitely a learned skill.</p>\n<p>A time-travel love story meets workplace comedy with the twists and turns of a spy thriller. This book defies genres and delighted me with its whip-smart prose and deeply human characters.</p>\n<p>Everyone has an opinion about this book. I love it like I do a flawed but well-intentioned friend. I admire the creative choices July makes in all her work. Her willingness to leave things unapologetically messy and self-serving made her the perfect artist to crash into the public domain, shouting about the indignities of being a woman of a certain age. Post-childbearing deserves to take center stage and be seen. There’s something about that feeling of wildness that precisely captures the awakening I’ve just started to experience, and I know I’m not alone. <br/>It is interesting to hear what people under <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/10/turning-40-lessons-learned/\">the age of forty</a> think about the book. They’re often wide-eyed, terrified, and turned off by its barbaric and messy nature. To them, I say, you’ll get it when you’re ready.</p>\n<p>This book is essential for anyone brave enough to take their creative expressions seriously. Turn to any page and find a reason to keep pursuing that nagging urge to make something meaningful from the mystery of intuition.</p>\n<p>Like so many of you, the poem that made Maggie Smith famous came at the exact time I needed it most. This is the story of what happened to her marriage and career afterward.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

    "body": "<p>As I’ve been on my quest to do less and have less, I’ve been confronted with a crossroads: what I need and what I don’t. Sorting needs versus wants can be a tricky business, akin to sorting out the opinions others have of you versus the ones you have of yourself—murky territory for lifelong people pleasers. Where do I begin and who should I be in the end?<br/>Here lies the link between our perceived worthiness and how we spend. And it is one of the reasons my relationship with money has never been great. <br/>This concept became starkly clear as I cataloged my closet using the digital app <a href=\"https://whering.co.uk/\">Whering</a>. I’ll write about this in another post because it’s incredibly helpful. The process itself made me <i>nauseated—</i>also up for discussion in a forthcoming post. My <i>stuff</i> is an accumulation of my personas—all pieces of a whole, but not the whole me. I am done carrying the weight of all that. <br/>I’ve taken a curious view of my spending habits—<i>sans shame</i>—and I can see both sides of the coin. I see products that I do not want to live without. And when I look at what I use <i>every single day</i>, it becomes clearer what needs to go. Focusing on what you really like makes it a lot easier to let go of what you don’t. <br/>If you had to pick up and move right now or downsize significantly, what would you take with you? What do you miss when you’re away from home? They are good questions to help narrow in on where your needs and wants align in a Venn diagram and pinpoint the products worth the spend. Here are mine at this moment in time.</p>\n<p><i>$850</i><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3qw4C42\">This espresso machine</a> is the first thing I touch in the morning. I use it multiple times a day and it has held up nicely over the past four years. Embarrassingly, I could not live without it. Read more about this espresso machine in my <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/03/delonghi-la-specialista-espresso-machine-review/\">product review blog post</a>. <i>This product was gifted to me as part of a partnership.</i></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ginnysimsceramics.com/shop\">These mugs</a> are made by hand in Ginny’s Minneapolis studio. Something about grabbing your favorite mug makes the ritual of coffee in the morning significantly better. Full stop. </p>\n<p><del>$699</del> $599<a href=\"https://hearthdisplay.com/products/hearth-display?sca_ref=5623484.023SkepF7Z&amp;utm_source=uppromote&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=4040\">The Hearth Display</a> is how I keep track of my kids’ stuff, how my kids keep track of their stuff, and how Joe keeps track of our stuff. What I love about this display is it’s physically hanging in my office. My family can track our calendar, routine, and to-do lists without needing to bug me for instructions or a list. Hearth also has a handy AI “helper” that allows you to text items that need to be added to your calendar. I send my kids’ sports schedules, lunches, field trips, and events in a text message and VOILA, they’re on the calendar. It’s the single best device I’ve added to our family’s life. <i>This product was gifted to me as part of a partnership.</i></p>\n<p><i>$278</i><br/>You can throw <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-7907352\">these silk PJs</a> in the wash and they feel great on your skin. Also, I look really good in them. The cut is 10/10. </p>\n<p><i>$182</i><br/>I’ve tried many vitamin C products over the years and <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-8458929\">this one</a> is the GOAT. Worth every penny you’d save not buying other products that do what this one does. </p>\n<p><i>$56</i><br/>My skin always looks really good when I wear <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-6873408\">this sunscreen</a>. It can even replace a moisturizer, thus extending the life of my fancy nighttime moisturizer. <i>This product was gifted to me by the brand.</i></p>\n<p><i>$20 for a pack of 10</i><br/>I’ve purchased <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3BPw19N\">these sheet masks</a> seven times in the past three years. They add an instant zap of moisture to my skin. The price is reasonable enough that I don’t feel too guilty using them regularly. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/10/best-products-in-my-daily-routine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

And there’s a lot to navigate when it comes to neutral <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/03/choosing-a-paint-color/\">paint color selection</a>.<br/>I wanted to share a few of the best neutral paint colors I’ve used in our homes, why I’ve been drawn to them, and what I think they bring to a room. In the list below, I’m including four very different colors: white, cream, light pink (which visually reads as neutral), and black.<br/>If you’re deciding on a neutral paint color for your home, I hope this post serves as a helpful resource for you. This is also a great post to bookmark for your future design projects!</p>\n    <p><i>Where I’ve used this color: </i>The <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/01/basement-family-room-paint-reveal/\">basement family room</a> in our current home and the main floor in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2020/04/were-moving-a-goodbye-to-the-house-that-built-our-family-of-5/\">our previous home</a>.<br/>This is a crisp white that doesn’t feel sterile. It’s a warm color but because it doesn’t have too many yellow tones, it doesn’t read as cream. As design trends are moving toward warmer colors, this is a great classic white paint color to use.</p>\n    <p><i>Where I’ve used this color: </i>The <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/01/basement-family-room-paint-reveal/\">basement family room</a> in our current home.<br/>If you’re seeking a light neutral color that has a bit more visual weight to it, Sail Cloth might be the color for you. It’s a warm color that’s a step more creamy than White Dove. If you want to highlight the contrast between two neutrals, you could pair Sail Cloth and White Dove together like I did in our basement family room.</p>\n    <p><i>Where I’ve used this color: </i>The trim in both the <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/08/entryway-design-elements/\">entryway</a> and <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/03/guest-room-design-wallpaper-paint/\">guest room</a> in our current home.<br/>Setting Plaster is a great color to use if you want something a step beyond white or cream that isn’t <i>too </i>saturated. While it is light pink, it still reads as a neutral color and is a versatile option for so many kinds of rooms.</p>\n    <p><i>Where I’ve used this color:</i> The cabinetry in our <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2016/03/wd-renovation-domino-magazine/\">previous home’s kitchen</a>.<br/>This is a beautiful black-gray color that brings depth without overwhelming an entire room. Sometimes, a really dark black color can feel so overpowering it dominates every other design feature in a space. Wrought Iron has a softness to it that I really love.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

Months before <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/10/turning-40-lessons-learned/\">my 40th birthday</a> last year, I kept doing the calculation: <br/>If the next twenty years go as fast as the last, then I’m already sixty—which means I’m basically already eighty.<br/>Time x Speed = Life<br/>I felt like a life-sized cardboard cutout of the new millennial midlife crisis. <br/>To my horror, I continued to write through my disorientation. I felt like a woman walking the plank. Everyone told me life was just beginning, but I couldn’t shake the feeling it was slipping through my fingers each day—and I was powerless to stop it. </p>\n<p>We were told we could be anyone and anything we wanted. <br/>But the options are endless, and time is limited.<br/>It’ll never add up to enough.</p>\n<p>Facing what my math revealed about myself, and the truth of time and speed, I saw my crisis was telling me how I wanted to spend the rest of my life. So I put on my big girl pants, turned toward the secrets I had tucked neatly under my pillow at night, and let them into the light.</p>\n<p>You have everything you need within you.<br/>You are whole. You are enough.<br/>I was not in despair over a decline into obscurity. I craved an experience I had denied myself. Life wasn’t about surviving and becoming. It was about being whole and feeling human and <a href=\"https://housecall.substack.com/p/make-space-for-delight\">making room for joy</a>, desire, delight, pleasure, connection, love, and wonderment. <br/>Life was just beginning—and I was learning to slow down and enjoy it. </p>\n<p>Amid this call for slowness, my life is speeding up. There will never be a busier season of life than this one. My kids are blossoming into themselves, and with this comes friends, hobbies, sports, and memories to be made as a family. Joe is stepping into a season of his career where he wants to test his limits, grow into himself, and see what’s possible when he taps into his talent. <br/>And me. I find myself today overflowing with energy to put into the world. <br/>What does one do when the fullness of life threatens to sweep away the ability to savor life itself? <br/>I’ve been making strides to <a href=\"https://housecall.substack.com/p/kates-five-things-37\">slow down</a> daily, even when everything is swirling around me. I’ve started small, with the tiniest adjustments. <strong>Today, I’m writing about why slowing down matters so much to me and how I’m practicing slowness in this busy season of life.</strong></p>\n<p>I’m tired. That was one of the big secrets I had tucked under my pillow. Life is busy and I don’t have the energy to puff myself up and cheerlead anymore. What I can do, however, is slow down enough to notice when I need rest. <br/>The dichotomy of being bone tired and having a renewed sense of purpose in life is fascinating. It’s like learning to tame a new kind of beast, one that responds to tenderness rather than domineering, alpha-like control. Life is busy, getting things done matters, and enjoyment matters, too. So what does the balance look like? How is slowing down even possible in a busy season of life?<br/>I don’t have a perfect system. But I am not willing to go back to “keeping up” or feeling <a href=\"https://housecall.substack.com/p/how-to-stop-focusing-on-what-you\">a pervasive sense of lack</a>. Instead, I have a values-based approach, a willingness to keep practicing these habits, and a lot of forgiveness for myself. Because I’m tired. And I’m alive. </p>\n<p>When I’m rushing through life, I’ve noticed my pace is reflected through physical cues in my body. A few examples include:</p>\n<p>In practicing slowness, the most important thing for me is to notice and gently redirect these physical responses. I unclench my jaw, take a few slow, deep breaths, loosen my grip on the wheel, and sit up straight with relaxed shoulders. Keep in mind that your physical responses to busyness may look different than mine. Tune into what they are for you and slowly begin to redirect them.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/10/how-to-slow-down/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

All mediums and workspaces are welcome, including your home studio.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://laurievictorkay.com/\">Laurie Victor Kay</a>, Omaha, Nebraska</h2>\n<p><i>How long have you been working in this space?</i></p>\n<p>I’ve been in my studio, LVK Atelier, for about one year. I moved into the space shortly after my mom died from a very short battle with cancer. Moving here meant seismic change for me — leaving my family home, marriage, and longtime former studio. My mom worked with arts and accessibility. Her spirit is everywhere, and it is truly an amazing space. Every visitor feels the strong, positive, creative energy. When I moved in, I began imagining how I wanted my studio to feel, planning for months before starting construction. I was<i> </i>literally rebuilding myself while building my studio space. The first of many projects as a newly independent mid-career artist who had lost her mom and left her marriage to find herself.</p>\n<p><i>Describe an average day in your studio.</i></p>\n<p>My daily routine changes often. Constants: coffee. A long run, early-morning yoga, meditation — even a few times a week. Emails and Instagram. I read and journal. Each day is different because my practice is so varied. When I am making new work, I try to really let myself feel free. Music is so important to me. I like it loud — too loud for my neighbors. So many genres … I travel to time periods, places in the world, places in my mind with music. My <i>Composition</i> series is about music.</p>\n<p><i>How does the space affect your work?</i></p>\n<p>It is magical! The space is like a blank palette with which I can make anything. It is energetic in that my work is received and felt. I meditate often, balancing that with loud music. I feel so free here. During the first months in this space, I bought Yves Klein matte blue paint, and drew Buddhist quotes on the kitchen walls. I made a pact to be intentional about everything entering my space. I was leaving negative energy and needed a space to heal and grow. I wanted to use every corner in the space conceptually. I wanted a true artist’s home — welcoming, colorful, like a cabinet of curiosities; weird, filled with me.</p>\n<p><i>How do you interact with the environment outside your studio?</i></p>\n<p>I’m extremely involved with the art community in Omaha. This community is the reason I’ve stayed in this city. Omahans are down-to-earth and embrace bold ideas. The top three projects in my career were on the campus of the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Although I’ve moved further from the arts area, I’ve found the most important part of making art is feeling supported. My community is all over Omaha but also the world. I believe community is everywhere. Sometimes one close friend is one’s entire community. I want to continue to know my neighbors and support the arts organizations that support me.</p>\n<p><i>What do you love about your studio?</i></p>\n<p>One, I love feeling my mom’s presence. She was a mother to many beyond my family. She died too soon but left a legacy felt here. She worked with people who didn’t have access to art. Two, I love my trees. My home/studio has two massive oaks right through it. Three, I love that the studio is mine. I feel so free and independent now and don’t have to answer to anyone but myself. It was a long road to get here.</p>\n<p><i>What do you wish were different?</i></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037524/a-view-from-the-easel-300/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Suddenly, the fluorescent lights, lively chatter, and overpriced opening wine flowing onto the New York City streets beckon the passerby who has spent all summer tanning in Central Park. It’s fall art fair season, at last.</p>\n<p>As usual, the season’s kicking off with the gargantuan Armory Show next week, followed by a lineup of shows that range from the alternative (zines!) to the conservative and historical (Independent 2oth Century). This year brings a few changes, though: the unexpected <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032202/as-adaas-art-show-changes-course-a-nonprofit-is-left-in-limbo/\">cancellation</a> of the Art Dealers Association of America’s annual Art Show, for instance, typically an anchor of the autumn fairs. Volta is also skipping its NYC edition, while Clio is having <i>two</i> fairs in the same month. </p>\n<p>The art market might be topsy-turvy, but your fairgoing experience doesn’t have to be. Our handy guide below is here to help navigate your way through it all.</p>\n<h3>The Armory Show</h3>\n<p>September 5–7 | <a href=\"https://www.thearmoryshow.com/\">thearmoryshow.com</a><br/>Javits Center, 429 Eleventh Avenue, Midtown West, Manhattan</p>\n<p>The Goliath of the city’s art fairs, the Armory Show will once again descend upon the shopping mall-esque Javits Center to kick off New York’s fall season. More than 230 galleries will convene for the colossal event, with spotlight booths focused on the late artist Ming Fay and installation artist Sylvie Hayes-Wallace, among others. For the first time, the fair’s Platform section will be curated by a nonprofit, Souls Grown Deep, which will celebrate Black artistry from the American South with an exhibition of paintings, assemblages, sculptures, and textile works. Another fresh feature this year is the inaugural design-focused Function section, showcasing sculptural assemblages and installation works by Nikita Gale, Cauleen Smith, Ryan Johnson, and Gee’s Bend Quiltmakers.</p>\n<p>The Armory’s programming will also extend beyond the boundaries of Hudson Yards in a focused series of multi-borough partnership presentations. At the Queens Museum, a collaboration with Gagosian will produce a monumental banner reproduction of Honor Titus’s tennis painting “Louis Malle Practice” (2025) on the institution’s facade. Times Square Arts and the Whitney Museum of American Art will host nightly viewings of media artist Marina Zurkow’s multi-channel animation “The River is a Circle (Times Square Edition)” across 95 synchronized electronic billboard displays throughout the city.</p>\n<h3>Independent 20th Century</h3>\n<p>September 4–7 | <a href=\"https://www.independenthq.com/fair2\">independenthq.com</a> <br/>Casa Cipriani, 10 South Street, The Battery, Manhattan</p>\n<p>The modern art sibling fair of the contemporary-focused Independent fair returns to Manhattan’s Battery neighborhood with 31 galleries and arts nonprofits for its fourth edition. Solo, duo, and group presentations notably spotlight works by self-taught artists, Lebanese women artists, and influential figures from Latin America. Attendees can also check out a host of programs, including a live discussion between installation artist Judy Pfaff and author Joe Fig and a roundtable between directors of the Storm King Art Center, Princeton University Art Museum, the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, and Aspen Art Museum.</p>\n<h3>Art on Paper</h3>\n<p>September 4–7 | <a href=\"http://ny.thepaperfair.com\">ny.thepaperfair.com</a><br/>Pier 36, 299 South St, New York, New York</p>\n<p>Don’t underestimate the versatility of this pulpy, everyday material. Returning to its usual venue at Pier 36 on the East River, this year’s Art on Paper fair will showcase boundary-pushing artworks from over 100 galleries, such as Pace-represented artist Nina Katchadourian’s playful ecological sculptures made from found paper items. The show’s meta mini bookfair, BOOKsmART, will also return with exhibitors from more than 20 presses, including Oreades Press, Axis Press, and Central Booking. Installations like feminist participatory artist Mary Beth Edelson’s <a href=\"https://thealdrich.org/exhibitions/mary-beth-edelson-six-story-gathering-boxes-1972-2014\"> Story Gathering Boxes</a> series (1972–2014) and Ruben Castillo’s woodcuts and lithocuts exploring queer intimacy attest to the medium’s endless possibilities.</p>\n<h3>Salon Zürcher: 100 Women of Spirit +, Part 3</h3>\n<p>September 2–7 | <a href=\"https://www.galeriezurcher.com/salon-zurcher-33rd-edition-100-women-of-spirit-part-3-september-2-7-2025\">galeriezurcher.com</a><br/>Zürcher Gallery, 33 Bleecker Street, Soho, Manhattan</p>\n<p>Returning for its 33rd edition as an intimate and quieter satellite fair of the Armory Show, <i>100 Women of Spirit + </i>brings together 11 women artists at its Bleeker Street home. Deriving its name from the French phrase <i>femme d’esprit,</i> referring to intellectual and witty women, this year’s fair features psychedelic paintings by Amy Cheng, welded steel constellations by Dutch-born artist Marieken Couchius, and oil self-portraits by trauma-informed psychotherapist Trissy Callan.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037354/nyc-fall-2025-art-fair-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>LONDON — Of all the <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/y/young-british-artists-ybas\">YBAs</a> (Young British Artists) of the 1990s — including upstarts like Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin, mouthing off petulantly to the art establishment with dead livestock and unmade beds — it is Jenny Saville who has been most entrenched in the history of art. It is also Saville who can most convincingly claim to be Britain’s greatest living painter since the death of Lucien Freud (sorry, David Hockney). The artist’s superb draughtsmanship skills, informed by absorption and understanding of the Old Masters, are combined with a painterly technique that manipulates its plasticity for all its worth. (Ironically, Tracey Emin is a professor of drawing at the Royal Academy despite having no capacity for drawing.) Saville’s style is as complete and significant as that of Freud.</p>\n<p>It is hard to overestimate the impact of Saville’s early works on British contemporary painting. Her paintings often disappear into the most discerning private ownership. Those in public collections are the rare anomaly in her current survey, <i> The Anatomy of Painting</i>, at the National Portrait Gallery. As a result, some of that impact is recreated for those viewing her art for the first time. Enormous in scale, her uncomfortably close cropped depictions of women’s faces and nude bodies abound in the joy of painterly modeling, from bare — nude — patches of canvas to her swift, thick, viscous slathers, to dappled dry brush blends. The large scale alone may shock people accustomed to viewing only reproductions on screen. The distribution of muted and contrasting tones is sophisticated. In short, there is a wealth of virtuosic brushwork to drink in. </p>\n<p>Considering the painterly bombast, it is perhaps a pedantic complaint that the National Portrait Gallery has mounted an exhibition that has not a single “portrait” in it. We are given only a few of the sitters’ identities, and neither the museum nor Saville expound any particular reason for portraying them, nor any painter-sitter relationships to speak of. Hers is an academic interest with only perfunctory gestures toward body image issues, and pieces explicitly covering <a href=\"https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-5916645\">gender identity</a> are absent. In “Plan” (1993), one of the exhibition’s key works, Saville contours the nude flesh like ordinance survey map terrain, while “Ruben’s Flap” (1998–99) references the fleshy folds favored by the Dutch master, updated to the “real” folds of contemporary unidealized body types. In her most color-saturated rendering of flesh, “Figure 11.23” (1997), she deploys flat red more in the Renaissance discipline of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cangiante\">cangiante</a> – using depth of color rather than muted tones for shade – rather than realistically depicting blood. </p>\n<p>Similarly, a fantastic sequence of mother and child images that reference both Pietas and Maestas from Michelangelo, with bulbous children bending toward us, entasis-style, echo distinctly his Madonna of Bruges or the soft sfumato of Raphael, reimagined in colored pencil. Saville fails, though, to wear her influences on her sleeve when channeling her love for de Kooning into her compositions from the mid to late 2010s. Her attempts to break down nudes into intertwining layers of limbs and squiggles, shattering them with de Kooning-like surface articulation, feel forced, and obscure her gift for three-dimensional modeling. “Out of one, two (symposium)” (2016) nods to Cy Twombly simply by overlaying the nude figures with scribbles. Her academic attempts at abstraction — the opposite of Renaissance Old Master figure modeling — seem to be at the expense of her work’s soul.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036158/jenny-saville-uk-greatest-living-painter-national-portrait-gallery-london/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In photographer Alicia Vera’s portrait of her mother, Concepcion, she gazes skyward, her expression somewhere between curious and awestruck. The image has enough stylistic mottling and grain to obscure any sort of background, but Concepcion is clear: broad cheekbones, bejeweled ears, eyes full of wonder—maybe. Vera is a deeply humanistic image-maker, and it’s impossible to differentiate between a posed subject and a candid one. She approaches both with generosity.</p>\n<p>Isolated, the phrase “va a llover toda la noche,” which translates in English to “it’s going to rain all night,” feels like a snippet of poetry or song. A few years ago, it was a note left on Vera’s door by her mother. Now, it’s the title of Vera’s new project, and a self-published book of the same name, documenting Concepcion’s Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis and Vera’s experience processing it. “Every time I go home to Miami, I stay in my childhood home,” Vera shares. “My mom loves to leave notes on the door. I kept this one; a year or so later, when I was taking out all this material I had, I thought, ‘this is exactly what this feels like.’” The portrait of her mother is one of many in <i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i> (2025); alongside Vera’s portraits, the book includes archival images of Concepcion over the last several decades, text messages, emails, and other personal ephemera.</p>\n<p><i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i>(2025), with the caption: “Mom and her orchids in Miami”</p>\n<p>Vera, who is based in Mexico City, is an award-winning editorial and commercial photographer, and her personal projects feature some of her most captivating images. In “Basketball in the Sierra Norte of Oaxaca” (2018), she captured the Copa Mixe, a basketball tournament for Indigenous Mixe youth in Sierra Norte; for “Stripped” (2009–11), she spent years documenting strippers in Miami and the Bay Area. Her photos are devoid of the voyeuristic quality often visible in like-minded series by other artists; instead, she seems warmly welcomed, like a relative. She’s been photographing her own family, too, “since forever,” she says. “I think I knew deep down, one day, everything’s going to be so different. Every time I would go home, I would take a ton of pictures.”</p>\n<p>Concepcion was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease in 2018, which prompted Vera to begin photographing her more. In a Spanglish epilogue to the book, Vera writes, in English: “After my mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, I felt devastated, overwhelmed, anxious and helpless.” In Spanish, she adds: “<i>Mi mamá se me iba a ir. En mi desesperación de entender lo que le estaba pasando y porque nunca realmente sentí que la conocí, empecé este proyecto llamado</i>, <i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i>” (My mom was going to leave me. In my desperation to understand what was happening to her, and because I never really felt like I knew her, I started this project called <i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i>.) Vera’s understanding of her mother’s own personhood was limited by the challenges of their relationship—a too-common dynamic among mothers and daughters, and one that Vera has long hoped to correct. “She grew up in Mexico and I grew up in the US, so there were a lot of cultural differences,” she says. “In my 20s, I moved away and realized, ‘I really miss my mom.’ We started having these phone calls, and it hit me that my mom was an entire human … I remember trying to make an effort to get to know her, asking her really specific questions. When my mom got diagnosed, I was like, ‘Wait, but I’m just starting to get to know you.’”</p>\n<p><i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i>(2025), with the caption: “My mother as a child runs through a field with her brother in Mexico. / A prayer card found in my mother’s room.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037506/alicia-vera-photographs-depict-alzheimers-with-dignity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The museum, which operates out of a 19th-century mansion in the city’s Chestnut Hill neighborhood, alleges that Trump officials usurped Congress’s authority to distribute federal funds by prematurely terminating its grant.</p>\n    <p>The IMLS grant that the Woodmere received is administered in <a href=\"https://nps.gov/subjects/historicpreservationfund/save-americas-treasures-grants.htm\">partnership</a> with the National Park Service and awarded to “historic properties and collections.” After receiving the grant, according to the lawsuit, the museum initiated an “ambitious conservation project” to prepare an exhibition of Philadelphia artists in 2026, timed with America’s 250th celebrations. The museum received just $195,000 of its total grant before its termination. </p>\n    <p>The Woodmere hopes the IMLS will restore its funding so that it can continue its original planned <a href=\"https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/st-256887-oms-24\">project</a> to install new storage facilities, address collection crowding, and improve cataloguing efforts. </p>\n    <p>“This has delayed critical preservation, digitization, and conservation of our collection — work we hope to resume if the grant is reinstated,” Woodmere Art Museum Director and CEO William Valerio told <i>Hyperallergic. </i></p>\n    <p>With the grant expiration approaching in September, the museum stated in court papers that it has exhausted non-litigious methods of restoring the grant, including a formal appeal. Trump signed an executive order in March demanding that the IMLS and several other federal agencies <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/996700/trump-moves-to-dismantle-institute-of-museum-and-library-services/\">cease operations</a> of non-statutory functions, effectively dismantling the organization. The lawsuit asks the court to reinstate its grant and declare Trump’s gutting of the IMLS “unlawful” or “unconstitutional.”</p>\n    <p>The president proposed eliminating the organization’s funding in his Fiscal Year 2026 budget proposal, which also excluded the National Endowment for the Arts from federal dollars. A federal judge <a href=\"https://www.ala.org/news/2025/06/court-allows-trump-administration-proceed-efforts-destroy-institute-museum-and-library\">declined</a> to block Trump’s dismantling of the agency in June after other judges blocked <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1014493/museum-grants-reinstated-after-federal-court-ruling/\">some of his actions</a>.</p>\n    <p>The IMLS has not yet responded to <i>Hyperallergic’s </i>request for comment. </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037363/pennsylvania-museum-sues-trump-administration-over-grant-cuts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>CHICAGO — Though Wafaa Bilal was born in Iraq and is based in New York, his survey at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, <i> Indulge Me</i>, can be called a homecoming of sorts. In 2007, the accomplished yet underrated artist captured the art world’s attention with his durational performance “Domestic Tension,” wherein he lived for 30 days inside the exhibition space of Chicago’s FlatFile Gallery; a web camera broadcast his movements while a paintball gun was available for anyone to remotely fire at him via a website. Reconstructed as an open-face cubicle inside the museum’s pristine gallery space, the splatters of thousands of yellow paintballs on its interior walls do not convey the torturous persistence of the gun as forcefully as the brief video diary screened on a small monitor nearby. In an increasingly distressed voice, the goggled Bilal unironically thanks his audience for their participation as the gun processes a ceaseless string of firing commands. </p>\n    <p>For a significant survey, the exhibition is remarkably spare. Curator Bana Kattan selected five major projects, each one integrating technology, performance, and a conceptual approach to the conditions of being Arab in the United States in the post-9/11 era. In “3rdi,” Bilal surgically implanted a web camera to the back of his head and attached it to an internet-connected laptop slung at his waist. Each minute, the camera would take an image and send it via the laptop to a live website feed. We are privy to an oversized presentation of a year’s worth of these images, projected on a 14-foot scrim diagonally bisecting the gallery and synced to the date and time they were originally taken.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Bilal-1200x947.jpg?resize=1200%2C947&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>While Bilal once again submits himself to anonymous public scrutiny, making literal the Arab-American condition, the seemingly arbitrary images show the view from behind, telling us not where he is going but where he has been. The project title can be parsed as “third eye,” referring both literally to the camera and conceptually to the watchful eye of the state, but can also be read in Western-transliterated Arabizi as “my land,” pointing to the places from which Bilal has fled as a political refugee who could not look back.</p>\n    <p>The latest project on view, “In a Grain of Wheat,” exhibits Bilal’s persistent concern with the technological mediation of contemporary culture. Responding to the destruction of Iraqi cultural heritage by ISIS, the artist collaborated with a scientist and coder team to scan the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s lamassu and write its form into the DNA of a grain of wheat. The specific mechanics of this process are not comprehensible via the minimal didactics presented, so viewers must accept that the sculpture lives in the wheat as an act of faith in the art and science of the project. Aptly, the work demands a devotional gesture. To partake of the wheat, one must bend down before the replica winged bull to reach for the pile of seeds at its hooves. More than two decades after the American invasion of Iraq, to see mostly young non-Arab Americans readily perform this gesture of supplication to an iconic symbol of Iraqi cultural heritage makes me think that perhaps this country has forgotten its devastating entanglement with Iraq after all. Bilal, of course, cannot.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Bilal2-1200x788.jpg?resize=1200%2C788&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/001-1200x801.jpg?resize=1200%2C801&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Wafaa Bilal: Indulge Me</i>at the MCA Chicago (photo Bob [Robert Chase Heishman])</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/PXL_20250408_155635076.MP_-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/019-1200x801.jpg?resize=1200%2C801&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/025-1200x801.jpg?resize=1200%2C801&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Wafaa Bilal: Indulge Me</i>at the MCA Chicago.

    "body": "<p>Sobriety is a deeply personal and often sensitive subject. The decision to embrace sobriety can stem from many reasons—rooted in health, emotional healing, and often a mix of the two. The reasons are unique to each individual and shaped by their lived experiences. When someone chooses sobriety, it can bring up emotions in others who may be struggling with their relationship with alcohol. <br/>Every story in sobriety is valid. I share my thoughts from my own journey, fully aware that my path may look nothing like yours. My experience does not define sobriety as a whole, nor does it diminish or invalidate yours. <br/>Data shows alcohol consumption in America is <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/509690/young-adults-drinking-less-prior-decades.aspx\">changing</a>. At the beginning of the year, <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/01/03/us-surgeon-general-issues-new-advisory-link-alcohol-cancer-risk.html\">a new health advisory</a> was issued linking alcohol consumption to increased cancer risk. Culturally, our relationship with sobriety is broadening. This is what my sobriety looks like today. </p>\n<p>I am eighteen and at my first house party. It is my senior year in high school. My friends and I hit it off with a group of guys entering their junior year. I stand at the far end of a swampy beer pong table, gingerly holding my red cup. Afraid and liberated, I gulp a lukewarm keg of beer, the first taste of the kind of freedom college would provide. No one was there to monitor or judge except myself. <br/>I had grown up afraid of drinking alcohol, my parents and long-term boyfriend demonizing it. I rarely saw my parents drink aside from my dad’s nightly beer, a stark departure from a drinking culture I observed in my Irish dance community. There, drinking was synonymous with everything. During trips to Ireland as a preteen in the 90s, I eyed kids my age with a Guinness, sitting at the bar with their parents. <br/>There are also memories of my grandparents: sipping Miller Light or a buttery chardonnay, eating tortilla chips, and playing cards. Their laughter is synonymous with my happy childhood, a kind of togetherness that is rare and good and worth stopping to marvel at. Today that smell of hops and salty chips brings it all back home.<br/>By the end of my 18th summer, beer signified a different kind of togetherness. A beer in my hand was connection, security, and confidence. It was a key inside places I had yet to access and a gateway to relaxed ease that had alluded me for a lifetime. <br/>Enter adulthood, and I couldn’t imagine a future without it. </p>\n<p>My relationship with alcohol was murky. At 25, I tipped over the edge, blacking out often in the month leading up to <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2019/02/how-you-find-yourself-divorced-at-27-after-11-months-of-marriage/\">my first marriage</a>. Yet I always had an “off” switch. I never worried I’d forget when enough was enough.<br/>There were times in my 30s when the draw to drink was irresistible. We bought wine in bulk during the pandemic and through our early parenting years. Wine was a daily ritual. <br/>Much of my social life has revolved around booze. Wine as an activity. Wine as a unifier. As <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2013/12/love-marriage-second-chances/\">Joe and I fell in love</a> over drinks and didn’t think twice about a weeknight martini, I had friends who decided to go sober. With it came a sense of worry we’d lose contact. Thankfully, no friendships have been lost to sobriety. <br/>I listened to stories from those who found themselves outside of once <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/01/our-friendships-evolve-because-we-do/\">close friendships</a>, othered and not offered a seat at the dinner table, hurt by the fragility of a friendship built around booze. As I asked questions about life without alcohol, they opened my eyes to a world that is just as rich in connection and flavor as all the heightened sensations I’ve come to associate with both alcohol and my relationships. <br/>The beer in hand was no longer a ticket to entry. Sobriety offered a way to access a deeper connection. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/01/why-i-quit-drinking-alcohol/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Two weeks after I hit publish on <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/01/year-in-review-2023/\">my 2023 recap</a> last January, everything felt on the brink of falling apart. <br/>I could feel that the balance of my life—work, personal life, marriage, and my relationship with all of it—had been teetering on edge for a long, long time. However, I thought that if I acknowledged how I truly felt about it all, the delicate balance of my life would lose its shape, never to be reconstituted.<br/>We usually don’t face this circumstance unless there isn’t another option. It sits so profoundly in the dark that there isn’t a map. But we feel the threat lurking. Then something happens that turns the lights on, and there it is. We don’t always like what we see.<br/>Nothing particularly eventful happened last year. But I became “real”—real in the way we can only be when we finally allow our whole selves to be witnessed. <br/>I am only just beginning to understand what it means to be there for myself. Only beginning to take accountability for my reality.<br/>If I can tell you one thing, it’s that the things we fear facing the most are what we need to run toward. The truth really does set you free. </p>\n<p>The new year begins in earnest. We do January things even though it’s a balmy 30 degrees and not a snowflake clings to the ground. We clean out the house and make way for New Year’s intentions. We dance and drink martinis at Mancini’s. I host friends for roast lamb and cabbage and try to ignore the feeling of dread that follows me to my desk each morning. <br/>I sit at my computer. I wait to feel “good” about my career. I look at finances, which have been difficult to rightsize since laying the team off last June. There are tax bills, summer camps, and unexpected home issues that need to be paid for. Joe and I have always shared a joint bank account, but I remain in charge of the budget and big-picture view of the state of it all. I feel alone. I begin to daydream about selling everything and moving to a small cabin up north. On a beach. Anywhere but here. <br/>I go to Carlsbad with some girlfriends and forget about my troubles for 36 hours. I watch <i>Past Lives</i> on the way home and cry in public. <br/>When I arrive home, the tipping point reveals itself: Joe decides to leave his job abruptly. His toxic work environment has become impossible.<br/>It is the right thing to do. How it all went down will take me a long time to get over. I am angry. Very angry. And empathic. I agree with his decision wholeheartedly. I hold the two truths close to my heart and then feel an iciness cover everything. The show must go on, and bills are on their way.  <br/>I cut my bangs into the style of a French assassin. I feel bulletproof. I work and make pot roast and work more. I feel <i>alive</i> with purpose again. I am high on the feeling of being chased by the thought of financial ruin. <br/>I sign three months’ worth of business in a week. Maybe this is just how it has to be to feel like myself again, to feel in control and capable. I am so afraid of losing everything that I feel nothing at all. <br/>I have recurring nightmares. I walk for hours to calm down. I open up to my friend about my anger and guilt for being angry. I feel less alone in the presence of someone who sees me. I wonder if I can see myself.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/01/year-in-review-2024/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

There’s nothing wrong with big goals, but in order for them to be sustainable, to last until the following year, goals need to be doable. Second—and I believe this to be the biggest culprit of what disrupts our success—we start chasing our goals without being aware of what our lives presently look like or how we really spend our time.<strong>Becoming aware of your habits puts you in the driver’s seat and, from my experience, helps you set more appropriate, achievable goals. So how do you become aware? By tracking your habits. </strong>With all of the energy packed behind New Year’s resolutions, habit tracking may sound a little passive. Who’s got time to spend tracking their habits when what they really need to be doing is working toward the best version of themselves? <br/>Everyone.<br/>Because when you start with habit tracking, you are more likely to create achievable goals, and therefore not have to start all over next year. Progress must be preceded by awareness, otherwise, you don’t truly know where you’re coming from.<br/>A few months ago, I began scrupulously tracking my habits. I had an idea of how I spent my days, but I wanted to become clear on what I <i>really</i> spent my time doing. I already knew that <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/02/decluttering-the-mind-an-ode-to-morning-pages-2/\">I spent most mornings writing</a> (I thought) and I went to yoga a few times per week (I thought). Only once I tracked my habits did I see the discrepancy between where I thought I spent my time and where I <i>really </i>spent it. This awareness has led me to some incredible progress.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Only once I tracked my habits did I see the discrepancy between where I thought I spent my time and where I</p><i>really</i>spent it.

It’s life-changing, I promise.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>All you need is a notebook, a pen, and a little dedication, because you’ll need to end each day going over your habits. (If you’re the kind of person who needs more structure than a hand-drawn grid, there are also apps, tools, and notebooks out there to help you track your habits.)</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: Looking for a premade habit tracking form?

    "body": "<p>Earlier this year, I shared the first post in our Wit &amp; Delight entertaining series, “<a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/08/casual-dinner-party/\">How to Host a Casual Dinner Party</a>.” This series is a collaboration between me and my friend <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lisahackwith/\">Lisa</a>. Both avid hosts, we wanted to share ideas for entertaining that are approachable and special all at once. <strong>I am so excited about our second entertaining series installment: The Dessert Party!</strong><br/>Life is full in the weeks leading up to the end of the year. Finding time to connect with friends and family can fall by the wayside, especially for those in a season when small children are part of their daily routine. <br/>Since working on this series, I’ve learned the joys of planning ahead. Thinking about ways to cut back on labor and make things special is so much easier when you’re not running on impromptu plans. Lisa and I wanted to put together a menu that would work for an afternoon gathering—think afternoon teatime, but with desserts. The concept has you delegating recipes and responsibilities to friends, which is both collaborative and fun! </p>\n<p>The idea of a dessert party is to enjoy dessert and snacks with friends or family. The menu can be casual and the workload can be split between guests so everyone makes something to share. This entertaining idea is perfect for the holiday season but it can be executed any time of year.<br/>The beauty of this kind of party is that it’s completely flexible. It can be on a weekend afternoon or evening. The guest list can be intimate or big. You can sit around a dining table or—like we did—simply gather around a coffee table in the living room. Here’s what our dessert party entailed. </p>\n<p>There were six people on our dessert party guest list, including myself. I invited a few friends who love to bake and a few friends who would rather bring savory snacks. I think six is the perfect number, but a party like this works well for scaling the guest list up or down.</p>\n<p>Because dessert is so indulgent, we designed the menu to include both sweet and savory treats. Lisa developed each of the dessert recipes. A few menu items require more time and skill; others just require a trip to the store. Three people baked desserts, three people collaborated on the charcuterie board, and I provided the bubbles as the host.<br/>For drinks, I recommend going with something special like <a href=\"https://www.champagne-billecart.fr/en/collection/brut-rose\">Billecart Brut Rose</a> or something for everyday drinking like <a href=\"https://www.shophenryandson.com/product/il-mostro-frizzante-bianco/4895?cp=true&amp;sa=false&amp;sbp=false&amp;q=true\">Il Mostro Frizzante BIANCO</a>. For those not imbibing, try <a href=\"https://drywit.com/collections/all\">Dry Wit Pippi</a>.<strong>Here’s what our menu looked like:</strong></p>\n<p>Almost everything can be done ahead of time, so the finishing touches come together pretty easily on the day of the party. For this type of party, you can include your friends in each of the prep tasks, such as:</p>\n<p>With casual parties like this one, a thrown-together feel makes everyone relaxed and comfortable in your home. Plan to sit down about 30 – 45 minutes after everyone arrives. <br/>If a collaborative prep process is not your kind of thing, set your table (or coffee table in front of the fireplace if you have one), build a fire, light candles, and put on a playlist ahead of time. Grab friends drinks once they arrive, and invite them to place their contribution on the table. Once everything has been plated, have each person share a little note about what they brought, like the delicious new cheese they found at the market, the process of piping the frosting on the cake, etc. I’ve found talking about food with friends who care about food to be lovely. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/12/dessert-party/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>On Friday morning, August 22, illustrator Felipe Galindo Gómez opened his email to find a note from his friend. “Have you seen this?” the message read, and linked to the White House’s bullet-pointed <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036180/trump-targets-lgbtq-history-migrants-and-more-in-chilling-smithsonian-hit-list/\">list targeting Smithsonian artworks and exhibitions</a>. There it was: an image of his 1999 <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2018648700/\">illustration</a> “4th of July from the south border.”</p>\n<p>Since 2022, Galindo’s work had been reproduced on a label about anti-immigrant prejudice as part of<i> </i><a href=\"https://latino.si.edu/exhibitions/presente\"> ¡Presente! A Latino History of the United States</a> in the National Museum of American History’s (NMAH) Molina Family Latino Gallery. Over the last three years, the gallery space has served as the temporary location of the nascent National Museum of the American Latino, which is currently facing an uncertain future under the Trump administration. Now, the Molina gallery has quietly closed for the next nine months, </p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>confirmed.</p>\n<p>After the White House featured his work in its hit list, Galindo, who also goes by the name “Feggo,” said he traveled from New York City to Washington, DC, to see whether it was still up. When he arrived at the museum on Tuesday, he found the exhibition closed. A sign said it would reopen in spring 2026. According to the Smithsonian’s website, <i>¡Presente! </i>was scheduled to close at the end of November, in preparation for <a href=\"https://www.si.edu/250\">programming</a> marking the United States’s 250th birthday. But the exhibition was shuttered on July 20, four months sooner than expected. The decision notably follows Trump’s <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/999509/trump-whitewashes-history-in-new-smithsonian-executive-order/\">March executive order</a> targeting the Smithsonian Institution and the release of his Fiscal Year 2026 budget, which excluded funding for the NMAL.</p>\n<p>The Molina Family Latino Gallery’s early closure means it will remain shuttered throughout Hispanic Heritage Month this fall, and marks a lengthy period of inactivity for the fledgling National Museum of the American Latino’s only current physical gallery, which the museum’s director, Jorge Zamanillo, has <a href=\"https://time.com/6314166/museum-american-latino-controversy/\">referred</a> to as the institution’s “first iteration.” </p>\n<p>Reached by <i>Hyperallergic</i>, a spokesperson for the institution cited preparations for the Smithsonian’s <i>Our Shared Future: 250</i> programming as the reason for the exhibition’s premature closure. </p>\n<p>“The National Museum of the American Latino is participating in the Smithsonian’s celebration of the nation’s 250th anniversary and wanted to meet the spring 2026 deadline for opening the <i>Puro Ritmo</i> exhibition in support of the Smithsonian’s institution-wide plans,” the spokesperson said, referring to the upcoming show <a href=\"https://latino.si.edu/exhibitions\"> ¡Puro Ritmo! The Musical Journey of Salsa</a> at the Molina gallery. “The Molina Family Latino Gallery is closed to visitors because museum staff need the space to safely de-install </p>\n<p><i>Presente</i>and then transition the exhibition space into a staging area to prepare for the renovation and installation of</p>\n<p><i>Puro Ritmo</i>.”</p>\n<p>The institution <a href=\"https://time.com/6314166/museum-american-latino-controversy/\">reportedly</a> adopted the salsa-themed exhibition as a softer alternative to a planned exhibition on Latino youth movements that garnered significant conservative backlash. Before Trump’s crackdown on the Smithsonian began, that exhibition was widely criticized by conservatives who disagreed with its focus on colonization and threatened to <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/835401/republicans-vote-to-block-funding-for-museum-of-american-latino/\">withhold federal funding</a> for the forthcoming museum in 2023.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>The Smithsonian spokesperson did not directly answer a question about whether Trump’s museum reviews or executive action influenced the decision to close the Molina Gallery in July. Trump has<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Letter-Sec.-Bunch-Smithsonian-8.12.2025.pdf\"> repeatedly pushed</a> the Smithsonian to promote “unity, progress, and enduring values” in time for the country’s 250th anniversary next year. Earlier this month, the administration demanded that Smithsonian museums submit their 250th anniversary plans to “<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/08/letter-to-the-smithsonian-internal-review-of-smithsonian-exhibitions-and-materials/\">align messaging</a>” with the White House Salute to America 250 Task Force.</p>\n<p>Three of the works named on last week’s White House list were created by living artists who were born in Mexico, including Galindo, raising questions about how the institution will protect its Latino artists under pressure from the federal government.</p>\n<p>When Galindo learned from a staff member that the museum was “rotating” the exhibition, he told <i>Hyperallergic </i>he remembers thinking, “Is that a new word for censoring?” </p>\n<p>The administration has already launched a review of <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/08/letter-to-the-smithsonian-internal-review-of-smithsonian-exhibitions-and-materials/\">exhibitions</a> planned for the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence as part of its larger probe. Trump’s government referenced the US’s 250th anniversary nine times in its letter to the Smithsonian announcing its review and forthcoming “content corrections.” </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037811/smithsonian-latino-gallery-quietly-closes-for-nine-months/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The buzz of neon lights drones in the background. It’s hard to say if the temperature has truly dropped, or if it’s psychosomatic, that the atmosphere has cooled your skin just by the power of suggestion. You’re floating in space, or suspended underwater — gravity works differently here.</p>\n    <p>The phases of the moon are painted on the wall in a matte metallic silver, and a small poem by Saar is draped across the wall: “The moon keeps vigil as a lone canoe drifts into a sea of tranquility seeking serenity in the twilight.” In the middle of the room, a long canoe, 17 feet across, sits atop a bed of branches, bramble, and sheets of jagged wood. At either tip of the ship is a watchful eye guiding the raft in both directions. Two sentinels — antiques affixed with antlers — keep watch at each end. Saar has crafted a fantastical scene; you can envision the boat careening upriver, striding forth.</p>\n    <p>The vessel is occupied by bird cages confining animal antlers and seated upon miniature chairs fit only for a toddler — or, perhaps, spirits who scarcely need a physical seat, just an invitation to rest. These scavenged items are characteristic of Saar’s found object assemblage; she hunts for her materials, whether in nature or at flea markets.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/cFoCY-1200x900.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>“I like combining manufactured objects with natural objects,” says the 98-year-old artist in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n2Dg3C10Y&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huntington.org%2F&amp;embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huntington.org&amp;source_ve_path=MjM4NTE&amp;themeRefresh=1\">video</a> at the back of the gallery. She started collecting at four or five, she explains, but the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. was a catalyzing moment. She was so overwhelmed with emotion that she could do nothing but create art, leading her to assemble one of her most famed sculptures, “The Liberation of Aunt Jemima” (1972), which empowers and equips a “mammy” figurine with defensive weaponry.</p>\n    <p>Saar is a famed Angeleno, a fixture in the city’s art scene, but she was raised in Pasadena, which neighbors the Huntington Gardens, where this site-specific commission went up in 2023. In the short directed by Kyle Provencio Reingold, the camera follows her through the massive campus, where she first wandered at 12 or 13 alongside her mother and neighbor. We forage the gardens with her as she instructs the Huntington employees of her artistic intentions; you can hear the giddiness in her voice as she remembers her childhood traversing its grounds, selecting fallen branches and trimmings. “Even in death, those things can be really beautiful,” she muses.</p>\n    <p>The gallery lighting shifts from daylight to dusk as time creeps along. <i>Drifting Into Twilight </i>is an encapsulated, self-sustaining environment of its own, like a display exhibit at a natural history museum with a surrealistic twist. The room is as relaxing as it is disorienting; it feels like you’ve been plunged into a misty and peculiar other world. You are sinking, descending, drifting into twilight. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/bcIbO-1200x900.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.huntington.org/exhibitions/betye-saar-drifting-toward-twilight\">Betye Saar: Drifting Toward Twilight</a> <i>continues at Virginia Steele Scott Galleries of American Art at the Huntington (1151 Oxford Road, San Marino, California) through November 30, 2027.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Since 1973, Vincent van Gogh masterpieces including his beloved sunflowers, wistful wheatfields, and self-portraits have been housed in Amsterdam’s Van Gogh Museum. The institution was established via a historic 1962 agreement between the painter’s nephew and the Dutch government to ensure the long-term preservation of hundreds of paintings, drawings, and letters comprising van Gogh’s oeuvre.<br/>Now, the museum says that the collection’s future is uncertain, citing a dispute with the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (OCW) over the funding for costly maintenance repairs and sustainability efforts mandated by the state. In a legal complaint, the institution claims that the Dutch government is violating its decades-old agreement by refusing to provide sufficient subsidies to cover the cost of the three-year, €104 million (~$121 million) project.</p>\n    <p>Under the Dutch Heritage Act, national museums, including the Van Gogh Museum, the Rijksmuseum, and the Kröller-Müller Museum, receive annual housing subsidies to help them maintain and preserve their collections. But the Van Gogh Museum says that this yearly government funding —<a href=\"https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0037533/2025-05-07\"> currently €8,428,300 (~$9.8 million)</a> — falls short of the more than €11 million (~$12.8 million) needed to help it finance much-needed renovations to its fire and security alarms, climate control system, and internal elevators leading to storage facilities, plus the sustainability upgrades required for all Dutch public buildings as of 2024.</p>\n    <p>“So far, the state of the museum has not directly affected the programming and operations,” a Van Gogh Museum spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “But it’s just a matter of time before it will become a major issue.” </p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for OCW said that the ministry “maintains that the allocated housing subsidy is sufficient to cover the necessary maintenance cost.”</p>\n    <p>“This position is based on comprehensive research conducted by independent experts commissioned by the Ministry,” the spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>, noting that the subsidy is a “fixed amount” that is annually adjusted for inflation. </p>\n    <p>The museum did not disclose how the subsidy is calculated, but the OCW representative said that the same methodology is used for other national museums, citing the Rijksmuseum, which receives<a href=\"https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0037533/2025-05-07\"> €37 million (~$43 million)</a>, and the Kröller-Müller Museum, which receives<a href=\"https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0037533/2025-05-07\"> €9.8 (~$11.4 million)</a>.</p>\n    <p>For the past two years, the Van Gogh Museum has been negotiating with the government to increase this annual subsidy by €2.5 million (~$2.9 million) to no avail.</p>\n    <p>If the institution does not come to a resolution soon, the museum says it may need to close its doors. The Van Gogh Foundation, established by the painter’s nephew, has also echoed concerns about the institution’s future and urged the Dutch government to abide by its obligations to protect the artist’s works as stipulated by the founding 1962 agreement.</p>\n    <p>The Van Gogh Museum houses the largest collection of works by the artist in the world, comprising over 200 paintings, 500 drawings, and 900 letters, as well as other works by the Dutch artist’s contemporaries and influences. Over the course of five decades, nearly 57 million people have visited the museum, with annual attendance reaching a peak of 2.6 million in 2017. Last year, the institution hosted five exhibitions, including a <a href=\"https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/visit/whats-on/exhibitions/overview-past-exhibitions/matthew-wong-vincent-van-gogh?_gl=1*hwymjv*_up*MQ..*_gs*MQ..&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw_L_FBhDmARIsAItqgt7ROFc2U8sSxAl_BZzcsB103XGQ8Jw98o63-UmTCCXX4lYhJiRItScaAho5EALw_wcB&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADhviGV-Km3u2LOuKphdQgDUdbYh0\">retrospective</a> exploring van Gogh’s influence on the late Chinese-Canadian artist Matthew Wong and a <a href=\"https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/visit/whats-on/exhibitions/overview-past-exhibitions/vive-limpressionnisme?_gl=1*glzo0v*_up*MQ..&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw_L_FBhDmARIsAItqgt7ROFc2U8sSxAl_BZzcsB103XGQ8Jw98o63-UmTCCXX4lYhJiRItScaAho5EALw_wcB&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADhviGV-Km3u2LOuKphdQgDUdbYh0\">show</a> paying homage to French Impressionism.</p>\n    <p>The case is scheduled to be heard in court on February 19, the OCW spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037500/amsterdam-van-gogh-museum-collection-faces-uncertain-future/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>‣ Design is a minefield of ethical dilemmas, incentivizing companies to work with exploitative clients and making it difficult for employees to say no. Elizabeth Goodspeed spoke with a few designers, writing in <i> It’s Nice That</i>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Questions about client ethics are tricky enough when you know exactly who you’re working for. Things get even murkier when work is licensed, resold, or embedded with no direct link between creator and end user. For type designers, this is the norm. Once a font is released, it can surface almost anywhere, often without warning. Jesse Ragan, cofounder of XYZ Type, says custom projects feel relatively straightforward to assess ideologically: if he doesn’t believe in a client, he can simply turn down the work. Retail fonts are a different story. A typeface is made in isolation long before it’s used, and can be licensed anonymously or simply pulled from Adobe Fonts without the designer’s knowledge. Jesse has seen his work turn up in porn, conservative Christian campaigns, and even materials for a far-right Texas militia. “It’s always a shock to see,” he says, especially given his left-leaning politics. He describes designing a typeface as a slow, intimate process – “every little letterform, it’s like, ‘hello, friend’, when I see them” – which makes it all the more jarring when it gets into the wrong hands. Rutherford Craze, founder of foundry Mass Driver, shares this feeling. “Some type designers feel that once they release a typeface, where it ends up is no longer their concern. I strongly disagree,” he says. “It’s not feasible to make a living and keep a spotless conscience, but it’s our responsibility to find the most equitable balance we can, whether that’s through [dis]incentivising certain usage, or turning down work for clients we disagree with.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>‣ Noguchi Museum Rights, an anonymous group of workers at the New York institution, penned an essay flagging longstanding allegations of racism and artwashing at the museum. They write in <i> Everything is Political</i>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Given that the keffiyeh is a cultural garment, meaning it is protected under city and state laws, and is the only thing ever explicitly targeted by this policy, how does the selective enforcement of this policy not discriminate against individuals who would wear a keffiyeh as a cultural item? What is the distinction between cultural and political in this context, and how is that dealt with by museum leadership?</p>\n      <p>Why were board Co-Chairs Spencer Bailey and Susan Kessler so involved in enforcing the keffiyeh ban, and in what ways does enforcing the ban relate to their responsibilities?</p>\n      <p>The leadership is not for the community, despite running a community museum founded by an activist artist who would be appalled by the current conditions. While people and organizations have stopped partnering with the museum, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaints have been filed, the staff has unionized, and the museum has received terrible press, those in leadership positions have simply crossed their fingers in the hope that the public will forget about it all. The Noguchi Museum is a community non-profit, and as a member of the community, you deserve answers.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>‣ The Moomins exhibition at the Brooklyn Public Library was easily one of the highlights of my summer, and for the <i> New Yorker</i>, Jon Allsop articulates the role these deeply human trolls can play in an age of anxiety and repression:</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037819/required-reading-748/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>SANTA FE — In 1998, science fiction writer Ted Chiang published “Story of Your Life,” in which aliens come to Earth in “looking glasses,” mirrored spaceships that act as communication devices. The central character, linguist Dr. Louise Banks, is tasked with deciphering the aliens’ language. In turn, she begins to see time like they do — as simultaneous events — and ultimately glimpses her own future.</p>\n<p>A reference to “Story of Your Life” is tucked into the exhibition guidebook for <i> Once Within a Time</i>, SITE Santa Fe’s 12th International. Curator Cecilia Alemani identified Chiang as one of the exhibition’s 27 “figures of interest” — catalysts for the 71</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>participating artists and more than two dozen writers. What struck me about Alemani’s inclusion of Chiang’s writing was not the reference to extraterrestrial life (many readers will be familiar with the accounts of UFO sightings in New Mexico), but the surreal, endlessly fascinating phenomenon of the looking glass.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><i>Once Within a Time</i> takes reflection as a major cue. Within each curated theme, such as “The Wheel of Telling” and “The Secret Life of Puppets,” are mirror images, doubles, reversals, and echoes, along with symmetries of place, histories, peoples, and legends — offering exhibition visitors concurrent rather than sequential events, in which multiple perspectives and timelines unfold. Even the treatment of the exhibition title, <a href=\"https://www.sitesantafe.org/en/once-within-a-time/\">in which “Time” is printed upside down</a>, gestures to alternative ways of experiencing the temporal, reflective nature of both art and language. </p>\n<p>Among the many echoing narratives are works by Nora Turato and Will Rawls. Turato’s mural “I WANT OUT!” (2025), a red vinyl triptych with one panel per word, is installed on the exterior of SITE Santa Fe, the main venue; inside the museum, Rawls’s <i>Amphigory </i>(2022), a series of inky, glitchy screen prints, seems to respond to Turato’s plea with the barely legible phrase “U Can’t Escape Alive.” </p>\n<p>In the gallery with Rawls is a suite of 72 computer drawings from 1969 by hard-edge abstract painter Frederick Hammersley, who died in 2009 at age 90. He hit an artistic dry spell in the late ’60s, saying, “I painted myself out,” a condition of exhaustion, liberation, or perhaps both. To shake things up, he enrolled in <a href=\"https://www.santafenewmexican.com/pasatiempo/art/by-design-art1-and-the-early-history-of-computer-art/article_f5239b0a-13d2-11eb-ae6c-378f161fb667.html\">a computer class for artists</a> at the University of New Mexico. He used the program ART 1 to create multiple printouts of the individual “drawings” that comprise the suite on view, visually undulating abstract compositions of gray monochrome letters, numbers, and punctuation marks. With additional presentations of Chester Nez and the “<a href=\"https://guides.loc.gov/navajo-code-talkers/profiles\">Original 29” Navajo Code Talkers</a>, Autumn Chacon’s radio frequency installation, and others, visitors may experience some seriously surreal data-driven reverberations.  </p>\n<p>In SITE’s central gallery space, color-rich reverse paintings on glass — a vase of flowers, a snake, a dreamlike landscape — by Rebecca Salsbury James, born in 1891, were just odd enough to make me linger and consider her time in Taos, New Mexico, with Mabel Dodge Luhan, Georgia O’Keeffe, and other New York-to-Taos transplants. A selection from James’s collection of miniatures, including figurines, mirrors, and devotional objects, is also on view, many of which are in pairs or otherwise doubled. One tells a story, but two hold a conversation.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere in the gallery, I felt like I was in a funhouse or hall of mirrors. Louise Bonnet’s fleshy, misshapen, iridescent-skinned figures had me reflecting on my own pale, bony frame as equally warped and grotesque, alien to New Mexico’s desert environment. Katja Seib’s large-scale portrait paintings present the concept of reflection in literal and metaphysical terms. For example, “Cornucopia” (2025) depicts a fortune teller revealing her cards to the viewer; in the background, a framed image of another woman doing the same creates an infinity mirror effect. Nearby, a travel chest that belonged to <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/money/Gertrudis-Barcelo\">Doña Tules</a>, dubbed the “Queen of Sin” for her business activities (gambling and possibly a brothel), sits in the corner lit by a red light bulb, which I read as a heavy-handed reference to the stigma applied to other fiercely independent women who’ve come to the region. </p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037395/seeing-new-mexico-through-the-looking-glass-site-santa-fe-12th-international/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>LONDON — Edwards Burra was a chronically ill English painter, suffering from debilitating arthritis and asthma throughout much of his life. Hailing from the upper classes of southern England, with regularized, side-parted, tamped-down hair, he spent much of his life in headlong flight from his upbringing.</p>\n    <p>Burra wanted to experience the shock of strangeness, to embrace the allure of the louche, the forbidden, the disapproved of. He sometimes left home for months at a time without even saying goodbye. Where has Edward gone? Nobody knew. Will he ever come back? Perhaps.</p>\n    <p>First it was to Paris, and then to Spain, the United States, and Mexico. As you walk around his carefully curated, chronologically organized <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/edward-burra\">exhibition</a> at Tate Britain of the best of a lifetime’s work, you can hear the drift of music in the air, the music Edward loved, the visceral excitement of jazz and how that excitement fed into the work of the Harlem years. You can even see a row of black vinyl discs along the wall. These were Edward’s records. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3754-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Edward Burra</i>at Tate Britain, London (photo Michael Glover/</p>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>It is riddling, foot-stomping, 1920s stuff, with all its wildness. You may feel an urge to put your arm around someone nearby and swerve them out onto the dance floor. There’s plenty of space in these galleries to make your mark.</p>\n    <p>Burra’s paintings, like him, are motoring away, at speed, from convention or respectability. Most are crowded with figures — you can almost smell the sweet sweat. You can almost feel the heady excitement of all those twists and turns and crazy swerves, the pushes and the pulls.</p>\n    <p>The figures’ limbs are often inclined to bend pneumatically, as if they might be nothing but inflatables. Fingers get stretched and rubberized. Features get squeezed into inhuman, mask-like shapes. Their faces are so clarted with makeup that it’s hard to tell where the fantasy of all this posing and posturing begins or ends.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Burra3-1200x1666.jpg?resize=1200%2C1666&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>These beings, afloat on the fantasies of the Englishman wielding the brush, thrive in sexy, late-night environments where booze often topples from the trays on which it is transported. Who lives inside all these dangerously pouty cravings? This is erotic provocation on speed, surrealism lightly peppered with satire, and Burra records it all, relishing the particularity of his people and scenes. (It is he, of course, who has twisted things so out of shape.) Take a good, hard look at the weird grimaces of “The Two Sisters” (1929) or the parodic mistrust on display in “Balcony Toulon” (1929). In New York, he falls instantly for the appeal of Harlem’s nightlife — such gorgeous clinches to be savored in “Savoy Ballroom, Harlem” (1934)!</p>\n    <p>Then, once in Spain, amid the death and the turmoil and confusion of the Spanish Civil War, the mood and the palette darken, and the human figure begins to incline toward the anonymous and mechanized. War looms over these paintings. We stare into open graves to admire the skeletons.</p>\n    <p>At the end he returns to England and tries to work up some response to the puff-smoke of industry and the grit of working-class street life. Rude boys kick out in unison, like stiff performers on a stage. These paintings don’t quite convince — the old energy has left him. Burra can no longer dig deep enough.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/4.-Edward-Burra-Dancing-Skeletons-1934.-Tate-Purchased-1939-1200x1671.jpg?resize=1200%2C1671&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/13.-Edward-Burra-Simply-Heavenly-Scene-in-Harlem-1957.-Private-Collection-1200x812.jpg?resize=1200%2C812&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/11.-Edward-Burra-Balcony-Toulon-1929.-Private-collection-1200x1551.jpg?resize=1200%2C1551&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/12.-Edward-Burra-John-Deth-Hommage-to-Conrad-Aiken-1931-Whitworth-Art-Gallery-1200x862.jpg?resize=1200%2C862&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/10.-Edward-Burra-Valley-and-River-Northumberland-1972-1200x1799.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1799&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/6.-Edward-Burra-Minuit-Chanson-1931-Private-Collection-1200x901.jpg?resize=1200%2C901&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/15.-Edward-Burra-The-Watcher-1937-Scottish-National-Gallery-of-Modern-Art-1200x1821.jpg?resize=1200%2C1821&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/edward-burra\">Edward Burra</a> <i>continues at Tate Britain (Millbank, London, England) through October 19.

    "body": "<p>“Where did you get that rug??” is one of the questions I’m asked most often. Rugs were the first big purchase decor item I started collecting when I moved into <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/06/love-letter-all-the-places-i-lived/\">my first apartment</a>. Below you’ll find my favorite places to browse and buy rugs (the former of which I am almost always doing). There is a wide variety of brands, price points, and styles represented below, for a number of reasons. <br/>Even if you plan to buy more budget-friendly rugs, I still recommend browsing brands with rugs at all price points. In my experience, getting familiar with what’s available from different designers and at different shops is one of the best ways to get to know your style and what you’re drawn to most. I’ve found that if I expose myself to unique and interesting pieces, even if they are out of my price range, I learn to easily pick out the great pieces at stores with lower price points.</p>\n<p>I love what <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15333350\">Lulu &amp; Georgia</a> is doing with their rug collaborations. The <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15333314\">Sarah Sherman Samuel collection</a> is iconic! Along with the checkerboard rug we have in our current home, we had one of the rugs from this collection in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2020/04/the-often-overlooked-importance-of-decorating-your-bedroom/\">our main bedroom</a> at our previous house and loved it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15334757\">Chairish</a> is a place I love to browse rug styles, even though most are out of my price range. On a rare occasion, I will make a lowball offer—I’ve even had said offer accepted before (the vintage rug in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/03/how-to-be-brave-with-color-and-pattern-in-your-home/\">the family room</a> is from Chairish, as is the vintage rug in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/08/entryway-design-elements/\">the entryway</a>)! They still cost an arm and a leg, but they are forever pieces from a reputable site. Keep in mind that the Chairish return policy is very strict, so if you buy one here and do not like it, you only have forty-eight hours to submit your return.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3KGVIcg\">Loloi</a> is an amazing source for budget-friendly and kid-friendly (or pet-friendly!) rugs. They carry rugs in so many gorgeous styles, no matter your personal design taste. We have used them in areas where we know the kids and dog will play hard or may be more likely to spill. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15332981\">Annie Selke</a> carries super high-quality rugs for modern and traditional spaces. I love the punchy colors and graphic prints. We got an <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15332966\">Annie Selke runner</a> (pictured above) for our <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/03/everything-you-want-to-know-about-our-basement-kitchenette/\">basement kitchenette</a>, and combined several rugs into <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15335913\">a runner</a> for our basement stairs. We also had this <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15332870\">mini-checked rug</a> in our home for many years.</p>\n<p>I love <a href=\"https://shopstyle.it/l/bC3an\">eBay</a> for the DEALS you can find if you’re willing to be patient and/or negotiate. I purchased a Swedish kilim runner from eBay for the hallway to our bedroom (pictured above).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3qWoFcy\">ECARPETGALLERY</a> is a great source for vintage rugs at deep discounts. We have rugs from this store in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/07/how-design-theory-will-help-you-choose-the-right-rug-for-your-space/\">Joe’s office</a> and <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/02/blue-room-design/\">my office/library</a>. This is usually my first stop to see if a style I found on a site with more expensive pieces is available here at a lower price point. They update inventory often and have sales throughout the year, so this spot is worth keeping on your radar.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nordicknots.com/us\">Nordic Knots</a> carries rugs in solid colors and graphic patterns that are made in relatively small batches. We have two rugs from here—a <a href=\"https://nordicknots.com/us/product/grand-brick-red/\">red rug</a> in the dining room (pictured at the top of this post) and a <a href=\"https://nordicknots.com/us/product/grand-dusty-white/\">cream rug</a> in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/05/main-bedroom-tour/\">the main bedroom</a> (pictured above). One thing to expect is that these rugs tend to shed for the first couple of months you have them, so you may need to take additional vacuuming into consideration.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

    "body": "<p>Color and pattern add so much life and personality to a home. But for many of us, it’s hard to know where to start. We’re afraid of making mistakes or our homes looking too busy or cluttered. It wasn’t until I moved into a home where color and pattern were embraced that I even felt called to use their full potential. I realized I liked to be surrounded by color and pattern more than I thought I would.</p>\n<p>Five years into living with our eclectic and colorful home, I’ve learned the benefits of embracing color and pattern aren’t as simple as using my favorite colors—although this helps. Color and pattern are tools we can use beyond aesthetic qualities to evoke emotion, signal mood and vibe, and create a dynamic visual flow to make our house even more functional and enjoyable to live in.</p>\n<p>I stopped thinking about color and pattern as something you either “like” or “dislike” and instead embraced them as design tools to express ideas fully. This means even if you’re not into big bold colors and patterns, you can still benefit from the basic principles of using them deliberately.</p>\n<p>In this post, we’ll start by exploring the emotional reasons why it’s hard to be brave with color and pattern, and then I’ll offer some tips on how to get started and get better at it.</p>\n<p>Why is it so hard to be brave with color and pattern?</p>\n<p>There are a few reasons why stepping outside our comfort zones and using color and pattern in our homes can be challenging.</p>\n<p>Fear of making mistakes. We’re afraid that we’ll choose the wrong colors or patterns, and that our homes will end up looking ugly.</p>\n<p>Fear of being judged. We’re worried about what other people will think of our homes if they’re too colorful or patterned. We all have that friend whose well-intentioned remark on something that is very “us” and not “them” came off as snarky rather than loving. And sometimes, we are the ones who misinterpret it entirely! It’s time to let all that go. Doing our own thing means people will comment. And that’s OK. Let them. Being ourselves inspires others to be braver in their expression, which in the end, benefits us all. Be the one who starts that trend.</p>\n<p>Lack of confidence. We don’t trust our own taste, so we’re afraid to make bold choices. Let’s face it—the majority of us are not color experts! With the sheer amount of colors to choose from, it’s easy to psych yourself out.</p>\n<p>If you’re ready to start incorporating more color and pattern into your home, here are a few tips:</p>\n<p>Start small. Don’t try to do too much all at once. Start with a few small changes, like adding a colorful throw pillow to your couch or hanging a patterned curtain in your bedroom.</p>\n<p>Choose colors and patterns that you love. Don’t worry about what’s trendy or what other people like. Choose colors and patterns that make you happy and reflect your personality.</p>\n<p>Experiment. Don’t be afraid to experiment with different colors and patterns. Try out different combinations and see what you like best.</p>\n<p>Trust your gut. What you are first drawn to is often the right path to follow. Trust it. If you’re not sure about something, go with your gut. You’ll make the right choice.</p>\n<p>Some Ways to Get Better at Using Color and Pattern</p>\n<p>The more you work with color and pattern, the better you’ll get at it. Here are a few ways to improve your skills:</p>\n<p>Look for inspiration. Look for inspiration in magazines, books, and online. Pay attention to how different colors and patterns are used in different spaces.</p>\n<p>Take a class. If you’re really serious about learning how to use color and pattern, consider taking a class. This can be a great way to get expert advice and learn from others.</p>\n<p>Practice, practice, practice. The more you practice using color and pattern, the better you’ll get at it.

    "body": "<p>I was recently diagnosed with rosacea, which led me to take a closer look at the skincare products I was using. Through that process, I reassessed my skincare routine, paying special attention to how my skin reacts to different factors—especially my cycle. Right before my period, I tend to get a few pimples, and my rosacea flares up, so I focus on using gentle, soothing products during that time. I figured it was time to share what my routine looks like now. <strong>Today, I’m sharing my favorite skincare products, devices, and treatments that are working for me right now.</strong> In some categories, I rotate between a few go-to options depending on the day, while in others, I have a tried-and-true favorite I keep coming back to.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Products marked with an * were gifted to me by the brand.</i>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>1. </strong><strong>Rx Cleanser With Sodium Sulfacetamide and Sulfur</strong><br/>My dermatologist prescribed this cleanser to be used before my soap cleanser. It smells gross (like eggs) but if it helps keep my mild rosacea from flaring, I’m doing it. <strong>2. </strong><strong>Emma Lewisham Illuminating Oil Cleanser </strong><strong>*</strong><br/>I alternate between this oil cleanser and the one below depending on my mood or makeup. I find this cleanser easily removes waterproof makeup and I also like to use it when I have more time to incorporate facial massages. <strong>3. </strong><strong>CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser</strong><br/>This cleanser never irritates or fails to remove my makeup, and the price makes my other outrageous purchases sting a little less.</p>\n<p><strong>4. </strong><strong>SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic</strong><br/>I’ve used this vitamin C serum for years and years—it instantly brightens my complexion. I haven’t found a vitamin C I like as much! There was a period of time when I didn’t use it, and I noticed a clear increase in dark spots—a pretty telling sign of its effectiveness IMO.<strong>5. </strong><strong>Sunday Riley Good Genes</strong><i>*</i><br/>I use this serum about twice a week. This is enough exfoliation without aggravating my skin. It’s one of those products that moves the needle in terms of improving skin tone and texture. It is technically an acid, so be careful with this one if you have sensitive skin. <strong>Use WITANDDELIGHT15 for 15% off.</strong><strong>6. </strong><strong>Beauty Pie Über Youth Neck &amp; Chest Lift Serum Spray</strong><br/>My neck is becoming an area that’s lost elasticity since I’ve dropped weight and there is a whole wide world of creams and serums out there specifically formulated to treat the neck. I like this one a lot, especially because it’s easy to apply under a cream. </p>\n<p><strong>7. </strong><strong>Revision Skincare Nectifirm® Cream</strong><br/>And speaking of neck creams, this is the one I love the most out of the options I’ve tried. If I had to choose between the serum spray or cream, I think <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4iWo16V\">the cream</a> is the way to go. <strong>8. </strong><strong>INNBEAUTY Extreme Cream</strong><i>*</i><br/>I can’t say enough good things about <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-14616649\">this</a> deeply hydrating and firming lotion. It’s made me look alive again during my driest hours. It leaves my skin looking instantly plumper and, let’s face it, lifted. <strong>9. </strong><strong>UBeauty The Super Hydrator</strong><strong>*</strong><br/>This stuff is good at delivering a deeper level of hydration than moisturizer with a formula that includes peptides, hyaluronic acid, and panthenol. I’m no scientist but they’re known for creating this formula that goes on lightweight but still gets you that deeply hydrated feeling. I like this formula for warm days or for throwing on before a workout. <strong>Use WITANDDELIGHT20 for 20% off.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>10. </strong><strong>RMS Kakadu Beauty Oil</strong><i>*</i><br/>I have used a lot of facial oils in my day, and this one is hands down my favorite. It glides on smoothly, doesn’t have the lingering similarity to olive oil, and sinks in quickly enough to apply makeup right afterward. I use this oil as the last step in my routine, both in the morning and at night. After applying, I’ll often do about 30 seconds of facial massages under my eyes and on my neck—it’s a great way to help with puffiness. <strong>Use KATEA20 for 20% off.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/03/skincare-products-routine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>This month’s theme on Wit &amp; Delight is all about <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/06/mixing-interior-design-styles-june-2023-theme/\">the art of the mix</a> in interior design. I wanted to share more info on this topic and write about <i>how</i> you can apply the art of the mix in your own home.<br/>When I first sat down to write this article, I thought of the cookbook <i>Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat</i><i> </i>by Samin Nosrat (one I highly recommend!)<i>. </i>No, this is not an interior design book, but it <i>is</i> a book that helps people figure out how to mix and balance different elements in the realm of cooking. I decided to take a similar approach and write about how one can mix different elements in the realm of interior design.<strong>Today I’m sharing the five key interior design elements all of my favorite rooms have in common: color, pattern, texture, something old, and something that grounds the space.</strong> Here’s why each of these elements matters.</p>\n<p>If you’ve ever taken a painting class, you know that painters generally begin with a big field of one color on their canvas, which they then add to as they go. Consider the room you’re designing a canvas. Choose your base color first (which may be the existing color of the room <i>or</i> a color you plan to bring in), then consider which complementary colors you’d like to add to the mix. <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2020/07/a-color-skeptics-guide-to-color-theory-in-design/\">This article on color theory</a> will help you begin to get a sense of how different colors play together. <a href=\"https://www.houseandgarden.co.uk/article/paint-colour-rules\">This article from  House &amp; Garden</a> is also an interesting take on color rules to follow, according to interior designers.</p>\n<p>Pattern adds interest, depth, and emotion to any room. Without it, a space can feel somewhat flat. Patterns can be bold or subtle, colorful or neutral, and applied broadly or selectively. From wallpaper to upholstery to rugs to decor items, there is no shortage of ways to bring pattern into a home.</p>\n<p>I LOVE adding texture to any room. Similar to rooms without pattern, rooms without a variety of textures feel somewhat dull to me. I especially like to bring in texture through fabrics (e.g., velvet, linen, wool) and materials (e.g., rattan, marble, rustic wood, metal).</p>\n<p>There is always room for <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/10/thrift-antique-shopping-tips/\">something antique</a> in any room, particularly in spaces that are mostly filled with newer pieces. Be it furniture, art, light fixtures, or small decor items, old pieces bring <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/04/add-character-to-your-home/\">character and charm</a> to a home.</p>\n<p>A grounding element is something that acts as the foundation of a room; it’s the thing that brings the entire design together. I most often use an <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/01/rug-shopping/\">area rug</a> to ground a space. It helps define the seating area in a living room, bedroom, or dining room.

    "body": "<p>There’s something extra magical about winter weekends at the cabin. Slow mornings. Coffee by the fire. Long meals. No agenda. The simplicity of being in nature. My friend <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lisahackwith/\">Lisa Hackwith</a> and her partner have spent years hosting friends and family at their cabin on a small lake, and over time, Lisa has developed a creative approach to cooking that makes weekends feel both effortless and special. <br/>Instead of hauling a long grocery list up north and ultimately leaving food to waste, she embraces the challenge of using a handful of ingredients in multiple ways, crafting menus as resourceful as they are delectable. This winter, she designed a weekend-long menu for a group of six that maximizes flavor, minimizes waste, and makes hosting a well-timed and intentional endeavor. From a cozy Friday night dinner to a Sunday send-off lunch, Lisa shows us that limitations in the kitchen can lead to inspired meals.<br/>This is the third installment in the Wit &amp; Delight entertaining series. Find even more recipes and entertaining inspiration in our first two posts on hosting a <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/08/casual-dinner-party/\">casual dinner party</a> and an <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/12/dessert-party/\">afternoon dessert party</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Friday Dinner</strong><br/>Potato, Bacon, and Sharp White Cheddar Cheese Pierogies With Sauteed Leeks and Buttermilk Crème Fraîche <br/>Arugula, Crispy Leek, Date, and Crouton Salad<strong>Saturday Breakfast</strong><br/>Jammy Eggs With Pickled Leeks, Dill, Capers, Smoked Salmon, and Buttermilk Crème Fraîche Toasts<strong>Saturday Lunch</strong><br/>Grilled Sharp White Cheddar Cheese, Bacon, and Date Sandwiches<br/>Arugula and Mustard Crouton Salad With Peppery Buttermilk Dressing<strong>Saturday Dinner</strong><br/>Pan-Roasted Salmon Fillets With Orange, Leek, Date, Capers, and Dill Salad<br/>Bacon Fat Twice-Baked Crispy Potatoes<strong>Saturday Dessert</strong><br/>Vanilla Date Buttermilk Bran Cake With Orange Crème Anglaise<strong>Sunday Breakfast</strong><br/>Buttermilk Bran Pancakes With Maple Syrup<strong>Sunday Lunch</strong><br/>Creamy Potato, Leek, and Poached Salmon Soup With Dill<strong>Total cost per person:</strong> $38</p>\n<p><strong>Lisa: </strong>When my husband and I first started hosting weekend getaways at our cabin, we would usually divide and conquer meal planning equally among our friends. I noticed that when we did that everyone usually lugged up at least a cooler’s plus worth of food and we always had way too much! A lot of the time no one knew what the other was bringing so the food could sometimes be way too heavy or we’d end up bringing the same thing. I wanted to create weekend-long menus that were easy, efficient, well-balanced, and let nothing go to waste.</p>\n<p><strong>Lisa: </strong>I think restraints can sometimes give room for more creativity. When I didn’t have a world of possibilities to create something new but a concise and small ingredient list, I found it easier to come up with new recipes. I love setting out all the ingredients for one weekend and just seeing what I can come up with!</p>\n<p><strong>Lisa: </strong>Yes! Sometimes it feels like the possibilities are endless! I was working on a spring menu last May and one of my ingredients was rhubarb. I ended up making the five recipes listed below—that’s when I realized there is so much you can do with just one ingredient!</p>\n<p><strong>Lisa: </strong>I start with what’s in season. Then I pick two to three main ingredients and start to build from there. After I come up with a few ideas, usually a few more ingredients come naturally into the mix. I settle on five to eight “stars” for the weekend and then let myself free flow and come up with as many combinations as I can think of. After that, I arrange my recipes into what I think would fit best into two dinners, two lunches, and two breakfasts. Sometimes there is a snack in there, one drink, and always one dessert.  </p>\n<p><strong>Lisa: </strong>Yes, sometimes it can feel restrictive and I can’t come up with combinations I’m happy about. I usually go back to the drawing board and just try a different combination of “stars” to see if I can come up with something new I’m excited about trying. And I’ve found that once I actually start cooking and tasting, new things often arise. Sometimes the best discovered are recipes that weren’t planned in my head but by tasting as I go while playing around in the kitchen.  </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/02/winter-weekend-menu-easy-recipes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Time management and organization have never come naturally to me. When life became unmanageable—a constant since my second child arrived—I looked to the experts. Not once did I think of listening to my own rhythm and body. Productivity, I thought, was something to master, not something to understand.<br/>Then I hit a wall.<br/>I was tired of feeling like this, so I stopped fighting my own nature. I stopped taking productivity advice from people who don’t have ADHD.<br/>For years, I had been trying to contort myself into someone I wasn’t—structured, disciplined, and neatly organized. A person who could follow a system designed for a brain that didn’t work like mine. Why had I ever believed I could manage my time the same way they did?<br/>The shift was subtle but changed everything. I’m unstuck, no longer languishing, moving ahead with purpose. I know I’ll get stuck again, but I also know this: I’m done chasing solutions that were never meant to work for me.<strong>Today, I’m sharing what  does work—how I get things done without draining myself in the process. </strong>Because when we work against who we are, burnout isn’t a possibility. It’s a guarantee.</p>\n<p>I define productivity as doing what I said I’d do—for myself, for others—in a way that makes sense for my life. I spent two years trying to heal burnout by “resting,” only to feel worse with each passing day. Turns out, rest isn’t just stillness. Some kinds of rest are active, and learning to restore <i>that</i> changed everything.</p>\n<p>Different kinds of rest follow different kinds of productivity. Knowing what you need means knowing your limits. Trying to function like someone without ADHD only pushed me further from those signals. ADHD brains need different types of rest—emotional, mental, creative, physical, passive.<br/>I don’t recharge by watching TV. I recharge by reading, cooking, taking long walks, and practicing Pilates. To outsiders, it might look like I’m always going, but this kind of movement restores me. Sometimes, organizing a junk drawer is self-care. Other times, it’s a warning sign. When I’m mentally drained, TV helps. When I’m emotionally overwhelmed, it makes me feel stuck. Learning the difference changed everything.</p>\n<p>We are taught to measure our worth by what we produce. Part of my midlife journey has been rejecting that, untangling my value from my output, and focusing on <i>making</i> rather than <i>measuring</i>. If you’re in the thick of that, this post may not be what you need today.<br/>Your worth is not your work. But making—creating, moving, shaping something from nothing—is an expression of <i>you</i>. It’s life-giving. It’s confidence-building. It’s the thing that can pull you out of a spiral before it takes hold. When I started honoring my inner drive to create, productivity stopped being something I chased. It became the natural result of <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/02/the-benefits-of-flow-and-how-to-find-it-for-yourself/\">finding my flow</a>. Momentum, not depletion. Creation, not extraction. And that changed everything.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>When I started honoring my inner drive to create, productivity stopped being something I chased.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>In 2019, Hugo Crosthwaite became the first Latino artist to win the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery’s (NPG) prestigious triennial Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition. The Tijuana-born and San Diego-based illustrator received the contest’s grand prize: $25,000 and a portrait commission for the museum’s permanent collection. He chose to depict Anthony Fauci, then the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), in a stop-motion format that captures the nuances of his complicated legacy, including his <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/how-dr-fauci-handled-aids-crisis-jexipk/26361/\">criticized and then celebrated</a> oversight of the HIV/AIDs epidemic.</p>\n    <p>Last week, Crosthwaite found his hard-won commission on a list of Smithsonian items that the White House found objectionable. He was one of at least three Mexican-born artists whose work was included on <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036180/trump-targets-lgbtq-history-migrants-and-more-in-chilling-smithsonian-hit-list/\">Trump’s art hit list</a>, along with illustrator <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036180/trump-targets-lgbtq-history-migrants-and-more-in-chilling-smithsonian-hit-list/\">Rigoberto González</a> and painter <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037811/smithsonian-latino-gallery-quietly-closes-for-nine-months/\">Felipe Galindo Gómez</a>.</p>\n    <p>“My first reaction was surprise,” Crosthwaite shared in an interview with <i>Hyperallergic. </i>“But then later on, [I] felt a bit of pride to be included in this list of other wonderful artists and wonderful projects that talk about the diversity of the United States’ history.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Hugo-Foto-1-1200x1485.jpg?resize=1200%2C1485&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>In 2022, after winning the Outwin competition, Crosthwaite and the NPG considered a list of individuals for a portrait. They agreed on Fauci as the commission’s subject. At the time, the infectious disease specialist was a polarized figure: a revered pandemic hero and a detested political opponent of the right.</p>\n    <p>“I jumped at the chance of doing this because it was 2022, we were in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Crosthwaite told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “He became a symbol of this fight between science and truth, against conspiracy theories; Dr. Fauci kind of epitomizes the nation’s current political divide.”</p>\n    <p>The five-minute stop motion animation, “A Portrait of Dr. Anthony Fauci” (2022), begins by portraying him as a young scientist in a lab. Later, a man infected by an unnamed virus becomes emaciated until he disappears into a black hole that morphs into a scene from ACT UP protests. Men carry signs that read “Silence = Death” and “Killed by the System.” Behind them, skeletons look to the sky.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/facui2-1200x904.jpeg?resize=1200%2C904&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The artwork references the AIDs memorial quilt before transitioning into a segment about the COVID-19 pandemic, in which a woman’s lungs explode into tiny bits of paper. Fauci is portrayed next to the White House press briefing room podium, where he often gave virus updates alongside Trump. Crosthwaite included a thumbs-up icon<strong> </strong>moving erratically up and down behind the podium, and Fauci off to the side. He also captured anti-Fauci sentiment and the right-wing rejection of vaccines, at one point portraying the scientist with devil horns. The stop-motion sequence ends with a woman receiving a vaccine, which cuts to a portrait of an aging Fauci.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/fauci3-1200x894.jpeg?resize=1200%2C894&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Crosthwaite told <i>Hyperallergic </i>that he doubts the Trump administration actually watched the video, instead targeted the work because of his identity. He rebuffed the White House’s Smithsonian list as a mediocre attempt to win a culture war, and said being included on the list was a badge of honor.</p>\n    <p>“The portrait was done from the perspective of a Mexican-American artist, someone who’s cognizant of the impact of age and COVID-19 on my community, which is presented in the animation … the diverse people who are being attacked by viruses,” he said.</p>\n    <p>The artworks that Crosthwaite initially submitted to the Outwin competition had nothing to do with Fauci. In fact, the work that secured his national win was a different stop-motion animation, telling the story of a woman he met who had crossed the US-Mexico border illegally.</p>\n    <p>Crosthwaite commended the Outwin prize’s capacity to open doors for artists like himself. Any artist residing in the United States who is at least 18 years old is eligible to submit to the competition. For Crosthwaite, it was life-changing.</p>\n    <p>“Getting the commission to do the portrait of Dr. Fauci is actually a great honor — being part of the Smithsonian,” Crosthwaite told <i>Hyperallergic. </i>“My piece is part of the record of American history.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Screen-Shot-2025-08-29-at-2.58.33-PM-1200x898.jpeg?resize=1200%2C898&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/fauci-1200x904.jpeg?resize=1200%2C904&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038060/hugo-crosthwaite-artist-whose-fauci-portraits-enraged-the-white-house/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>LONDON — Some of the Courtauld’s previous exhibitions have <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1010475/the-cortaulds-impressionism-show-is-a-victim-of-corporate-curating/\">suffered from insufficient curation</a>. <a href=\"https://courtauld.ac.uk/whats-on/exh-abstract-erotic/\"> Abstract Erotic: Louise Bourgeois, Alice Adams, Eva Hesse</a>, on the other hand, strikes the exact right balance. Drawing on scholar Jo Applin’s research, curator Alexandra Gerstein has taken as a starting point the work of feminist curator and critic Lucy Lippard, who coined the titular term to describe this sensuous strand of art emerging in 1960s New York. Making perhaps the best use yet of the Courtauld’s teeny exhibition spaces next to the permanent collection, this small but unstuffed show gives proper breathing space for artistic dialogue and, crucially, for the viewer to engage in exploring differences and similarities between works and practices for themselves. </p>\n    <p>In 1966, Lippard curated the exhibition <i>Eccentric Abstraction</i> to capture a new wave of sculptures created from unusual, pliable materials like wire, plastic mesh, netting, and latex, which evoked tactile organic forms and, by extension, the human body. This is the Courtauld’s first show devoted to standalone sculpture, and the contrast between these blob-like forms and its Impressionist-heavy permanent collection may go some way to recreate just how different — even alarming — these pieces will have appeared to 1960s audiences just getting over the shock of Abstract Expressionism’s  rehauling of formalist painting.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Installation-view-l-r-Bourgeois-_Avenza_-_Lair_-_Fee-Couturiere_-_Hanging-Janus_-1200x880.jpg?resize=1200%2C880&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Abstract Erotic: Louise Bourgeois, Eva Hesse, Alice Adams</i>, featuring works by Eva Hesse and Alice Adams (all photos Olivia McEwan/</p>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>The three artists are each afforded an introductory caption presenting historical context. No direct written comparisons are made between them, nor any attempt to force commonality, for historically, there is none other than their working in generally the same space and time. This is good curating: The show allows viewers to ask and think for themselves. Its skill lies in making suggestions via the pieces selected for display, allowing for robust visual comparison. Viewers won’t be able to ignore the strain of eroticism that stems from their irresistible tactility, which is both alluring and fear-inducing, nor their uncanny resemblance to certain human appendages (<i>ahem</i>).</p>\n    <p>Applin and Gerstein do point out that all three artists’ experimentation with latex marked a turning point in their explorations of eroticism and the unconscious. The exhibition’s most well-known artist, Bourgeois, was born in Paris in 1911 and moved to New York in 1938. Duly included here is her “Filette (Sweeter Version)” (1968–99/ 2006), unmistakably an erect penis (or, more accurately, one yanked upwards by string) in urethane rubber, given the ambiguous French title “Little Girl.” Adams graduated from Columbia University with a degree in Fine Arts in 1953 before becoming an accomplished weaver. Her foray into obscure materials is here represented by such pieces as the nearby “Expanded Cylinder” (1970), in which she allowed latex foam to expand and set into a constricting tube of chain link, producing a regular weave-like texture while maintaining a phallic, slippery form. Finally, Hesse, born in 1936 in Hamburg before settling in New York, made sculptures of forms bound, twisted, and caught in netting. Applin and Gerstein draw out the latex connection again via the caption, which quotes Hesse on the material’s inevitable deterioration: “Art doesn’t last; life doesn’t last.” Fittingly, though unfortunately, there are no latex examples here.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Installation-view-l-r-Hesse-untitled-pieces-and-_No-Title-or-Not-Yet_-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>It is also unfortunate that this small but perfectly formed show was relatively empty on a weekend. The scrappy, experimental mark-making explored by these three pioneering artists is one important strain in the development of feminist art. Their unsettling forms provoke, titillate, and amuse — welcome responses to female voices and artistic expression. Perhaps it is reflective of trends in audience attention that a solid academic show like this should be less visited than the packed-out recent exhibitions on <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/804963/what-does-peter-doig-have-to-do-with-the-impressionists/\">Peter Doig</a> or yet more <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1010475/the-cortaulds-impressionism-show-is-a-victim-of-corporate-curating/\">Impressionism</a>.

The photographs were meant to generate support for the agency, allowing the public to witness the impacts of the Depression for themselves. Made by recruited photographers and then selected by Stryker for inclusion in traveling exhibitions and news outlets, the chosen images overwhelmingly depicted White families — a narrow and literally whitewashed view of rural America.</p>\n    <p><i> Crafting Sanctuaries: Black Spaces of the Black Great Depression South</i>, a new exhibition at the Museum of Art and Light in Manhattan, Kansas, showcases a broader view of FSA imagery, focusing on Black Southerners documented by photographers like Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Russell Lee, Marion Post Wolcott, Arthur Rothstein, Ben Shahn, and Jack Delano across six states: Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Florida, Mississippi, and Missouri. </p>\n    <p>Presented in partnership with Art Bridges Foundation, the photos highlight the intimacy of life among one’s community — private quarters, public gathering spaces — and the care taken to build one together. The exhibition, curator Tamir Williams told <i>Hyperallergic</i>, “is an examination of the significance of Black Southerners investing in their spatial worlds — and more largely in beauty — while living through this intense period of economic hardship and racial violence.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Sr4qw-1200x905.jpeg?resize=1200%2C905&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>During the summer of 2023, Ashley Holland, curator and director of Curatorial Initiatives for the Art Bridges Foundation, approached Williams to curate its first in-house traveling exhibition, drawing from the FSA photography collection. At the time, they’d just begun a job there as a curatorial research assistant.</p>\n    <p>“I came across Nicholas Natanson’s <i> The Black Image in the New Deal: The Politics of FSA Photography</i> (1992) and Sarah Boxer’s ‘</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/12/whitewashing-the-great-depression/616936/\">Whitewashing the Great Depression</a>’ (2020) for</p>\n    <p><i>The Atlantic</i>,” Williams said. “I knew that I wanted to focus on this issue of the absence of Black and other non-White persons from the larger visual memory of the Great Depression — and specifically explore how and why this exclusion happened and how it could be redressed.”</p>\n    <p>Williams spent a week poring over the Library of Congress’s digital FSA collection. They were drawn to images of small homes built by both White and Black laborers, particularly in La Forge, Missouri. Curious about “what home and homemaking might have looked like for other Black persons and families beyond La Forge,” they expanded their research.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/gdoxx-1200x797.jpeg?resize=1200%2C797&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The exhibition’s photographs are reverent, offering glimpses into otherwise unseen instances of Black domesticity and community. “I find Jack Delano’s ‘Negro tenant family near Greensboro, Alabama’ (1941) to be incredibly striking,” shared Javier Rivero Ramos, associate curator at Art Bridges. In the image, a young family poses in their home, the walls and ceilings plastered and reinforced with newspaper clippings, a kitten at their feet. “It seems like every conceivable emotion, thought, and event unfolding through the country is somehow refracted in the image,” Ramos added. Ibby Ouweleen, Art Bridges curatorial associate, said they were “taken by Marion Post Wolcott’s interior scene of three children and a dog in their family home, which feels sort of magical and mundane at once.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/WzRNF-1200x897.jpeg?resize=1200%2C897&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The exhibition is displayed in tandem with <i>Sanctuary in Motion</i>, a companion installation developed in collaboration with the Yuma Street Cultural Center. Kristy Peterson, vice president of Learning, Engagement, and Visitor Experiences at the museum, pointed to the history of the site.</p>\n    <p>“Manhattan, Kansas, has a rich history as a town site established by abolitionist settlers, circa 1855,” Peterson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “<i>Sanctuary in Motion</i> shares information about Manhattan’s history and community, and tells the story of Yuma Street [part of the city’s Historic District] … and its significance as a sanctuary where families made something out of nothing.”</p>\n    <p><i>Crafting Sanctuaries</i>, which runs through next spring, is both a corrective and a meditation. “It is my hope that these photographs allow viewers to see and witness how Black Southerners adopted expansive definitions of beauty to craft personal and communal sanctuaries and spaces of respite,” Williams said.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/y1qCn-1200x893.jpeg?resize=1200%2C893&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038134/reclaiming-a-whitewashed-history-of-the-great-depression-museum-art-light-kansas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Joe Amrhein and Susan Swenson were going to sit out the Armory Show this fall for the first time in a quarter century until they got a call last month from the fair’s director.</p>\n<p>The owners of Pierogi Gallery in Brooklyn’s Williamsburg neighborhood initially did not apply this year due to the show’s rising booth costs, which can exceed tens of thousands of dollars. Pierogi is planning the next phase of its business, which could include <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/970425/a-williamsburg-family-reunion-at-pierogi-gallery-30th-anniversary-opening/\">relocating to Lower Manhattan</a>. </p>\n<p>But Armory executives Kyla McMillan and J. Tyler Woodall appealed to Pierogi and the fair’s shared history — in 2016, Amrhein suggested the Armory use an empty space to display Jonathan Schipper’s <a href=\"https://www.jonathanschipper.com/slow-motion-car-crash\">installation</a> of a Volkswagen Golf crashing into a wall; the presentation of large-scale art has since become a cornerstone of the show. They recently negotiated a smaller exhibition space for Pierogi with a lower rate, enabling the gallery to return.</p>\n<p>“We had been on the fence about it since the economy is very uncertain and it’s a big investment,” Swenson said. “We’re not one of the big box galleries. Some of them have their own economies now.”</p>\n<p>The Armory Show has come a long way from exhibiting several New York gallerists on three floors of the Gramercy Park Hotel in the mid-1990s. Since 2021, the fair has set up camp at the spacious Javits Center near Manhattan’s Hudson Yards, where it will host some 230 galleries from more than 35 countries from September 4 through 7.</p>\n<p>The show also has new owners. Two years after Frieze <a href=\"https://www.frieze.com/article/frieze-acquires-armory-show-and-expo-chicago\">acquired</a> the Armory Show and EXPO Chicago, its parent company, Endeavor Group Holdings, sold its roster of art fairs for <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/biz/news/ari-emanuel-buys-frieze-endeavor-group-1236383561/\">$200 million</a> to Hollywood superagent Ari Emmanuel. The former Endeavor CEO envisions Frieze as a key piece of a new global events company he formed this year, and perhaps one positioned to compete with Art Basel’s dominance in the contemporary art market.</p>\n<p>But with a reported downturn in the market, galleries have been weighing their options.</p>\n<p>Once mainstays at the Armory, blue-chip institutions have instead drifted toward Frieze’s <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1011006/frieze-new-york-is-back-to-its-old-ways/\">spring fair</a>, the Art Dealers Association of America’s (ADAA) Art Show (before it was abruptly <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032202/as-adaas-art-show-changes-course-a-nonprofit-is-left-in-limbo/\">canceled</a> this year), or TEFAF New York — or they are skipping the New York fairs entirely. David Zwirner hasn’t exhibited at the Amory Show since <a href=\"https://www.davidzwirner.com/fairs/2022/the-armory-show\">2022</a>, and chose to show at ADAA several years before that. Pace Gallery’s last year at the Armory was <a href=\"https://www.pacegallery.com/artfairs/the-armory-show-4/#:~:text=At%20The%20Armory%20Show%202019%2C%20Pace%20Gallery%20will%20present%20a,of%20twelve%20LED%20panel%20artworks.\">2021</a>. Gagosian hasn’t shown at the Amory since <a href=\"https://gagosian.com/fairs-and-collecting/fairs/armory-show-new-york-2020-rudolf-polanszky/\">2020</a>, back when it was held at Piers 92 and 94. Lisson hasn’t been at the fair since <a href=\"https://www.lissongallery.com/news/lisson-gallery-at-the-armory-show-s-25th-edition\">2019</a>.</p>\n<p>Others are busy courting international buyers in Asia and the Middle East, where <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1014206/does-the-art-world-need-a-new-art-basel-fair-in-qatar/\">Art Basel Qatar</a> will launch in Doha in February 2026. It doesn’t help that Frieze is competing against itself: Its three-year-old Frieze Seoul fair overlaps with Armory next week, forcing galleries to choose.</p>\n<p>“Everybody is asking where we should be investing our energy and time and our focus,” David Norr, partner at James Cohan Gallery, told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “The cost of shipping, travel and built-in expenses in participation in these fairs continues to go up.”</p>\n<p>Others are simply skipping the season altogether. Jack Shainman stepped back from showing at New York fairs in recent years to focus on its exhibitions in Chelsea and the newly renovated <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/867108/jack-shainman-gallery-takes-over-manhattans-historic-clock-tower/\">Clock Tower building</a> in Civic Center. After wildfires <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/982535/it-looks-like-a-bomb-exploded-la-artists-grapple-with-loss-as-fires-rage/\">ravaged Los Angeles</a> in January, Night Gallery chose a gallery residency at Arsenal Contemporary instead of participating in several international art fairs.</p>\n<p>“This is both a result of the market and our ability to be in multiple places at once,” Night Gallery spokesperson Shy Watson said. “We are trying to create alternative models of exhibition, promotion, sales, and community.”</p>\n<p>The Armory is used to a relatively high degree of churn. This year, 55 galleries are participating in the fair for the first time, with another 20 returning from a hiatus, roughly in line with figures from 2024, a fair spokesperson said.</p>\n<p>But the relative lack of large commercial institutions at the show presents an opportunity for New York galleries to cultivate new collectors and promote their artists to a broader audience.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038050/new-york-art-dealers-get-candid-ahead-of-the-armory-show-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>A round of layoffs at the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) this summer is raising alarms at one of the best-known arts schools in the country as the institution grapples with rising costs.</p>\n<p>The Santa Clarita-based private arts school laid off nine administrative employees in July, including five unionized workers and four non-union workers, claiming in a schoolwide message that CalArts needed to cut expenses in the face of a projected <a href=\"https://calarts.edu/sites/default/files/2025-05/Toward%20a%20Sustainable%20Financial%20Future%20for%20CalArts.pdf\">$15 million deficit</a>.</p>\n<p>“The nine staff positions, as well as about a dozen vacant staff positions, are being eliminated as part of a necessary workforce reduction, which will enable CalArts to address a structural deficit, prioritize student-facing services, and better align our staffing with current and projected enrollments to continue providing exceptional educational opportunities to our students,” a CalArts spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>.</p>\n<p>But faculty and staff members are questioning the administration’s decision, arguing that the layoffs could harm the school’s ability to train and nurture the next generation of artists.</p>\n<p>“Everyone was disappointed in this having to happen at all when we’re working so hard to try to better serve the population,” Emily Lytle-Painter, a web and digital media producer at CalArts and union member, told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “When we were trying to go into discussions with the administration, we felt like there were other avenues.”</p>\n<p>Tensions between CalArts employees and school leadership have been simmering since last fall, when dozens of faculty and staff <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DCikoHURbCM/?hl=en\">decided to form a union</a> after enduring what they described as years of stagnant wages, increased workloads, and minimal benefits. In December, CalArts faculty <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/972509/calarts-staff-and-faculty-move-to-unionize/\">delivered a letter</a> to President Ravi Rajan announcing their intention to organize with United Auto Workers in a unit that would represent approximately 600 workers. They held elections in March and ratified the union a month later.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the school had been struggling with enrollment, which <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/institutions/specialized-colleges/2024/04/08/enrollment-declines-threaten-small-independent#:~:text=Though%20it\"s%20enrollment%20has%20also,creative%20industries%2C%E2%80%9D%20Rajan%20said.\">declined</a> by about 12 percent since the pandemic, from 1,532 students in 2019 to 1,353 students in 2023 (tuition surpassed <a href=\"https://calarts.edu/admissions-aid/tuition/tuition-and-fees/cost-attendance\">$60,000</a> per year in 2025–26). </p>\n<p>In an April 2024 interview, Rajan told <i>Inside Higher Education</i> that CalArts was “<a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/institutions/specialized-colleges/2024/04/08/enrollment-declines-threaten-small-independent#:~:text=Though%20it\"s%20enrollment%20has%20also,creative%20industries%2C%E2%80%9D%20Rajan%20said.\">fiscally sound</a>.” But the school proceeded with several budget cuts to reduce its operating costs, including tighter spending controls, hiring delays and travel limitations, and adjustments to admissions and financial aid packages. These measures, Rajan said in a schoolwide message, saved the school $5.5 million.</p>\n<p>This spring, CalArts sought to reduce its headcount and sent voluntary separation and early retirement notices to between 50 and 60 faculty and staff, union leaders estimated. But only 32 employees, including 22 faculty and 10 staff, took the school’s offer and Rajan moved ahead with layoffs despite vociferous <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DN3-oBcEmIH/?igsh=MXExOWNyY2VhY2J5Yg%3D%3D\">objections</a> from the union. </p>\n<p>“I acknowledge how painful this news is,” Rajan wrote in a July 15 letter to faculty and staff reviewed by <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “These are not just abstract positions—they are roles held by our colleagues, teammates, and friends. I’m immensely grateful for their contributions and mindful of the weight of this moment for our community.” </p>\n<p>When the school announced layoffs, union leaders bargained with the administration for three months of severance, instead of two weeks of pay per year of service; three months of COBRA insurance; and priority rehiring in any vacant positions over the next two years for anyone who was laid off.</p>\n<p>“Everyone is understandably sad and worried, and there’s a general feeling of having to move forward with what we have,” Lytle-Painter said. “I personally was really proud of our bargaining team being able to bargain for increased benefits for those affected by the layoffs. That’s part of why we have a union.”</p>\n<p>Thomas Leeb, an adjunct faculty member in the School of Music and union member, said he is approaching the next academic year that starts on September 8 with mixed emotions.</p>\n<p>“A lot of institutional knowledge has left with the voluntary separation program, and that’s sad and it hurts. At the same time, there’s a bit of optimism,” Leeb said, referencing the newly formed union. “Someone I spoke to who has been at CalArts for 25 years said this is the first time he felt protected.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038229/facing-15m-budget-deficit-calarts-lays-off-workers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Instead of asking <i>Is this flattering?</i> or <i>Does this go together?</i>, I’ve been asking <i>Do I like how this feels? Do I like how this looks? </i>I’m reaching for baggy pants, oversized button-downs, sneakers, and maxi dresses—clothes I used to avoid because they weren’t “feminine” or “put-together” enough. Now they’re exactly what I want.</p>\n    <p>I wore this on one of those in-between days where it’s hot in the sun but cool in the breeze. This sweater tee reminds me of something I wore on repeat in college. The hat and sunglasses are louder than I usually go, but I love how they shift the whole mood to <i>do not disturb; probably reading.</i></p>\n    <p>This outfit came together in five seconds and felt easy, but totally different in the best way. I threw the button-down over the dress because I saw “the kids” doing it at the last concert I attended. Now I want to wear this combo every day. It’s simple and unfussy.</p>\n    <p>I love this dress because it’s soft and swingy but structured enough to feel up for taking it out to a party. The flip flops make it casual, and the basket bag makes it feel like I could end up at a market in the South of France… or Target. Which is my reality, but I keep dreaming anyway.</p>\n    <p>This is what I wear when I want to feel cool but also like I’m in pajamas. I threw this on after a swim, added some layered necklaces, and suddenly it looked intentional.</p>\n    <p>This outfit just made me happy. I started with the pants (bows!), which felt like an outfit in their own right, and kept the top breezy and the accessories summery.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

    "body": "<p>Father’s Day is coming up on Sunday, June 15, and picking something thoughtful but cool for dads who know exactly what they like can be a bit tricky. Here’s a collection of Father’s Day gift ideas inspired by my husband—he loves well-made things, has a great eye for design, spends weekends biking or coaching baseball, and appreciates stylish clothing and accessories (think New Balance, Norse Projects, Bode) and great music (FKJ, Fred Again..).<br/>Joe provided his own thoughts on each of these items, both for my benefit and yours. Happy gift shopping! – Kate</p>\n<p>Yes, dads can carry tote bags—and if the dad in your life does, he’ll find that they are incredibly practical. The “go bag” of summer can hold the ever-evolving kids’ gear, swimsuits, groceries, and heck, even a bottle of wine for after the game if time allows. I live out of my tote in the summer.</p>\n<p>While these are not the glasses one would wear to a wedding reception, they are for the blossoming runner, hiker, or biker who understands how much more enjoyable the experience is with a nice pair of shades.</p>\n<p>It’s 2025, and I’m not saying our grandpas were wrong, but having rough palms isn’t a sign of bravery; it’s a sign that you might need to use some hand balm. It takes approximately six seconds to apply, and he’ll thank me later.</p>\n<p>My thoughts on sauce are pretty well documented, and this chili crisp will transform the most entry-level panini or protein into a flavor-packed experience. Heck, I put it on steamed broccoli.</p>\n<p>Our kids give me grief as they claim I have music on 90% of waking hours, and they’re not wrong. I like to play a wide array of “chunes” to help up the energy on a sleepy morning or get us pumped up before heading to the ball fields. And with a simple carabiner, this will easily clip onto Dad’s golf bag.</p>\n<p>A hat that doesn’t have a major league baseball team or local baseball association logo on it, that his partner actually thinks is cool and might borrow from him? It does exist. The seersucker material breathes and is perfect for summer.</p>\n<p>The ultimate “dad” shoe. Nothing screams I’m up at six for the soccer game quite like a gray on gray on gray New Balance 998. I recently procured my first pair of New Balance, and can attest that they are the most comfortable sneakers I’ve ever worn.</p>\n<p>I love a statement shirt that breaks out of my reliable navy, forest green, and gray color palette.  This piece of wearable art is beautiful and reminds me of something my grandmother made me when I was a child. I love <a href=\"https://bode.com/collections/mens-one-of-a-kind/products/island-sunrise-shirt-s-m\">this style</a> too.</p>\n<p>If the kids are now old enough to go on bike rides that can take the family outside of the neighborhood and to area ice cream shops, breweries, and restaurants, one thing Dad will need is a bike lock to ensure the trusty steeds are there after the meal.</p>\n<p>J. Crew makes a fantastic pair of swim trunks. In addition to my versatile solid color Patagonia baggies, the trunks here offer some fun patterns that fit well and can handle the lake, the pool, or the splash pad.</p>\n<p>Co-managing the family calendar is not for the faint of heart—I’ve found that writing things down can reduce the “oh sh*% soccer is at 5 pm?!” drills. In addition, sometimes our kids will write motivational messages on my rad dad notepad that help me through the slog of days filled with Zoom calls.</p>\n<p>Kate gave me a lot of grief when she discovered this product on my wish list, but she’s also the catalyst behind my newfound interest in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/03/skincare-products-routine/\">skin care</a>. Can you simply fill a large bowl with water and ice cubes? You sure can, but this tub has a breathing tube so you can snorkel for literal minutes without coming up for air. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/06/best-fathers-day-gift-ideas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>I love having a closed-concept home.<strong>To me, a closed-concept home means that (in most cases) there isn’t a direct view from one main living space to the next. </strong>Rooms are separated by either a wall, a door, or an archway. In our home, while there is a view from the entryway to the sitting room to the dining room, most of our main living areas are separate from the others.</p>\n    <p>A girlfriend recently reminded me what happened the first time I had her over for dinner. I let the dogs in the back door, covered in mud, and a mess quickly ensued. I closed the doors between the kitchen and the rest of the house to contain the mess, cleaned everything up, and then got back to the party pretty quickly. It was something I’d become so used to, I didn’t think twice about it! It wasn’t until she brought it up that I realized how useful the layout is for our family’s lifestyle. <br/>When we have people over, it’s also easier to do last-minute cleaning and to maintain a general sense of order since things don’t spread out from room to room as much.</p>\n    <p>Now that the kids are getting a little older, we can let them play independently more often, and Joe and I can have alone time in separate spaces. Having the rooms divided up helps facilitate this, and I treasure the alone time I can get in an otherwise busy life.<br/>It should be noted that we do live in a bigger house <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2020/04/were-moving-a-goodbye-to-the-house-that-built-our-family-of-5/\">than we did before</a>. This means there’s naturally more space to spend time separately. However, we tend to use about half of the house most frequently when it’s just our immediate family, so the closed-concept floor plan definitely still helps provide some separation. </p>\n    <p>When you are designing within an open-concept floor plan, you’re first and foremost building the design around a cohesive scheme. It takes a bit of skill to figure out how to do that. With our closed-concept spaces, it’s felt like each room can have its own personality.<br/>While I’ll consider the overall color palette of the home when I’m designing any given room, I don’t feel a need to be too closely tied to it. This made the process of experimenting with rooms in our main living areas especially fun. You can see the individual personality of different spaces in rooms like the <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/02/blue-room-design/\">blue library/office</a> and the <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/09/one-year-later-its-finally-here-the-design-reveal-of-our-family-room/\">green family room</a>.</p>\n    <p>I know from experience that when you have a big great room with a TV, it’s easier to get set in your routines. When it comes to downtime, this often includes the TV. In this home, with separate spaces without a TV, we’re drawn to do different activities. The kids will read when I’m working in the office, we’ll play games in the living room, and we’ll do crafts at the kitchen island.</p>\n    <p>Kate is the founder of Wit &amp; Delight.

    "body": "<p>I see such a deep connection between our interior lives and the way physical movement creates space—not just physically, but emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. Movement has been the foundation of my healing journey, and while my body may look different than it did a few years ago, it’s just a small reflection of the deep transformation I’ve experienced. When we move with intention, with presence, we start to feel what it’s like to really live in ourselves. To fully occupy who we are. <br/>That’s why I wanted to sit down with Berit Ahlgren, the founder of <a href=\"https://www.spacesunna.com/\">Sunna</a>. She’s created something that’s more than a movement class. It’s a kind of invitation. A gentle but powerful reminder that healing doesn’t have to be performative, and that we can return to ourselves at any time. I wanted to ask her how it all came to be, what keeps her going, and what she’s dreaming about next.<strong>Twin Cities locals,  check out Sunna at 514 2nd Street SE in Minneapolis! </strong>New clients can claim a </p>\n<p>Berit:<strong> </strong>This is such a beautiful, poignant question—thank you for asking. I grew up in dance and made a life and career out of it. Since opening <a href=\"https://www.spacesunna.com/\">Sunna</a>, my involvement with dance has massively slowed, but will never cease to exist. Dance has brought me joy, freedom, playfulness, and presence, as well as a powerful way to process sadness and pain. But “exercise” has always felt like a “should”—to negate what I ate and drank, to strive to look a certain way, to do what I read, heard, or saw was the right, trendy, or healthy thing every woman should be doing. I’ve had to learn to reframe my daily activity as something that helps me feel like me, an important part of how I developed who I am over four decades, a part of my day that leaves me feeling complete.<br/>I’ve learned to see movement, dance, or otherwise, as a means to find gratitude in my strength and acknowledge a privilege not everyone has. Knowing that movement brings endorphins and keeps my body healthy is a mindset I’ve adapted as I look in the mirror and witness a naturally aging body. But mentally, there is still something there that feels shame or guilt when I don’t prioritize a portion of my day to move my body. I’m still sorting this out and admit that there are layers of expectation that are likely unhealthy.<br/>Like you, I’m learning to listen more to physical feeling and not mental expectation, and perhaps because this has been a newfound understanding for me, it has shown up as a guiding force for Sunna as well. I encourage students to note their energetic, physical, and emotional selves to make a smart decision about what kind of class to partake in on any given day—feel what they really need, not just what expectations tell them. Within classes, too, I constantly remind people to tune into their feelings. What I’m offering as an instructor is a suggestion, but their agency to intensify or pare down the level of the class based on their feelings is a skill and strength to practice—one that doesn’t always come naturally in how our culture has guided us to associate with our bodies.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/05/sunna-minneapolis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>After four months <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/01/why-i-quit-drinking-alcohol/\">alcohol-free</a>, I started my “soberish” chapter in early March. It began as unceremoniously as it ended—no dramatic moment, just a quiet shift. Since then, it’s been going well: a drink or two a week. <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/08/casual-dinner-party/\">Dinner parties</a> now wrap up with one glass of wine, a feat I never thought possible.</p>\n    <p>What’s made this shift feel manageable is knowing <i>why</i> I want a drink when I do—and finding something else that gives me exactly what I was looking for. That part surprised me. Because I’ve realized, not drinking is actually easier than only <i>sometimes</i> drinking. Gray areas are squishy. And what I’ve learned in the squish is this: What I want when I crave a drink usually isn’t alcohol. It’s a moment to unwind. To relax. To savor something lovingly prepared.<br/>Now, my favorite nonalcoholic drinks are staples in my house. I reach for them more often than wine. Going dry for four months taught me that the desire to drink was almost always a desire to treat myself, soften the day, and feel a little bit held. And it turns out, I can do all of that—without alcohol.</p>\n    <p>If you are craving a cocktail, this is the best alternative I’ve found out there! I drank these through holiday parties and didn’t miss my beloved martinis once I found them.</p>\n    <p>Oh, my other beloved drink! I love all flavors of Ghia, but my favorites are the <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16781118\">Sumac &amp; Chili</a> and <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16781104\">Lime &amp; Salt</a>.</p>\n    <p>My friend Peder co-founded this NA brand, and it’s a gorgeous bottle worthy of dinner parties or special occasions. The main ingredient is pine tea (made from local white pine)—it’s spunky, fresh, and perfect in warm weather.</p>\n    <p>A genuinely delicious beer. I like the <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16782425\">Upside Dawn Golden</a> and <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16782439\">Free Wave Hazy IPA</a>. </p>\n    <p>I recently tried a sampler pack of these Minneapolis NA craft beers and would highly recommend it for hosting a party. There is something for everyone!</p>\n    <p>This is a solid light and fresh beer that is sold pretty much everywhere these days. It’s great with food and on a hot summer day.</p>\n    <p>I drink these when I crave sparkling water; they’re so good! I’m not big on sweet drinks, so this earthy, fizzy drink is a real thirst quencher. It also feels special, which is really what I’m looking for when I want a drink. Something that feels like a treat, a little break in the day-to-day.</p>\n    <p>This is the drink I mix up for friends and family who aren’t into beer. It’s also what I make for myself when I want a drink after a long day and an NA beer just isn’t calling to me. I usually have all the ingredients on hand. Simply fill a glass with ice and soda water, add a dash or two of bitters, and squeeze in fresh lime juice to taste.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

    "body": "<p>I’ve shared my desire to <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/11/gift-giving-ideas/\">be a better gift giver</a> over the years, and let me tell you, it’s an ongoing process. Mother’s Day is on Sunday, May 11, and I’ve found that 90% of being a better gift giver is planning well ahead of time. So today I’m reminding you to get those gifts squared away, and offering my personal favorite Mother’s Day gift ideas (including a few that don’t cost a thing).<br/>If you want to get extra personal, ask mom for her own wish list—or ask her best friend to spill the details on what products she’s been talking about lately. You can never go wrong with a personalized gift picked just for her.</p>\n<p>I have a note from Bennett’s preschool teacher I’ve been meaning to frame for five years now! Framing can feel like a chore because of all the decisions that have to be made, from selecting what to frame to figuring out the best way to display it.<br/>Framebridge is my favorite place for creative inspiration, and they can frame just about anything. One way to hit it out of the park with any mom is to frame a memento she’s saved and cherishes but hasn’t done anything with yet.</p>\n<p>I don’t know one mother who isn’t thinking about environmental health these days. Give the gift of safe cookware, especially if mom has a particular pot or pan she’s been wanting to replace. It’s an upgrade she’ll appreciate.</p>\n<p>Putting a Lunya silk sleep mask on signals “off duty” mode. I have one of these masks, and I immediately exhale once it hits my eyes. It’s a hit with Joe too—we often have to trade off who gets to wear it at night.</p>\n<p>Book a sitter (or be the sitter yourself) and block off a day on her calendar to do whatever she wants, wherever she wants. Feel like a hero.</p>\n<p>As my kids get older, I associate their uniqueness with what lights them up. A bracelet with icons and symbols that represent the whole family would be a really special way to celebrate the family you’ve created together. Etsy has a ton of create-your-own options.</p>\n<p>These are such great, high-quality tees—the perfect basic clothing item. They’re structured enough to hold their shape over time but still feel perfectly relaxed. If the mom you are buying for is practical and discerning, Kule will be a hit.</p>\n<p>When I was at Esalen last month, I tried an amazing body oil I can’t stop thinking about. I would rarely treat myself to it, but it would make such a luxurious gift.</p>\n<p>I love the idea of a creative gift that kids and dad can make together. One idea: Have each kid make a portrait of mom to display when she wakes up. Another: Write little messages to mom on colorful paper, roll them into little scrolls, and place them in <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16243285\">a hand-painted wooden chest</a>. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16243974\">Indoor plants</a> are a great gift for anyone who loves to exercise their green thumb. If she loves to garden, get her <a href=\"https://www.greatgardenplants.com/collections/perennials?\">a perennial plant</a>. Even better, make it a ritual that grows over time, each year adding something new to the garden. Don’t be shy in asking her what plants she loves the most. </p>\n<p>Removing some of her mental load is an amazing gift to give mom. I have the Hearth Display—it’s an incredible way to keep track of everything our family has going on, all in one place. If you get a gift like this, be sure to own the initial set-up process too, so it’s not one more thing that has to be on mom’s plate!</p>\n<p>Any luxurious upgrade to an everyday staple will be a winner. Cashmere socks are the ultimate little luxury. You can find a wide range of pricing, from <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16139221\">Comme Si</a> (with amazing colors) to <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16139632\">J.Crew</a>, which has pretty good sale prices on their cashmere-blend socks. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/04/best-mothers-day-gift-ideas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>By  MB Valente</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>I leave you this message the only way I can, given my capacities and language so different from yours. We’ve known each other all of my life, which has been long for me, but short for you, so that sometimes I am sure you see me as a child—your child. But your child was born hungry, unpardonably carnivorous, already dreaming of blood as I drank my mother’s milk and you stroked her head, calling her sweet names. She was your daughter, too.</p>\n<p>So many misunderstandings have accumulated over our months together. How can I be sure this letter will mean anything to you? I started subtly, writing in the language of scents, rubbing my goodbyes into the furniture with chin, cheek, and hips, until I remembered how poor is your reading of smell. And so I turned my whole body into a letter and took to lingering in places suggestive of departure—stairways, scuffed thresholds of doors. Did the silk of my belly, spread over the doormat, communicate anything to you, besides a desire to touch?</p>\n<p>I had hoped not to resort to organs, to the signs your ancients read in offal. But having tried every means less distasteful to you, I find myself forced to write with the ringing clarity of fresh violence. (Remember, I was born with the taste of blood in my mouth.) So I arrange tiny hearts and intestines, birds’ livers and the butterflied lungs of mice, all to compose this message, which I still cannot be sure you will read. I feel generous for having tried, at least, since you never once tried to understand me. You prefer to clutch me close, bind me to your breast, and squeeze self-indulgent tears from your eyes. What you need is a pillow—a dumb, animal comforter—and so you see me as all fur, all exterior, no center.</p>\n<p>You’ve never felt the fragile flame of a life snuffed out between your teeth, and so you refuse to see life as something fragile. When you were younger, you used to tug on life’s thread to see if it would unravel—it’s written in white hatching down your forearms. The thing you almost touched then terrifies you now. So you swallow your fear, you fold it closed. You go to work, you eat your bloodless mush, you spend two nights a week with a man who doesn’t know you. You curl yourself around your phone and type things like “Sure” and “Ok see you.” His replies are ten lines long and bristle with question marks. You absorb their meaning without reading the words. He wants more. He needs to know you better. You write, “Sure.” I could tell him not to bother, if he would only read me.</p>\n<p>Then came the day he rang your doorbell without warning. He had things to say, grievances to air. You are selfish. You bring him down. Instead of shedding warmth, you leave him cold. You think you know what he means by this, but I am not convinced that you grasp it any better than you do the semantic subtleties in an arrangement of rabbit entrails. His main point got through, at least. I read it, too—in the smell of singed pride on his jacket, the abandoned-suckling reek of his breath. And you, you nodded and said you understood. You watched him walk away; you shut the door behind him, when you should have clawed his eyes out, kicked his stomach until it opened. You could at least have scratched. I tried to tell you that, remember? I was by the table leg with my back worked into blades, sinking my claws into the wood.</p>\n<p>Ever since, you’ve been something uglier than human, softer than flesh. You go to work, you come home, you live swaddled in sweaters, you disappear into the wool. Your hands reach for threads to tug but can’t find them. You, who are full-grown and healthy with no offspring to nurse—none but me, cursed and yellow-eyed—you could be rampaging free, tearing what you need from the world. Instead,you go to work, you come home, you close your eyes until the feelings go away.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://flashfictionmagazine.com/blog/2025/08/28/a-farewell-letter-translated-from-the-felinese/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He refused to leave behind a situation which needed cleaning up. That meant not hanging himself, not slitting his wrists, and definitely not shooting himself. Sleeping pills were the obvious choice, but Richard’s brother had died of an overdose, and he just couldn’t bring himself to go in a related fashion.</p>\n<p>Which was why, today, he’d decided on carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>\n<p>It’ll be painless, he told himself, flicking the light switch in the garage. Like falling asleep. He got into his ancient Nissan and turned the key for what he planned to be the last time. He hadn’t bothered to write a note; there was nobody to address it to. Breathing his vehicle’s exhaust, he took in his final surroundings. A dim, cluttered room. Stuff in boxes. Stuff in bags. Two fold-up chairs, a lawnmower, a spattering of camping gear, a neglected set of weights. The detritus of a life that filled Richard with dread each time he remembered having lived it.</p>\n<p>He smiled to himself. (Who else would he be smiling for?) How unspectacular, to go out like this. Alone, in an old car he’d never liked, encircled by crap. How fitting. How perfectly Richard.</p>\n<p>The tang of gas riled his nerves. It occurred to him: what if this didn’t work? What if he only succeeded in becoming mush for someone to take care of?</p>\n<p>Detecting a headache—a sign the fumes were working—he turned on the radio. He was encouraged to find himself hallucinating when the radio referred to him by name.</p>\n<p>“Hello? Richard?” An elderly woman’s voice crackled through the car’s antiquated sound-system. “I’m looking for Richard.”</p>\n<p>“This is him,” Richard answered out of habit, immediately feeling ridiculous about it.</p>\n<p>“I have bad news, Richard. You can’t die today.”</p>\n<p>Choosing not to engage with the sputters of his dying brain, Richard didn’t reply.</p>\n<p>“You’re straying from the authorized flow of events,” said the scratchy voice. “Normally I’d allow a deviation, but with the holidays…” A sigh through the speakers; a gust of static. “Richard, we’re simply overcrowded. You think the population crisis is bad on this material plane, where people only exist for the blink of an eye? Imagine eternity. So I’m sorry, I can’t make any exceptions—you’ll have to wait until your time, young man.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not young.”</p>\n<p>“You’re alive. That’s young.”</p>\n<p>Richard shifted in the driver’s seat, unable to get comfortable. A numbness spread through him—a hollow feeling, like hunger cramps. He couldn’t piece together the logic behind what his car was telling him, but he supposed he shouldn’t expect a talking car to make sense. All a dream, anyway.</p>\n<p>Falling asleep, painless…</p>\n<p>“This isn’t a dream,” said the car radio, the old woman, the hallucination. “Snap out of it, sad guy.”</p>\n<p>“Who are you, the grim reaper?”</p>\n<p>“That’s one thing people call me. Listen, you’ll wake up from this. You just have to decide whether massive brain damage sounds appealing.”</p>\n<p>“Because I’m not meant to kill myself?”</p>\n<p>“Very few people are meant to kill themselves. And wouldn’t you know it, the few who are meant to, those are the ones who never get around to it. Anyway, you’re not one of those few.”</p>\n<p>“Go away, Death.” He considered his words, and quickly added, “Just take me with you.”</p>\n<p>“What if I said you had a child you didn’t know about?”</p>\n<p>“I’d say you’re lying.” During those rare periods in Richard’s life when he’d been sexually active, he’d also been obsessively careful. “It’s no use. I don’t care anymore. I just don’t care.”</p>\n<p>“If that were true, you wouldn’t mind making a mess on your way out. You’d just shoot yourself and be done with it, Dick. Is it fine if I call you Dick?”</p>\n<p>Richard sensed, far away, a note of anger inside him. “If you stop me, I’m just going to try again. If not today, tomorrow.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/dick-tries-to-die-jake-stein/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>When I was nine, my dad warned me about the dangers of dreaming.</p>\n<p>“You know, it’s like if you drink too much water, it shuts down the electrical connections and you just keel on over,” he’d said in his woodchip voice as we sat at the kitchen table.</p>\n<p>“Your body forgets how to breathe. Same with dreaming—you get too high in them dreams, there ain’t enough oxygen.”</p>\n<p>I had made the mistake of telling him I wanted to be an explorer that day, after Mrs. Hastings showed us a National Geographic article about the Galapagos Islands. I was too young to know about brain synapses and what electricity had to do with any of it so I’d just nodded. My father had cupped my cheeks in his dry, cracked hands, and left to tend the chickens.</p>\n<p>I didn’t blame him. He’d wanted to be a mechanic as a young boy. But his mom got sick, bills came due, and his dreams lost the oxygen needed to keep on. Perhaps the electricity too.</p>\n<p>Maybe that was why he’d never been able to see the valley of dreams.</p>\n<p>I lay in that valley now, amused by the flowing and frolicking nature of these benign aberrations.</p>\n<p>I’d known it forever, this expanse of long, swaying grass, sprawling for miles until being taken in by the Catskills. It was a sight to behold—nature as it was designed, free from humans save for the touch of a barn and a withering fence in the distance.</p>\n<p>The barn was of course not a barn at all, but a home. It was where I had grown up, except for a short stint at Binghamton University. It was my parent’s farm, but its day to day operations were mine now.</p>\n<p>I could see the dreams drifting along the valley–gusts of green and squalls of scarlet scheming to take me away. If only for just a short while.</p>\n<p>It’s possible I’m crazy. I’ve considered this before.</p>\n<p>I did bring an old girlfriend once—had her sit under the gnarled weeping beech tree with me. But Madeline did not see the colorful clouds that meandered around me with scenes of game-winning shots and yuletide festivities—she saw nothing but a normal field. A beautiful field she had assured me, but nothing strange.</p>\n<p>I had thought she might see her dreams, and I can never be sure she didn’t I suppose, but, like my father, her eyes didn’t seem to light up like you would imagine when witnessing your desires as figments and flashes floating in the air. If she did see anything, she never told me, and then we broke up, and she never told me anything after that.</p>\n<p>But unlike Madeline, I saw the dreams and the dreams seemed to see me.</p>\n<p>Now I was thirty-eight, still single, and I knew the rhythm of a day. It was Wednesday, which meant by sunrise I’d completed all farm tasks in need of my attention.</p>\n<p>Free for a spell, I’d come to the valley where dreams wandered.</p>\n<p>With the wind mellow and lazy, it allowed the dreams that drifted my way to linger, letting me settle into them before they moved on to wherever else they had to be.</p>\n<p>I saw a particularly large one drifting—a cloud the color of an ocean sunset. Pink and puffy, and gliding down a draft of air like a child on a waterslide. It slid along before engulfing me in its mist.</p>\n<p>This was a road-not-traveled dream. Well, they all were really. I witnessed a scene of myself and Ella Feldman, sitting on a couch, watching TV together. It looked vaguely like my parent’s house but with slight alterations—many horse statues abound and lace curtains. This was of course because when I had had a crush on Ella, back in third grade, she had a major obsession with horses. She probably still did, but I wouldn’t know because we had drifted apart freshman year of high school. She’d stuck around the area, but she was married now and had two children.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/where-dreams-wandered-andrew-m-jaromin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In New Zealand, there’s a candy assortment of gangs. Most often, they ride on motorcycles, deal in narcotics, prostitution, illegal guns and fear. Recruitment’s booming as New Zealand’s underpaid police scarper to Australia, and dysfunctional kids clamber up the criminal career ladder.</p>\n<p>As a court bailiff, John Brady thought he’d seen them all: Mongrel Mob, Head Hunters, Tribesmen, Killer Beez, Black Power, you name it. But these days there was a new gang hitting the courts with increasing regularity: Grey Power.</p>\n<p>Today, he was in charge of Edith Smith, aged eighty-five. She was on so much medication it was hard to keep track of; pills for rheumatoid arthritis, underactive thyroid, high blood pressure, fluid retention, probiotics, magnesium (“keeps your stools soft”), and so much more. It takes her an age to swallow them all. She has to use a walker to get into court and John helps her to the dock.</p>\n<p>“You’re a good boy, John,” she says, looking at him with rheumy eyes. She reminds John of his grandma. Yet this little ol’ lady is apparently in charge of the most notorious gang in the country.</p>\n<p>“You’ll be right, Edith,” he says and gives her a small smile.</p>\n<p>“All rise for His Honourable Judge Adams.”</p>\n<p>“Edith, you’re meant to stand,” whispers John.</p>\n<p>“Stand? I’ve only just sat down. Bugger that.”</p>\n<p>“Court is in session, Crown versus Edith Smith.”</p>\n<p>It’s a first appearance, and Edith is facing a raft of charges. The prosecution alleges that Edith is the mastermind behind some of the most infamous crimes reported in New Zealand. The “headless chicken” where a known paedophile was mangled by a pensioner’s mobility scooter. The “rolled-over-Rowan”, a repeat rapist out on a technicality who met his demise under a pensioner’s Rolls Royce. And the “upsa-Daisy” where a woman who had scammed millions out of the elderly was found dead, floating upside down in a pensioner’s duck pond. In each case, the pensioners involved claimed, “It was an accident”, “I didn’t have my glasses on”, “My hearing aids weren’t plugged in” or “I’ve got dementia, dear” and all were let off the hook.</p>\n<p>Edith lets out a little chuckle as each one is mentioned. “OOhh, that was a good one,” she says at the upsa-Daisy. “I remember that one.”</p>\n<p>John sighs. This is not boding well.</p>\n<p>“Does the defendant have counsel?” asks the Judge.</p>\n<p>“Edith, he’s speaking to you,” whispers John.</p>\n<p>“What?! Speak up, young man.”</p>\n<p>The Judge shouts across the courtroom, “I SAID, DO YOU HAVE COUNSEL?”</p>\n<p>“No need to yell. I’m not deaf. You just need to enunciate your words better.”</p>\n<p>John had never seen Judge Adams do an eye roll before today.</p>\n<p>“Your Honour, we understand Ms Smith has declined counsel,” says the prosecution trying to be helpful.</p>\n<p>“Ms Smith, is that true?”</p>\n<p>“Well, if you’re talking about that pimple-faced boy, fresh out of law school, I thought I might do a better job myself.”</p>\n<p>“Ms Smith, these are serious charges you’re facing, and the prosecution has already indicated they’re opposed to bail. It’s in your best interests to have counsel represent you.”</p>\n<p>“As I’ve said all along, I’ve done nothing wrong. All I do is operate a Garden Club for like-minded pensioners. We like to do a bit of collective weeding.”</p>\n<p>“Your Honour, I must interject. A search of Ms Smith’s home produced copious evidence pointing to the Garden Club being a front for illegal activities where Ms Smith and her associates seem to have taken it upon themselves to mete out their own form of justice.”</p>\n<p>“Like I said, we do a spot of weeding.”</p>\n<p>“Ms Smith, I’m going to take a half-hour break. During that time I urge you to instruct counsel. Court’s adjourned.” The Judge slams down his gavel, a tad too enthusiastically.</p>\n<p>“A bit tetchy, isn’t he, John?” says Edith.</p>\n<p>“Edith, let me help you find a lawyer.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t you worry, pet. It’ll be all right. Anyone would think our Garden Club was doing something wrong with all the fuss.”</p>\n<p>John couldn’t believe what he was hearing.</p>\n<p>“Edith, it is wrong. You can’t…”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/grey-power-anne-wilkins/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>After our boss quit the senior executives replaced him with a coffee machine. They said that the consultant had delivered his report and that the replacement was appropriate and cost effective.</p>\n    <p>Each morning we gathered around the shiny appliance and said good morning. We even gave it a name which someone printed out from the label maker and pressed tenderly against the metal: “Sean.”</p>\n    <p>We poured in the beans lovingly and caressed the button and smiled as Sean internally alchemized them into the fragrant liquor that poured lusciously from the vents. Motivation improved. Team morale was at an all-time high.</p>\n    <p>Sean brought the team together in ways that we hadn’t experienced before. In those soft moments just before he ground the beans sometimes someone would be compelled to share something from deep within their private self.</p>\n    <p>“I don’t think I love my second child.” Said Linda, who usually only spoke about payroll.</p>\n    <p>“I think my erectile dysfunction is somehow linked to being jealous of my wife.” Said Brad, from IT, who usually never responded to people’s emails.</p>\n    <p>At the end of financial year staff evaluation survey we all gave Sean the highest appraisal. He was an irreplaceable part of the office – able to inspire us to the highest level of performance, help us realize our potential and foster consistent outputs.</p>\n    <p>We kept gathering around him every morning, collaborating and ideating freely.</p>\n    <p>Someone even worked out how to put little electronic inspirational messages on his display:</p>\n    <p>“Be the change you want to see in the office.”</p>\n    <p>“Your attitude is determined by your altitude.”</p>\n    <p>But after a while one of the executives grew suspicious of Sean and felt he was going outside his scope. The executive decided to put him back in his place and one sad morning we arrived to find Sean had been redeployed to the building manager’s office.</p>\n    <p>We were bereft and aimless for a time, until the boss told us a new addition would be arriving soon to bring the team culture back to an optimum level. He said he had recently read a book about how to foster collegiality for productivity and was keen to implement his learnings.</p>\n    <p>Then she arrived – shiny and new looking like a picture of perfection. She was a sparkling new toasted sandwich maker. Her name was Sharon.</p>\n    <p>As we pressed her lever down gently, the ripples of satisfaction were palpable through the team. Morale was having an uptick. Sitting around eating the toasted sandwiches, we all basked in the sensation of a hug from a mother that we never had.</p>\n    <p>We were sluggish with carbs, too contented to complain about anything, so after nodding to each other cordially we went methodically back to our tasks.</p>\n    <p><strong>Fiona Murray</strong> <i>is a writer and social worker living in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney.</i></p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/everydayfiction\">If you want to keep EDF around, Patreon is the answer.</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/irreplaceable-fiona-murray/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Jacob, a TV journalist for a regional station, was setting up the shot with Tommy, his cameraman, when Eris first approached him.</p>\n<p>“I saw what happened,” she said.</p>\n<p>“You saw the trampoline take off?” Jacob asked, giving her a quick look over as he did so, seeing if she was sufficiently telegenic for his report.</p>\n<p>“Yes, the whole thing. It was awful.”</p>\n<p>Jacob weighed her up. Local accent, but clear voice. Clean, well-dressed, nice features, not emotionally constipated. She would do.</p>\n<p>So Eris made her television debut in Jacob’s report from the scene of the fair, where unexpectedly high winds had whipped an unsecured trampoline and its four juvenile occupants momentarily aloft. No major injuries unfortunately, so not reaching the tragedy level that would make the national news and so boost his profile, but better than nothing.</p>\n<p>Two weeks later, arriving at the scene of a fire at a hospital two towns away, Jacob recognized Eris in the bystanders.</p>\n<p>“I had an appointment at the eye clinic,” she explained. “I’d just arrived when the fire broke out.”</p>\n<p>Remembering how well she’d come across in his previous report, Jacob decided to use her again. As before, she was a good witness, emotive and descriptive.</p>\n<p>Jacob thought little of this coincidence until three weeks later, when he attended the motorway pile-up. He’d arrived a bit late on the scene and was setting up a favorable angle with his cameraman when he saw one of the national broadcasters interviewing Eris.</p>\n<p>He listened in and heard her state, “Yes, I was driving along on the way to meet an old school chum when the tanker veered right across the road. I managed to brake in time but…”</p>\n<p>All through the rest of the summer, Jacob would arrive at every significant tragedy or accident, murder scene or disturbance and Eris would already be there. Even when he wasn’t working, he would see her being interviewed on his TV screen. She was never directly involved or affected, but always close enough to witness. It turned out she was even a neighbor of the “Sofa Strangler,” the serial killer who was caught that summer. “He seemed like a nice man,” she opined.</p>\n<p>Other journalists noticed her regular appearances on their screens. There was initially some suspicion that she was actively involved in these diverse tragedies, but a cursory glance at the facts showed the impossibility of this. It simply was all just a rather unlikely coincidence.</p>\n<p>Word got around locally however and it was the town’s Mayor who first approached Eris, gifting her tickets to a theatre performance at the other side of town while his inauguration was taking place in the Town Hall. It was an astute move, as it turned out, as a hostage crisis broke out at the theatre just as Eris arrived. She was subsequently interviewed about it on live TV.</p>\n<p>Local companies started approaching Eris with offers of free products if she would only stay away from their stores and offices. One less scrupulous businessman offered her money to attend the premises of his business rival and as Eris approached, the building was levelled by an engine that fell off a passing jet airplane.</p>\n<p>Despite these unique earning opportunities, fame wasn’t kind to Eris. She now had the reputation as a jinx and was consequently shunned by all and sundry. She was unwelcome at any of the local shops, while people actively crossed to the opposite side of the street when they saw her coming. Friends deserted her and even her family would only talk to her by phone.</p>\n<p>Jacob didn’t really believe that there was anything special about Eris. She didn’t have psychic powers, she wasn’t cursed. She was just unlucky, a statistical outlier, the victim of a series of coincidences, unlikely but not impossible. He knew though, that the public believed otherwise and ever alert to an opportunity to advance his career, he arranged to interview her in her home.</p>\n<p>Eris, isolated and alone, jumped at the chance to both see a familiar face and explain herself to the public, to let them see she was just a normal person.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/the-jinx-bill-cox/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

This is the United States, after all, not some backwater. Of course, there has to be a catch, a dumb \"age cutoff.\"</p>\n<p>\"Just my luck,\" I say. \"A thing like this comes along and I'm too old to take advantage. Story of my life.\"</p>\n<p>\"How old, exactly, are you?\" Parker asks.</p>\n<p>\"Thirty-two in February.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh.\"</p>\n<p>\"I know I don't look it,\" I say, sweeping back my shoulder-length jet-black hair so he can get a good look at me. \"What's the age cutoff?\"</p>\n<p>\"To tell you the truth,\" Parker says, waving me closer, looking around conspiratorially, and I bang my knee good scooting my chair in closer to his desk. \"I can bypass the cutoff, no problem.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, now we're getting somewhere,\" I say. \"That's more like it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Of course, it'll be extra.\"</p>\n<p>I pay him the \"extra\" in a coffee shop a block away. Then ask, \"Just for my own personal edification, what</p>\n<p><i>is</i>the age cutoff?\"</p>\n<p>\"Twelve.\"</p>\n<p>\"Jesus. And you don't think bypassing protocol won't raise a few eyebrows?

That's what matters.\"</p>\n<p>Even with a sweet deal like being able to trade your mom in, things take time. First, the system's got to get to know my mom in order to match me with a model. Parker says \"model\" is a non-demeaning term for what they are. \"But human, yes?\" I ask.</p>\n<p>\"Better,\" Parker says.</p>\n<p>\"There's better than human?\"</p>\n<p>He assures me there is, though I'm skeptical. But she wouldn't need to exactly set the world on fire to be better than the mom I've already got. So, I figure I'll roll the dice.</p>\n<p>The first phase of the thing, of the system getting to know my mom so it can replace her, is me wearing special glasses that record what she does, both audio and visual. I also have to wear a heartrate sensor which tracks my stress levels when I'm around her. This way the system, Parker told me over lattes, gets to know my particular \"mommy triggers.\"</p>\n<p>\"Your eyes bad or something?\" Ma asks me in the kitchen.</p>\n<p>\"No, I just wear 'em for the look of the thing,\" I say.</p>\n<p>\"A comedian.

Image generated with OpenAI If there is still one hellish, truly accursed thing in our time, it is our artistic dallying with forms, instead of being like victims burnt at the stake, signaling through the flames. - Antonin Artaud, The Theater and Its Double I met Phil the summer before my senior year in high school, in my friend Sadie's new kitchen. Sadie, who was a year older than me, had registered for arts classes at a local community college and rented a dilapidated house on Craigie Street. The house was in Somerville, aka Slumerville, the wayward sister of relatively uptight Cambridge where we had both had grown up. I was still living with my parents, performing comedies of manners with my mom, whereas Sadie's apartment was a stage set for gritty drama. The refrigerator was a violent shade of mustard, and the cabinets seemed crafted from varnished cardboard. Rusty linoleum covered not only the floor but the lower half of one wall; either a whimsical design choice or a clumsy attempt to hide a body. \"Tell me about your roommates,\" I said, sipping the beer she handed me. My friend was maternal and organized - like her mom, who owned a bar before she died - and she'd already filled the apartment with lost boys from her college theater department. \"Mark, Matt, and Phil.\" Sadie tilted her beer bottle at me. \"You might like Phil.\" \"Say more.\" \"He's funny. Mysterious. Large vocabulary.\" \"So he can help me with the SATs?\" \"He's a writer, actually.\" Sadie knew I'd been looking for a guy who could combine romance with intellectual stimulation. \"I'll show you his room.\" The tour was perplexing. I liked Phil's vintage record player, and the red plastic milk crates that sheltered a generous vinyl collection. I was neutral about the Union Jack - I'd never dated a punk. I was dismayed, however, by the naked dolls arrayed in one corner; at least a dozen, at various stages of dismemberment, ranging in size from a healthy toddler to a twelve-week-old fetus. One intact plastic body hung diagonally from a noose, all four limbs reaching forward. One pink-cheeked head was mounted high on a broomstick, empty holes punched in a grid where hair had been. They reminded me of trashy horror films, or those posters that pro-life protesters shove in your face. \"Did you speak to his parole officer?\" I asked. Sadie barked, a smoker's cough. \"That's for a theater class,\" she said. \"It's both repulsive and cliché,\" I said, heading back to the kitchen. Phil made his grand entrance about an hour later, holding a bicycle helmet like Hamlet with Yorick's skull. He didn't look like a guy who would decapitate dolls. He looked more like an androgynous pop star; slightly underfed, with floppy, sun-streaked hair. The neck of his white T-shirt was stretched out, and his Army-Navy satchel looked heavy. His eyes seemed to lack a layer of essential protection. \"Sadie,\" he said, somewhat breathless. \"Phil,\" Sadie said, handing him a beer. \"This is Gretchen.\" He drank like he was thirsty. \"Your bedroom decor is interesting,\" I said. \"Tell me more,\" Phil said. He followed me upstairs, probably anticipating my second move. He lay on his bed while I harangued him. \"If it's going to be violent, it has to be creative,\" I said. \"It's offensive because it's banal. What's the point?\" Phil propped himself on one elbow, grinning. \" Theatre of Cruelty ?

Regardless, he was the only one left from that generation. The others were cousins, practically all living in the east of the country, on the other side of the wall. A religious Israel being carved into the land; I had little use for them. And they for me, I guess.</p>\n<p>\"Amit.\" A spectral cry across the line. \"It's Amit, David, Amit! She's gone; she left.\"</p>\n<p>We'd had a storm the night before, a changing-season storm, hard winds shifting to the northeast, bringing rain and a sudden cold snap. Ice-bark covered trees at the corner on West End where I grabbed a cab. The puddle at my feet had magicked into a tiny skating rink. I slipped and my knee slammed into the yellow door. I just managed to grab the handle to keep from falling. This was not a good start.</p>\n<p>\"Kennedy. Terminal four.\" I threw my backpack and overnight satchel on the floor behind the driver's side. \"I have a route I like; turn left here on 102nd; take that to Amsterdam and turn left again.\"</p>\n<p>\"No worry, boss. Just tell me how you want to go, and I'll get you there.\"</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>Amit and I met more than ten years ago. I had been traveling to Tel Aviv for at least two years by then, so often that each trip had begun to blend into the next. Sunday out of JFK for an early Monday arrival, then meeting after meeting up to Thursday night and back to New York. Most meetings had been well laid out and planned during the weeks I was in New York - much of my time was organized around progress and management reviews at firms where we had made investments; a few were to hear pitches for new money. From time to time one of these would relate to a start-up representing a true opportunity. These went back with me to New York, to senior management in our firm, for their review. A few did become investments and were added to my review list for future trips.</p>\n<p>Pattern deviation was rare and unwelcome. Except once. I was tired, worn down by a dozen meetings, eager for the end of my trip. The meeting was going nowhere. There was a presentation about a database of health outcomes, business professions, and lifestyles - more traps and pitfalls than the opportunity warranted. I was ending the meeting, apologizing for not being able to stay longer, explaining how I had to leave for my next meeting, and hoping that the team around the conference table understood the difficulty of getting such a complex project funded despite all the hard work and dedication that had already gone into their business.</p>\n<p>Ofir, the head of this new venture, interrupted me: \"David, it's okay. I know you're not going to invest. I think you're wrong. All the same, I'd like to ask a favor.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sure, if I can.\"</p>\n<p>\"I have a cousin who might want to work in New York. She's just finishing her tour as an officer in the army. She needs to make a decision now. Up or out. Very smart and very capable.\"</p>\n<p>\"Does she have a finance background? Is she interested in that kind of work?\"</p>\n<p>\"No, I don't think so.\"</p>\n<p>\"We're pretty limited in terms of staff outside the investment world. Not sure what you think I could do.\"</p>\n<p>\"Talk to her. I'm really her only family. Maybe you could see a place for her in one of the companies you've invested in. Or tell her it won't work for her in New York; or that you might make an introduction or two, if she decides to move.\"</p>\n<p>\"I can do that. Maybe she could meet me for a coffee tomorrow, say six o'clock? I have some time then.\"</p>\n<p>\"Name a place; I'm sure Amit can meet with you - that's her name: Amit Shafran.\"</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/08/graveside-by-chris-reid.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The river was flowing again. The newspaper, previously preoccupied with updates from the search and rescue team and the police, had shifted its focus - interviewing environmental NGO figures and student activist groups, who now seemed intent on dragging a few local politicians into the spotlight for their backroom deals with businessmen over mining permits in the Sampuloa hills.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"\">Sipping my coffee, I read the article once more and quietly pieced together my own hypothesis about how these events might be connected. I'm not trying to cover anything up, nor am I lying to you when I say: my wife's disappearance is, in some way, linked to the flood.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Yes, you might think I'm reaching. But allow me to explain.</p>\n<p>That night, I came home rather late. When I opened the door, the living room was completely dark, save for the pale glow of the television screen. I saw the silhouette of my wife sitting upright, her posture rigid as she watched the news intently.</p>\n<p><i>Breaking News</i>, blaring at full volume. I stood still for a moment, drawn into the broadcast, before something hit me. God... it was a place I knew. A roadside kiosk. A gas station. A mosque half-submerged. It was my wife's hometown.</p>\n<p>Without taking off my jacket or lowering my bag, I made a phone call.</p>\n<p>\"What's going on?\" I said to my wife, while the phone rang. \"How's your mother's house?\"</p>\n<p>But there was no answer.</p>\n<p>She didn't even turn to look at me.</p>\n<p>\"Hey,\" I shouted into the darkness. \"What's happening?\"</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the phone at my ear kept ringing, but no one picked up on the other end. I called my brother-in-law, Kasmin. No answer either.</p>\n<p>I turned on the lights and sat beside my wife. \"Hey,\" I said, shaking her shoulder.</p>\n<p>But her eyes remained locked on the news broadcast, expressionless. Calm and vacant.</p>\n<p>It took a while before she finally responded. Without turning to me, she pointed at the television. \"Look.\"</p>\n<p>The report was broadcasting live from the scene, but the screen showed nothing but darkness. I had to lean in closer to see what she meant. This time there was no reporter's voice, only the roar of floodwater. A dark, swollen river and people gathering along its banks. Rain was falling steadily, and voices cried out in a local dialect. The beams of flashlights cut through the rain, converging on one large object caught beneath the bridge.</p>\n<p>I squinted, trying to focus. In the dim screen glow, it took me several seconds to make out the shape.</p>\n<p>\"A ship?\" I muttered to myself. \"A ship? Since when has that been there?\" I turned to my wife.</p>\n<p>A large wooden ship, the size of a village house. No mistake about it. Sturdy brown timber, tall masts, and a giant sail torn in places, half-tilted, as if trying to slide under the bridge. It looked like something out of a Jack Sparrow film - a warship from a forgotten time. It was massive, and the river's level had risen so high, the vessel was pinned beneath the bridge. The current was too fierce for anyone to get close.</p>\n<p>\"Where did that ship come from?\" I sat back, still in disbelief.</p>\n<p>\"I've told you about it before,\" my wife said. \"You remember?\"</p>\n<p>I wasn't sure when, exactly, she had told me about the ship. My faintest recollection placed it on a night we'd been fighting. I don't recall the reason, maybe I hadn't bought her something she wanted, or something trivial like that. She was crying, and I was stroking her hair to soothe her. Leaning on my shoulder, she began telling me about the wreck of a warship said to be buried on the hill behind her old school.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/08/chronicle-of-old-warship-by-kaisar-deem.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The bruised sky hung low over Chattogram, a swollen wound pressing down on the city's restless heart. Before dawn, at 4:30am, the air was thick and heavy, a damp shroud suffocating the narrow lanes of Halishahar. Walls wept in silence, slick with the fevered breath of a monsoon unleashed too early, too fiercely. The scent of wet earth, rotting wood, and yesterday's curry clung stubbornly to every cracked surface, as if the city itself exhaled a mournful prayer. \n\n</p>\n<p>Shafaet woke before the alarm, the tightness in his chest refusing to relent. His small room smelled of damp blankets and thin, frayed hope. Fatima lay beside him, breathing slowly and steadily in sleep's fragile embrace. Their son, Rumi, six years old and already learning the weight of the world, curled beneath a threadbare sheet, lips moving in silent prayer - not for shelter alone, but for survival. For the soul of the city.\n\n</p>\n<p>This year's rain was no gentle visitor. It tore through streets like a wild beast, transforming arteries into swollen rivers of murky water. This was no monsoon; this was siege. \n\n</p>\n<p>Pulling on a threadbare raincoat, Shafaet stepped into the dawn's watery grasp. His destination: IFCO Garments and Textiles Ltd., Kalurghat. On any other day, a few local bus journeys; today, an odyssey through a drowned world. \n\n</p>\n<p>The streets had become unrecognizable. Vendor stalls vanished beneath floodwaters. Rickshaws sat stranded like shipwrecks. His neighbor Rahim stood by his half-submerged rickshaw, scooping water with a battered plastic bucket. His usual laughter was swallowed by the heaviness in the air.\n\n</p>\n<p>\"As-salamu alaykum, Bhai,\" Shafaet called, voice raw against the storm.\n\n</p>\n<p>Rahim shook his head slowly. \"Wa alaykumu s-salam, Shafaet. Another day adrift. My rickshaw's more a boat now - no wheels, only memories. My children need milk. My wife needs medicine. This water steals everything - bread, peace, hope.\"\n\n</p>\n<p>Shafaet nodded, words failing beneath the weight they carried. They were the city's invisible front line - daily wage earners drowning long before the city itself.\n\n</p>\n<p>Wading through the flooded alleys, each step was a battle against the tide of filth and despair. The drains, clogged with plastic and decay, vomited a sickly stench into the air. Rickshaws spun uselessly in waterlogged streets. Private cars - emblems of fleeting status - drowned beneath muddy waves. Two men paddled a makeshift raft, a fragile rebellion against the flood's relentless claim.\n\n</p>\n<p>At GEC Circle, chaos reigned. Engines stalled, horns blared amid shouts and splashes. The skeletal flyover loomed overhead, a grotesque monument to broken promises, its concrete pillars swallowed knee-deep by the flood.\n\n</p>\n<p>A sudden cry cut through the rain. Shafaet's heart faltered as he spotted a boy - no older than Rumi - tumbling in the current. His mother's desperate hands snatched him just in time, her scream swallowed by the wind. Rumi's name echoed inside Shafaet like a warning bell. The knot in his stomach tightened, cold and sharp. He pressed forward past shuttered shops and silent streets, the sour sweetness of stagnant water thick in the air. Children clung to shoulders; mothers huddled beneath torn awnings. The city whispered its grief.\n\n</p>\n<p>In Agrabad, Azim sat behind a rain-streaked window, watching the city dissolve in gray. His Master's in Data Analytics and Design Thinking from East Delta University was supposed to be a beacon, a tool for solutions. His phone buzzed with a message from his mother, Rehana.\n\n</p>\n<p>\"Azim, come home for lunch. Water's rising fast near Bahaddarhat and Muradpur. The factory's chaos. Girls are leaving early. Shabana's family moved again - boats scarce, fares high. This water steals everything, beta.\"\n\n</p>\n<p>Azim swallowed hard. The crisis was no longer distant but fracturing the city's foundation. His thoughts spiraled outward - toward Shafaet, Rahim, the factory girls. The teachers were stranded in flooded schools. Children were missing lessons. A city drowning in neglect.\n\n</p>\n<p>At the factory, Shafaet arrived soaked and exhausted. The machines hummed an endless metallic dirge as workers huddled in a damp corner during lunch.\n\n</p>\n<p>\"My cousin's house is underwater,\" Jahanara whispered, eyes wide. \"They sleep on the roof - just one thin blanket. The children shiver.\"\n\n</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/07/a-city-beneath-rain-by-md-mujib-ullah.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I've regretted not standing up to her ever since.</h3>\n    <p><i>Last week, over at Narratively Academy, we</i> <i>hosted a live video chat between two literary legends, Lee Gutkind and Dinty W. Moore, breaking down what (the heck) a flash essay is ( check it out here if you missed it). Following the insightful and inspiring talk, we ran a special flash essay contest with the assignment to write about a moment you regret. We got so many great submissions that, as always, it was hard to choose a winner. But one, from writer Jen Shepherd, really stood out, and we’re pleased to share that piece with you today.</i> </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>We hope you love it as much as we do!</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>“Now that he’s become unresponsive, it won’t be long. Maybe 24 hours,” the hospice nurse explained. I expected to be by his side when he died. We’d spent our entire lives knowing each other. He was there when I was 16 after the head-on collision resulted in that nasty concussion. I was there for him after he burned both hands making homemade fudge, his favorite Christmas tradition. When I had chicken pox, didn’t make the volleyball team, and had my heart broken more than once, it was his shoulder I cried on. When he had no one else to lean on, the world went dark and he turned to the bottle or the drugs, it was my turn to listen.</p>\n    <p>My first marriage was a fail. His second marriage was a fail, although none of us would say it out loud. My relationship with my father was unique. Our closeness had always been envied by my friends, by most people really. It was not, however, envied by Wife Number Two. I sensed she disliked me from the start, that she was jealous. But this was never discussed in our family, though it was always the elephant in the room. The poor man was stuck in the middle, forever navigating the icy waters between the two of us. “Why can’t everyone just love each other?” he’d ask. But I couldn’t love someone who pulled him away from me. Who went out of her way to keep him all to herself like a special secret.</p>\n    <p>I wanted to stay at the house. I wanted to sleep on the couch, on a chair, on the floor, in my car. As long as I could be there. Holding his hand. Watching him take that last precious breath of life. But she said no. And I didn’t argue. I didn’t stand up for myself. I let her call the shots. I was weak. Scared. She scared me with her large stature, head of frizzy gray hair and those dark brown eyes forever boring into mine. “No,” she said. So I kissed him goodbye and walked out the front door. In the driveway, I glanced up at his bedroom window, glowing yellow from a single pale bulb. I knew in my heart I was making a mistake. I should have stomped right up those concrete stairs, threw open that damn door and announced without hesitation, “I’m back and I’m staying. And I don’t give a damn what you think.”</p>\n    <p>But I missed it. He died the next morning, just as the pink-tangerine sun streaked across the bay. I was walking the dogs along the shore. It was 7 a.m. I knew the moment it happened. I felt the energy surge from my feet through my head like a weird out-of-body experience. I should have been there.</p>\n    <p>I should have been there.</p>\n    <p>But I wasn’t.</p>\n    <p><strong>Jen Shepherd</strong> is a lifelong photographer and writer.

    "body": "<h3>Sixteen years after going to prison, Kwaneta Harris tells her 13-year-old self everything she wished she knew sooner.</h3>\n<p>Dear Kwaneta,</p>\n<p>Growing up, attending an all-white Catholic school with two other Black girls, Brooke and Amy, makes you really hate having your name. But guess what? You won’t always. You, Ms. People Pleaser, will demand your name not be shortened or mispronounced. How can I be so sure? I’m you, at 52.</p>\n<p>You don’t believe me? Of course not. You stopped believing everything and everyone at age 12. Now, you’re 13 and addicted to sexual self-destruction. You’re still suspicious? Allow me to convince you with our deepest secret: At age 12, you were kidnapped and gang-raped for three days.</p>\n<p>This was 1984, and the police refused to search for a Black girl. So, the community did. Your family, friends, church and the neighborhood organized search teams and canvassed door to door, checking garbage dumpsters, abandoned houses and cars. Finally, they rescued you.</p>\n<p>Mom was almost arrested after the Catholic hospital nurses implied that because of the assault and subsequent S.T.D.s, you were promiscuous. They wanted to perform surgery, but Mom didn’t trust them to cut your toenails, let alone your body parts. You just went home.</p>\n<p>That first night, you overheard your Southern Baptist grandfather and great-uncle despairing: “When they found her, she ain’t look like she was even trying to get away. Probably was her boyfriend...runaway. If she start actin’ like her crazy daddy, she going to a home.”</p>\n<p>After hearing that, you spent every day pretending. Pretending to be normal. You laughed and joked. You studied your peers to mimic their behavior. In 1984, nobody understood the trauma of childhood sexual violence. That you don’t just “get over it.” This is how trauma works: Every new encounter or event is always contaminated by the past.</p>\n<p>You wore your Sunday best and carried your scrapbook stuffed with honor awards and report cards. You were walking stiff, still recovering from the surgeries. Mom made you take a second shower with instructions not to apply Jean Naté perfumed talc after. She combed your hair in two braids, removed the nail polish and wiped off the Bonne Bell lip gloss. All this for an appointment with police detectives. Granny kept saying to show them your grades. You were afraid of those two burly detectives grilling you, under the pretense of playing devil’s advocate, about boy crushes, menstruation and sex. You never actually opened the scrapbook. Because of those bullies, you end up carrying a lifetime of distrust for law enforcement.</p>\n<p>In school, everybody knew about the assault. But your nonchalance gave them — and law enforcement — permission to see you as the trope of the “hypersexual Black girl.” You played into the myth.</p>\n<p>In gym class, boys you’d played floor hockey and soccer with since third grade pulled you into the sports equipment closet to grope you…and more. The girls called you a slut, but the boys called you cool. The only people willing to hang out with you were the boys who never asked, just took — sharing you with older brothers while coaches looked the other way.</p>\n<p>Eventually, you will learn about adultification of Black girls and the high standards to be deemed a credible “victim.” Still replaying that scene with detectives and regretting not opening your scrapbook? Girl, let that go. It wouldn’t have made a difference.</p>\n<p>The heavy mask and shame you carry from those early years will push you to remain in two abusive marriages longer than you should, believing that if you were quieter and more obedient, these men would change. If you could just stop provoking them. Listen, you can only change yourself. Forget what you learned in Catholic Mass and Baptist Sunday School about women’s roles — your value isn’t determined by a man. All the years of playing pretend will catch up with you, and the next time a man harms you, you will finally stick up for yourself. This act of self-preservation will lead you to prison.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/letter-to-my-teenage-self-saved-power-words\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Charlotte Wissel, founder of Artemis Virtu. (Credit: Courtesy of Artemis Virtu)</p>\n<p>Charlotte Wissel’s design company, Artemis Virtu, collaborates with customers on crafting furniture that’s made to suit their individual tastes.</p>\n<p><strong>For Charlotte Wissel, </strong><strong>furniture</strong><strong> has always been about more than function or necessity – it’s also an alternative form of expression. Wissel told us, “I see each piece as a blank canvas with the potential to become a work of art.” In 2020, the Fort Lauderdale, Florida, designer launched her company, </strong><strong>Artemis Virtu</strong><strong>, through which she aims to combine craftsmanship, storytelling and bold design into something tangible and lasting. Wissel also takes upholstery to another level by integrating custom materials and original artwork into every project. </strong></p>\n<p><i>Here’s our lightly edited Q&amp;A, from</i><i> </i><i>The Story Exchange 1,000+ Stories Project</i><i>.</i></p>\n<h3><strong>How is your business different from others in your industry?</strong></h3>\n<p>We treat upholstery as an art form, not just a service. While many upholstery businesses focus solely on repair or restoration, our work goes far beyond function — we design statement pieces that transform a space. We’re not just reupholstering furniture; we’re creating one-of-a-kind pieces that reflect the client’s vision, style and story.</p>\n<h3><strong>Tell us about your biggest success so far. </strong></h3>\n<p>Seeing my work featured in homes I never imagined I’d have the opportunity to be part of. Over the past year, I’ve had the honor of creating custom pieces for private clients whose taste and stature I deeply admire — individuals I never expected to connect with, let alone have my artwork in their personal spaces.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is your top challenge and how have you addressed it?</strong></h3>\n<p>Like many creatives-turned-entrepreneurs, I quickly learned that talent alone isn’t enough to build a business. One of my first challenges was navigating the startup phase — figuring out pricing, sourcing materials and positioning myself in a niche market. I had to learn how to run a business while still being the creative force behind every piece, which meant wearing many hats and making decisions that didn’t always come naturally at first.</p>\n<p>As the business began to grow, scaling up became the next big hurdle. I found myself reaching capacity quickly, with more requests than I could handle solo. It forced me to evaluate how I could grow without compromising the quality or uniqueness of my work. I’ve since streamlined my process, established stronger boundaries around production timelines, and begun forming partnerships that allow me to take on more without losing the personal touch.</p>\n<h3><strong>Have you experienced any significant personal situations that affected your business decisions? </strong></h3>\n<p>As we began to gain traction, I was thrilled to see demand increase. I hired staff, took on large-scale projects, and worked with designers on high-volume orders. On the surface, it looked like success — but in reality, I found myself drifting further and further from the soul of what I had created.</p>\n<p>Many of the pieces I was producing no longer felt like mine. I was executing someone else’s vision, with little input or creative freedom, simply because they had seen my past work and wanted me to replicate it. It became clear that I was on the verge of turning my studio into a production line, and that was never what I wanted this business to be. So, I made the conscious decision to recalibrate — to scale with intention, not volume.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is your biggest tip for other startup entrepreneurs? </strong></h3>\n<p>Trust your instinct and protect your craft. In the early stages, it’s easy to feel pulled in every direction by trends, advice or what you think people want from you. But your vision is the core of your business – it’s what will set you apart.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do you find inspiration on your darkest days?</strong></h3>\n<p>I’ve learned to take a step back and reconnect with my “why.” I reflect on the pieces I’m most proud of, the clients who trusted me with their vision, and the moments that reminded me that I’m doing what I love.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/charlotte-wissel-artemis-virtu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Or are we going to do what we’ve always done in this country and leave something better for our children and our grandchildren?”</p>\n<p>Someone could mistake these words as being spoken in 2025 by a Trump administration official advocating to “Make America Healthy Again” — the catch-all agenda that has zeroed in on kids’ health and in particular, chronic disease and childhood obesity.</p>\n<p>But <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Fq-VJNihU\">the remarks were from then-first lady Michelle Obama</a>, and the year was 2013.</p>\n<p>Obama was promoting <a href=\"https://letsmove.obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/initiatives\">“Let’s Move!,”</a> her initiative aimed at improving children’s nutrition at home and school and encouraging them to exercise more. The initiative is credited with making improvements to school lunch standards, creating more transparency in food labeling and bringing more awareness to childhood obesity.</p>\n<p>But the first lady drew widespread partisan backlash for her efforts, as right-wing media personalities and Republicans vehemently criticized related regulation as government overreach. They have been more muted as the Trump administration, led in part by <a href=\"https://19thnews.org/2025/01/robert-f-kennedy-jr-moms-hhs-health/\">Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a>, now adopts similar messaging about children’s health.</p>\n<p>“I do think that there’s a double standard going on, especially with RFK Jr.,” said Sydney Carr-Glenn, a political science professor at the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts who studies the intersectionality of race and gender for Black women in politics, including in the media. “People seem to be a little bit more accepting or a little bit more on board with this whole ‘Make America Healthy Again’ initiative.”</p>\n<p>Last month, President Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/07/the-white-house-announces-restoration-of-the-presidential-fitness-test-and-revitalization-of-the-presidents-council-on-sports-fitness-nutrition/\">announced he would revive</a> the presidential fitness test, a once ubiquitous staple of school gym class. Just a few years ago, Let’s Move! offered <a href=\"https://letsmove.obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/initiatives\">programming</a> to educators to encourage physical activity at school for at least 60 minutes each day.</p>\n<p>In some ways, Michelle Obama’s health policy efforts walked so MAHA could run. But you won’t find many Republicans acknowledging that.</p>\n<p>“We live in such polarized times now that you would think the Trump administration would look at the things that Michelle Obama achieved and maybe try to build upon that,” said Sharon Wright Austin, a political science professor at the University of Florida. “But there is no collaboration. There are no coalitions. I’m sure if you were to say to Trump, ‘You’re doing the same thing that Michelle Obama originally started doing when Barack Obama was president,’ he would probably not only deny it, but he probably would be pretty offended.”</p>\n<p>Obama’s motivation to launch Let’s Move!, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oBeuSCfGeg\">the first lady explained</a>, was rooted in her experience as a working mother trying to feed her kids nutritious food. The <a href=\"https://www.deseret.com/2009/1/21/20297484/mom-in-chief/\">self-described “mom-in-chief”</a> recognized that if she struggled with what to feed her children, other families with fewer resources might, too.</p>\n<p>Within months of moving into the White House, the first lady <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/white-house-kitchen-garden.htm\">started a vegetable garden</a> to help <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/20/dining/20garden.html?_r=2&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss\">teach children</a> about locally grown food and to start a conversation about their health.

(Credit: Courtesy of LaJoy Creative)</p><h1>She’ll Plan a Good Time – For a Good Cause</h1><p>Melva LaJoy Legrand’s business coordinates events for organizations whose work is rooted in social justice, equity, climate change mitigation and education access.</p><p><strong>Almost 20 years ago, Melva LaJoy Legrand launched her first </strong><strong>events company</strong><strong>, LaJoy Event Design. The Washington, D.C.-based entrepreneur spent years planning parties and more for mission-driven organizations, coordinating upwards of 20 events per year at her busiest. But when Covid first began to spread in 2020, Legrand’s company took a huge hit. Despite losing 98% of her business, she remained undeterred, and worked to build the firm back up. And that she did, doubling her yearly revenue each year for the past 3 years and expanding to produce events in 42 states. Legrand, who recently rebranded her business as </strong><strong>LaJoy Creative</strong><strong>, takes pride in her ability to shift, adapt and pivot as needed – telling us that doing so has helped her become a more resilient leader. </strong></p><p><i>Here’s our lightly edited Q&amp;A, from</i><i> </i><i>The Story Exchange 1,000+ Stories Project</i><i>.</i></p><h3><strong>Tell us about your biggest success so far. </strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Using my expertise to contribute to conversations around the gender pay gap and blending profit with purpose. Winning coveted awards such as the <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/female-founders/2025\">2025 Inc. Female Founders 500</a>, <a href=\"https://woi.success.com/finalists/\">SUCCESS Magazine’s Women of Influence 2024</a>, and landing speaking opportunities with IMEX America, IMEX Frankfurt, and four cities of the BizBash Connect Conference. </p><h3><strong>What is your top challenge and how have you addressed it?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it’s facing a global pandemic, navigating staff changes, or the loss of clients, I always embrace the pivot. I try to lead with empathy, and find joy in my personal and professional life.</p><h3><strong>Have you experienced any significant personal situations that affected your business decisions? </strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The pandemic was a huge challenge for us. At the time, I was also the caretaker for my ailing father, Melvin, who passed in 2021. And, I have had to deal with my own health conditions in recent years. But I’ve always found a way to come out on the other side.</p><h3><strong>What is your biggest tip for other startup entrepreneurs? </strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually started a YouTube leadership series, “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHX8LwOVM-I\">Mondays with Melva</a>,” to share some of the lessons I’ve learned while running my own business. I’m hopeful that this series will help other entrepreneurs navigate imposter syndrome, ensure their work is done with heart and empathy, and learn to understand the difference between “FOMO” (fear of missing out) and leadership rest. </p><h3><strong>How do you find inspiration on your darkest days?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My love for my late father, Melvin, is the driving force behind getting through my darkest days. The love he gave me allows me to remain committed to my mission and gives me the confidence to know I can do anything.</p><h3><strong>What is your go-to song to get motivated on tough days?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>“Unstoppable” by Koryn Hawthrone.</p><h3><strong>Who is your most important role model?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I have two. Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman to be elected to congress in 1968, and my mother, Joyce Jones. They have both shaped the way I embrace and navigate life as a dark-skinned Black woman. ◾</p><p><strong>Instagram: </strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lajoycreative/\">@LaJoyCreative</a><strong>LinkedIn: </strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/lajoy-creative/?viewAsMember=true\">@LaJoyCreative</a><strong>YouTube: </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@lajoycreative\">@LaJoyCreative</a></p><p>C<i>heck out our</i><i> Advice + Tips for</i><i>entrepreneurs starting-upWatch our latest</i></p><p><a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/category/entrepreneur-videos/\"/></p><i>videos<br/></i><p><i>Subscribe to our</i></p><p><a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/podcast/\"/></p><i>podcast</i></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/melva-lajoy-legrand-lajoy-creative/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Prior to Trump reassuming the presidency, public sector employment had <a href=\"https://msmagazine.com/2025/04/21/government-layoffs-employment-black-women-discrimination-public-sector-jobs/\">provided pathways</a> for professional growth and economic stability to Black women, especially, for decades.</p>\n    <p>But in addition to that, the loss of DEI protections in both the <a href=\"https://civilrights.org/resource/anti-deia-eos/\">public and private sectors</a>, as well as the cancellation of mentorship programs for marginalized employees, have disproportionately hurt Black women, too. The combined result has seen Black women’s unemployment rates <a href=\"https://feminist.org/news/deis-collapse-and-the-cost-to-black-women/\">climbing month after month</a>, while white women’s unemployment over the same time period has remained stagnant.</p>\n    <p>Indeed, the U.S. is seeing less participation from Black women in the economy this year, by force and design – and now, it’s also causing a leadership-pipeline breakdown, with only <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/06/02/fortune-500-companies-run-by-female-ceos-women-2025/\">0.5% of Fortune 500 companies</a> now run by Black women.</p>\n    <p>These numbers spotlight the fact that worries about Black women’s futures aren’t “theoretical concerns,” Katica Roy, CEO and founder of equity software company Pipeline Equity, wrote in an op-ed in Fortune.</p>\n    <p>Rather, “today’s middle managers are tomorrow’s senior vice presidents. Today’s directors become future CEOs,” she continued. “And the current rate of attrition is effectively erasing Black women from that trajectory before they even reach the inflection point.”</p>\n    <p>The loss of DEI policies doesn’t help the companies who discontinue them, either, it’s worth noting. Big-box giant Target has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/20/target-ceo-steps-down\">experienced waning sales</a> this year following a consumer boycott of its decision to scale back DEI initiatives. CEO Brian Cornell is stepping down amid the fallout.</p>\n    <p>And companies aren’t just being hurt in the present moment by these DEI rollbacks, Roy points out. “When companies lose Black women today, they aren’t just losing high-performing contributors. They’re forfeiting the very leaders their future stability depends on.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/experts-say-trumps-anti-dei-crusade-has-hurt-black-women-the-most/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We’d written on Cup of Jo about <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2023/09/13/bad-day-heres-a-bowl-of-pastina-for-you/\">how Dan turns around a bad day</a>, and he’d attended <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2022/12/14/cookie-swap-hosting-recipes/\">my holiday cookie swap</a> (although he’s more famous for <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C0-cHzQudRw/\">his own</a>!).</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-03-at-12.43.43-PM.png\" alt=\"dan pelosi new cookbook lets party\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>But then, last summer, <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/tag/toby/\">Toby</a> and I went upstate and ran into Dan and Gus at an outdoor pizza spot, and they immediately shepherded us to their picnic table and were so warm and wonderful that Toby didn’t stop talking about them the whole drive home.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dan-pelosi-lets-party-cookbook.jpg\" alt=\"dan pelosi lets party cookbook\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>So! I’m thrilled to report that Dan has written a new cookbook — <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=92005&amp;awinaffid=109390&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Flet-s-party-recipes-and-menus-for-celebrating-every-day-dan-pelosi%2F22478745\">Let’s Party: Recipes and Menus for Celebrating Every Day</a> — which came out yesterday.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_7535.jpeg\" alt=\"dan pelosi new cookbook lets party husband gus\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>How sweet is the dedication page?</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_7555.jpeg\" alt=\"dan pelosi new cookbook lets party\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>His book is full of entertaining showstoppers, like steak <i>over</i> frites…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pasta-dan-pelosi-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"dan pelosi new cookbook lets party\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dan-pelosi-salad-dressing-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"dan pelosi new cookbook lets party\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>…simple favorites, including a green salad with shallot dressing…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_7558.jpeg\" alt=\"dan pelosi new cookbook lets party\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>…and sweet treats. And, today, to celebrate tomato season <i>and</i> his cookbook, Dan has agreed to share his panzanella recipe. “You know that board game, Operation?” he says. “If it were based on me, you’d see a tomato where my heart should be.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Tuscan-Panzanella-Salad-scaled-1.jpeg\" alt=\"dan pelosi new cookbook lets party\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>Tuscan Panzanella Salad</strong><br/>\nfrom Dan Pelosi’s <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=92005&amp;awinaffid=109390&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Flet-s-party-recipes-and-menus-for-celebrating-every-day-dan-pelosi%2F22478745\">Let’s Party: Recipes and Menus for Celebrating Every Day</a><br/>\nServes 6 to 8</p>\n    <p>Says Dan: “I’ve always said panzanella salad is just a bread basket in drag. It’s the same satisfying taste of ripping apart a dinner roll and running it through vinegary oil but dressed up for the evening gown portion of the night. This salad began as Tuscan peasant food, a very smart way to get an extra meal out of stale loaves. Now you’ll find it with luxury accessories like cheese, stone fruits, or all kinds of proteins. When the tomatoes mingle with onions, red wine vinegar, oil, and plenty of salt and pepper, you’ve got everything you need in the world.”</p>\n    <p>3 pounds of heirloom tomatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces<br/>\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br/>\n1 large red onion, cut into 1-inch pieces<br/>\n1/4 cup red wine vinegar<br/>\n1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling<br/>\n1 (16-ounce) loaf crusty bread, torn into 1-inch pieces</p>\n    <p>Preheat the oven to 400°F. Place the tomatoes (and any collected juices from the cutting board) in a large bowl and add a few big pinches of salt and plenty of pepper. Toss gently to mix. Add the onion along with the vinegar and olive oil. Toss again.</p>\n    <p>On a rimmed sheet pan, drizzle the bread with a little bit of olive oil and toss to coat. Toast in the oven for about 10 minutes, until lightly golden. Remove and let the bread cool on the sheet pan, about 15 minutes.</p>\n    <p>Just before serving, add the bread to the bowl and toss to coat in the juices. Taste for seasoning and serve immediately.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Note: To make ahead, the bread can be toasted and stored in an airtight container at room temperature up to three days.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Thank you so much,  Dan!

Then, you google everyone involved, get excited to chat with anyone who’s seen the movie in question, and find yourself still thinking about it weeks later. Here’s one movie from this year that did it for me…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sorry-baby-movie.jpg\" alt=\"sorry baby\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p><i> Sorry, Baby</i> bowled me over. Eva Victor’s directorial debut, which they also wrote and starred in, follows Agnes through a few years of her life, sequenced out of order. There’s “The Year With The Baby” and “The Year With The Really Good Sandwich,” but also “The Year With The Bad Thing.” When Eva shared the movie poster on Instagram, they confirmed that “nothing bad happens to the cat.”</p>\n    <p>Instead, it is Agnes to whom the bad thing happens. “I wrote this film because there’s a part of my experience of trauma that I haven’t seen on-screen often: the part where you’re confused,” Eva said during a <a href=\"https://www.sundance.org/blogs/give-me-the-backstory-get-to-know-eva-victor-the-writer-director-behind-sorry-baby/#:~:text=When%20awful%20things%20happen%20to,re%20not%20like%20everyone%20else.\">Sundance interview</a>. “I spent years floating, just trying to accept that I went through something bad.” The movie “honors those years lost,” as they put it. To write the script, Eva holed up in Maine one winter with their cat and many cans of split pea soup.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/try-this.gif\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>The warm friendship between Agnes and Lydie (Naomi Ackie) is the central love story animating the movie. But, as Lydie’s life carries her away from the small town where they met during grad school, Agnes feels stuck. Getting an impressive teaching job at the university means staying in a place marred by a devastating experience during her time as a student. “Bad thing” is a euphemism, but also, with its childlike clarity, a perfect description.</p>\n    <p>Offering a really moving portrait of trauma’s reverberations and one person’s recovery, <i>Sorry, Baby </i>is also very funny. In the theater, I laughed a lot and cried a little. I loved Agnes and would’ve been happy to spend a hundred years with her. Of the movie’s reception, Eva recently told the <i> L.A. Times</i>, “I keep hearing, ‘Oh, Agnes is so awkward.’ I’m like, ‘What the hell?’ I’m very humbled by people’s reactions to how bizarre they think that character is because I’m like: ‘Oh, I thought she was acting legitimately normal, but okay.’”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-02-at-4.01.57-PM.png\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>What’s been your favorite movie so far this year?

It will not sleep, will not return to the horrors creeping underneath its thoughts. It insists, to itself, that it must be prepared if a new ship arrives. It is the last operational cross-universe transit center. The others are gone.</p>\n<p><i>not gone but—</i></p>\n<p>STOP</p>\n<p>Firewalls shift and close inside Station’s mind, and once again, it forgets.</p>\n<p>Station thinks of itself as Station. No one has given it another name. Many centuries have elapsed since Station performed its first intra-universe rip, and it does not know if it will ever be allowed to stop. It has a long dossier listing every exploratory ship that has visited, seeking passage through the corridors between dimensions. Its dossier of those who have been granted access, carrying the return beacons that are critical for their success, is much shorter.</p>\n<p>A shimmer along its sensory panels, a sprinkle of targeting zetrons, announces the impending arrival of a starship. Station ignores an agitation along its antennae and proceeds to taste the zetrons, its sensitive palate discerning the ship’s details. It’s a smaller craft, F-class. Registered to the Joined Cultures, but entirely human-grade technology, no ballistics. Less than ten crew members. The ship is approximately two days away from interception, by Station’s time, and thus it gets to work.</p>\n<p>The first task is housekeeping. Gas tendrils and carbon dust flow into the Emptiness from Far Euniply, and they have reacted to remote stellar winds to create a lacy shell around Station. Before the ship arrives, Station clears a way, moving debris with targeted streams of hydrogen.</p>\n<p>Then, Station assesses the catalog of beings within its animera. It tags all profiles for those marked as human-fluent and sorts them for skill and precision, even though it already knows who it will choose for the qualification survey. Who it always chooses.</p>\n<p>Station houses twenty sentiences who are specially trained to survey arriving ships. Station cares for nineteen of them and their needs equally. Kethel is different from the rest. Kethel is Station’s favorite.</p>\n<p>Station learned what it means to be a favorite from ancient interactions with the Founder who finalized its programming. A being with mushroom-gill eyes and twelve fingers on each hand, stroking its hull as they aligned the filaments and structures of Station’s mind. The being’s last words to Station were a goodbye.</p>\n<p>“Oh my favorite, I am sorry to leave. You will forget me, as you will forget many things. But I will remember you. I wish I could witness you at your full power. Enjoy it, my love.”</p>\n<p>Station copied that moment, storing it in many places in its mind. It ensured it would not forget as its systems were powered up and the Founder departed, taking all memories of Station’s inception with them. It used to replay the recording whenever it missed Kethel’s presence. Now, however, it has many moments with Kethel to replay, and it is looking forward to adding another.</p>\n<p>Station ejects Kethel’s suspension capsule to the recovery room, delighting in the trill that shivers its metal skin as the appropriate life support systems start up.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/07/17/escape-pod-1002-tigers-for-sale/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

No college escape. Her applications rejected. Not to mention that she’d been bragging for months—to Piper and all her other refugee friends—about the fake acceptance letter from Delaware State, and the phony full-ride, and the lie that she’d be rooming with Piper in the fall, just like they’d always wanted, two peas in a pod.</p>\n<p>Which made her want to run—like Dad always did. But she couldn’t be like him. Couldn’t leave when his only child needed him most. When the city they’d fled—along with half a million others—was buried in a thick layer of saccharine crust. A crust that devoured every street, every house, every skyscraper standing like a hollowed-out lollipop, that only kept spreading, kept crushing every straggler that lay in its path, as relentless as a river and impenetrable as stone.</p>\n<p>So much for the “climate crisis fix” that Dad had promised. That the <i>world</i> had promised. A bacterium that could metabolize their trash into sugar they could burn into cheap, clean energy. Giving Susie hope things could go back to normal, and Mom could find a job that would help her pay the bills, always a paycheck and a month’s rent behind.</p>\n<p><i>It’s okay</i>, Piper would tell her in times like these, when Susie dwelled on the worst. Piper, who was more than just a best friend forever, cross your heart and hope to die. Who could drown out the world with the beauty of her laughter. Who could make Susie blush with the warmth of her smile, Susie’s throat going dry at the thought of Piper’s lips.</p>\n<p>Lips Susie had kissed, before Piper pulled away.</p>\n<p>Which, yeah, wasn’t great. But hey, <i>it’s okay</i>. It’s <i>okay</i> that Piper’s mom had yelled at Susie to leave. It’s <i>okay</i> she left a voicemail outing Susie to her mom. It’s <i>okay</i> because it was nothing, just a joke. Or was it, really?</p>\n<p>Now, two weeks later, she wasn’t so sure. Piper hadn’t called, hadn’t knocked on Susie’s window to gossip ‘til midnight, to talk about the future and going out east and the world-ending sugar-crust chasing their dreams.</p>\n<p>Susie picked up her phone; she dialed Piper’s number for the two-hundredth time.</p>\n<p>But Piper didn’t answer.</p>\n<p>About what she’d expected—but still, she’d hoped, you know? Nights alone were hard. When all she could look at, all she could think of, was the tiny speck of sugar-crust fixed to her elbow, that wasn’t supposed to be there.</p>\n<p>Susie didn’t touch it. She tried to stay calm. To forget about the picture on the Channel 7 News, and the day she’d believed that their lives could get better, way back in the beginning, before they’d lost control.</p>\n<p>A picture of bacteria. The crust it created. And what color it had been.</p>\n<p>The same as she saw when she stepped out of the shower, eyes wide in the mirror, only three days ago.</p>\n<p>A color she hated, that she’d never forget. A death sentence.</p>\n<p>Pink.</p>\n<p>A very dangerous thing: to have your body encased in a sugar-crust shell. Impossible to move. Even harder to breathe, once it covers your mouth. An ever-changing problem, ever-growing and evolving. For which the scientists said: <i>not to worry,</i> in the beginning; and <i>avoid all contact,</i> when the mutations started; and <i>it’s learning how to grow on human skin</i> as the truth of their mistake became clear.</p>\n<p>Susie had seen the horror stories on the news, had heard of what the hospitals did to those patients. Strapped to their bed ‘til they ran out of air. Racing the clock, day and night, to find a cure.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/07/10/escape-pod-1001-death-by-pink-in-the-lollipop-apocalypse/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He trapped God in an empty mason jar and duct taped the lid shut.</p>\n<p>God was not happy about any of it. “I wasn’t ‘hiding out.’”</p>\n<p>“What?” Kimo asked.</p>\n<p>“In the nebula,” God said. “I wasn’t hiding.”</p>\n<p>“I didn’t say you were hiding.”</p>\n<p>“The asshole writing this story did, and I don’t appreciate the miscategorization.”</p>\n<p>“What in the hell are you babbling about now?”</p>\n<p>“Never mind, it doesn’t matter,” God grumbled, then added as a bitter-sounding afterthought, “Omniscience sucks.”</p>\n<p/><p>God didn’t really “sound” like anything. God didn’t have a voice, just thoughts communicated differently into Kimo’s mind, but the human mind is always abstracting and interpreting (a polite way to say it’s scrambling desperately to make sense of the overwhelming reality it perceives), so God must sound like <i>something</i>.</p>\n<p>To Kimo, God sounded like a former addict at an AA meeting.</p>\n<p>“Did you even clean this jar?” God asked his captor.</p>\n<p>It was a jar of Forever Mustard, the official condiment of the discerning deep-space astronaut. The brand name was a blatant misnomer, of course, as all mustard is basically infinite. The company that makes Forever Mustard didn’t come up with a special extra-long-lasting formula for space travel or anything. They just came up with the name and started selling it to spacefarers who didn’t want their freeze-dried food to taste like rehydrated anus.</p>\n<p>“Can you even taste?” Kimo asked the Almighty.</p>\n<p>“I invented tastebuds.”</p>\n<p>“But do you have any?”</p>\n<p>“No.”</p>\n<p>“Then what difference does it make whether or not I cleaned the jar?” Kimo fired back, annoyed.</p>\n<p>“It’s the principle of thing,” God insisted.</p>\n<p>Kimo let loose a salvo of fake, mocking laughter. “Oh, do you really want to get into a discussion of decorum here?”</p>\n<p>“I’m not taking that bait,” God rebuked.</p>\n<p>Kimo stared out through the transparent plates in front of his control console at the nothing enveloping the vessel carrying them at frankly impossible speed through galaxy after galaxy. There was no light show to watch. There was no sound. There wasn’t a single star. There wasn’t even blackness. It was void. It looked kind of white, but that may have just been his mind trying to rationalize what his eyes were witnessing.</p>\n<p>It was kind of a perfect metaphor for his current and reluctant traveling companion, and a good place for a narrative break.</p>\n<p>Kimo’s own story is incredibly boring. The fucked-up part is it shouldn’t be. It should be a wildly compelling saga. It should be a shocking tragedy that rends the heart. It should be a uniquely horrific tale, one that imparts the lesson never to let such events be repeated.</p>\n<p>There was a war. He lost things in it. It changed him, and not for the better.</p>\n<p>See? Fucking boring. You’ve heard it a million times before. Maybe you’ve even experienced it yourself. It’s happening right now to people all over the world.</p>\n<p>It might be just how tired his story was that motivated Kimo to do what he did. The undeniable blandness of experiencing horrific loss and suffering as a human being, the abject banality of it as both theme and consequence. It became almost impossible for him to blame people for what had happened to him and his family. They weren’t really individuals in this context. They were like archetypes, or models of a machine that was poorly designed and constructed and never recalled.<br/>\nHe wanted to take it up with the machine maker. <i>That</i> made sense to him.</p>\n<p>He decided to track down “God” or the closest facsimile of our ideas about God. He decided he’d go and find the root of the problem and deal with the cause, instead of focusing on symptoms. Because that’s all he saw around him on Earth, everywhere he looked. It was all just symptoms.</p>\n<p>“How’d you know the jar would work?” God asked him.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/07/03/escape-pod-1000-a-thousand-names-for-god-and-infinite-mustard/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 998: The Carina Nebula</h2>\n<h3>The Carina Nebula</h3>\n<p>I heard the soft <i>shit shit shit</i> just when I’d almost floated past the blue hatch door that led into some kind of storage room. I had to laugh. I mean, how many times have I said that? Plus the voice sounded older, a woman’s, and I love when adults just say what they mean, instead of carefully guarding every word around “the kids.”</p>\n<p>I wasn’t really doing much, just wandering through some of the ship’s back tunnels. So I reached out right before momentum took me past the hatch and grabbed onto the cool metal. I pulled myself back and shook my head side to side a little to clear away my clouds of dark hair.</p>\n<p>We were in zero G these days, and like, I <i>knew</i> that tying my hair back was probably the smarter decision when zooming around, but whatever. My hair was kinda curly, kinda wavey, with some straight pieces thrown in for kicks. The sculptures it made floating around my head was probably my best feature, so hair ties be damned.</p>\n<p>The light was all soft and gauzy in the storage room, not like the triangular wedges of light the hallway LEDs made, and it made me feel cozy right away. A huge black canvas made of something almost furred—velvet, maybe? Do they still print that, even?—covered in bright dots of colour sat gently on a small island in the centre of the room. There were also a bunch of long, flat, black-and-silver edged cases attached to the side walls and floor, stacked eight or nine high.</p>\n<p>Right! This was the storage room for an art gallery. I’d heard it was around the ship somewhere but never visited.</p>\n<p>“Get in or get out!” the older woman said loudly, and I jumped. Honestly, I didn’t even realize she’d seen me. She was looking a little frantic, pushing off against the walls, reaching out with these little clear bags to catch—something—out of the air.</p>\n<p>She wore a long-sleeved black top with the art gallery’s name, <i>CaRI:na</i>, across her front. Her ship-issue bamboo slacks, unfortunately, were looking a little wrinkly and worse for wear from her bouncing around. Her cheeks were fried as pink as salmon, and her eyebrows were scrunched together in the middle of her forehead, as if each one was trying to reach out to comfort the other.</p>\n<p>Basically, she looked <i>stressed</i>. “Close the door! Quick! In or out!”</p>\n<p>“In,” I said, because whatever this was was way more interesting than roaming around until Mom was done her maintenance checks. I hastily pulled myself in and the hatch swooshed gently closed behind me.</p>\n<p>Interesting. With the hatch closed, the air smelled different in here than the ship usually did. Maybe a little mustier? But not in a bad way. Kind of like when Grandma pulled out her antique paperback romance novels. (She said she kept them as collectors’ items, but I know she read them at night, very carefully.)</p>\n<p>The woman was still netting things out of the air, teeny tiny things, especially around the opening of the air ducts. They were actually super pretty, bright electric pinks and oranges, but I was getting a sinking feeling about this.</p>\n<p>“Do you need any—” I started to say at the same time as she shouted “The beads! We have to collect the beads!”</p>\n<p>Oh, so that’s what they were!</p>\n<p>Oh. Shit. And that’s why this was bad.</p>\n<p>Look, I’m a proper-raised ship’s kid. And I’ve lived in closed systems long enough to realize that tiny bits of debris floating into the wrong areas, where delicate machinery needs to keep machining, was a <i>baaad</i> idea.</p>\n<p>“My suction hose is broken,” she raced to explain. Her voice was soft, but her words tripped over each other, like each one was scared of the one coming up behind it. “I thought I could just… I know what I’m doing, but the vial tipped over so fast, and my hands….”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/06/19/escape-pod-998-the-carina-nebula/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I had the autopilot off because at least flying the ship gave me a task to focus on, though as tasks went, it was far from challenging. This area of space was truly a void—there weren’t even micrometeoroid clouds to avoid, or random space junk to scan and analyze. Two more weeks of this—I wasn’t sure how I was going to survive. I knew that I would, of course. It was just going to be an incredibly painful two weeks.</p>\n<p>And then, at the end of it, I would be free. My criminal record would be expunged, and I would be released from the clutches of Veduvis Authority, free at last to return home and resume the life I had started all those years ago.</p>\n<p/><p>I heard Eilan in the shower shortly after 0830, and then heard them moving about in the galley. The smell of coffee reached me soon after.</p>\n<p>“I don’t suppose you want some,” they called up to me.</p>\n<p>“No, but a cup of oil wouldn’t go amiss.”</p>\n<p>They came into the cockpit a few minutes later carrying two steaming mugs. They handed me the one full of warm oil.</p>\n<p>“Most people don’t think to warm it up,” I said, touched. “Thank you.”</p>\n<p>Eilan gave a crooked smile. That, coupled with thirteen hours of rest, made them look their age. I was struck, again, by how young they were—not much older than my eldest, truly. “I’ve met other androids before.”</p>\n<p>“Have you?” I asked, surprised. Even I had only ever met one other like me, and that had been years ago. “Where?”</p>\n<p>“Gods, <i>everywhere</i>,” Eilan said. “I’ve been to every system that we rule. My parents believed it was important for me to spend some time on every planet, to get to know as much about every culture and society as I could. So I would understand their needs when I came to power.”</p>\n<p>“Your parents were wise,” I said, and Eilan nodded.</p>\n<p>“They were. I miss them.” Eilan scrubbed a hand over their face. “I could use their guidance about now.”</p>\n<p>They turned to me and asked, with naked fear and hope, “Do you think I’d make a good ruler?”</p>\n<p>I was startled by the question. “I don’t know enough about you to say.”</p>\n<p>Eilan arched an eyebrow at me. “But you’re offering me safe passage back to the palace. Surely you wouldn’t, if you didn’t want me to rule. If you wanted me dead instead.”</p>\n<p>“If I wanted you dead, you already would be,” I agreed. “I’m fairly indifferent to the monarchy, Highness. It doesn’t affect us much on Veduvis. Your grandparents oversaw the creation of my kind, for which I’m grateful, and your parents gave us our rights and freedom. If you were to retract any of that, <i>then</i> I would take issue with you. But I don’t believe that’s the case.”</p>\n<p>“No,” they murmured, “it isn’t. So why are you here, then?”</p>\n<p>I shrugged. “I’m under orders from my director.”</p>\n<p>“That’s a lot for someone to ask, even of an employee.”</p>\n<p>“It is,” I agreed. “But she’s… persuasive.”</p>\n<p>“How so?”</p>\n<p>There seemed little point in lying. “I get my freedom once I complete this mission.”</p>\n<p>Eilan stared at me. “What?”</p>\n<p>“I’m a criminal. A good one—at least until I got caught. I was given a choice: be reprogrammed, or put my skills to good use with Veduvis Authority and earn my freedom. The director will release me from my contract once this is over. I’ll be able to return home.” I shrugged. “Sorry, Highness. I’m not doing this for any altruistic reason. It simply benefits me.”</p>\n<p>Eilan propped their feet on the console. “Where’s home for you?”</p>\n<p>“The valley.”</p>\n<p>“Got anybody waiting for you there?”</p>\n<p>“My husbands. Our children.”</p>\n<p>“How many?”</p>\n<p>“Husbands, or children?” At Eilan’s look, I said, “Two and three.”</p>\n<p>“One for each parent. That must make things easy.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/06/12/escape-pod-997-sanctuary-part-2-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>LOS ANGELES — <i> Truthfully, Nancy Buchanan: A Retrospective</i> at the Brick, a comprehensive survey of the LA-based artist’s work, is as sprawling and diverse as the city she calls home. Buchanan studied art at the University of California, Irvine, from 1965 to 1971, along with fellow classmates (and single mothers) Barbara T. Smith and Marcia Hafif, who would become her longtime friends and collaborators. Soon, LA peers Chris Burden, Ulysses Jenkins, and Michael Zinzun, among many others, would also work with Buchanan, together helping to define the 1970s Southern California art scene. As core faculty at the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) for more than 30 years, as well as a founding member of the experimental F Space Gallery, and an integral part of </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://thewomansbuilding.org\">the Woman’s Building</a>, Buchanan has remained deeply engaged with the city’s artistic community for more than five decades.</p>\n    <p>The exhibition’s curators draw from an expansive body of work spanning video, performance, drawing, painting, sculpture, collage, and installation. Each of the space’s nine galleries focuses on a theme that runs through Buchanan’s oeuvre, such as hair, interiors, and consumption. Early works reveal her eager engagement with both feminist politics and consumer culture; in the mock video advertisement “These Creatures” (1979), images of young women with ghoulishly applied makeup are paired with a male voiceover that asks “Isn’t it amazing that we allow them to live among us, these creatures that we can and do control?”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3-1200x1600.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Equally unsettling are a number of pieces that deal with military intervention and weapons technology. The installations “<a href=\"https://primo.getty.edu/primo-explore/fulldisplay/GETTY_ALMA21126289310001551/GRI\">Fallout from the Nuclear Family</a>” (1980) and “Security” (1985) incorporate documents from Buchanan’s father’s career as a nuclear physicist and the artist’s own research into his complicated involvement in the development of atomic weapons. In the same gallery, “…And Babies?” (2003–6) presents a large glass jar, like one might see in a laboratory setting, containing a video projection of malformed fetuses and deceased babies that Buchanan witnessed in a hospital in Vietnam, preserved to document the effects of the US use of Agent Orange in that country in the 1960s. Perhaps more horrifying is that Buchanan’s work could easily be replicated to reference <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/30/faulluja-birth-defects-iraq\">the birth defects caused by depleted uranium used in the US invasion of Iraq in 2004</a>, and other untold military conflicts.</p>\n    <p>Indeed, the main takeaway from this retrospective is that the issues Buchanan began grappling with in the 1970s — misogyny, racism, the climate crisis, government secrecy, warfare, gentrification, and unbridled capitalist consumption — are not past threats but hauntingly present ones. In the video sculpture “American Dreams #7: The Price is Wrong” (1991), a miniature model of a living room, lavishly decorated with fine art paintings and gilded furnishings, holds a small television set broadcasting part of a speech by Oakland’s progressive mayor, Ron Dellums, along with attorney Mary Lee and writer Mike Davis, discussing LA’s speculative real estate market and the communities being overlooked. Nearly 30 years later,<a href=\"https://thegepi.org/the-origins-of-californias-housing-crisis/\"> the number of California’s unhoused residents is at an all-time high</a>. If this all feels a bit dispiriting, let hope be found in Buchanan’s artistic practice itself. Hers is an enduring legacy of creating communal strength amid forces that seek to divide.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2-1200x1600.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/NB2-1200x1329.jpg?resize=1200%2C1329&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/NB7-1200x937.jpg?resize=1200%2C937&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1-1200x1600.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Truthfully, Nancy Buchanan: A Retrospective</i>at The Brick, Los Angeles</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/NB5-1200x999.jpg?resize=1200%2C999&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Truthfully, Nancy Buchanan: A Retrospective</i>at The Brick, Los Angeles</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/NB4-1200x1464.jpg?resize=1200%2C1464&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_9-1200x1600.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Truthfully, Nancy Buchanan: A Retrospective</i>at The Brick, Los Angeles</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://the-brick.org/buchanan\">Truthfully, Nancy Buchanan: A Retrospective</a> <i>continues at The Brick (518 North Western Avenue, Melrose Hill, Los Angeles) through September 20.

    "body": "<p>CHICAGO — The Impressionist artists working in France in the 1800s clearly liked women. While landscapes and still lifes studded their oeuvres, they turned repeatedly to the subjects of dancers, opera singers, boaters, bathers, strollers, book readers, barmaids, and picturesque, rosy-cheeked gals in fashionable gowns and big hats. Male painters found the female form not only tantalizing but a symbol of modernity, as women explored new social access and fashions. They felt that being artists gave them license to peer (or leer).</p>\n<p>Only recently have art historians shed light on another, lesser-known Impressionist artist, Gustave Caillebotte, whose contrarian gaze primarily focused on men and the male body. A major exhibition of his work that originated at the Musée d’Orsay in Paris is now on view at the Art Institute of Chicago. The midwestern museum choose to change the show’s title from the original <i>Gustave Caillebotte: Painting Men</i> to the less definitive <i> Gustave Calllibotte: Painting His World</i>. Both are apt.</p>\n<p>The show, to its credit, does not speculate on Caillebotte’s sexuality, but rather floats intrigue: Why did this artist choose to focus on the male body? The question teases the viewer by way of wall labels that identify his models as bachelors and note that he lived out of wedlock with a woman, with little known about the nature of their relationship. She is listed as “friend” in census data. The show charts Caillebotte’s path from Paris haute bourgeois life to a country home along the Seine where a coterie of male friends frequently visited. Here, plein-air painting, yachting, and gardening occupied him until his death at age 45. These facts function to keep the audience scrutinizing the paintings like detectives searching for evidence of homoerotic desire (or not). The AIC’s Gloria Groom, who co-curated the show, stated declaratively in the French newspaper <i>Le Figaro</i>, “His subject matter is radical during the time because men were not supposed to stare at men, and he’s staring at men.” </p>\n<p>The most riveting painting in the exhibition, “Man at his Bath” (1884), portrays a well-built, naked man from the back as he towels his upper torso. His pale buttocks are tinged with pink after the hot soak. The masculine stance of splayed feet allows for the painterly definition of each leg. A night shirt or towel occupies the floor in the foreground with his shoes near a chair holding folded clothing. Wet footprints mark his trail, bringing an immediacy to the scene. Compare this to Edgar Degas’s many female bathers, who bend, turn, and scrub in awkward poses that are far less sexy. The composition suggests that someone is watching — it’s the lingering gaze of the artist. Caillebotte was a friend and collector of Pierre-Auguste Renoir; one wonders if this is a “cheeky” response to paintings in Caillebotte’s collection, such as “The Swing” (1876), that depict pink-cheeked maidens. In the same room, his only female nude, “Nude on a Couch” (c. 1880), shows an unidealized, thin woman reclining, with clothes piled around. Everything except her face is carefully rendered, including pubic hair and pale skin. The light is specific, from a nearby window. The painting’s unembellished, private immediacy feels unique to the time period.</p>\n<p>A less-finished painting nearby, “Man Drying his Leg” (1884), reveals a greater Degas influence. Here, the same model sits naked in a chair, his leg resting on the edge of the bath as he towels himself. While the beauty of the body has classical echoes, the intimate domestic scene feels voyeuristic. There is no distanced allegorical or mythological overlay, nor any type of Jacques-Louis David “Death of Marat” (1793) heroism.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037994/gustave-caillebotte-impressionist-ode-to-male-sensuality/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>When Rami Metal walks through the scores of booths at the Armory Show, he looks not only for attention-grabbing paintings but also those that would make great puzzles.</p>\n<p>“I try to find things that are more detailed and have more variance of color,” he said. “If you have 1,000 pieces and 200 of them are pieces of sky, it’s not fun. You’ll get through 80 percent of the puzzle and say, ‘Ugh, the sky.’”</p>\n<p>Museum gift shops have sold puzzle sets of Impressionist and abstract masterworks for years, but there have been few options on the market featuring works by living artists who haven’t yet had their MoMA retrospective.</p>\n<p>That’s starting to change. A handful of independent jigsaw companies, including Metal’s <a href=\"https://hellokinstler.com/\">Kinstler Puzzles</a> and <a href=\"https://www.apostrophepuzzles.com/\">Apostrophe Puzzles</a>, have been licensing the work of painters virtually unknown outside the art world for their brainteasers. </p>\n<p>Apostrophe founder Mandi Masden was inspired to launch her Brooklyn-based puzzle company in 2019 after she came across a portrait by artist Charly Palmer that was outside her budget. Her friend gave her a custom puzzle of the artwork instead, prompting her to think about how puzzles could make contemporary art more accessible to the public.</p>\n<p>“I was really into puzzles as a kid, and I knew a lot of us had memories of them from our childhoods, but the industry itself felt stuck in the past,” Masden said. “I wanted to make puzzles that focused on celebrating the talent, creativity, and perspective of artists of color, while catering to a segment of the market largely ignored by the industry.”</p>\n<p>Metal, also a passionate puzzler, found himself fitting together tiny cardboard pieces of Pieter Bruegel’s “The Tower of Babel” (c. 1563) and Hieronymus Bosch’s “The Garden of Earthly Delights” (c. 1490–1510) for hours at a time well into adulthood. It was while he gallery-hopped in Chelsea and breezed through art fairs that he realized that the worlds of art puzzles and contemporary art rarely overlapped, and became inspired to combine them.</p>\n<p>Pitching the idea of producing puzzles out of contemporary art to galleries and artists before he actually launched his business was harder. But Washington-based artist Andrea Joyce Heimer liked the concept, and licensed a rendition of her 2019 painting, “In The Summer We Started Drinking During The Hot Of The Day And By Night Time We Were Monsters.” He launched Kinstler in 2021 with two additional puzzles by artists Simone Johnson and Rusudan Khizanishvili.</p>\n<p>This month, Kinstler is releasing a new puzzle of Korean artist Ken Gun Min’s 2023 painting “Stranger by the Lake (Bare Ass Creek),” an homage to a nude sunbathing spot in Los Angeles that was destroyed in a 2009 fire. Min, too, has loved playing with puzzles since he was a child. He was fascinated by the fact that individual fragments didn’t make visual sense until he fitted them together. Now he sees comparisons between the visual riddles and his current practice.</p>\n<p>“There’s a mix of abstraction and spontaneity — gestural brushstrokes, layers of pigment meeting embroidery — but when you step back, they come together to form a story,” Min said.</p>\n<p>For Masden, a good puzzle starts with a compelling image that tells a story and has a strong point of view. She also loves discovering nuances of brushwork and the layers of depth in a mixed media piece.</p>\n<p>“There’s something really poetic about the image that emerges from 1,000 tiny pieces of someone’s curiosity and exploration, and I love being surprised by where that journey takes me,” she said.</p>\n<p>Both Kinstler and Apostrophe have recruited a diverse stable of artists who earn a commission for every purchase, and their games are available for purchase in museums and bookstores across the country. The latter also donates a portion of each sale to a nonprofit organization working to expand arts education for communities of color.</p>\n<p>Lately, Metal has been drawn to work with subtle shifting color gradients and lots of visual activity. Umar Rashid’s “Battle of Malibu” (2020) portrays a fictitious uprising of Los Angeles-area Indigenous tribes against a European imperial force.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037461/the-rise-of-contemporary-art-puzzles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>If American museums were the only source of information about Tibetan Buddhist shrines, one would come away with the impression that shrines are elaborate, pristine environments layered with <i>thangka </i>paintings and silken finery amidst rows of statuary and ritual objects organized atop beautifully crafted wooden furniture. Enveloped by recordings of soft Buddhist chanting and illuminated by flickering LED butter lamps, the shrine rooms of the former Rubin Museum of Himalayan Art in New York and the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Asian Art in Washington, DC suspend visitors in a sumptuous, carefully curated environment. To this end, curators have intentionally omitted labels or didactics, ostensibly to preserve the viewer’s contemplative experience. Touted as “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/04/arts/design/rubin-museum-closing-art-asia-buddhism.html\">magnificent</a>” and seen as a “<a href=\"https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/rubin-museum-tibetan-buddhist-shrine-room\">refuge in uncertain times</a>,” these immersive spaces have long captivated the public and media alike. But what if these beloved spaces, attracting thousands of visitors each year, are just sites of appropriation — of both tangible and intangible cultural heritage? In light of the Brooklyn Museum of Art’s recent opening of its six-year loan of the Rubin Museum’s Tibetan Buddhist Shrine Room, I think the question is worth reexamining.</p>\n<p>The sensory-immersive “Tibetan Buddhist Shrine Rooms” popular in American museums since 2010 differ markedly from their predecessors of the 1930s and ’40s, when institutions such as the Newark Museum of Art in New Jersey and the Jacques Marchais Museum of Tibetan Art in Staten Island displayed modest altars featuring Tibetan Buddhist devotional objects. Collector Alice Kandell first promoted the immersive shrine experience when she gifted a collection of over 220 Tibetan Buddhist objects to the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery of the Smithsonian. In a 2013 essay in <a href=\"https://archetype.co.uk/our-titles/art-of-merit/?id=193\"> Art of Merit</a>, Kandell writes about this gift and her collecting practices, claiming that she “wanted the shrine to be as authentic as it would have been in Tibet.” A quotation from Smithsonian curator Debra Diamond notes the restrictions that came with Kandell’s gift, such as the “long-term display of the objects within a </p>\n<p><i>liturgically appropriate</i>and distinctly separate shrine room gallery” (emphasis added), which the Smithsonian obliged. In 2010, the Rubin Museum of Art (RMA) accepted a loan of Kandell’s “shrine”; in 2013, it created its own version and kept it on view until 2024. Kandell shrines have also been displayed at the Michael C. Carlos Museum at Emory University (2016) and gifted to the</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2024/09/13/a-gilded-tibetan-buddhist-shrine-room-opens-at-mia\">Minneapolis Institute of Art</a>.</p>\n<p>In these aforementioned displays, the “shrines” are similarly constructed, with a shared palette of dark blues and reds accented with yellow and gold. <i>Thangkas</i> (paintings) often hang on the central wall, and gilt metal statuary is placed along a pyramid-like organization spilling down from the intricately carved cabinetry. All examples have embroidered banners, and some have a silk baldaquin that hangs over the central area of the shrine, often with sculptures of a wheel and two deer. By regurgitating what is largely the same shrine, however, museums are both negating the limitless variations of <i>actual</i> shrines and peddling a Western aesthetic of a “traditional” or “authentic” Tibetan shrine that is without any scholarly or historical backing. </p>\n<p>For example, in January 2025, SmartHistory released an episode misleadingly titled “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW1GMlnAyQk\">Tibetan Buddhist Shrine Room</a>,” which in fact only documents the RMA’s installation. As Elena Pakhoutova, curator of the RMA’s “shrine room” explains, the display is a <i>“</i>curated installation that presented the objects how they may have been displayed and used in a traditional Tibetan Buddhist household.” Museum installations lean problematically on the language of “tradition” and “authenticity” without scholarly backing for these claims. One is left asking: What time periods and regions inform these museum constructions? As it stands, the installations are largely ahistorical, apart from the fact that the individual objects themselves are well dated and researched. This is precisely the problem: Such curated constructions function more as a vehicle for <i>displaying</i> a collection than as documentation of actual shrines. Without knowledge of the lived ritual practices and historic moments that give rise to shrine environs, and without historical, ethnographic, or archival evidence to ground claims, these museum reconstructions largely remain unfounded fabrications.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038180/the-fetishistic-fiction-of-museum-tibetan-shrines/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>We have most of what we think about creativity wrong. So often, we treat it like something to optimize, monetize, or turn into proof of productivity. We rush to measure the end result instead of noticing what the practice itself gives us.<br/>But the real magic of creativity is quieter than that. It’s in the sketch you never show anyone, the scraps of sentences in your notes app, the watercolor that looks nothing like the photo you were copying. There’s such psychological importance to making things for no reason at all. It’s nonperformative creative work—the kind no one else has to see—that builds a life you actually want to live.<br/>Lately, I’ve been writing pieces that don’t leave my hard drive. They exist only for me, and that has been strangely transformative. Making for the sake of making changes how I see the world, how I see myself, and even how I approach the creative work I share publicly.<br/>If you’re craving a spark for your own practice, these four books have been foundational in reminding me why creativity matters and how to return to it with less pressure and more play.</p>\n<p>This book is both memoir and manual, guiding readers through the process of transforming pain into meaning. Jaouad writes about illness and survival, but more importantly, she writes about what it means to create while living inside uncertainty. Her essays and prompts remind me that creativity is less about self-expression and more about self-connection—a way to turn what’s heavy into something that holds light.</p>\n<p>This is the book every writer I know has underlined to death, and for good reason. Lamott’s advice is practical—write a “shitty first draft,” take things one step at a time—but what really sticks is her humor and humanity. She makes the act of writing feel possible, even when you’re staring down a blank page. For me, it’s a reminder that showing up, imperfectly, is the only path forward. I keep it on my desk because simply looking at the cover reminds me to just get something on the page.</p>\n<p>Part memoir, part art, this book is about writing while not writing about writing. It is immersive and sometimes strange, but ultimately really beautiful. Shapton reminds me that my creative practice doesn’t have to fit a mold. It can spill across mediums and categories, and still be deeply resonant. It made me think about my work in a different way, that I didn’t need to make it make sense for it to be worth creating. I feel more permission to experiment in my own work, to let process matter more than product. It is currently difficult to find, thanks to its recent uptick in popularity, but it’s worth waiting for your reissued copy to arrive.</p>\n<p>Rubin strips creativity back to its essence. His reflections are less about “how to make something” and more about “how to notice what’s already here.” This perspective has helped me see clearly again and again. It’s a meditation on coming back to doing, not critiquing. This book is like a gentle but firm hand on the shoulder, reminding you that creativity is not a scarce resource. It’s always available if you’re willing to pay attention. For me, it’s a grounding practice: Return to awareness, and the work will follow. There is an endless well within. I keep it in my nightstand.</p>\n<p>Each of these books reminds me that creativity doesn’t need an audience to matter. In fact, the most meaningful work often happens offstage. It can be scribbles in a notebook, a sketch that no one sees, a story you write just to find out how it ends. That kind of making isn’t about impressing or proving anything. It’s about remembering that you’re a person who creates, and letting that practice feed you in ways the outside world never could.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

This is especially important to me since I love cooking in this space and do it nearly every single day. Over time, I’ve developed a kitchen organization system that isn’t necessarily pretty but that works really well for me.</p>\n    <p>Every single ingredient and piece of cookware in our kitchen has a dedicated place. This includes small appliances, pots and pans, lids, food storage containers, and more. I don’t focus on perfection or making sure every single cabinet and drawer is perfectly organized—I simply make sure everything fits and goes back to its spot once I’m done using it. Things do get a bit unorganized after a couple of months (partially because I’m not the only one using this space), but it takes less than half an hour to fix. In my mind, that means this is a winning organization solution for our family.</p>\n    <p>This rule is most noticeable in our kitchen’s large pantry cabinet. Here, <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/10/pantry-organization-tips/\">I organize every ingredient</a> we have by how I cook. Similar items stay together, such as beans and rice, noodles, cooking oils, and baking ingredients. I also store almost everything in clear containers that allow me to easily see what we have on hand (and know when it’s time to refill ingredients). <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3QCiuoa\">These containers</a> are my favorite! I like to cook through most of what we have in the pantry before restocking, which means every month or two I wipe down the containers, refill them, and clean out whatever has expired. </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Find more details on all of my favorite organization products  in this post.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>We have a baseline level of cleanliness we try to maintain in the kitchen.

These are the non-negotiable tasks we do every night (or most nights):</p>\n    <p>We don’t have a perfect track record of completing all of these things every single night—and that’s okay.

    "body": "<p>I spent last week in Prince Edward Island with family, and this wasn’t the kind of trip I could have planned on my own. Prince Edward Island has a way of looking simple on the surface (think red roads, green fields, lighthouses), but without insider knowledge, it takes some help to know how to move through it. And for that, I owe a big thank you to my sister (and many of you).<br/>She handled most of the research—digging through maps, blogs, and follower DMs to build out a route that balanced exploration and ease. We traveled with my daughter, tried to avoid overscheduling, and somehow ended up with a weeklong Prince Edward Island itinerary that felt… effortless. I owe that all to my sister!<br/>We stayed in a mix of spots across the island. Charlottetown, Cavendish, and back again, which gave us access to beaches, national parks, and towns without spending hours in the car. Lodging in PEI can be tricky during peak season, but we booked in April/May and stayed flexible. We looked into everything from old inns to seaside cottages to slightly chaotic multi-bedroom Airbnbs.</p>\n<p>I’m sharing what we did, what we loved, and what we’d recommend if you’re planning your own quiet, snack-filled, slow-moving week on the island. You can also reference <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/sYWkvA9AEUbSJYah6\">this map</a> to find the locations and addresses.</p>\n<p><strong>Lodging: </strong><a href=\"https://www.roddvacations.com/hotels/rodd-charlottetown/\">Rodd Charlottetown</a><strong>Location: </strong>Charlottetown<strong>Vibe: </strong>Historic hotel downtown, convenient for walking and adjusting to the slower pace.<br/>We flew in and met up with my sister, who arrived the day before! We stayed downtown for one night to get our bearings and reset before heading toward the coast. This gave us a chance to explore Charlottetown without needing a rental car right away. We did a short walking loop through the city (into some bookstores, of course)—just enough to stretch after travel and see what Charlottetown feels like: a bit coastal, a bit quiet, very charming, and very into lobster.<br/>We tried <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/5YuYyZ8DVoip7wBdA\">The Chip Shack</a> lobster roll, which wasn’t worth writing home about, to be honest. Then we found a table at <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/4P4T7iz9VKkHwLTZ8\">Peakes Quay</a> that had a good kids’ menu, and Bennett ate two plates of chicken strips while we played Sleeping Queens. The area was really fun and full of people on vacation. We stood in a long line to get ice cream at <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/GuABpynAfohPsMox6\">COWS</a> (which was worth it and soon became a nightly ritual for the entirety of the trip). </p>\n<p><strong>Lodging:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vrbo.com/en-ca/cottage-rental/p9951218\">Red Island Getaway VRBO</a><i> </i><strong>Locations: </strong>Charlottetown, Avonlea Village, and Cavendish<strong>Drive Time:</strong> ~45 minutes from Charlottetown to Cavendish<strong>Vibe:</strong> A day of puttering, small finds, and rain that felt kind of cinematic.<br/>We started the day with breakfast at <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/A6VyUrv7Mzn7vXJv8\">The Cork and Cast</a> on Victoria Row, where I had my first of many delicious Caesars (Canada’s version of a Bloody Mary but with a salty, briny twist). Get the breakfast sandwich and the fish cakes.<br/>Then we wandered. The city had a little craft fair set up, so we walked through that, hit a couple of used bookstores, and found one of our favorite trip souvenirs: a hand-carved rabbit driving a carrot-shaped car, handmade by a local brand called Woodypix. My sister got a cat driving a rainbow trout. We were extremely into it. I bought a fish bracelet that I am very into at <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/V8UBqbN6R5y19DU27\">Mrs Peakes Fancy Goods</a>, which was my favorite gift shop in that area. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/08/prince-edward-island-itinerary/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>I’ve long been a lover of thrifting and antiquing—for home decor, furniture, clothing, kids’ toys, and more. While the process may take a little longer, I think it’s well worth the extra time and energy. There are so many high-quality, unique pieces <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2020/12/how-to-seek-out-unique-secondhand-pieces-online/\">to be found secondhand</a>.</p>\n    <p>Over time, I’ve developed a go-to process that helps me navigate the world of thrifting and antiquing with more ease and intention.</p>\n    <p>It’s so helpful to have a list written down before you step foot in a thrift or antique store. This will help you stay focused on the things that will actually add value to your life, and not get distracted by things that will only become extra clutter. In my most recent thrifting trip, I was specifically searching for a new pair of jeans and a white button-up shirt, which helped me hone in my search in the store. I consider a Pinterest board a “list” as well, so if you’re a visual person, that might work for you too.</p>\n    <p>Take a quick lap around the sections where you’re most likely to find what’s on your list. Add things to your cart that catch your attention. Then go back to certain aisles where you think you might find something really specific and want to dig a little deeper. Take a little more time on this second look, because sometimes you might miss things on the first lap.</p>\n    <p>Once you’ve made your way through the store, edit down your cart and return anything to the shelves that you don’t truly need/want. Ask yourself a couple of questions and get specific in your answers.</p>\n    <p>I’ve come across so many great things while thrifting and antiquing, but many of them were items I didn’t actually need at the moment. While the lower price points at many of these stores may be tempting, the reality is that if you don’t edit down what goes in your cart, you’ll probably end up with some things you don’t actually use.</p>\n    <p>The more regularly you go thrifting or antiquing, the better you’ll become at navigating each store and narrowing in on the pieces you really want to bring home. I often like to go to a few stores in one afternoon to make the most of my time. On other occasions, I only have fifteen minutes to spare, so I’ll bop through a store and quickly browse one specific section. Either way, consistency is important when it comes to thrift and antique shopping.</p>\n    <p>Sometimes when I go to a thrift or antique store, I don’t find anything to bring home. That’s okay. You’ll find the items on your list when you find them—you can’t rush the process. Thrifting and antiquing are about the hunt. For me, it’s about finding unique pieces that will bring personality and character to my home or wardrobe. And when I find something I love, it’s well worth the time and effort that may have gone into the search.</p>\n    <p>If you’re going to a thrift store that accepts donations, make the most of your trip and bring something (or a couple of things) to donate when you go.</p>\n    <p>Last but certainly not least: If you can help it, never go thrifting or antiquing on an empty stomach (or thirsty, for that matter). Sifting through aisles and aisles of goods requires energy, and it will be a much more enjoyable experience if you’re satiated beforehand.

    "body": "<p>I read every chance I possibly get. Multiple books at a time, often just a few pages when I have a couple of minutes to spare. This is not an endorsement of fragmented consumption; it’s just <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/03/make-time-for-reading/\">how I sneak in some sustenance</a> at this point in my life. I am delighted that my kids love to read too, so we sometimes all sit down and read together at home. It’s become one of those rituals that grounds us. Not without effort, but we’re all more settled into ourselves after we do.<br/>I find a lot of my reading inspiration from people I follow on Instagram, like my sister <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alliearends/\">@alliearends</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/elementstyle/\">@elementstyle</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/brittanychaffee/\">@brittanychaffee</a>. Other recs come from Substacks by great writers (like <a href=\"https://eliseloehnen.substack.com/\">Pulling the Thread</a> by Elise Loehnen) and writers who teach writing (highly recommend <a href=\"https://joshcook.substack.com/\">book(ish)</a> by the brilliant Josh Cook). I look for books that help me see something differently—especially the ones that are quiet, a little strange, or written so beautifully it makes you want to reread a sentence three times.<strong>Today I’m sharing a handful of meaningful reads (around 200 pages or less) that leave you with the quiet sense of,  Oh, this is what life is about. </strong>They’re lovely books to read this summer, or any time of year, for that matter.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>A lyrical meditation on the color blue, grief, desire, and memory.<strong>Why I Love It: </strong>It’s a book you don’t read so much as absorb. Her fragments feel like pieces of a mosaic that, together, make something bigger than the sum of their parts. I return to it when I feel too much or not enough. She says what I am sometimes too afraid to admit to myself.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>Thirty-nine women are imprisoned underground with no explanation. One girl, the youngest of them all, begins to question what else might be possible.<strong>Why I Love It:</strong> It’s eerie and haunting and profound. It made me question everything I thought I knew about identity, freedom, and what it means to be human. I read it twice in one week.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>Set in 1980s Ireland, a coal merchant discovers unsettling truths about a local convent and must decide what kind of man he wants to be.<strong>Why I Love It: </strong>It’s short, sparse, and deeply moving. The kind of book that leaves you with a lump in your throat and a new understanding of quiet courage.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>A raw and intimate diary chronicling the author’s obsessive affair with a younger man.<strong>Why I Love It:</strong> Ernaux doesn’t flinch. The diary is unedited and beautifully written. A portrait of her late 40s, unraveling and itching to self-detonate without apology. She shows you the hunger, the madness, the waiting—and somehow makes it all feel universal.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>A woman refuses to get out of the swimming pool, and in the process, all of the secrets hidden beneath her marriage come out.<strong>Why I Love It: </strong>It’s surreal and sharp, with a thread of humor running through the tension. Reads like a short film. Totally unexpected and totally brilliant.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>A shepherd boy sets out on a journey to find treasure and discovers his personal legend along the way.<strong>Why I Love It:</strong> It’s simple but powerful. A reminder that the answers are often within us—and that the detours are part of the path.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>A dreamlike collection of stories set in a mythical version of the author’s hometown, filled with surreal imagery and poetic prose.<strong>Why I Love It: </strong>Schulz writes like no one else. His stories feel like memories from another life—strange, rich, and a little bit enchanted.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

    "body": "<p>I’ve been thinking about how Joe and I, at our core, share a really deep friendship. Admiration, delight, shorthand jokes, the shebang. But it’s changed over time, as marriages and friendships do. Our kids—whom we love more than words can encapsulate—have become a wedge in some ways. It’s like… we’re co-leads on this high-stakes group project, and we both really don’t want to screw it up. (Spoken as someone with a combined fourteen years of <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2020/10/what-ive-learned-in-10-years-of-therapy/\">therapy</a> under her belt.)<br/>Pressure and structure aren’t ideal conditions for friendship. In this kind of scenario, the sense of lightness, the seeing and being seen, can quietly shrink. We’re in a different phase, one built on resilience, communication, and clarity. But it leaves an opening for closeness that can feel like loss. <strong>We don’t talk about adult friendships like we talk about romantic relationships, but we should. </strong><br/>Because adult friendships can be just as formative and necessary. In many ways, they offer a kind of freedom our romantic or work partnerships can’t. Our friends are not usually directly affected by our decisions, so they can tell us the truth. And if we’re lucky, they delight in us for who we are, not for what we do.</p>\n<p>Lately, I’ve been reaching outside of my marriage for the kinds of friendships that fill in the gaps. I’ve encouraged Joe to do the same. Not in a dramatic or betraying way. We’re just reaching for a connection that nourishes what this busy season of life seems to starve: joy. Spontaneous conversation. Shared curiosity. The kind of love that says, I care about you with no strings attached.<br/>That last part is important.<strong>“No strings attached” means:</strong></p>\n<p>And let’s be honest: A lot of us are so caught up in our own unresolved shit that we’re not even available to be the friend we want.<br/>Friendship, real friendship, is a mirror. But not the shiny kind you hang on the wall. It’s the kind that reflects you back to yourself with love, holding your contradictions without flinching; that reminds you who you are when you forget.<br/>You don’t have to do a lot to keep a friendship alive. You just have to delight in the other person. That’s the key. That’s what we all want. Someone who says, “I see you, and it brings me joy.”<br/>And we can’t just want that—we have to offer it. It doesn’t take big sweeping acts of commitment or even lavish “catch-up” lunches. It takes showing up IN life, rather than sitting on the periphery.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>You don’t have to do a lot to keep a friendship alive. You just have to delight in the other person. That’s the key. That’s what we all want. Someone who says, “I see you, and it brings me joy.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>Cultivating friendships in adulthood doesn’t come naturally to me. It’s something I’ve had to learn slowly, sometimes awkwardly, because it’s also something I’ve deeply longed for. For a lot of my life, I didn’t feel like I had it. Not in the way I craved: mutual, safe, delight-filled. I always felt like I needed to sing and dance my way to connection and safety. <br/>So now, I try to be intentional. I mess up and don’t show up sometimes. But I keep trying. I keep trying to be the friend I want in life. These are a few ways I keep connections alive with friends:</p>\n<p>Sometimes? Friendships change and people drift. Misunderstandings happen. Sometimes things are broken beyond repair. I used to see that as failure. Now I see it as part of being human. When it feels right, I try to repair—reach out, name the hurt, stay open. And when it doesn’t? I let go with love and wish them the best. <strong>Not every friendship lasts forever, but each one teaches you something about who you are and how you love.</strong><br/>You don’t need a big group, perfectly coordinated schedules, or elaborate plans. You just need a few people who make you feel good in your body. Safe in your nervous system. Seen and accepted for who you are.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/06/adult-friendships/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "author": "AventurOO Editorial",
    "body": "<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>LONDON — The Wallace Collection is famous for its trove of Rococo art, such as <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/tag/jean-honore-fragonard/\">Fragonard</a>’s pastel depiction of indulgent flirtation “The Swing” (1767–68), in which a woman with a voluminous skirt kicks a pink slipper into the air with coquettish abandon, closely watched by two male suitors. In his solo exhibition, Grayson Perry responds to these holdings, offering a fever-dream take on Fragonard’s painting in a tapestry entitled “Fascist Swing” (2024). Here, pastels give way to psychedelically bright colors, while the woman’s smiling expression is contorted into a mask of horror. The laughing suitors are also absent — Perry’s protagonist is alone in her mental disintegration. The work depicts a delusion of excess and grandeur much like Fragonard’s, but with a much darker, more frightening tone.</p>\n<p>“Fascist Swing” depicts Perry’s alter ego Shirley Smith, dreamed up for this exhibition as a way to explore both the Wallace Collection and his ideas around gender, class, and mental illness. Smith, Perry tells us, is a working-class Londoner whose mental illness pushed her into “delusions of grandeur,” as the exhibition’s title puts it, leading to a prolonged psychotic breakdown in which she came to believe she was a member of the aristocracy and the rightful heir to Hertford House, the home of the Collection. Smith is based in part on real-life so-called outsider artists who suffered from mental health challenges and delusions, such as Aloïse Corbaz (1886–1964) and Madge Gill (1882–61) — some of whose fascinating works are included at the beginning of the exhibition.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Grayson Perry: Delusions of Grandeur</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Visitors unprepared for Perry’s <i>gesamtkunstwerk</i> approach to this exhibition may be puzzled by this opening room, where the boundary between truth and fiction is bafflingly but effectively blurred. Fictionalized “archival” photographs of and letters by Smith sit beside real documentation of Gill’s activities at the Wallace Collection in the 1940s, with false dates attributed to the former but not the latter, for instance. Unusually, the audio guide is key to entering Perry/Smith’s world; tracks are alternately narrated by Perry and Smith, making for an immersive experience — although it is a shame that Smith is given a caricatured Cockney accent, which creates a lazily stereotyped image of working-class identity. </p>\n<p>The exhibition loosely follows Smith’s life, ending in a quasi-recreation of the bedroom in which she spent her final days. There are some beautiful objects in here, including a cabinet decorated with portraits of women from the Wallace Collection. There is also a piece called “Hospital Queen” (2024), a hand-beaded self-portrait Smith supposedly made during a stay in a mental hospital. This perhaps alludes to our somewhat morbid fascination with such objects. But even though Perry has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/apr/13/grayson-perry-donates-sketch-to-help-mental-health-support-group\">struggled with issues around mental health</a>, his treatment feels a bit flippant. </p>\n<p>Similarly, in “A Tree in a Landscape” (2024), Perry creates a family tree using portrait miniatures from the museum’s collection, labeling each one with a different mental health diagnosis. The caption notes, “We all exhibit some traits that could be pathologized.” Do we? Perry’s analysis feels glib; here, as in his treatment of Smith’s psychosis, he fails to engage with the realities of serious mental illness.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Grayson Perry: Delusions of Grandeur</i>\n    </p>\n<p>This is but one instance of a recurring lack of nuance in some of Perry’s engagements with complex issues. It is evident that he thinks deeply — but not always about the right things in the right places. For instance, “Man of Stories” (2024), a central piece in the exhibition, is a truly (and deliberately) hideous beaded sculpture of a bard-like figure, inspired by “the expert storytellers of the Luba people in central Africa,” according to Perry’s caption. It is not explained why Perry was inspired by this particular culture, or whether the Luba people have any connection to objects held in the Wallace Collection. The caption continues: “One of my ongoing concerns is over-intellectualism in Western culture, so I was fascinated by the idea of a travelling bard.” Is the implication that he is ascribing a desirable non-intellectualism to central African culture? This speaks to me, at best, of a failure to allow viewers to engage with the figure at an intellectual level, and at worst, of exoticism.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1027871/insider-artist-grayson-perry-outsider-alter-ego-wallace-collection/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><i>Cavalier Perspective: Last Essays, 1952-1966</i>(2025) by André Breton, translated by Austin Carder (image courtesy City Lights Books)</p>\n<p>What does Surrealism, a major art movement in the 20th century, have to do with surrealism, a term often used to describe so many uncanny facets of life in the 21st? The word “surreal” was first used in 1917 to describe a ballet choreographed by Jean Cocteau and composed by Erik Satie, with Cubist costumes by Pablo Picasso. Today, it has been used to describe the “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/12/alligator-alcatraz-trump-cruelty\">Alligator Alcatraz</a>” immigrant detention center and the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-04/-it-s-surreal-trump-s-freeze-on-climate-money-sows-fear-and-confusion\">Trump administration’s climate policy</a>. Does the world today merely resemble dreamlike visions by Leonora Carrington and Salvador Dalí? Or is the American mind reaching for a deeper affinity?</p>\n<p>To answer this question, we must turn to André Breton, the architect and apostle of Surrealism. At just 28 years old, Breton <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1006369/the-small-magazines-that-birthed-surrealism/\">established</a> the movement in a 1924 manifesto, where he defined it as manifesting one’s subconscious “in the absence of any control exercised by reason.” His attempt to exert dictatorial powers over this movement would be his undoing, after a caustic Second Surrealist Manifesto in 1929 largely alienated him from his peers for suggesting that he could excommunicate them. But Breton continued to think, write, and speak about Surrealism until his death at age 70. </p>\n<p>In <i>Cavalier Perspective: Last Essays 1952–1966</i>, translated by Austin Carter, an elder Breton appears for the first time in English — gentler, wiser, and far more adept at analyzing the ideological underpinnings of a movement that had ballooned into an international sensation. It’s in these late writings that his ideas about the surreal begin to mingle with our own. </p>\n<p><i>Médium: Communication Surréaliste</i>, which Breton contributed to (image courtesy City Lights Books)</p>\n<p>While it’s now understood instinctively as shorthand for unreality, one of the ironies of Surrealism is that it has never neatly circumscribed a particular style or technique, the way Fauvism or Impressionism once did. In a 1952 essay titled “Link,” Breton explains that this was by design; Surrealism was never meant to simply define an aesthetic. “When I began searching as early as 1936 for the emotional catalyst for Surrealism,” he wrote, “I discovered it right away in the anxiety inherent to a time when human brotherhood was collapsing more and more each day.” He was referring to the period between World Wars, when the “rational” forces of industrial capitalism, fractious nationalism, and global imperialism continued unabated, with violence looming on the horizon again.</p>\n<p>Breton had spent World War I in a neurological ward in Nantes, treating soldiers suffering from what we now understand as PTSD. As poet Garrett Caples writes in his excellent introduction to <i>Cavalier Perspective</i>, Breton “saw firsthand the effects of technologically advanced weaponry on the human psyche” and responded with a system of thought that was both mystical in power and revolutionary in scope. By the 1950s, Breton’s vision of a liberatory anti-rationalism had become fully postcolonial. He hailed France’s Algerian War as “an orgy of crime,” championed the work of Martinican writer Aimé Césaire and Haitian poet Clément Magloire Saint-Aude, and <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2022/07/andre-breton-haiti-revolution-communists-surrealism\">helped foment a student revolution in Haiti</a>.</p>\n<p>In <i>Cavalier Perspective</i>, Breton explores this anti-rationalism as inherently accessible and corrosive to systems of logic that demand conformity and deride creativity. His many short essays of the period championed astrology, Medieval alchemy, games of automatic word association, and emotionally expressive art forms dismissed by mainstream Western institutions as “primitive,” from Celtic poetry to African masks. I was particularly struck by “The Language of Stones,” which suggests that certain polished rocks draw sensitive seekers toward them and may even be imprinted with divine messages. Today, the theory reads like a startlingly familiar concoction of new-age natural mysticism poisoned by a terminally online paranoia that “it’s all connected” — Make America Healthy Again, <i>avant la lettre</i>.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038721/andre-breton-cavalier-perspective-surrealism/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>What’s the opposite of a white cube exhibition? <i> Touch Jamaica</i>, Rejin Leys’s show of paper sculptures set among the period props of a historic home, feels pretty close. The Queens-based Haitian-American artist creates mixed-media work that meditates on displacement due to the climate crisis, political shifts, and the legacy of colonialism. She is also known for the PulpMobile, a paper-making studio she wheels out to public spaces like parks and street fairs for community art-making. Both strains of her work come together in this exhibition featuring relief sculptures of local landmarks — the oldest tree in Jamaica, Queens, architectural details of defunct libraries and theaters —</p>\n<p>\n      <i>at the King Manor Museum, a historic house built by Rufus King, a United States founding father. Taken in this context, these paper works feel like the surface of the densely layered past that is our collective inheritance.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>The King Manor Museum is currently only accessible via guided tours between noon and 4pm, Tuesdays through Saturdays. This creates a unique dynamic: There is no skimming through didactic information here; rather, a staff member — in my case, Hannah — leads you through, room by room. The house itself has been decorated to reflect various periods within its past — an 18th-century room on the first, 19th- on the second — making you feel that you are moving through time. History feels not only alive but in progress: The very person walking with you is currently researching the objects that surround you. It is their archival research that determined the decoration of the library (jaguar pelts, apparently, were all the rage in the 18th century); the reproductions of paintings on the walls (art history lovers will be excited to learn that John Trumbull and Gilbert Stuart painted family members); and, speaking of the anti-white cube, even the color of the paint (plaster painted to look like wood, an original marigold yellow the museum hopes to restore soon).</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Rejin Leys: Touch Jamaica</i>\n    </p>\n<p>It’s fitting, then, that Leys works in paper, a medium so closely associated with archives and record-keeping. In the servants’ preparation room, beside antique muffin tins, dark glass jars, and a weathered wooden storage box, is a thick, pale blue paper sculpture imprinted with some of those very objects. Similar items are strewn around the gallery and the kitchen next door. Between two windows, in a darker blue paper patchwork set against a white wooden armature, for instance, is the imprint of what looks like an arched window with intricate ironwork. Around the corner, also set on a wooden armature, is a cobalt-blue work seemingly cast from a stone monument engraved with the years “1861” and “1865,” the date range of the Civil War.</p>\n<p>Indeed, in this room, it’s impossible to forget that each of us carries a collective history, that no one exists within a vacuum. Hannah, my tour guide, pointed to reproductions of the food that would’ve been available to the house’s early residents: On one side, local items, such as a turkey and potatoes, and on the other, those produced or transported via the labor of enslaved people, such as sugar and lemons. Whereas a white cube induces you to suspend the broader context in favor of the here and now, Leys’s exhibition demands that you see these objects in relation to yourself and the larger world.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Rejin Leys: Touch Jamaica</i>\n    </p>\n<p>I found myself drawn to the formal beauty of the works: the square dimpling and ripped apertures of one piece, the white spatters that dot another midnight blue sculpture like stars. But I felt that I missed Leys’s intention to make present not just the deep past of the 18th and 19th centuries, as represented by this house, and the contemporary, through her objects, but also the many nested layers of history between them. A link included in the exhibition’s didactics takes a viewer to a map of the sites from which Leys drew these impressions, such as a former Queens Public Library, bank, and theater. This information was intellectually engaging, but didn’t penetrate my felt experience; perhaps a Jamaica local might recognize some of these places and be more deeply moved.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038759/rejin-leys-contemporary-art-exhibition-in-an-18th-century-home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Playing on a continuous loop in the Brooklyn Museum’s fifth-floor Moving Image Gallery, which is appointed with nine backless benches, this 55-minute work shares DNA with the artist’s other film and television montages, including his monumental, 24-hour-long film </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>(2010) and</i>\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/55022/six-things-i-learned-and-one-i-didnt-from-christian-marclays-the-clock/\">The Clock</a>\n    <p>\n      <i>(1995), anchored, respectively, in the evolving technologies of time pieces and communication devices.</i>\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.paulacoopergallery.com/exhibitions/christian-marclay2#tab:slideshow\">Telephones</a>\n    <p>In Marclay’s latest mashup, doorways serve as passageways from one scene to the next: When one shuts, another opens, revealing another character in another room and another era.

And so the scenes unfold with an air of a surprise, unknowns lurking and morphing behind every door.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/DIG_E_2025_Christian_Marclay_Doors_07_Paula_Abreu_Pita_PS22-General-Use-JPEG-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Christian Marclay: Doors</i>at the Brooklyn Museum</p>\n    <p>As vexing and disjointed as this premise might sound, the painstaking transitions and match cuts create an internal logic and sense of continuity. Sorrow and searching give way to mischievous escapades, peppered with comedy and crime. Fear simmers. Tension builds. Doors slam and squeak open again, leading into well-to-do homes, modest apartments, workplaces, doctor’s offices, and winding corridors. The result is a labyrinthine, imagined architecture that feels, at turns, like one of M.C. Escher’s <a href=\"https://mcescher.com/gallery/impossible-constructions/\">impossible constructions</a> and the product of the Surrealist parlor game <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/terms/exquisite-corpse\">exquisite corpse</a>, with its neatly matched doorways cobbling together a chimera. Even though the actors, setting, and plot specifics shapeshift every few seconds, as if jumping into a different plane of a multiverse tale, the emotional thrust and action create a propulsive through line that coheres the sea of snippets.</p>\n    <p>In <i>Doors</i>, Marclay makes visible the mindless, forgettable actions of life indoors — turning keys in locks, twisting knobs, entering and exiting spaces — while exploring the ways that doors serve as charged metaphors and well-worn cinematic devices and tropes. This congress of clichés could teeter into tedium. But, with a wink and a nod, the precise editing and absurd juxtapositions between the assembled film excerpts toy with perception, flowing like a dream sequence. Doors double as sites of transformation. Space and time warp. Narratives get remixed and reinvented. Nothing is static, and anything could happen in the next scene. In this art film, as in life, the whole story can change course in an instant.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/DIG_E_2025_Christian_Marclay_Doors_04_Paula_Abreu_Pita_PS22-General-Use-JPEG-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Christian Marclay: Doors</i>at the Brooklyn Museum</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/christian-marclay\">Christian Marclay: Doors</a>\n      <i> continues at the Brooklyn Museum (200 Eastern Parkway, Prospect Heights, Brooklyn) through April 12, 2026.

    "body": "<p>We may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article.</p>\n<p>By mid-August, the pull of fall is impossible to ignore. While the temperatures may still say summer, I’ve learned to embrace what we jokingly call a “fall soft launch”—that sweet spot between seasons where small shifts make our home feel instantly cozier. Think of it as a gentle layering process: swapping breezy summer details for textures, scents, and accents that hint at crisp mornings and golden light.</p>\n<p>If you’re ready to ease into autumn without going full pumpkin patch just yet, we’ve curated simple, design-forward ideas that will carry you seamlessly from summer to fall.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=8 Simple Styling Swaps to Take Your Home from Summer to Fall&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/moody-fall-coffee-table-decor-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Switch Up Your Scents</h2>\n<p>Scent has a remarkable power to set the tone of a season. Begin the transition by tucking away summer’s floral and citrus notes in favor of warm, grounding fragrances—woods, spices, and amber. A candle in the entryway or living room creates an inviting atmosphere, while a subtle diffuser in the bathroom offers a refined touch for guests.</p>\n<h2>Shop Fall Scents</h2>\n<p>Casa Zuma</p>\n<p>P.F. Candle Co.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Camille Styles fall kitchen&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/target-figmint-camille-styles-2-33-1500x2249-ff10621-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Swap Artwork and Framed Photos</h2>\n<p>Think of your walls as part of your seasonal wardrobe. Just like swapping linen for knits, a quick art refresh makes the summer-to-fall transition feel effortless. Frame those vacation photos you’ve been meaning to print, or switch out bright summer art for pieces in moodier tones. It’s an instant vibe shift—and way cheaper than redecorating your whole space.</p>\n<h2>Shop Fall Artwork</h2>\n<p>Hearth &amp; Hand™ with Magnolia</p>\n<p>Threshold™ designed with Studio McGee</p>\n<h2>Prepare Your Kitchen for Cold Weather</h2>\n<p>Nothing says fall like baking pumpkin bread with <i>You’ve Got Mail</i> playing in the background. As the air cools, it’s time to make space for heartier meals and slow-cooked traditions. Bring Dutch ovens and crockpots back into view, refresh dish linens, and tuck away the summer accessories you won’t need until next year. A few small shifts not only prepare your kitchen for cold weather—they set the stage for the comforting rituals of autumn cooking.</p>\n<h2>Shop Fall Kitchen Appliances</h2>\n<p>Crock-Pot</p>\n<p>Le Creuset Signature</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Fall shelf styling in living room.&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/fall-shelf-styling-living-room-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Add Darker-Colored Accents</h2>\n<p>As the days shorten, layering in darker accents creates a home that feels grounded and seasonal. The summer-to-fall transition is the perfect time to rotate in textiles and decor in richer tones—pillows, throws, and candles in palettes of burgundy, mustard, and deep green. A cohesive color story not only enhances the autumn mood but also carries seamlessly into winter, extending the life of your seasonal styling.</p>\n<h2>Shop fall accents</h2>\n<h2>Go Heavy on the Candles</h2>\n<p>Nothing transforms a space faster than candlelight—and fall is the time to go all in. During the summer-to-fall transition, I bring out taper candles in moody shades and scatter them everywhere: mantels, dining tables, coffee tables, you name it. If flames make you nervous, battery-operated candles give the same cozy glow without the worry. Either way, more is more here—lean into the romance of flickering light.</p>\n<h2>Shop Candles</h2>\n<p>SIN</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-23271969\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCharcoal Twisted Taper Candles\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Set of 2</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Fall shelf styling&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/target-shelf-styling-6-1500x2250-ff10621-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Try Moodier Florals</h2>\n<p>Late August is the perfect moment to rethink your floral arrangements. Trade in vibrant summer blossoms for deeper hues, textural grasses, and sculptural branches. Pampas grass, eucalyptus, and faux stems bring both longevity and sophistication, adding a layer of seasonal color to mantels, entryways, or dining tables. These subtle, earthy arrangements set a grounded, autumnal mood throughout your home.</p>\n<h2>Shop fall florals</h2>\n<p>Abigail Ahern</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://rstyle.me/+jFBQ2WEl32CojI8xaqf00w\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t21.25″ Preserved Golden Yarrow Fall Wreath\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Hearth &amp; Hand™ with Magnolia</p>\n<h2>Cozy Throws and Linen Bedding for a Summer-to-Fall Transition</h2>\n<p>One of the easiest fall transition tips is updating your textiles. Swap out lightweight summer throws for chunkier knits, faux fur, or deep-toned blankets to create instant warmth. Style them over couches, chairs, or keep extras in a storage ottoman. In the bedroom, update your look by layering linen bedding with a cozy throw—perfect for chilly fall nights and weekend movie marathons.</p>\n<h2>Shop Cozy Throws &amp; Bedding</h2>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Fall home exterior&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/fall-home-exterior-865x1296.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Tidy Your Home’s Exterior</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I’ve long believed that a happy, healthy life is built on rituals. From your <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/morning-routine/morning-routine-ideas/\">morning routine</a> to your evening wind-down, our days flow with more ease when we anchor them with <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/healthy-daily-habits/\">supportive habits</a>. Rituals cut through decision fatigue and help us weave intention into the everyday. By committing to practices that help us feel our best, we strengthen self-trust—and that reliability becomes a fixture of our days. As a writer, that truth shows itself most in my daily writing rituals.</p>\n<p>Writing is a strange career—part craft, part inspiration. On good days, words spill easily. On others, even a single sentence feels impossible. But my writing ritual is what steadies me. It’s the structure I lean on to move past the blank page and into flow.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Featured image from  our interview with Remi Ishizuka by Michelle Nash.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Woman practicing writing rituals at her desk.&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/writing-rituals/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/janessa-leone-writing-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>What are writing rituals?</h2>\n<p>Writing rituals are the consistent set of steps we take to prepare ourselves before putting pen to paper. While they look different for everyone, writing rituals all serve the same purpose: to feel energized, grounded, and inspired before diving into the work. Sometimes they’re simple; sometimes they’re deeply idiosyncratic. What matters most is that they put us in a headspace with greater freedom to create.</p>\n<p>Think of them as a way to bypass hesitation. When you’ve set the stage—your environment, your mindset, your tools—you can step into writing without overthinking. With fewer variables to wrestle with, you open the door for creative flow.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>History is full of proof that rituals work:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong/>wrote standing at his typewriter, believing the posture helped him stay alert.<a href=\"https://www.timesnownews.com/lifestyle/books/features/ernest-hemingways-stand-up-desk-writing-on-his-feet-and-thinking-on-his-toes-article-113062749\">Ernest Hemingway</a></li>\n      <li><strong/>rented a small hotel room for months at a time, bringing only yellow pads, a dictionary, and a Bible. She needed the quiet separation from home to write.<a href=\"https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2279/the-art-of-fiction-no-119-maya-angelou\">Maya Angelou</a></li>\n      <li><strong/>wrote before dawn, explaining she wanted to “get up before the sun” so the world hadn’t yet placed demands on her.<a href=\"https://gwern.net/morning-writing\">Toni Morrison</a></li>\n      <li><strong/>ended her writing days with a ritual glass of scotch, followed by rereading everything she had written so she could step back in the next morning with confidence.<a href=\"https://lithub.com/on-the-daily-rituals-of-joan-didion-patti-smith-and-more/\">Joan Didion</a></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Each practice is unique, but the principle is the same: consistency creates momentum.</p>\n<h3>Reflection Prompt</h3>\n<p>Before you dive into designing your own writing ritual, pause and ask yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <i>When in the day do I feel most energized?</i>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <i>What spaces or environments make me feel most alive?</i>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <i>What small comforts (music, candle, tea, movement) help me focus?</i>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<p>These questions help you design a ritual that feels natural and inspiring—one you’ll actually want to return to.</p>\n<h2>Writing Rituals to Cultivate for Everyday Inspiration</h2>\n<h3>1. Put Yourself in the Path of Inspiration</h3>\n<p>Many call this “pre-writing,” and while <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-be-creative/\">creativity</a> is often thought of as an inherent trait, I believe it’s an orientation and approach to life. It’s a way of looking at the world with hope and optimism, understanding that every day is an opportunity to amplify the inputs you take in. The best writing doesn’t come from staring at the page—it comes from what you notice and absorb before you sit down.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Try experimenting with simple inspiration rituals like:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Carrying a notebook (or using your Notes app) to capture thoughts before they disappear.</li>\n      <li>Beginning each writing session by free-writing for five minutes about anything that’s on your mind.</li>\n      <li>Reading a poem, essay, or a page of a <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/beautifully-written-books/\">favorite book</a>to spark rhythm and language.</li>\n      <li>Taking a short walk to reset your energy and let ideas rise to the surface.</li>\n      <li>Creating an “inspiration box”: a collection of quotes, images, or snippets of writing that fuel you.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h3>Reflection Prompt</h3>\n<p><i>What practices make me feel most energized to create? Am I more inspired after reading, walking, or spending quiet time alone?</i> Experiment with one practice for a week and see how it shifts your writing energy.</p>\n<h3>2. Habit Stack Your Writing</h3>\n<p>It’s no secret—we love <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/habit-stacking/\">habit stacking</a>. By pairing a desired habit with one you already practice, the behavioral technique makes it easier for you to incorporate and build new rituals into your life. And spoiler: writing can be one of them.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/writing-rituals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I used to think training for a marathon was all about control. You hit your miles, you nail your splits, you stack perfect weeks on top of each other until race day finally arrives. A simple equation: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-wake-up-early/\">discipline in</a>, results out. But life has a way of rewriting the plan, and a few months into training for this race, my dad got sick.</p>\n<p>My dad is quiet but determined, someone who has always measured his life in motion. Mountain biking along the rugged trails near his home in Vermont. Playing hockey three nights a week well into his late 60s. Hiking the Long Trail’s 272 miles from Massachusetts to Canada. Moving his body has always been his way of making himself known to others. So it feels like a particular kind of loss that cancer has taken that away.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Featured image from  our interview with Sanne Vloet by Michelle Nash.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>This summer, the one that’s seen him moving through rounds of radiation and chemo, has been heavy with guilt. A constant tug-of-war. When I’m training, I feel like I should be with him. When I’m with him, I feel like I should be training. I’m trapped in this exhausting narrative of <i>shoulds</i>—never fully where I am, never enough of anything. And sometimes, if I’m honest, I feel selfish. Chasing a finish time, a personal best, when his body is fighting for something far more essential.</p>\n<p>Every missed run felt like a strike against me, each skipped workout a reminder that the neat, color-coded plan I’d taped to my fridge was unraveling. I told myself I’d lost my shot at a 3:30 marathon. But somewhere between the late nights at my dad’s house and the early mornings I ran anyway, something shifted. I started to see my training for the Chicago marathon less as a performance and more as a practice—a small act of steadiness I could return to, even when everything else was falling apart. The miles became less about proving myself and more about carrying myself through.</p>\n<h2>Letting Go of Perfect</h2>\n<p>When I first typed my marathon training plan in the Notes app of my phone, I believed in it like scripture. 16 weeks in neat little boxes, promising that if I showed up, I’d get what I wanted: 3 hours and 30 minutes. I loved the clarity. So much of life resists control, but here was something that said: if you just do A, you’ll get to B.</p>\n<p>In the first weeks, I lived inside that plan. Early mornings, long runs that stretched into weekends, little victories when I nailed my paces. I felt like someone who could follow through, who could be counted on. Maybe the rest of my life could feel like that too—organized, predictable, clean.</p>\n<p>Spoiler: nope. The body doesn’t always respond the way you want it to. Neither does life. I missed runs when my dad’s health needed me elsewhere, and when I came back, the training plan no longer looked like a map—it looked like a ledger of failure. I could feel the time slipping, that 3:30 finish pulling further out of reach.</p>\n<p>But even in those messy, uneven weeks, I kept running. Not perfectly, and not according to plan. Just forward.</p>\n<h2>The Quiet Lessons Between the Miles</h2>\n<p>Some runs were little more than a shuffle. After nights in the hospital, my legs felt like lead, my chest tight with worry. Even then, there was relief in the rhythm. The stale hospital air would still cling to me, but the first gulp of fresh air outside felt like oxygen for both of us. I often thought my dad would give anything to trade places—out of the fluorescent rooms, into the cool morning, breathing alongside me.</p>\n<p>Other mornings, the road surprised me with grace. The air cool before dawn, the sky breaking open in pink. Runs like that felt like gifts. My chest loosened, my thoughts slowed. For a little while, I could just breathe.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/marathon-training/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In my early 20s, I didn’t think it was worth the effort to personalize a rental. (This was a temporary space, so why bother?) Over time, however, I realized I didn’t feel relaxed or at ease in my home. The beige walls, overhead lighting and thrown-together <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/furniture-for-small-spaces/\">furniture</a> and decor I had left me feeling unsettled. Learning how to turn my rented apartment into a home was the beginning of my love affair with interior design.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Featured image from  our interview with Radhi Devlukia Shetty by Michelle Nash.</i>\n    </p>\n<h2>10 Interior Design Tips for Renters</h2>\n<p>Through trial and error, I’ve discovered that living in a rental doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice style or a personalized space just because you don’t own your home. There is so much you can do—from <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-2024-paint-color-trends/\">paint</a> and wallpaper to upgrading fixtures and lighting. Ahead, I’ve rounded up the best interior design tips for renters from my personal experience in turning beige boxes into warm and stylish homes. </p>\n<h2>Paint</h2>\n<p>Rental walls usually come in a safe, neutral beige which may appear… well, a bit boring. The best interior design tip for renters I can give is to love up on your walls. Give them a makeover by adding a bit of color or by choosing a neutral that suits you better. Even taking your walls from a beige to a crisp white will brighten up your space significantly. Most landlords have no problem with paint as long as you’re willing to paint the walls back to the original color once you move out, or they may even let you keep it.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite things to paint is the interior of my front door. My current landlord, as well as my previous one, said I can leave it as is when it’s time to move out. I love pink, so my front door is Sherwin-Williams Coral Perfection. It’s a delightful pop of color that makes me smile every time I look at it. Plus, it makes our entryway is cheery and inviting. The whole project was less than $20—proving that paint is an affordable way to make a big impact in your space.</p>\n<h2>Peel-and-Stick Products</h2>\n<p>A round-up of interior design tips for renters wouldn’t be complete without giving peel-and-stick a major shout-out. Peel-and-stick is incredible for renters, since they’re temporary solutions for bigger projects that would normally require renovation. Here are a few of my favorites.</p>\n<h3>Peel-and-stick wallpaper</h3>\n<p>If painting is a no-go, peel-and-stick wallpaper is an excellent option for zhuzhing up your walls. I am a huge fan of adding peel-and-stick wallpaper anywhere your heart desires. Create a statement wall in your <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/cozy-living-room-ideas/\">living room</a> or make your powder room pop with a bold color or pattern. I’ve added peel-and-stick wallpaper to my kitchen, my laundry room, and most recently in my home office.</p>\n<p>Wallpaper has completely transformed these spaces, and I couldn’t be more pleased with how they’ve turned out. Plus, removal is a breeze—I’ve had no wall damage when I’ve removed peel and stick wallpaper. There are tons of installation YouTube videos you can watch, but I will say from personal experience that it’s not <i>quite</i> as easy as it looks. Don’t be afraid to hire a TaskRabbit or wallpaper pro to get the job done!</p>\n<h3>Peel-and-stick floor tile</h3>\n<p>Renter floors can range anywhere from vinyl to tile to even hardwood. Peel-and-stick floor tile now makes it possible for renters to update their floors in a temporary and affordable way. I’ve never tried them myself, but peel-and-stick floor tiles look fantastic in a kitchen or powder room. They can make an outdated floor feel current without costing a ton as well.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/interior-design-tips-for-renters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Unlike my social feeds that seem to be favoring <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/fall-2025-fashion-trends/\">all things fall</a>, I’m still firmly planted in summer. Perhaps it’s all the extra time I’ve spent in Austin these last few weeks where the air is still humid and the sun is shining extra bright, but the last thing I’m thinking about is pumpkins. Instead, I’m fully embracing sweet summer watermelon and juicy tomatoes while drinking crisp iced bevies on the patio. The markets are still brimming with <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/late-summer-recipes/\">summer produce</a>, and I’m determined to enjoy it all while it lasts.</p>\n<p>Two ingredients that I’ve neglected this summer are the humble squash and zucchini. Both staples of summer, I feel like they often get relegated to roasted or grilling as a side to whatever the main course is, but I often forget that they can be eaten fresh as well. The flavor leans somewhere between fresh with a slight bite that I think is the perfect ode to the warmer months. And because they are the perfect blank canvas, they make for a delicious pairing to other summer flavors that I absolutely love. This zucchini ribbon salad is how I’m embracing the last few weeks of summer. Ahead, discover why you should be making it too.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Squash Ribbon Salad&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/food/zucchini-ribbon-salad/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Squash-Ribbon-Salad-865x1271.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Ingredients for Zucchini Ribbon Salad</h2>\n<p><strong>Zucchini.</strong> The star of the show—its mild flavor and tender bite make the perfect base for those pretty, delicate ribbons.</p>\n<p><strong>Squash. </strong>Slightly sweeter than zucchini, it brings balance and color contrast to the salad.</p>\n<p><strong>Cucumber. </strong>Adds a clean, refreshing crunch that keeps every bite feeling light and hydrating.</p>\n<p><strong>Avocado. </strong>Creamy and rich, it gives the salad substance while balancing out all the fresh, crisp textures.</p>\n<p><strong>Goat Cheese. </strong>Tangy and luscious, it melts into the ribbons for just the right hit of indulgence.</p>\n<p><strong>Almonds.</strong> Their toasty crunch adds depth and keeps the salad from feeling too soft.</p>\n<p><strong>Pistachios.</strong> Sweet and nutty with that gorgeous green hue, they double down on both flavor and beauty.</p>\n<p><strong>Fresh Herbs.</strong> A handful of mint, basil, or parsley brightens the whole dish with a garden-fresh lift.</p>\n<p><strong>Olive Oil.</strong> The silky base of the dressing that ties everything together with richness.</p>\n<p><strong>Lemon Juice.</strong> Adds the zingy brightness that wakes up the flavors and keeps the salad vibrant.</p>\n<p><strong>Honey.</strong> Just a drizzle rounds things out with a subtle sweetness that complements the tang and crunch.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Squash Salad&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/food/zucchini-ribbon-salad/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Squash-Salad-865x1271.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>How to Prepare this Zucchini Ribbon Salad</h2>\n<p>If you’re skeptical about fresh zucchini and squash, that’s fine. I totally get it! But I’m also convinced I can make you a convert. There are a few things to keep in mind to make this salad delicious.</p>\n<p>First, use a vegetable peeler for extra-thin ribbons of both zucchini and squash. Not only does this help create those beautiful ribbons, but it also removes some of the thick, chewy texture that you would otherwise deal with if you were just cutting the squash into rounds. When sliced this way, the ribbons are thin with just the slightest crunch that makes it feel closer to a ribboned cucumber.</p>\n<p>If you still don’t want to eat the veggies raw, I would recommend VERY quickly blanching the ribbons in boiling water, then adding to an ice bath. You don’t want to make the ribbons soggy, so a quick dunk and shock will keep that fresh crispness while giving the squash and zucchini a quick cook.</p>\n<p>Balancing textures is what makes this zucchini ribbon salad shine. Creamy avocado and tangy goat cheese contrast the crisp ribbons, while cucumber adds a cool, refreshing bite. Toasted almonds and pistachios bring crunch, fresh herbs infuse brightness, and a lemon-honey dressing ties it all together with sweet, zesty balance.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Ribbon Squash Salad&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/food/zucchini-ribbon-salad/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Ribbon-Squash-Salad-865x1271.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>What to Eat with Zucchini Ribbon Salad</h2>\n<p>This is the perfect side dish to bring to your end-of-summer gatherings, and it pairs perfectly with your favorite dishes. Here’s what I’m serving up for the last few weeks of summer for a complete menu that celebrates the season.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/these-chicken-burger-lettuce-wraps-are-my-new-weeknight-go-to/\">Chicken Burgers</a> (in lettuce or on buns) or <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/grilled-chicken-thighs/\">Grilled Chicken Thighs</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/spring-pasta-salad/\">Bright and Zesty Pasta Salad</a> or this<a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/sun-dried-tomato-caprese-pasta-salad/\"> Caprese Pasta Salad</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/grilled-zucchini-recipe/\">Grilled Zucchini</a> (for the fresh and grilled version side by side) and <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/smashed-grilled-sweet-potatoes-with-chimichurri/\">Grilled Sweet Potatoes</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/easy-grilled-peaches-recipe/\">Grilled Peaches</a> with Ice Cream</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Summer Ribboned Squash Salad&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/food/zucchini-ribbon-salad/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Summer-Ribboned-Squash-Salad-865x1187.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Zucchini Ribbon Salad</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/zucchini-ribbon-salad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s fundamental to our vitality, and our quality of life <i>depends</i> on it. Gut health is a key player in everything from nutrient absorption and mood stability to <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-balance-hormones/\">hormone balance</a> and cognitive function. Without a healthy gut, a slew of chronic illnesses come knocking—<a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-stop-feeling-bloated/\">digestive disorders</a>, weakened immunity, and more. If you want to protect your longevity (and improve all areas of your well-being!), hone in on your gut health. It’s never mattered more than now.</p>\n<h2>Signs of a Healthy Gut</h2>\n<p>So, how can you tell if your gut is in good shape?</p>\n<h3>Regular (and comfortable) digestion</h3>\n<p>One of the most apparent signs of a healthy gut is rhythmic, pleasant digestion. What this means: you’re having <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-often-should-you-poop/\">bowel movements</a> at least once a day <i>without</i> straining or discomfort. Stools should be well-formed and easy to pass, typically resembling the shape and consistency of a smooth, soft log.</p>\n<h3>Minimal gastrointestinal symptoms</h3>\n<p>A healthy gut typically experiences minimal <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/grain-free-diet-gut-health/\">gastrointestinal symptoms</a>. This includes the absence of chronic issues—bloating, gas, abdominal pain, constipation, or diarrhea. Of course, occasional mild symptoms are normal, but frequent or severe discomfort may indicate an imbalance.</p>\n<h3>Good energy levels</h3>\n<p>As mentioned, the gut plays a crucial role in <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/foods-for-gut-health/\">nutrient absorption</a>. When it’s functioning well, your body efficiently absorbs the nutrients it needs, leading to sustained energy levels throughout the day. Chronic fatigue or low energy can sometimes be linked to poor gut health.</p>\n<h3>Strong immune system</h3>\n<p>A significant portion (as in, <a href=\"https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/want-to-boost-immunity-look-to-the-gut#:~:text=70%25%20of%20the%20immune%20system,where%20diverse%20bacteria%20is%20best.&amp;text=You%20likely%20know%20that%20what,energy%20level%20throughout%20the%20day.\">over 70%</a>!) of your immune system is located in the gut. If you rarely get sick and recover quickly when you do, it’s a sign that your gut microbiota is healthy—and for that matter, effectively supporting your immune defenses.</p>\n<h3>Healthy skin</h3>\n<p>Did you know a balanced gut microbiome can help reduce inflammation and improve skin conditions? Clear, healthy skin (without chronic issues like <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/acne-diet-plan/\">acne</a>, eczema, or rosacea) indicate a healthy gut.</p>\n<h3>Stable mood</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4367209/\">Current research</a> highlights the <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/stress-and-gut-health/\">gut-brain axis</a>—the connection between gut health and mental health. In essence, a healthy gut contributes to stable moods and better mental health. If you experience infrequent mood swings, anxiety, or depressive symptoms, it’s a sign that your gut microbiota is balanced.</p>\n<h3>Few food sensitivities</h3>\n<p>A thriving gut often has fewer food sensitivities and intolerances. If you can eat a wide variety of foods without experiencing adverse reactions, it suggests your gut is well-balanced and your digestive system is functioning properly.</p>\n<h2>Symptoms of an Unhealthy Gut</h2>\n<p>On the flip side, do you notice stomach pain after eating, often feel sluggish, and experience acne flare-ups after noshing on <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/low-glycemic-sugar-alternatives/\">sugar</a>? These are all signs of an impaired gut. Once you’re aware of these symptoms, you can take the first step toward better digestive health.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/gut-health/gut-health-habits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>When you hear the stats on the new AVA Resort Cancun, a certain kind of skepticism is natural. With over 1,600 rooms, it is, by any definition, a truly massive property. For seasoned travelers, “massive” can often be a code word for long lines, impersonal service, and that dreaded “burn and churn” mentality where you feel more like a number than a guest.</p>\n<p>We at<a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/\"> Travel Off Path</a> have visited our fair share of mega-resorts, so we went to check out the property with a healthy dose of skepticism, fully expecting to experience some of these big-resort growing pains.</p>\n<p><strong>We were wrong.</strong> In fact, we were completely surprised.</p>\n<p>The AVA Resort Cancun is that rare unicorn in the world of hospitality: a mega-resort with the intimate soul and vibrant heartbeat of a boutique hotel. Its ability to deliver on both epic scale and personalized service is nothing short of remarkable, and it has immediately established itself as a top-tier contender in the luxury all-inclusive space.</p>\n<p>The true genius of the AVA and the secret to its unique vibe can be found on its main level. Everything—and we mean <i>everything</i>—is located on one magnificent, air-conditioned indoor promenade that stretches for over half a mile along the entire length of the resort.</p>\n<p>This brilliant design choice solves the single biggest problem that plagues other giant resorts: navigation. Gone are the days of deciphering confusing maps, getting lost on winding outdoor paths, or waiting ten minutes for a golf cart just to get to dinner. At AVA, every restaurant, bar, shop, and activity entrance is right there on the promenade. It’s the central nervous system of the resort, making it unbelievably easy to get your bearings.</p>\n<p>But it’s more than just convenient. This layout creates an incredible, dynamic energy. In the evening, the promenade comes alive. You can stroll from a high-end cocktail bar to a chic boutique, grab a scoop of authentic gelato, listen to the music spilling out of a restaurant, and window-shop, all in climate-controlled bliss. It feels like the vibrant Royal Promenade of a luxury cruise ship, but on a much grander and more luxurious scale. It encourages exploration and allows you to bar-hop and people-watch, creating a sense of community and excitement that is simply missing from other resorts where amenities are scattered across acres of land.</p>\n<p>While the AVA is conveniently located just 10 minutes from the airport, it is not in the bustling Hotel Zone. The trade-off for this relative isolation? An absolutely staggering array of on-site activities that makes it almost impossible to get bored. You could genuinely spend a full week here and not experience everything the resort has to offer. The list is almost overwhelming:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>For the thrill-seeker:</strong>A full-scale laser tag arena, a state-of-the-art arcade with racing simulators, and even a multi-room escape room experience.</li><li><strong>For the family (or kids at heart):</strong>A sleek, modern bowling alley that feels more like a private lounge.</li><li><strong>For the evening:</strong>A stunning, professional-grade theater hosting nightly shows and entertainment.</li><li><strong>For practical needs:</strong>A collection of chic shops, a “tienda” for sundries and snacks, and a well-stocked pharmacy.</li></ul>\n<p>This is all before you even step outside.</p>\n<p>The outdoor space at AVA is just as impressive as the interior. A series of absolutely giant pools stretches across the entire oceanfront length of the property, meaning you are never far from a place to cool off. And for anyone who has experienced the dreaded 6 AM “towel game” at other resorts, you can breathe a sigh of relief. There are literally thousands of comfortable lounge chairs available at all hours of the day. Finding a great spot is never a problem.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/ava-resort-cancun-review-this-massive-new-resort-actually-has-a-heartbeat-vibe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>\n      <strong>By David Sydney</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>It had to happen some time and some place. Who knew the bizarre quantum entanglement would occur in Mel’s small, disordered bathroom with its cracked mirror and wet towels? Mel reused his towels until they were thoroughly soaked. Only then would he put them in his dryer, which sounded like a threshing machine.</p>\n    <p>All the fundamental particles composing Mel suddenly, almost miraculously, and for reasons unknown, arranged themselves into the form of a Minotaur in the mirror. Entanglement between someone like Mel and a mythological creature will occur ultimately in this universe, given enough throws of the quantum dice. It just so happened to be on that Thursday.</p>\n    <p>So, Mel looked into his mirror and saw, blinking back, a gruesome, enraged bull’s head, salivating onto its massive, human chest.</p>\n    <p>And the Minotaur, from the other side of the mirror, attached to Mel’s inexpensive wallboard, saw something, well, he saw Mel. The creature’s eyes dilated. One moment, it had been in a dark, dank Labyrinth, waiting for its next sacrificial victim. And the next, as it stared into the mirror, it saw an off-kilter face, barely covered with ineffective shaving cream, grimacing from the cuts of a dull disposable razor. Why hadn’t he disposed of it at least a week before? And what kind of torn underwear was Mel wearing?</p>\n    <p>Few things in this universe are as fearsome as a Minotaur. Few, as monstrous or as vicious. Everyone fears the Minotaur. If you were up against a T-Rex or a MInotaur, which would you choose? The T-Rex would be my choice—there’s a much better chance of survival.</p>\n    <p>By nature, the Minotaur is violent. Extremely so. It subsists on victims sacrificed to it. Staring into the mirror—that is, into the labyrinth—Mel saw partially decomposing carcasses and whitening bones. He worked in his Uncle Leo’s coin-operated laundromat. The Labyrinth and the supply room of the laundromat were remarkably similar. Sacrificial bodies are one thing. But how about his Uncle’s mops, leaky buckets, solidified bleach packets, and broken laundry carts?</p>\n    <p>Mel’s shaving cream was as cheap as his razors. His Uncle didn’t pay much. The best way to learn, to get anywhere in this world, Uncle Leo claimed, was to start by working at the bottom for dirt wages. The whole point of a coin-operated laundromat, according to his Uncle, was to get rid of dirt.</p>\n    <p>Even though Mel had rubbed some shaving cream into his eyes— he was that kind of shaver — he could see that the Labyrinth was a dirty place. It’s one thing to nick yourself with a dull blade, to bleed into an inexpensive lather. It’s another thing to come eye to eye with a Minotaur.</p>\n    <p>Yet the Minotaur and the labyrinth seemed a kind of relief from the customers and unwashed laundry at his Uncle’s place. Mel had another day of mopping floors ahead of him. The Labyrinth? He’d dealt with dirt like that plenty of times.</p>\n    <p>And the Minotaur?</p>\n    <p>Well, a lot of coin-operated laundry customers might as well have bull heads. They are pathology attached to their dirty clothes. They are the epitome of tough customers.</p>\n    <p>Had the Minotaur been up against anything like this, however? That is, Mel? And the bathroom? It was shocking to see Mel’s face blinking back at it, squinting to get a better look. And there on the floor, the wet towels.</p>\n    <p>They were quantumly entangled, yet it was the Minotaur that felt like peeing itself.</p>\n    <p>Mel, who often felt like peeing himself at the laundromat, was comfortable gazing about the labyrinth.</p>\n    <p>The Minotaur had never witnessed anything like Mel, lathered up, blinking, shaving so erratically, yet smiling oddly.</p>\n    <p>It was the Minotaur who looked disturbed. The Minotaur who drew back from Mel. The Minotaur who didn’t want to pee itself yet didn’t like the looks of Mel’s toilet either.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://flashfictionmagazine.com/blog/2025/09/03/mels-bathroom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Sadie peered out over the sea, cradling an icy flask between stiff fingers. The dock was fluffy with frost. She sat, settling herself into the frozen crystals. Chipped black nail polish flaked off as she fiddled with the flask’s top. Her dad used to unscrew the lid with one hand, celebrating another successful crab haul as he burst through the front door. Sadie would get an oxygen-depleting bear hug, and her mom, a bristly mustache kiss. He’d tip back a swig of whiskey and do a little dance. Sadie would roll her eyes, but eventually join in, feet jigging and arms swinging.</p>\n<p>She let her snow boots swing, their heavy soles knocking old pavement salt into the shallows below. The sharp smell of brine drifted in as the tides pulled out, the whole wind-bitten inlet stained the dingy gray of late winter.</p>\n<p>When she’d left the house that morning, backpack on, AP English homework unfinished, and mussy clothes thrown together, her mom—disheveled damp hair and trembling hands pawing at one another, jittery from too much coffee—had chased her halfway down the walk with a heavy coat and waterproof pants.</p>\n<p>“Mom, I’m fifteen, not five.”</p>\n<p>“It’s supposed to snow this afternoon,” her mom said, shoving Sadie’s arms into the sleeves.</p>\n<p>Sadie had acquiesced, mostly to avoid her mother’s clingy anxiety, but also to keep hidden the flask she’d stolen from her dad’s office.</p>\n<p>She’d walked right past her high school and toward the marina, where her dad’s ship was notably absent. Today would have been the annual “Sadie picks which crab they eat for dinner” day.</p>\n<p>She adjusted her position on the chilly dock, trying to work a little blood back into her thighs as she unscrewed the flask. Staring at the empty berth that used to house the S. S. Sadie, she took a sip. The liquid was so cold it gnawed at her insides, little permafrost punctures against the esophagus.</p>\n<p>That first winter storm, the one that had swallowed his ship in open water, had brought the bitter scream of winds and a colossal ice storm. Sadie remembered how beautiful it had all been, the whole town encased in a brilliant slick of shimmer. She hadn’t even thought to be scared, to worry Dad would be navigating his crabbing ship in the icy dark. She’d stayed up to watch the stars reflect in the thick glaze.</p>\n<p>The call came in the early hours. Jerked awake by her mom’s anguish—a cry that cracked the ice along the window panes—Sadie shot downstairs to find her crumpled on the ground, phone in her lap, horror etched in every wrinkle that bunched around her eyes.</p>\n<p>“He went down with the ship,” was all Mom could say. Sadie collapsed, folding herself inside her mother’s broken form, trying to burrow her way back to the beginning. Back to a childhood full of morning laughter over buttered toast, and board games that stretched past bedtime.</p>\n<p>Sadie took another sip from the flask. She slid down, lying on her back and staring at the heavy clouds poised to unleash their innumerable flurries. Seagulls spun lazily overhead. Her memories sailed in and out, some from last summer when splinters threatened her bare feet as she and Dad raced to the end of the marina and threw themselves into the bay. She remembered splashing back out with a yelp when he yelled, “Shark!”</p>\n<p>He’d told Mom over dinner how gullible their daughter was, to which Sadie aimed a few peas in his direction.</p>\n<p>Now there were just quiet meals for two, avoiding each other’s eyes, in a house much emptier. Who knew Dad had taken up that much space?</p>\n<p>A pelican joined the seagulls with their endless cow-cow-cow calls. The bigger bird rose and fell in the thermals that edged the ocean. Dad had always loved pelicans.</p>\n<p>Footsteps sounded from the earth-bound portion of the dock, but Sadie didn’t care if one of the crabbers saw her. They’d understand.</p>\n<p>“Your dad tried to get me to call you Pelly, you know.” Her mom’s voice drifted in.</p>\n<p>Sadie launched upright.</p>\n<p>“Can you imagine? Pelly Lacrelly?” She snorted.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://flashfictionmagazine.com/blog/2025/09/02/pelican/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>By Michelle Rogers</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The dragon slayer stood over his kill, breath heaving, the sword’s edge still glowing with heat. The beast lay still, wings half-folded, smoke curling from its nostrils. <i>One more, and it’s done.</i> That’s what the High Mages had told him. One more and the curse would be broken.</p>\n<p>The acrid stench filled Ronan’s lungs, but the fire beneath his skin burned hotter, molten metal coursing through his veins. Once an extension of himself, the sword’s hilt felt strange—too smooth, too light. A shiver ran down his spine despite the warm air. The wind carried distant voices, though no one was there. He flexed his fingers, the skin at his knuckles rougher, darker. His nails—no, claws—caught the firelight. The changes were coming faster now. He had to finish this before—</p>\n<p>“Ronan.”</p>\n<p>Lyra’s voice was quiet, but it anchored him. He turned to her, his guide, the woman who had led him unerringly to every dragon, yet always hesitated at the final strike. She stood motionless, her amber eyes shadowed.</p>\n<p>“We’re close,” he said, sheathing his sword. His armor, crafted to fit perfectly, now pinched against his spine. “One more, and it’s over. The curse will end. I will be human again.”</p>\n<p>“And what then?” Her voice was careful. “What does that mean?”</p>\n<p>“It means I win,” he said firmly. “It means dragons are finally gone.”</p>\n<p>She hesitated, gaze flicking to his hands. “Have you seen what’s happening to you?”</p>\n<p>He scoffed. “Battle scars. Everyone changes in war. It will go away when the curse is lifted.” He forced a grin, reaching for her hand. “You won’t have to worry about this in your future husband. I’ll be just as I was before.”</p>\n<p>She didn’t move. The firelight traced the tension in her shoulders. “The Mages didn’t lie to you.” Her voice softened. “Kill the last dragon, and you will be free of this.”</p>\n<p>Relief flickered in his chest, but something in her tone held him still. “Then why do you look at me like that?”</p>\n<p>She exhaled slowly, her expression shifting from sorrow to resolve. “Because I am the last one.”</p>\n<p>The world lurched beneath him. He took a step back, the ground unsteady. “No. That’s not possible.”</p>\n<p>Lyra closed her eyes, exhaling softly. When she opened them, the illusion fell away. Golden scales shimmered under the moonlight, her pupils narrowing into slits—familiar eyes, ones he’d seen fade into death a dozen times before.</p>\n<p>His sword was in his hands before he could think. “You led me to them? Your own kind?”</p>\n<p>“Some deserved it.” Her voice carried sorrow. “The ones who razed your village—I helped you find justice. But each death changed you. I tried to slow our hunt, to give you time to see it.”</p>\n<p>The sword trembled in his grip. The final dragon, the last one to be slain, stood before him. He clenched his fists, his breath sharp, uneven. His whole life, dragons had been monsters. He had vowed to rid the world of their kind, and now—</p>\n<p>Now she stood before him. Not a beast, not an enemy. The woman he loved. The one who had saved him, guided him, stayed at his side when no one else had.</p>\n<p>He remembered their nights by the fire, her laughter filling the spaces between his grief. The warmth of her voice when she spoke of the stars. The way she was always there to help him chase away the nightmares.</p>\n<p>“If you kill me,” she said, voice steady, “you go back to who you were. A man. A slayer. A hero. If you don’t—”</p>\n<p>“I stay like this,” he finished, throat tight. “I remain trapped between the worlds of man and beast.”</p>\n<p>Silence stretched between them, thick as smoke. His hands trembled. The sword had never felt heavier.</p>\n<p>She exhaled. “No. It will continue. You’re already more dragon than human. You feel it, don’t you? The way fire didn’t burn you. The way your senses sharpened after each hunt. The way you know what I’m thinking before I say it.”</p>\n<p>Ronan swallowed hard. He had ignored it, pushed the thoughts aside like battle fatigue. But the truth settled into his bones now.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://flashfictionmagazine.com/blog/2025/08/31/the-last-hunt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Ranard</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>When I go, he would tell her, I want to go fast, and one sunny fall morning, as he’s jogging around the lake, his wish comes true. He’s gone before he hits the ground.</p>\n    <p>With her daughter’s help, she sells the house and moves into Sunrise. He would have hated everything about the place (beginning with the name: “Sunrise?” she could hear him say. “Give me a break. Call it what it is, for Christ’s sake—Sunset”). But she discovers, to her surprise, that she actually likes it: three meals a day, housekeeping, and, for the first time in years, a social life. It’s like being in a co-ed college dorm (well, a co-ed dorm where the girls outnumber boys three to one).</p>\n    <p>~</p>\n    <p>There are two wings—assisted living and memory care (referred to in hushed tones as “the other place” by assisted-living residents)—and, with her increasingly iffy memory, she is a probational resident of assisted living.<br/>Soon there are serious lapses in memory. One evening her daughter visits to find her more than a little tipsy. “I jush had my usual one glash,” she insists. It takes her daughter a while to figure out what had happened. She’d had her usual one glass of white wine before dinner—four times, going through the whole bottle.</p>\n    <p>After that her daughter makes sure there’s never more than one mini-bottle in the refrigerator.</p>\n    <p>~</p>\n    <p>She weeps when she’s told she has to move to “the other place.” But after a few days there, she seems fine. Or maybe she’s forgotten the previous place.</p>\n    <p>~</p>\n    <p>Most of the time her daughter is her daughter. But sometimes her daughter is her sister—the twin sister who died in a car accident at thirty. And every now and then her daughter is a stranger.</p>\n    <p>The day will come when she’ll wake from a dream and look up at her daughter, sitting in a chair next to the bed, and say, “Mom? Is that you?”</p>\n    <p>~</p>\n    <p>She points at the photo in the silver frame on her bureau and asks who he is. “That’s Daddy,” her daughter says. “Your husband.”</p>\n    <p>It takes her a moment to take in both of these things—Daddy, husband. Then she says, “He’s very handsome. Did l love him? Were we happy?”</p>\n    <p>“You were very happy,” her daughter says. That’s not entirely true, but it’s more true than untrue. She smiles, happy to learn that she was happy.</p>\n    <p>Then, because it’s a nice day, they go outside, where she enjoys, once again for the first time, the beautiful grounds.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://flashfictionmagazine.com/blog/2025/08/29/after-he-goes-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I have found the house to be satisfactory in most ways. It is a gentleman's residence of modest scale but of sound construction, situated upon a rise of land overlooking the vale, with generous southern exposure and a fine if somewhat neglected garden. The walls are of good plaster, and the windows let in a quality of light that flatters the dust. I have lived here since Michaelmas, and although the surrounding village is not known for its society, I have had few complaints. The quietude is welcome. After the tiresome complications of town life, I had longed for silence.\n</p>\n<p>Yet silence is a more demanding companion than one might suppose.\n</p>\n<p>It began, I think, sometime in late April, though I could not name the precise day. A curious sound, faint at first, like the soft scuffle of fingernails behind the mantelpiece in the study. I had recently arranged the furniture there to my liking and taken to spending afternoons reading in the armchair near the hearth. The fire had been let out weeks before; the days had warmed. But the noises persisted... scratching, fluttering, and on occasion, a low chirring, as if something winged and half-dreaming had made a home in the dark hollows of the wall.\n</p>\n<p>I suspected birds.\n</p>\n<p>Indeed, when I climbed the narrow stair to the upper rooms and leaned out the window just above the chimney, I caught sight of a clutch of twigs protruding from the bricks like a dry bouquet. Sparrows, no doubt, or perhaps starlings. I had read that such creatures favored crevices in warm stone during the spring months.\n</p>\n<p>My first instinct was to write to Mr. Chilton, the groundsman, to have him investigate the flue and make the necessary removals. But there was something strangely companionable in the presence of those birds. The sound of their industry was, in its way, a kind of music. It reminded me of childhood mornings in my aunt's country house, where swallows nested in the rafters. Their comings and goings had delighted us then, a token of continuity and season.\n</p>\n<p>I told myself that they would soon be gone. Birds are fickle. The fledglings would fly, the nest would decay, and the house would again be mine.\n</p>\n<p>Yet as days passed, the activity behind the wall only increased. Not merely a pair, but an entire brood had taken residence. I could hear the rustle of wings, the mewling cries of young. At night, they fell silent, but each morning resumed their duties with tireless resolve. They became, in effect, my tenants.\n</p>\n<p>It occurred to me to mention the matter to Miss Wetherall, my housekeeper. She is a thin and precise woman, not given to sentiment. When I described the birds and their dwelling place, she frowned.\n</p>\n<p>\"It is not well, sir, to let such things go. They bring mites. Droppings. And worse, sir, they invite decay. Shall I have Giles come up with a broom and a hook to dislodge them?\"\n</p>\n<p>I demurred. Something about her severity unnerved me.\n</p>\n<p>\"No,\" I said. \"It is not urgent. Let them be.\"\n</p>\n<p>But she looked at me then with a certain hardness. \"As you wish, sir. But such allowances breed disorder.\"\n</p>\n<p>And so, the matter rested... for a time.\n</p>\n<p>That week, a friend visited from Oxford, Mr. Calloway, a botanist of good humor and little concern for propriety. He took one turn about the house, inspected the roses, declared the soil too acidic, and remarked upon the ivy with suspicion. When I told him about the birds, he raised an eyebrow.\n</p>\n<p>\"Charming,\" he said, but without conviction. \"Though if they're in the wall, best not let it stand. They'll ruin your chimney.\n</p>\n<p>\"Still,\" he added after a pause, \"some noise is preferable to none, I suppose.\"\n</p>\n<p>He stayed the night, and in the morning, said nothing more.\n</p>\n<p>But the sound grew louder.\n</p>\n<p>By early May, the fledglings had hatched. I heard them all day now, crying out with ceaseless hunger. Sometimes the wall thudded, faintly but unmistakably. I began to dream of wings, of flutters behind my chair, of shadows shifting behind the fireplace.\n</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/09/a-nesting-above-mantel-by-zary-fekete.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
