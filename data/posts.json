    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>It’s the Chinese Year of the Snake, so I thought it would be fun to come up with a few snake-themed drinks throughout the seasons. This one is inspired by the green tree snake, which is a gorgeous emerald colour, and the chilli thread garnish imitates its tongue. I definitely knew what this drink would look like long before I developed it, because I found myself leaning towards green flavours that have a great affinity with a smoky, vegetal mezcal. Green pepper and shiso enhance those herbal, peppery notes, while the apple liqueur and manzanilla bring a crisp, sweet fruitiness that rounds things out. I had so much fun with this one that it’s one of my favourite recipes to date.</p>\n    <h2>Tree snake</h2>\n    <p>Serves <strong>1</strong></p>\n    <p>For the mezcal infusion (to serve about 12)<strong>\n   2  shiso leaves\n   350ml good mezcal</strong> – we use </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://mezcalamaras.com/en/pages/mezcal-verde\">Mezcal Verde Amarás</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>, stalk, core and pith discarded, flesh finely sliced or chopped<br/>1 green pepper</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>1 green pepper</p>\n    <p>For the drink<strong>30ml </strong><strong>green pepper- and shiso-</strong><strong>infused mezcal </strong>(see above and method)<strong>30ml manzanilla</strong> – we use <a href=\"https://www.leithdistillery.com/port-of-leith-sherry\">Port of Leith</a><strong>10ml apple liqueu</strong><strong>r</strong> – we use <a href=\"https://mothershipscotland.com/collections/lucky-liqueurs\">Lucky Liqueurs</a><strong>10ml agave syrup</strong> – we use <a href=\"https://www.bristolsyrupcompany.com/no27-nogave\">Bristol Syrup Co’s Nogave</a><strong>1 dash green food colouring</strong> (optional)<strong>1 pinch red angel hair chilli threads</strong>, or a little very finely shredded red chilli, to garnish (optional)</p>\n    <p>To infuse the mezcal, put the shiso and mezcal in a blender, blitz for 10-15 seconds, then pour into a mason jar or similar. Add the sliced pepper, seal and leave to infuse for 48 hours, then strain through coffee filter paper – so long as it’s strained properly, the infused mezcal will have an almost indefinite shelf life, so there’s no need to store it in the fridge.</p>\n    <p>To build the drink, measure the infused mezcal, sherry, apple liqueur and agave syrup into a shaker, add the food colouring, if using, then drop in a big handful of ice and shake hard. Double strain into a rocks glass filled with fresh ice (we use one large cube), garnish with the chilli, if using, and serve.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Aidan Rivett, bar manager,</p><a href=\"https://notoedinburgh.co.uk/\">Noto</a>, Edinburgh</li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/29/cocktail-of-the-week-noto-edinburgh-tree-snake-mezcal-recipe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Summer in Bury St Edmunds has little in common with San Sebastián, even if both certainly entice food-lovers. A few months ago, however, Suffolk’s food capital welcomed a soupçon of fancy-pants Spain in the form of <a href=\"https://www.bellotarestaurant.com/\">Bellota</a> on Churchgate Street, not far from the abbey. Bellota bills itself as offering an “elevated tasting menu” (seven courses, and eight at weekends) and boasts only a maximum of 20 seats, all of them lined up around a counter overlooking married chefs Ruben Aquilar Bel and Gabriella Fogarasi at work.</p>\n<p>On its website, Bellota promises to be “relaxed and welcoming”, which before going I severely doubted, because tasting menus rarely are: “I found the chef’s 657-word soliloquy on artichoåkes very relaxing,” said no one ever. However, on entering the restaurant on a recent Saturday and finding a room hewn in a rhapsody of calm browns and golds, and Fogarasi herself greeting us at the door, well, Bellota actually felt rather zen. There is a cosiness here that doesn’t at all feel like your average flash-harry fine-dining metropolitan joint. On a sold-out night of two sittings, there were a mere four staff working all evening. There were no hostesses leading us 40 steps to our seats, no pushy sommeliers, no kitchens stuffed with staff ostentatiously shouting, “Oui, chef!”</p>\n<p>Bellota is homespun, sure, but it’s not remotely amateur-hour, and the meal service is gloriously well honed. Within mere moments of us taking our seats, warm loaves of Fogarasi’s sourdough bread appeared in cute hessian bags and with a glut of salted butter; we were offered more bread throughout the meal, just in case the tasting-menu portion sizes weren’t already sating enough. As Aquilar Bel talked earnestly about the txakoli he’d paired with his hake in salsa verde and escalivada vegetable raviolo, a satisfied hum of Suffolk folk eating good bread and butter enveloped the room.<br/>\n  Bellota’s genesis has been financed by <a href=\"https://www.restaurantonline.co.uk/Article/2025/05/09/linda-keenan-ive-seen-some-phenomenal-cooks-but-if-you-dont-have-real-teamwork-in-the-kitchen-it-doesnt-work/\">Linda Keenan</a>, who has connections to London’s well-loved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/oct/30/noble-rot-soho-london-w1-restaurant-review-grace-dent\">Noble Rot</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jul/06/clove-club-london-restaurant-review\">the Clove Club</a>, and, although dissecting something as grubby as money is unappetising, her golden touch matters. Bellota may well be the brainwave of two relatively unknown chefs and tucked away in a quaint West Suffolk market town, but there’s something hugely beguiling going on here, and even verging on swaggering.</p>\n<p>From the first snacks of hot, crisp, truffled croquetas – better than many I’ve tasted even in Spain – moving on to that masterful al dente raviolo stuffed with roast sweet red pepper and aubergine with just a touch of sherry vinegar, all dressed in a heavenly manchego sauce, it’s clear that this is a restaurant without so much as a hint of naivety.</p>\n<p>A hunk of south-west coast hake is crisscrossed with sombre-looking squid ink and served with a fiery green pepper sauce, a piece of grilled langoustine, a padrón pepper and a few palourde clams. Next, rare slices of Creedy Carver duck on a silky puree of heritage carrots with a slick of rich duck jus. Each dish, as we finish it with a sigh, is swept away and replaced like clockwork with something else sticky, rich or magnificent. The chefs move purposefully and in relative silence, with no flapping, no fussing, no shouting and no underlings locked in the walk-in freezer for “banter”. Just fabulous food. How very modern indeed.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/24/bellota-bury-st-edmunds-grace-dent-restaurant-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The pair met at <a href=\"https://atelier-robuchon-saint-germain.com/\">L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon</a> in Paris, moved on to run the now defunct L’Envie in Brive-La-Gaillarde, south-west France, before spending the best part of a decade in Jeon’s native Korea. In 2019, they settled in Bristol to open the very popular <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/aug/11/bokman-bristol-laser-like-focus-restaurant-review\">Bokman</a>, where dumplings, kimchi fried rice and cherry-flavoured soft-serve Jersey ice-cream are the order of the day.</p>\n<p><i>ssam</i>and sauces on the side.</p>\n<p>Their latest venture is a little more earnest, authentic and pared back, though. It’s billed as a traditional neighbourhood Korean barbecue restaurant, but it’s actually a little stranger and more homespun than that. While London restaurant investors might splurge tens of thousands of pounds on imported chandeliers, Dongnae uses Ikea-alike student bedsit paper lanterns in its two-store shopfront space, and has spent very little indeed on furniture, wallpaper and counters. Rather fittingly, in fact, it feels a bit as if you are <i>in</i> a student bedsit, only with Robertson doing the communal cooking every night.</p>\n<p>In keeping with this general aura, the menu itself is delicate, bespoke and thoughtful, too. Expect octopus and lamb fat <i>kkochi</i> (skewers), assorted punchy kimchis, hand-dived scallops, cockle and mussel bibimbap, and Korean beef tartare. Expect cold, bracing Korean soups and peculiar but unforgettable pond-green puddings – but more of that later. At lunch, there is an à la carte and a £24 set menu and, at dinner, the option of a <i>hanjeongsik,</i> an omakase-style seven-course menu that changes daily, and offers a handpicked flurry of Korean loveliness.</p>\n<p>Dongnae is odd, unique and absolutely a roaring hit with Bristol’s diners. It may not be to everyone’s taste, especially if your only knowledge of Korean cooking is generous portions of Brit-pleasing scallion pancakes, bulgogi and, of course, bubbling sweetcorn in cheese sauce, all washed down with peach soju. Instead, here there are ginger old fashioneds, a low-intervention wine list, delicate servings of grilled monkfish with octopus alongside tiny bowls of seasoned seaweed or mustard leaf kimchi, and a very good raw sea bass <i>mulhwe</i> soup made with fresh sugar tomatoes. And if you get a bit lost trying to make head or tail of the menu, Dongnae’s staff will expertly guide you through it and explain the difference between your <i>naengcha</i><i>e</i> and your <i>naengguk</i>. Yes, <i>yukhoe</i> is like beef tartare, and here it comes with a mound of leaves, cucumber and radish, all designed to be rolled up in sheets of nori. Bowls of soft, glossy yellow tofu come festooned with whiffy grated bottarga, though the front of house couldn’t, of course, help me transfer it to my mouth when it evaded my attempts to capture it with the dainty chopsticks. We ate a hunk of hot grilled mackerel and cubes of wagyu that arrived on a cute little grill with generous <i>ssam</i> and sauces on the side.</p>\n<p><i>ever</i>tasted’: Dongnae’s mugwort and black sesame cake.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/17/dongnae-bristol-grace-dent-restaurant-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In the photograph, chef Locatelli, with his flowing, silver locks and impish expression, has himself the look of a Renaissance-era mover and shaker. Great art meets great art, it seems to say. Come for the <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/michelangelo-the-entombment-or-christ-being-carried-to-his-tomb\">The Entombment</a> by Michelangelo in Room 2 on Level 2 and stay for the orecchiette with nettle pesto on the first-floor mezzanine next to the gift shop. Or even just for a coffee and a cake at <a href=\"https://locatelliatnationalgallery.co.uk/bar-giorgio/\">Bar Giorgio</a>, which is really just a coffee stand in the entrance hall that serves Locatelli’s chantilly cream-filled brioche buns for £7 a pop.</p>\n<p>Locatelli’s new arty venture is in partnership with the catering company <a href=\"https://searcys.co.uk/\">Searcys</a>, which controls the dining offering at a number of large, unwieldy venues – the Gherkin, the Barbican and Battersea power station, to name just a few – as well as vast hangars in Pall Mall, Westminster and farther afield. This is an outfit that specialises in posh-ish experiences in mega-high-footfall sweet spots.</p>\n<p>The National Gallery, especially in summer, is a far cry from Locatelli’s much-famed, Michelin-starred restaurant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/jun/01/foodanddrink.shopping4\">Locanda Locatelli</a>, where small portions of pricey pasta, drilled service and twinkly lighting <a href=\"https://www.locandalocatelli.com/\">created</a> a charming ambience. So charming, in fact, that after your <i>linguine</i><i> all’astice</i> or <i>strozzapreti al pomodoro</i>, you could almost forgive a bill that felt a bit like being run over by a Piaggio scooter on Piazza Venezia in Rome.</p>\n<p>Locatelli’s skill at creating ambience is being tested at the National Gallery, especially at the moment, when school’s out for summer and this elegant, echoey gallery that’s packed with old masters is overtaken by quacking hordes of crepe paper- and crayon-wielding school trips from overseas. These children would rather be anywhere else but staring at <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/hans-holbein-the-younger-the-ambassadors\">The Ambassadors</a> by Holbein the Younger, and are probably busy giving each other dead arms while I pick at my burrata and panzanella antipasti.</p>\n<p>But here’s the thing: I liked Locatelli at the National Gallery <i>a lot</i>. Head chef <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/imma_winelee/\">Imma Savinelli</a> and general manager <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/costanzo_cappella_\">Costanzo Cappella</a>, who front this latest Locatelli venture, have pulled off something unique in this pretty space with its pistachio-coloured, velour banquettes, gold furnishings and cute dessert trolley that delivers large, fat slices of tiramisu. The place is dashingly handy for meeting friends, too, and has a big, serious horseshoe bar that serves gin sours, <a href=\"https://www.diffordsguide.com/cocktails/recipe/18/adonis\">adonises</a> and breakfast martinis.</p>\n<p>What’s more, the lunch menu is a million times more interesting than the usual museum or gallery scones and sandwich fare. Here, there is piping hot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jul/20/how-to-make-the-perfect-fritto-misto-recipe-felicity-cloake\">fritto misto</a>, a choice of five fresh pasta dishes, including, when we visited, a juicy bowl of delightfully pungent red gurnard with thick pappardelle, fresh tomato, almonds and black olives that was nothing short of delicious. Someone is actually cooking here, not cynically heating things up for tourists; other pastas on offer might include handmade braised veal tortellini dotted with a punchy gremolata and served in a parmesan sauce or calamarata with sea bream.</p>\n<p>Earlier, a small, warm, rustic loaf of potato-and-rosemary sourdough had appeared with a glug of very good olive oil for dipping, which we ate with a bowl of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/dec/09/vegan-giardiniera-italian-pickles-recipe-meera-sodha\">giardiniera</a> (pickled vegetables), including fennel and carrot. One of the highlights of lunch was a vegan offering, baked aubergine, roasted until soft but not decimated, dressed with a very good soy “ricotta”, sweet cherry tomatoes, toasted hazelnuts and basil pesto.</p>\n<p>From the mains, there was rib-eye with rocket pesto and pot-roast chicken with polenta, both of them served with potato <i>arrost</i><i>o</i>, should one see fit. The <i>contorni</i> section, however, is a bit limited – there’s just those spuds, some green beans and a rocket salad – and I chose badly from the dessert trolley with a Sicilian lemon tart that seemed slightly old and was not remotely zingy. We should have had another of those pricey chantilly cream buns.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/10/locatelli-at-the-national-gallery-london-grace-dent-restaurant-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

If all that fails to thrill, you could just go for lunch at the pub – although be aware that <a href=\"https://greyhoundbeaconsfield.co.uk/\">the Greyhound</a> isn’t anything as simple as a plain old gastropub. Heck no, that would be something completely different: more shabbily chic, more carbohydrates on the menu, fewer staff calling you “Madam” while you’re en route to the loo and not even a hint of white peach granita on your burrata starter.</p>\n<p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>Rather, this is a charming, pale-fronted pub in a grade II 17th-century former coaching inn that also boasts a decidedly fancy and swanky restaurant that steers well away from muddy wellies and sticky toffee pudding, and instead pitches its tent in the land of wood pigeon with white beetroot and lavender, Norfolk chicken pressé with pickled girolles and sweetcorn, and <i>ajo blanco</i> with grapes, cantaloupe melon and nasturtium. And, to be fair, it might well not be for everyone. Gourmands, birthday treats and special occasions, perhaps, but picky children and Aunty Pam who just wants toad-in-the-hole might find the semi-formality a bit testing.</p>\n<p>Over at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jun/14/theres-nothing-else-like-it-the-ritz-is-crowned-best-restaurant-in-the-uk\">the Ritz</a> in London, I note that they call this style of dining “an epicurean journey”, which is, I feel, modern shorthand for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jun/22/duchy-restaurant-london-grace-dent-restaurant-review\">small</a> yet significant portions of largely French-influenced gastronomy heaving with finesse, technique and accomplishment. Whether or not epicurean journeys are delicious is a moot point, however, because we are here to gasp spellbound at the chef’s imagination and to nod sagely as a surprise amuse-bouche of fresh peas and lovage is delivered in a teeny ramekin with an equally ickle spoon. That’s followed by an equally precise and inoffensive minuscule tartlet of fresh sweetcorn and whipped cream cheese. <br/>\n  Decor-wise, and despite its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/06/enclume-cumbria-cartmel-restaurant-review\">L’Enclume</a> vibes, the Greyhound hasn’t gone fully stripped back with stone floors and crofter’s cottage chic, as so many other highfalutin country pubs have done, and prefers instead to complement its olde-worlde low beams and wooden floors with warm, cinnamon-coloured leather horseshoe banquettes, patterned wallpaper, bottle-green velour cocktail chairs and modern art on every wall. This may be an oligarch’s saloon bar teetering on the edge of chintz, but it’s still hugely cosy and welcoming. Daytrippers lured this way by the model village could not help but be seduced by its sheer quaintness.</p>\n<p>We ordered from the à la carte, rather than the six-plus course, £110-a-head tasting menu, and began with a pleasant bowl of <a href=\"https://www.lalatteria.co.uk/burrata/\">La Latteria burrata</a> in a green nasturtium pesto and topped with a sweet, peachy granita. Hereford rump cap tartare looked like something out of a fairytale, and was served very roughly chopped and arranged like a bird’s nest around a miso confit egg, pickled shimeji mushrooms and some capers. A main of roast sea bass had a gorgeously crisp skin and came with a silky spin on beurre blanc and some rather al dente braised baby fennel. Another main of wood pigeon erred on the side of well done and was submerged in a rich cherry jus that resembled nothing so much as a crime scene.</p>\n<p>There’s some clever, cogent cooking going on at the Greyhound, with some hits, some misses, but an overall sense that, in a bid to be the best restaurant for miles around, they might just be missing the chance to be simply delicious. Still, diners all around us, celebrating birthdays and anniversaries, were having a lovely time of it, and the restaurant was ticking over very nicely, thank you, especially for a Tuesday evening.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/03/the-greyhound-beaconsfield-buckinghamshire-restaurant-review-grace-dent\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Yesterday, we left a garden with a fig tree as tall as a house to catch a train to Rome Termini station, where tiny, thrill-seeking figs grow on the tracks. The fearless fig tree is a descendant of the prehistoric wild caprifig, which spread from Caria (hence the species name <i>carica</i>) in ancient Anatolia, across the Mediterranean. Cultivation is thought to have started in Egypt and the Levant, probably between 4000 and 2700BC; particular evidence of this is the common fig (<i>Ficus </i><i>carica</i>) on the stone walls within ancient Egyptian tombs called <i>mastaba</i>, painted so their occupants could enjoy the fruit in the afterlife.</p>\n<p>Dozens of examples are described in a research paper by the professor of Egyptology Noha Hany Gerges Salama, including paintings within a fifth-dynasty mastaba of Iymery, in Giza. One painting in particular depicts two fig trees, both of which have a boy standing in their branches and picking fruit, while men under the trees collect fallen figs in baskets. Another exquisite painting shows two men seated opposite each other, one of whom is holding a plate holding three enormous figs. Salama notes what a common food source fresh and dried figs were in ancient Egypt, and used often to enhance flavour and sweeten, but also how figs, their leaves and the sap from the branches provided a natural rennet for cheese-making and yeast for wine-making.</p>\n<p>The many varieties of figs fall into two broad groups: those that reproduce without pollination, and those that rely on little gnat-sized fig wasps to do it for them. Either way, figs are botanically not a single fruit, but a cluster of more than a thousand tiny flowers, which are thought of as seeds. Figs are also one of the few fruits to taste best when over-ripe, when those thousand tiny fruits have matured into an ambrosial cross between honey and jam, and as a result perfect for attracting both wasps and this week’s recipe.</p>\n<p>It’s a variation on the wonderful <i>crostata di ricotta e visciole</i> (sour cherry and ricotta tart) from the Jewish-Roman tradition, using figs and orange instead, and I have also varied the pastry by adding some (optional) orange zest and ground almonds. Always work quickly with pastry, and with cold hands, and don’t skip the chilling or the preheating of the baking tray, which prevents a soggy bottom. And if you can’t find figs, fig jam works beautifully, too.</p>\n<p>You can serve this tart hot out of the oven, but it is better, I think, when it has cooled a bit, so both the ricotta and fig layers have had the chance to firm up, which makes it easier to cut. Like its cherry cousin, the tart is also wonderful at room temperature and fridge-cold, especially for breakfast.</p>\n<h2>Fig, ricotta and orange tart</h2>\n<p>Serves <strong>8–10</strong><strong>150g cold butter</strong>, diced<strong>250g plain flour</strong>, plus extra for dusting<br/>\n  50g ground almonds<strong>1 pinch of salt\n  60g icing sugar\n  2 medium eggs</strong>, lightly beaten, plus extra for brushing</p>\n<p><strong>1 unwaxed orange</strong>, 2 strips of zest pared off, the rest of the zest finely grated, plus 2 tbsp juice</p>\n<p><strong>400g fresh figs</strong>, chopped, or 300g fig jam</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>175g</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>caster sugar</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>500g ricotta<br/>1 egg</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>1 egg</p>\n<p>Rub the butter into the flour and ground almonds until the mix resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add the salt, icing sugar, grated orange zest and eggs, then mix to make a soft pastry. Wrap in greaseproof paper and chill in the fridge for at least an hour.</p>\n<p>Put the figs in a pan with the two strips of orange zest, orange juice and 100g of the sugar. Bring to a boil, turn down to a lively simmer and cook for five to seven minutes,<strong> </strong>until the figs are tender and collapsing, but not mushy.</p>\n<p>On a lightly floured surface, roll out two-thirds of the pastry into a disc a little larger than a 24cm tart tin. Drape the pastry over a rolling pin, unfurl it into the tin and push it into the corners. Trim off the excess pastry with a knife.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/28/rachel-roddy-recipe-fig-ricotta-orange-tart\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>I’ve made chef <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/cheftimanderson/?hl=en-gb\">Tim Anderson</a>’s okonomiyaki from memory for years, realising only recently that rice is <i>not </i>a traditional ingredient and that his recipe is, in fact, for rice <i>yaki</i>, a speciality of Kyushu. It’s the first cousin to okonomiyaki in that it’s a crisp cabbage pancake, but with cooked rice as the main ingredient; after that, however, it’s up to you what you put in. I like to make this mini mushroom version because, miraculously, my children eat it. And the secret to a super-crisp pancake? A good gluten-free flour (I like <a href=\"https://www.freee-foods.co.uk/shop-category/flour/\">Freee</a>) – the combination of flours in a gluten-free mix gives you an amazingly crisp pancake.</p>\n    <h2>Mini mushroom okonomiyaki</h2>\n    <p>I really like finely chopped kimchi and greek yoghurt on the side. After all, <i>okonomi</i> means “as you like it”, which I take as a green light for “anything goes”.</p>\n    <p>Prep <strong>15 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>15 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>2-3</strong></p>\n    <p><strong>2 </strong><strong>tbsp sesame oil</strong>, or neutral oil <strong>\n  150g shiitake mushrooms</strong>, roughly chopped</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>1</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>garlic clove</strong>, peeled and finely grated</p>\n    <p><strong>2½cm piece fresh ginger</strong>, peeled and grated</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>1½</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>tsp flaky sea salt</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>2</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>eggs</strong>, beaten</p>\n    <p><strong>100g white cabbage</strong>, thinly sliced</p>\n    <p><strong>200g cooked white rice<br/>50g cheddar</strong>, roughly chopped</p>\n    <p>50g cheddar</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>40g gluten-free flour</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>3 spring onions</strong>, finely sliced</p>\n    <p>To serve<strong>Mayonnaise </strong><strong>and brown sauce</strong>, or<i> </i>Kewpie and okonomi sauce, if you have it</p>\n    <p>Heat a tablespoon of oil in a nonstick frying pan, then add the mushrooms, garlic, ginger and a half-teaspoon of flaky salt. Stir-fry for four to five minutes, until the mushrooms are just cooked through, then tip into a bowl.</p>\n    <p>Add the beaten eggs, cabbage, cooked rice, cheddar, flour, spring onions and the remaining teaspoon of salt to the mushroom bowl, and mix well to combine.</p>\n    <p>Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the same frying pan, then, working in batches, add tablespoons of the mixture and flatten each one into a rough disc. Fry the mini okonomiyaki on a medium heat for two to three minutes on each side, until golden brown (the cheese will melt in patches and crisp up), then transfer to a plate lined with kitchen roll and keep warm in a low (70C (50C fan)/gas very low) oven while you cook the rest of the mixture.</p>\n    <p>Serve hot with your choice of sauces: Japanese mayonnaise and okonomiyaki sauce are traditional, but regular mayonnaise and brown (or, indeed, tamarind) sauce are good, too, if that’s what you have.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/01/quick-and-easy-recipe-for-mini-mushroom-okonomiyaki-rukmini-iyer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Celery divides people, perhaps because most of us are introduced to it in the form of batons dipped into hummus, which I don’t feel is its best form. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy raw celery – it has an earthy pepperiness that I find quite moreish – but I adore it in cooked form, especially with soy and garlic, and today’s recipe is a take on a wok-fried celery dish that we often eat at large banquets in Malaysia. But first, a silky, fragrant curry with tender baby aubergines and a golden coconut base that’s perfect with hot steamed rice and a scattering of fresh herbs. These baby purple aubergines are perfect for one person, and hold their structure well in a curry. I adore them.</p>\n<h2>Yellow curry with baby aubergine (pictured top)</h2>\n<p>This is more for a day when I’m pottering around – the paste seems a bit laborious, but I don’t believe that cooking for yourself always needs to be quick; love and care and time can also be put into the process, especially when you get this golden, rich and nourishing curry at the end.</p>\n<p>Prep <strong>20 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>40 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>1</strong></p>\n<p>\n      <strong>200ml coconut milk\n  1 tbsp coconut oil\n  3 baby </strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>aubergines</strong>, cut into 4cm chunks</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>4–5 curry leaves<br/>¼ tsp ground turmeric</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>¼ tsp ground turmeric</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>\n        <br/>\n      </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>½ tbsp fish sauce</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Juice of ¼ lime</strong>, or to taste</p>\n<p><strong>½ tsp palm sugar</strong>, or brown sugar</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>\n        <br/>\n      </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 pinch of salt</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>¼ tsp MSG</strong>(optional, but lovely)</p>\n<p>For the paste<strong>\n  1 small shallot</strong>,</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>peeled and chopped</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>, peeled and roughly chopped (about 1 tsp)<br/>1 small thumb of ginger</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>1 small thumb of ginger</p>\n<p><strong>1 small thumb of galangal</strong>, chopped (about 1 tsp)</p>\n<p><strong>½ stalk lemongrass</strong>, tender part only, finely sliced</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>garlic clove,</strong>peeled and chopped</p>\n<p><strong>1 dried red chilli</strong>, soaked in hot water for 10 minutes, drained and chopped</p>\n<p><strong>1 small fresh red chilli</strong>,</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>chopped</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>¼ tsp belacan</strong>(shrimp paste), dry toasted until crumbly</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>To serve<br/><br/></strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Steamed jasmine rice</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Dill sprigs</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>(optional)<br/>Crispy garlic</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Crispy garlic</p>\n<p>Put all the paste ingredients in a blender and blitz to a rough paste; if need be, add a splash of water to help it along.</p>\n<p>In a small pan, reduce the coconut milk on a low-medium heat until it thickens and starts to split slightly – this will help bring out its natural oils and sweetness. In a second pan, heat a little coconut oil, then fry the aubergines in batches until golden and soft. Transfer to a rack or plate lined with paper towel to drain any excess oil.</p>\n<p>In the same pan, fry the curry leaves in a touch of oil until they start to pop, then add the paste and cook gently on a medium heat, stirring continuously, for five to seven minutes, until fragrant and the oil begins to split – this is when the magic happens. Add the turmeric and fry for another 30 seconds.</p>\n<p>Stir in the reduced coconut milk, season with the fish sauce, lime juice, a little sugar, salt and MSG, if using, then taste and adjust until it hits that beautiful balance of salty, sweet, sour and creamy. Return the aubergines to the pan and simmer for a few minutes so they soak up all that rich flavour. Serve with steamed jasmine rice and topped with fresh dill and crispy garlic.</p>\n<h2>Chinese-style spicy garlic celery</h2>\n<p>Once you get the knack of the timings, you can switch up the flavourings to whatever you fancy; if you want a more floral version, say, add some fried ginger. Again, this is a dish bursting with flavour and something I make for myself when I need something green with a satisfying crunch.</p>\n<p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>15 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>1</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2 tbsp Shaoxing rice wine\n  3 tbsp light soy sauce\n  1 tsp white sugar\n  2 tbsp vegetable oil\n  1 bunch celery</strong>, sliced on an angle</p>\n<p><strong>5 garlic cloves</strong>, peeled and finely diced</p>\n<p><strong>1 tsp cornflour</strong>, mixed with 3 tbsp water to make a paste</p>\n<p><strong>Salt and white pepper<br/>1 tsp Malaysian crispy prawn chilli</strong>, or crispy chilli oil</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/01/yellow-curry-with-baby-aubergine-chinese-style-spicy-garlic-celery-recipes-julie-lin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s also a very simple bake, because the show-stopping bit is all in the assembly.</p>\n<p>Prep <strong>1 hr</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>1 hr 5 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>8-10</strong></p>\n<p>For the pastry layer (optional)<strong>60g plain flour\n  5g cocoa powder\n  25g caster sugar\n  40g softened butter\n  Salt</strong></p>\n<p>For the sponge<strong>6 large eggs\n  140g soft light brown sugar\n  60g cocoa powder\n  Salt</strong></p>\n<p>For the filling<strong>750g fresh or frozen cherries</strong>, or 700g morello cherries in syrup (see step 1)<strong>60g caster sugar </strong>(only if using fresh or frozen cherries)<strong>1½ tbsp kirsch</strong>, or unsweetened cherry brandy (cherry liqueur will work, but is much sweeter)<strong>500ml double or whipping cream\n  ½ tsp vanilla extract\n  50g icing sugar\n  300g cherry jam\n  1 square dark chocolate</strong>, shaved into curls</p>\n<h2>1 A note on the cherries</h2>\n<p>Traditionally, this cake is made with sour cherries, which aren’t readily available in the UK. You can sometimes find them frozen, or use morello cherries in syrup/juice, instead, but there are still summer cherries in the shops, so I’ve devised this recipe to use the fresh sweet variety (skip step 2 if you’re using jarred or tinned fruit).</p>\n<h2>2 Prepare the cherries</h2>\n<p>Stone all but 10 of your fresh or frozen cherries, if need be, and set aside the unstoned fruit for now. The only easy way to do this is with a cherry pitter; they’re not expensive and some can also be used for olives.</p>\n<p>Put the stoned cherries in a saucepan with the caster sugar, set it over a medium heat and cook, stirring gently, until the cherries soften but are still holding their shape.</p>\n<h2>3 Pasty or no pastry?</h2>\n<p>Traditionally, the base of this cake is made from shortcrust pastry, rather than sponge, for the simple reason that it holds up better to being drenched in cherry juice and brandy than cake does. You can skip this and the next two steps for a simpler three-tier sponge cake that will require less cream and fewer cherries.</p>\n<h2>4 Make the pastry dough</h2>\n<p>Line the base of a 20cm, loose-bottomed tin with a circle of greaseproof paper that’s cut neatly to fit. Sift the flour and cocoa powder for the pastry layer, if making, into a large bowl, add the sugar and a pinch of salt, and whisk to combine. Squidge in the butter to make a soft dough.</p>\n<h2>5 Bake the pastry layer</h2>\n<p>Use your fingers to press the dough into the base of the lined tin, so it covers it in a thin, fairly even layer. Cover and chill for 20 minutes while you heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6, then bake for 15 minutes, until crisp. Take the tin out of the oven, carefully lift out the pastry and leave to cool.</p>\n<h2>6 Start the cake batter</h2>\n<p>Line the same tin with more greaseproof paper and turn down the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4.</p>\n<p>Separate the eggs into two large bowls and whisk the yolks with the sugar until the latter dissolves and the mixture begins to thicken.</p>\n<p>Sieve in the cocoa powder and a pinch of salt, and stir gently to combine.</p>\n<h2>7 Finish the batter and bake</h2>\n<p>Beat the egg whites until stiff, then stir a spoonful of them into the egg yolk mixture, just to loosen. Gently fold in the rest of the egg whites, then carefully spoon the mixture into the lined tin. Smooth out the top and bake for 35-40 minutes, until the cake is puffed up and set on top. Leave to cool completely in the tin (and be warned that it will sink slightly).</p>\n<h2>8 Flavour the cake</h2>\n<p>Drain the cooked cherries and mix 50ml of their syrup with the kirsch. Use a bread knife to cut the cooled cake into three layers.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/31/how-to-make-black-forest-gateau-recipe-felicity-cloake\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Modern Hackney Wick has a working overground station, several reformer pilates studios and, since the middle of last year, a new-build courtyard where <a href=\"https://inisfishisland.com/\">Inis</a>, an Irish-influenced bistro, serves thick chunks of Guinness cake and bowls of potato scallops with dainty silver jugs of curry sauce. Eat at Inis, then walk back via the artisan fromagerie and the padel court.</p>\n<p>The Wick was not always thus, especially for diners. Those who knew the place in the noughties, before its decimation and reconstruction for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012\">the 2012 London Olympics</a>, may well lament those bygone days. At one point circa 2005, <a href=\"https://www.formans.co.uk/restaurant/\">Forman’s fish restaurant</a>, which boasted a “view of the canal”, was one of the – cough – sole options round these parts. Back then, the canal, where these days young things frolic, was a swamp of shopping trolleys and sad-looking swans, and your salmon en croute might be accompanied by the spectacle of dehydrated ravers trying to find home two days after Friday’s squat party. Gentrification has come at a price, though, with stratospheric rents, in particular, but there are now also street art tours, sourdough pizzas and a great many places where you can buy terrible pre-mixed cocktails.</p>\n<p>None of that is anything quite like Inis, which is open for breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner, and owned and run by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lynseycoughlan/\">Lynsey Coughlan</a>, formerly of <a href=\"https://thegingerpig.co.uk/\">the Ginger Pig</a> butcher, and ex-art director Lindsay Lewis, alongside head chef Craig Johnson. Inis, from the offset, seemed determined to treat its clientele as grownups and its postcode as a proper community in need of a nice, neighbourhood restaurant. The place clearly wanted to be somewhere to come and come again, and to take your parents to whenever they were in town. There’s alfresco dining, though that’s possibly advisable only if you’re keen on Lime bikes, joggers and enjoying the cleaner, fresher canal. Oh, and importantly, especially if, like me, you only really like five people and two of those are Irish wolfhounds, it’s dog-friendly, too.</p>\n<p>Inis is Irish in spirit, but it isn’t Irish-themed. Yes, you can expect Guinness on draft, of course, and Irish breads all rich with treacle and rye, oysters from the west coast of Ireland, Sunday roasts and mince on toast. Irish people who miss their mother’s cooking might go for the house-glazed ham with coleslaw, the Ogleshield cheese pastries or the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_fillet_roll\">chicken fillet rolls</a> inspired by days frittered away on Pearse Street in Dublin. At night, however, the dinner menu reaches for deliciously lofty moments when rare duck and cucumber meet tahini and sweet, punchy hoisin, when a tranche of Cornish turbot comes festooned with sea vegetables, when elegant house martinis match with delicate watermelon salads, and when hunks of rare onglet come piled with excellent, al dente bobby beans and assertive homemade horseradish.</p>\n<p>The style is fresh, hyper-seasonal and absolutely homemade. It’s this that draws me back here time and again, the from-scratch element of the cakes and breads, in particular, because that’s as rare as hen’s teeth in British casual dining. On my first visit to Inis in its opening weeks, I popped by for a mid-morning coffee and maybe some soda bread with raspberry jam, and perhaps even a bowl of hot smoked trout on new potatoes, but I was immediately seduced by a fearsome and glistening lump of fine-looking Guinness cake that seemed to wink at me from under its glass cloche. “Is it freshly made?” I asked Coughlan. She assured me that chef had only recently tipped this majestic beauty out of its tin, and that it would be on that evening’s dinner menu and served with custard. At that exact point, my love affair with Inis was born.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/31/inis-london-e3-grace-dent-restaurant-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Jam is a simple product: it’s mostly fruit and sugar with added pectin and sometimes citric acid, and it needs little else, so I tend to avoid any with unnecessary additives. Legally, it has to contain a minimum level of sugar, so when manufacturers use fruit juice concentrate instead of sugar, they often fall below that threshold and have to call their product a fruit spread instead.</p>\n<p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>I tasted 10 jams straight from the jar, much to my teeth’s dismay, and then again spread on warm buttered baguette. Every product was delicious in its own right, but some really stood out as exceptional, with serious complexity and depth, and not overpowered by the sugar.</p>\n<p>Strawberries are among <a href=\"https://www.pan-uk.org/site/wp-content/uploads/Pesticides-in-our-food-multiple-residues-June-2019-1.pdf\">the most heavily sprayed crops</a> in the UK, according to <a href=\"https://www.pan-uk.org/dirty-dozen/\">Pesticide Action Network’s “dirty dozen”</a>, so I always look for organic strawberry products, especially in a concentrated one such as jam. Where the sugar content is notably high or low, I’ve also included the percentage of sugars. Sugar is integral to jam – it’s what preserves the fruit, after all – but in today’s health-conscious world, it’s worth knowing what you’re spreading. It’s also worth noting that there’s a trade-off for lower-sugar jams in that, once opened, they have a shorter shelf life.</p>\n<p>It’s also remarkable how many of these brands are steeped in history: Wilkin &amp; Sons started Tiptree jam back in 1885; Hartley’s was founded in Lancashire in 1871; St Dalfour was established in rural France at the turn of the 19th century; and Bonne Maman arrived in 1971. These are more than just spreads – they’re edible heritage.</p>\n<h2>The best supermarket strawberry jam</h2>\n<h2><i>Best </i><i>overall</i>:<br/>\n Duchy Organic strawberry extra jam preserve</h2>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.waitrose.com%2Fecom%2Fproducts%2Fduchy-organic-strawberry-extra-jam-preserve%2F615219-87285-87286&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/30/best-supermarket-strawberry-jams-tasted-rated\">£2 for 340g at Waitrose (59p/100g)</a>\n    </p>\n<p>★★★★★</p>\n<p>Mahogany red with deep flavour and a pleasantly sour twang, making it my favourite for both flavour and texture.

Be that as it may, there has never been a full-service, U.S.-based airline operating in this market.</p>\n<p>As for Nice, <strong>this will be the first time</strong> Boston-based travelers enjoy a nonstop connection to the Pearl of the French Riviera, without requiring stopovers in Paris. Previously, Delta only offered nonstop service to Nice from Atlanta, New York (JFK), and Philadelphia.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Delta-plane-backdropped-by-Utah-mountains.jpg\">\n        <graphic decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Delta-plane-backdropped-by-Utah-mountains.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-212281 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Delta-plane-backdropped-by-Utah-mountains.jpg.webp 1200w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Delta-plane-backdropped-by-Utah-mountains-300x300.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Delta-plane-backdropped-by-Utah-mountains-1024x1024.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Delta-plane-backdropped-by-Utah-mountains-150x150.jpg.webp 150w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Delta-plane-backdropped-by-Utah-mountains-768x768.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Delta-plane-backdropped-by-Utah-mountains-728x728.jpg.webp 728w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Delta-plane-backdropped-by-Utah-mountains-960x960.jpg.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Delta-plane-backdropped-by-Utah-mountains-1080x1080.jpg.webp 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Delta-plane-backdropped-by-Utah-mountains.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-2\" loading=\"lazy\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Now that Madrid and Nice are in the cards, Delta will serve at least a dozen European destinations from Boston next summer. Madrid flights will be available daily, while Nice ones will initially run on a three-times-weekly schedule, on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.</p>\n<p>By the way, in the meantime, Barcelona flights will increase to a daily frequency from May 7, and Milan will see four-times-weekly flights from May 16.</p>\n<h3>What To Expect From Delta's New Europe Flights</h3>\n<p>It's no wonder Delta is investing this heavily in Boston, now that Logan International hosts their Delta One Lounge and a revamped, larger Sky Club Space. In short<strong>, they're aiming to become the first choice</strong> for travelers heading to Europe.</p>\n<p>Comfort plays a huge part in it, as well. Both Madrid and Nice routes will be run on a brand new Airbus A330-900neo, with a 281-seat configuration.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Delta-Air-Lines-Aircraft-Parked-Near-A-Delta-Hub.jpg\">\n        <graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Delta-Air-Lines-Aircraft-Parked-Near-A-Delta-Hub.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Delta Air Lines Aircraft Parked Near A Delta Hub\" class=\"wp-image-185605 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Delta-Air-Lines-Aircraft-Parked-Near-A-Delta-Hub.jpg.webp 1200w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Delta-Air-Lines-Aircraft-Parked-Near-A-Delta-Hub-300x300.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Delta-Air-Lines-Aircraft-Parked-Near-A-Delta-Hub-1024x1024.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Delta-Air-Lines-Aircraft-Parked-Near-A-Delta-Hub-150x150.jpg.webp 150w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Delta-Air-Lines-Aircraft-Parked-Near-A-Delta-Hub-768x768.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Delta-Air-Lines-Aircraft-Parked-Near-A-Delta-Hub-728x728.jpg.webp 728w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Delta-Air-Lines-Aircraft-Parked-Near-A-Delta-Hub-960x960.jpg.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Delta-Air-Lines-Aircraft-Parked-Near-A-Delta-Hub-1080x1080.jpg.webp 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Delta-Air-Lines-Aircraft-Parked-Near-A-Delta-Hub.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-3\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Out of those, 29 are reserved for Delta One (their business class) seats, 28 are for Premium Select (the equivalent to Premium Economy, 56 are Comfort+ seats (these typically offer extra legroom), and finally, 168 seats in the Main Cabin.</p>\n<p>As far as competition goes, <strong>Madrid is a smart move</strong>.

There are lower crowds than in winter, that's for sure, but if you're visiting on the weekend, you should expect a major influx of beach bums at public bathing areas, and partygoers to flock into the entertainment district.</p>\n<p>Long gone are the days you could just ‘chance it' and book stuff last-minute in the fall. Be it trendy restaurants, popular activities, like visiting cenotes or Mayan ruins, or spa appointments at your resort, you'd be wise to secure spots in advance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cancun-Declared-Safe-For-Swimming-After-2300-Beaches-Nationwide-Inspected-For-Sanitary-Conditions.jpg.webp\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" width=\"1223\" height=\"816\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cancun-Declared-Safe-For-Swimming-After-2300-Beaches-Nationwide-Inspected-For-Sanitary-Conditions.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Swimming in hotel zone\" class=\"wp-image-213440 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cancun-Declared-Safe-For-Swimming-After-2300-Beaches-Nationwide-Inspected-For-Sanitary-Conditions.jpg.webp 1223w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cancun-Declared-Safe-For-Swimming-After-2300-Beaches-Nationwide-Inspected-For-Sanitary-Conditions.jpg-300x200.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cancun-Declared-Safe-For-Swimming-After-2300-Beaches-Nationwide-Inspected-For-Sanitary-Conditions.jpg-1024x683.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cancun-Declared-Safe-For-Swimming-After-2300-Beaches-Nationwide-Inspected-For-Sanitary-Conditions.jpg-768x512.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cancun-Declared-Safe-For-Swimming-After-2300-Beaches-Nationwide-Inspected-For-Sanitary-Conditions.jpg-960x641.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cancun-Declared-Safe-For-Swimming-After-2300-Beaches-Nationwide-Inspected-For-Sanitary-Conditions.jpg-1080x721.webp 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cancun-Declared-Safe-For-Swimming-After-2300-Beaches-Nationwide-Inspected-For-Sanitary-Conditions.jpg-1200x801.webp 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cancun-Declared-Safe-For-Swimming-After-2300-Beaches-Nationwide-Inspected-For-Sanitary-Conditions.jpg.webp\" data-mvt-skip=\"src\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-2\" loading=\"lazy\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p>\n<h3>Who Will You Be Sharing the Resort With?</h3>\n<p>The <i>Cancun Sun</i> also reiterates that, despite the continuous crowding, <strong>the  type of crowd changes.</strong></p>\n<p>After all, schools across the United States and Canada have resumed classes, so you can for sure expect to see fewer families with children and adolescents in resorts. This helps contribute to the overall adult-centered, more laid-back feel.</p>\n<p>That being said, you can never entirely rule out children running around and splashing around in the pool when all you need is some peace and quiet. Your fellow Americans may be gone, but there will be families from other parts of the world that do not operate under the U.S. school schedule.</p>\n<p>In those cases, it's best to book an adults-only resort.

In the words of the <i>Cancun Sun</i>, this era is now ‘over':</p>\n<p>Granted, there is <strong>still better value to be found</strong> in the fall compared to the winter period, but the rising demand from Cancun, not only from Americans, but travelers worldwide, has resulted in prices staying at a plateau instead of dropping significantly.</p>\n<p>When it comes to tours and private transportation, you might even notice there's no difference at all. Based on the expert advice, the best way to save money is to look for a ‘package deal': there are still plenty of ‘5th Night Free' and flight-and-hotel combos in offer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-04-22-08_29_38-shutterstock_2589679945.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1211\" height=\"810\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-04-22-08_29_38-shutterstock_2589679945.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Tourists Visiting Cancun Warned To Be Cautious On All Beaches After Multiple Incidents\" class=\"wp-image-205335 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-04-22-08_29_38-shutterstock_2589679945.jpg.webp 1211w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-04-22-08_29_38-shutterstock_2589679945-300x201.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-04-22-08_29_38-shutterstock_2589679945-1024x685.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-04-22-08_29_38-shutterstock_2589679945-768x514.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-04-22-08_29_38-shutterstock_2589679945-960x642.jpg.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-04-22-08_29_38-shutterstock_2589679945-1080x722.jpg.webp 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-04-22-08_29_38-shutterstock_2589679945-1200x803.jpg.webp 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-04-22-08_29_38-shutterstock_2589679945.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-4\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p>\n<h3><strong>Navigating the Weather: Hurricanes and Sargassum</strong></h3>\n<p>Last but not least, we have the weather conditions.

These objects—<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/missions/hubble/hubble-takes-census-of-elusive-brown-dwarf-stars/\">something between a planet and a star</a>—are notoriously difficult to study. They’re small, cold and faint, making them hard to detect. And determining a brown dwarf’s age also poses a challenge. That’s because, unlike stars, brown dwarfs continuously cool throughout their lifespan, so their characteristics are constantly changing.</p>\n    <p>To <a href=\"http://www.americanscientist.org/article/search-for-brown-dwarfs\">find these strange objects</a>, astronomers might look for brown dwarfs when they’re young and still burning brightly, or seek out ones that are relatively close to us.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://astronomy.nju.edu.cn/EN/People/AssociateProfessors/20200707/i113755.html\">Zenghua Zhang</a>, an astronomer at Nanjing University in China, and his team were initially searching for brown dwarfs by seeking out their bright stellar companions. The scientists sifted through data from the European Space Agency’s Gaia telescope and NASA’s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and were rewarded when they identified a brown dwarf orbiting a bright star<i>.</i></p>\n    <p>They soon realized, however, that there wasn’t just one brown dwarf, but two. Then, they discovered there were also two of the bright, stellar companions.</p>\n    <p>“I like to call this a double-double,” says <a href=\"https://astro.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/index.html\">Adam Burgasser</a>, an astrophysicist at the University of California, San Diego, and a member of the research team, to Katrina Miller at the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/25/science/quadruple-star-system.html\"> New York Times</a>. The discovery was highlighted in a recent study published in the </p>\n    <p>\n      <i/>\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/542/2/656/8155088\"/>\n    <i>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</i>\n    <p>\n      <i>.</i>\n    </p>\n    <h4>Fun fact: The first known brown dwarf</h4>\n    <p>Astronomers <a href=\"https://www.space.com/23798-brown-dwarfs.html\">identified the first brown dwarf</a> in 1995 and named it Gliese 229Ba. But something seemed odd about it—and in 2024, a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08064-x\">study</a> revealed the <a href=\"https://www.space.com/brown-dwarf-failed-star-binary-gliese-229b\">brown dwarf was actually two</a>, orbiting each other so closely that they’re only 16 times more distant than the Earth and moon.</p>\n    <p>The system, named UPM J1040−3551 AabBab, is located about 82 light-years from Earth. The two pairs—the brown dwarfs and the bright stars, identified as <a href=\"https://www.space.com/23772-red-dwarf-stars.html\">red dwarfs</a>—are separated by 1,656 astronomical units, making them 1,656 times farther apart from each other than the Earth is from the sun.</p>\n    <p>This unusual quartet can provide a “unique cosmic laboratory for studying these mysterious objects,” says co-author <a href=\"https://cab.inta-csic.es/en/personal/galvez-ortiz-maria-cruz/\">Maria Cruz Gálvez-Ortiz</a>, an astrophysicist at the Center for Astrobiology in Spain, in a <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2025-08-rare-quadruple-star-mystery-brown.html\">statement</a>.</p>\n    <p>Because the objects likely formed around the same time from similar materials, the companion stars offer a benchmark from which researchers can uncover certain characteristics about the brown dwarfs, such as their ages and compositions. The brown dwarfs in this system appear similar in size to Jupiter, but they contain 10 to 30 times more mass.</p>\n    <p>With the help of the <a href=\"https://noirlab.edu/public/programs/ctio/soar-telescope/\">Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR)</a> telescope in Chile, scientists observed the red dwarf stars in visible light and the brown dwarfs in near-infrared. They found that the system is between 300 million and 2 billion years old, making it relatively young. They also concluded that the two brown dwarfs have temperatures of about 1,016 degrees Fahrenheit and 782 degrees Fahrenheit, while the brighter companions have temperatures of approximately 5,300 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>\n    <p>“This system offers a dual benefit for brown dwarf science,” Burgasser adds in the statement. “It can serve as an age benchmark to calibrate low-temperature atmosphere models and as a mass benchmark to test evolutionary models, if we can resolve the brown dwarf binary and track its orbit.”</p>\n    <p>And the fact that this star system has two pairs of objects is even better for scientists. It “helps twice as much,” Burgasser tells the <i>New York Times</i>.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/astronomers-spot-a-rare-quadruple-star-system-in-the-milky-way-shedding-light-on-mysterious-brown-dwarfs-180987241/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Matthew Dempsey</p>\n    <p>Around 165 million years ago, a bizarre, armored dinosaur roamed the floodplains of North Africa. The unusual, 13-foot creature, named <i>Spicomellus afer </i>by paleontologists<i>, </i>was adorned with three-foot-long spikes around its collar and plates down its shoulders.</p>\n    <p>Now, paleontologists have discovered the first skeleton of the odd species, marking the oldest ankylosaur fossil ever found. Their findings were published on Wednesday in the journal <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09453-6\"> Nature</a>.</p>\n    <p>“When we originally named <i>Spicomellus</i>, there were doubts that it was an ankylosaur at all,” says <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/people/susannah-maidment.html\">Susannah Maidment</a>, a paleontologist at London’s Natural History Museum, in a <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/news/2025/august/bizarre-armoured-dinosaur-spicomellus-afer-rewrites-ankylosaur-evolution.html\">statement</a>. “Now, not only can we confirm beyond a doubt that this interpretation was correct, but Africa’s only known ankylosaur is far weirder than anyone imagined.”</p>\n    <p>In 2019, Maidment came across a rib fossil from a dealer in Cambridge, England. The bone was unlike any vertebrate she had ever seen—it had protective spines directly fused into its surface. Based solely on that bone, scientists described <i>Spicomellus afer</i> as a new species <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-021-01553-6\">in 2021</a>.</p>\n    <p>Still, Maidment and her colleagues wanted to learn more about the mysterious dinosaur the fossil belonged to, so they went searching in Morocco’s Middle Atlas Mountains. In 2023, they found a more complete skeleton from the same rocks as the 2019 specimen, Maidment writes in a research briefing for <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02690-9\"> Nature</a>.</p>\n    <p>That fossil is now the earliest example scientists have of <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/dino-directory/ankylosaurus.html\">ankylosaurs</a>, a group of bulky, slow-moving dinosaurs that lived from the Middle Jurassic to the end of the Late Cretaceous. “They’re probably a bit dim-witted, as they have relatively small brains, but they’re very successful,” says <a href=\"https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/gees/butler-richard\">Richard Butler</a>, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Birmingham in England who co-led the work, to Hannah Devlin at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/aug/27/oldest-known-ankylosaur-fossil-found-in-morocco\"> Guardian</a>. “They’re around for about 100 million years.”</p>\n    <h4>Fun fact: Africa’s only known ankylosaur</h4>\n    <p>Armored ankylosaurs are mostly known from Late Cretaceous fossils found in the Northern Hemisphere, making their early history in the Jurassic still mysterious. <i>Spicomellus afer</i> is the only ankylosaur species to be described from fossils found in Africa.</p>\n    <p>Further analysis confirmed that <i>Spicomellus </i>evolved early in ankylosaurs’ history, and the discovery changes scientists’ understanding of the group’s evolution. While the fossil is missing its tail, its fused tail vertebrae suggest the animal would have had a club-like weapon at the appendage’s end. That would mean ankylosaurs evolved tail weaponry 30 million years earlier than previously thought.</p>\n    <p>The armor’s ornateness also suggests it evolved to attract mates and assert dominance over rivals, rather than serving a purely defensive purpose, like in later ankylosaurs. “When you see the neck collar of this thing, it seems like total overkill,” says Butler to the <i>Guardian</i>. “It does seem like the kind of thing that would’ve complicated its life.”</p>\n    <p>It’s unclear why the armor of ankylosaurs might have simplified over time, but it would have been energetically expensive to carry intense armor. Larger predators were also evolving, so ankylosaurs might have simplified their armor to be more energy cost-effective and defensive. Or, ankylosaurs might have opted to win mates through combat rather than extravagance, so their armor evolved to be less complex.</p>\n    <p>The findings are “of great importance for a better understanding of the disparity, diversity and evolution of ankylosaurs,” says <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wenjie-Zheng-9\">Wenjie Zheng</a>, a paleontologist at the Zhejiang Museum of Natural History in China, in a statement to <i> Nature</i>.</p>\n    <p>Further research in Morocco could help unearth the answers to some remaining questions. “This study is helping to drive forward Moroccan science,” says study co-author <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Driss-Ouarhache\">Driss Ouarhache</a>, a paleontologist at the Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University in Morocco, in another <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2025-08-bizarre-armored-dinosaur-spicomellus-afer.html\">statement</a>. “We’ve never seen dinosaurs like this before, and there’s still a lot more this region has to offer.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/oldest-known-fossil-of-an-armored-ankylosaur-is-far-weirder-than-paleontologists-expected-180987258/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Sanjay Patel enjoyed success on YouTube with his colorful shorts and is about to release a richly illustrated book that tells the story of the longest poem in the world</h2>\n<p>The<i> Mahabharata</i> is the longest epic in recorded history, seven times the length of Homer’s <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> put together. The Sanskrit verses, attributed to the ancient sage Vyasa (who is also a character in the tale), describe the events leading up to a massive war. The story, set some 5,000 years ago, is loaded with so many divinities, characters and subplots that one European scholar, writing in 1922, <a href=\"https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015074796577&amp;page=root&amp;view=1up&amp;size=100&amp;seq=8\">characterized</a> the <i>Mahabharata</i> as “the most monstrous chaos: Alongside the main narrative, there were veritable jungles of smaller narratives, as well as countless and endless teachings.”</p>\n<p>Sanjay Patel, an artist and former Pixar animator, cuts through these verbal jungles with clear, powerful images. His <a href=\"https://amzn.to/476vmyb\">2010 version of the  Ramayana</a>—another (shorter) Hindu epic—has already been </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DBJY6n-tQR8/\">added</a>to grade school classrooms across the United States. His animated 2023 YouTube series, “</p>\n<p><i>,” introduced Hindu stories to preschoolers, depicting the gods as adorable children. In his richly illustrated 400-page</i></p>\n<p><i>, Patel’s imagery takes on a more somber tone, with sharper angles and darker hues.</i></p>\n<p>It’s a serious story, but Patel hopes his retelling will capture the imaginations of middle schoolers like his oldest son, Arjun (who shares the name of the <i>Mahabharata</i>’s hero). “You have to remix these ideas,” he says, “if you want them to survive.”</p>\n<ul><li>The <i>Mahabharata</i>focuses on the Hindu concept of<i>dharma</i>—living in accord with one’s specific purpose on earth.</li></ul>\n<p>Patel spoke with <i>Smithsonian</i> magazine in advance of the book’s release this October.</p>\n<p><strong>You grew up in San Bernadino, California, with Indian immigrant parents. Did they read these epics to you when you were a kid?</strong></p>\n<p>Nothing was ever formally taught, but my parents had rituals. Every day, I’d have to participate in a meditation or puja practice. But I didn’t understand or appreciate what was behind these symbols and rites and rituals.</p>\n<p><strong>I remember that from “ Sanjay’s Super Team,” your Pixar animated short nominated for an Academy Award in 2016. You showed yourself as a little kid, imagining that the gods your father was worshiping were like the superheroes you liked to watch on TV. </strong></p>\n<p>Part of that story was poetic license. I absolutely was required to participate in these rituals. But my epiphany really came later on when I picked up a book of Hindu miniature paintings. Art was the medium that finally unlocked all these stories and philosophies. That was the context where it finally made sense to me. I started to see these gods as characters, and I sort of got underneath the philosophy that way.</p>\n<h3>\n        <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZ13P5X2?tag=smithsonianco-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\">\n          Mahabharata: Designs of Dharma\n        </a>\n      </h3>\n<p>Adapted and illustrated with both humor and heart for a contemporary audience, this stunning visual retelling of the Indian epic the Mahabharata features more than 400 pages of illustrated text in Academy Award-nominated animator Sanjay Patel’s iconic style.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZ13P5X2?tag=smithsonianco-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\"/></p>\n<p><strong>The Hindu gods are obviously very visual. They have multiple faces, or multiple arms holding weapons or books or musical instruments. That visual element seems to be built into the religion, as a way to understand what the gods represent. </strong></p>\n<p>I honestly think one of the strengths of Hinduism is that there’s no one dogma. There are a lot of symbols and rituals, but in many ways, it’s like a buffet of diverse options. There’s room for people to bring what they want to these symbols and images. If you want more, obviously there are thousands of years of writings about what these symbols and images mean. If you don’t want more, that’s fine too. You can just hang out with a cool image of elephant-headed <a href=\"https://amzn.to/47EvpBv\">Ganesha</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell me about the illustration from your  Mahabharata book where Krishna becomes enormous. </strong></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/veteran-pixar-animator-newest-book-epic-undertaking-began-5000-years-ago-180987179/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Researchers discovered the intricately decorated artifact at an archaeological site near a seventh-century C.E. monastery on the island of Sir Bani Yas</h2>\n<p>Researchers have discovered a Christian cross molded from stucco on a small island in the United Arab Emirates. The 1,400-year-old artifact has helped archaeologists confirm that the surrounding houses were part of a nearby monastery.</p>\n<p>The cross was unearthed on the island of Sir Bani Yas, located about 100 miles west of Abu Dhabi. According to a <a href=\"https://www.mediaoffice.abudhabi/ar/tourism/department-of-culture-and-tourism-abu-dhabi-discovers-ancient-cross-in-latest-archaeological-excavation-at-monastery-site-on-sir-bani-yas-island/\">statement</a> from the Abu Dhabi Media Office, the island was first excavated in the 1990s. During that dig, archaeologists discovered a Christian church and monastery dating to the seventh and eighth centuries C.E. They also found nine small houses complete with courtyards.</p>\n<p>“We never had concrete proof that [the houses] were actually inhabited by Christians,” says <a href=\"https://cambridge.academia.edu/MariaGajewska\">Maria Gajewska</a>, an archaeologist with Abu Dhabi’s Department of Culture and Tourism, in a <a href=\"https://www.mediaoffice.abudhabi/ar/tourism/department-of-culture-and-tourism-abu-dhabi-discovers-ancient-cross-in-latest-archaeological-excavation-at-monastery-site-on-sir-bani-yas-island/\">video</a>. “We have now proved that these houses were indeed part of a Christian settlement.”</p>\n<p>Archaeologists think that both Christians and Muslims lived peacefully on the island until the eighth century, when the monastery was abandoned.</p>\n<p>This year, for the first time in about three decades, archaeologists conducted a comprehensive excavation on Sir Bani Yas. While digging in the courtyard of one of the houses, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/hageralmenhali/?originalSubdomain=ae\">Hager Al Menhali</a>, another department archaeologist, came across a flat piece of plaster.</p>\n<p>“The plaster was resting face down, and something about it caught my attention,” Al Menhali tells the <a href=\"https://www.thenationalnews.com/news/uae/2025/08/19/ancient-christian-cross-found-on-abu-dhabi-island-as-archaeologists-dig-into-mysteries-of-the-past/\"> National</a>’s John Dennehy. “There was a distinct fingerprint on the back,” indicating that someone had molded it. “But when the team carefully turned it over, we were stunned,” she adds. “There it was … a beautifully preserved cross [on] stucco plaster.”</p>\n<p>The rectangular piece of stucco is about one foot long, seven inches wide and one inch thick. The molded plaster forms an ornate cross, flanked by leaves and surrounded by a frame-like border.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sir_Bani_Yas_Island_Panorama.jpg\">Ismail.alghussein via Wikimedia Commons under CC BY-SA 3.0</a>\n    </p>\n<p>The plaster cross features motifs that are common among artifacts from the Middle East. “The stepped pyramid at the bottom, representing the Golgotha; the leaves sprouting from the base; the shape of the cross arms; the dots at the ends and the setting within a niche all find regional parallels in the Gulf and Mesopotamia,” Gajewska tells the <i>National</i>.</p>\n<p>In fact, three other plaster crosses were unearthed in Bahrain last year. Researchers from the University of Exeter discovered the artifacts at what they think was the site of a fourth-century C.E. palace belonging to a bishop, according to an <a href=\"https://news.exeter.ac.uk/faculty-of-humanities-arts-and-social-sciences/archaeologists-discover-the-first-christian-building-in-bahrain/\">announcement</a> from the university.</p>\n<p>On Sir Bani Yas, the residential complex where the cross was found features about nine houses located north and northwest of the main church, according to Gajewska. Inside the buildings, researchers found blackened earth indicating the use of lamps.</p>\n<p>“We currently believe that this is where more senior monks lived and did periods of seclusion,” Gajewska says in the video. They might have “practiced prayer and mental and spiritual discipline before reconvening with their brothers at the monastery.”</p>\n<p>Another theory is that the houses functioned as spiritual retreat cabins for wealthy Christians who wanted to escape their world to pray, Gajewska explains to the <i>National</i>. She says the buildings are unusually well-made, complete with thick stone walls and water cisterns, suggesting that their inhabitants lived comfortably.</p>\n<p>“The ongoing discoveries from Sir Bani Yas Island, even after 30 years of research and excavation, underscore the magnitude of our cultural legacy and the importance of our continued commitment to its preservation and understanding,” Mohamed Khalifa Al Mubarak, chairman of the tourism department, says in the statement, per a translation from the <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-remarkably-preserved-7th-century-christian-cross-unearthed-on-abu-dhabis-sir-bani-yas-island/articleshow/123397659.cms\"> Times of India</a>.</p>\n<p>Today, Sir Bani Yas’ tourism is mainly driven by the <a href=\"https://visitabudhabi.ae/en/where-to-go/parks-and-zoos/arabian-wildlife-park\">Arabian Wildlife Park</a>, which is home to more than 17,000 roaming giraffes, Arabian oryx, cheetahs and other animals. The monastery lies within the nature reserve, and it’s open to visitors.</p>\n<p>Other finds from this year’s dig include pottery and glass artifacts, such as a small green bottle that might have contained oil.

His gaze never leaves my face. He wants to know if I feel the burr on the edge of the knife as the Japanese carbon steel is dragged along my skin to my fingertips. This is a skill largely done by touch, although I’m too busy counting my fingers to pay attention to the tool’s texture.</p>\n<p>Ikegami wakes each morning and goes to his workshop in the city of Sakai, on Osaka Bay in western Japan, as he has done since the age of 15. Each day he sits behind a rotating sharpening stone to produce some of the country’s most sought-after knives. The knives made in Sakai are used by 90 percent of professional chefs in Japan.</p>\n<p>“My father also sharpened knives,” says Ikegami. “I started as a teenager, helping my father with my brothers. I have done this for over 70 years.”</p>\n<p>The history of knife-making in Sakai dates back to the fifth century, when blacksmiths arrived in the area to create tools for the construction of <a href=\"https://www.city.sakai.lg.jp/foreign-language/english/visitors/topics/world_heritage_site/notable_tombs/nintoku-ryo.html\">Nintoku-tenno-ryo Kofun</a>, a 1,594 feet-foot-long tomb that is considered one of the largest burial mounds in the world. According to Shirakami Noriyuki, a curator at the Sakai City Museum, the edged tools found around the tombs seem to be evidence they were made in Sakai. By the 12th century, the blacksmiths had moved from making tools for the emperor’s tomb to forging swords for the samurai.</p>\n<p>The port city flourished, and when the Portuguese arrived in the 16th century, the blacksmiths made them the sharpest of knives for their tobacco crops across the world. During a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/ltn11iN8CYI?feature=shared&amp;t=1914\">talk</a> for the cultural center Japan House London, Noriyuki said geographical location helped spread Sakai’s knife-making fame. “There was a major port,” he said. “It was also a transport hub within the country.”</p>\n<p>So masterful was the workmanship, the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Tokugawa-period\">Tokugawa</a> shogunate awarded Sakai’s knife-makers a seal of approval. As time went on, a shift in power meant that rich merchants moved to Osaka, but the knife-making skills of Sakai were never forgotten by Japan’s chefs.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>In the TV show \"The Bear,\" chef de cuisine Sydney used a <a href=\"https://seisukeknife.com/collections/the-bear-collection?srsltid=AfmBOoryfP0C0zQkRormMC-O4RsMczD29aqgwHjpo2vR3HXKc7s7VsGs\">Sakai Kikumori Blue Steel</a>knife imported to the United States by Seisuke Knife.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Now, once again, Sakai’s knife-makers are catching attention.

    "body": "<h2>The critically endangered species gets a helping hand from an Indonesian facility as the island’s human population is about to explode</h2>\n<p>The baby orangutans were trying to stall before bedtime. One reached out to grab a particularly long leaf through the bars of its cage, encouraging a human to play, then employed a classic toddler sabotage technique: needing to pee. Eventually, the orangutan relented, climbing up a jungle-gym-like structure in an otherwise empty, if messy, room. The floor was littered with sticks and pieces of wood. The baby orangutan settled into a small hammock and pulled a large leaf over its body as a blanket.</p>\n<p>In the wild, orangutans build new nests every night, weaving leaves and branches together and curling up in the tree canopy. But this was not the wild—not quite. This was the site of the world’s largest orangutan conservation organization, the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation, or BOSF, based in the Indonesian part of the island (also known as Kalimantan). The day before, I had watched an adult female, standing on a concrete platform on a lush, artificial island surrounded by water, hold a large palm frond over her body to shield herself from the rain. A permanent resident, she was too tame to be released back into the wild and independent enough not to have to live in a cage.</p>\n<p>Nearby, a large male conducted high-level negotiations with his keeper, who was trying to get him to eat his carrots before a dessert of dragon fruit. Resplendent in impossibly sleek, long and unmatted orange fur, he poked a stick into the deep water between himself and the keeper. <i>If you don’t give me the dragon fruit now</i>, he seemed to be saying, <i>I’ll just have to come over there and get it myself.</i> Orangutans share 97 percent of their DNA with humans. Somewhere in that missing 3 percent was the transparency of the orangutan’s bluff. The keeper knew that the orangutan couldn’t swim. </p>\n<p>If you haven’t been to Borneo, you may imagine it as a land of dense tropical jungle and strange living things—giant flowers, abundant leeches, venomous snakes dangling from vines. In his 1984 memoir <i>Into the Heart of Borneo</i>, the English writer Redmond O’Hanlon described it like this: “Two-hundred-foot-high trees crowded down the slopes of the hills, almost to the water’s edge, an apparently endless chaos of different species of tree, every kind of green, even under the uniform glare of a tropical sun.” </p>\n<p>At the time, three-quarters of Borneo was covered in rainforest. Now almost half of that land has been cleared. The view from my plane as I descended was of coal barges fanning out from the coast. The airport is a large, gleaming white-and-silver building with a Dunkin’ Donuts inside the arrivals lounge. But Borneo’s remaining forest has some of the highest species diversity on earth, according to the World Wildlife Fund for Nature, with one area of Lambir Hills National Park, in Sarawak, Malaysia, holding the world record for tree diversity: more than 1,000 species in 125 acres. And each of these holds its own great diversity, too: Scientists have found 1,000 species of insect in a single tree. Overall, Borneo is home to 6 percent of the world’s biodiversity. Nearly 90 percent of all orangutans in the world can be found there. (The rest are on the Indonesian island of Sumatra.)</p>\n<p>Because orangutans spend almost all their time up in the trees, the island’s deforestation, mainly from palm oil farming and mining, is the biggest threat they face. Borneo’s orangutan population halved between 1999 and 2015, from 300,000 to 150,000. In the decade since then, the population has declined by another third, to 100,000 today. A 2022 study predicted that more than a quarter of today’s population could be lost to deforestation by 2032.</p>\n<p>All of this makes BOSF’s work more crucial than ever. Since the foundation was established in 1991, it has released 533 orangutans, and it maintains 359 permanent residents that are too tame, diseased or disabled to live in the wild. Depending on their circumstances, these residents live in cages or on artificial islands in the foundation’s two centers in East and Central Kalimantan.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/orangutan-sanctuary-borneo-giving-endangered-primates-second-chance-180987152/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>GREENWICH, Conn. — Jeremy Frey weaves slim strips of wood into mesmerizing patterns and color combinations with extreme precision. In each impeccable vessel, ancestral Wabanaki basketmaking traditions crisscross with the Passamaquoddy artist’s distinctive creative vision, and wood harvested from ash trees, sweetgrass, and other foraged materials turn kaleidoscopic, with dizzying geometric patterns and colorwork. A keen sense of craftsmanship and a predilection for challenging boundaries have helped to propel Frey’s work into the national spotlight, landing him top prizes at the top Indian markets, his <a href=\"https://karmakarma.org/exhibitions/jeremy-frey-ny-2023/\">first solo gallery show</a> in 2023, and growing acclaim — for both the artist and his community of fellow Wabanaki basketmakers. </p>\n<p><i>Jeremy Frey: Woven</i><i> </i>marks the artist’s first museum exhibition — and the first presentation of Wabanaki basketry in a fine-art museum. The exhibition, featuring some 50 baskets, first <a href=\"https://www.portlandmuseum.org/woven\">opened</a> at the Portland Museum of Art in Maine in May 2024, before traveling to the Art Institute of Chicago. Now, in its third and final stop, the show is on view at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich, Connecticut through early September. (It recently reopened after the museum closed due to unexpected building maintenance for nearly four weeks of the show’s scheduled three-month run.) A gorgeous, photo-rich <a href=\"http://bookshop.org/a/539/9780847899708\">catalog</a>, the first book about the artist, accompanies the show.</p>\n<p>Born in 1978 on the Passamaquoddy Indian Township Reservation in Maine, Frey is a seventh-generation basketmaker. He learned to make them from his mother, Frances “Gal” Frey, and through apprenticeships facilitated by the <a href=\"https://www.nativeartsandcultures.org/maine-indian-basketmakers-alliance-miba\">Maine Indian Basketmakers Alliance</a>, and gravitated towards decorative “<a href=\"https://umaine.edu/hudsonmuseum/robert-anderson-and-the-leo-and-florence-shay-collection/historic-fancy-baskets/\">fancy baskets</a>” typically sold at markets for household purposes.</p>\n<p>Basketmaking knowledge has been passed through generations of Wabanaki weavers for thousands of years. Each begins in the forest, with a black ash tree, also known as brown ash or “basket tree.” It’s a species that’s deeply intertwined with the culture — in creation myths, the Wabanaki people came from their bark. It’s only after the labor-intensive process of felling a suitable tree, removing the bark, pounding the trunk to loosen strips of wood (or “splints”) from the growth rings, cutting (or “gauging”) the strips to uniform widths, dyeing, and preparing basket forms that the weaving even begins. In the exhibition, “Ash” (2023), a cinematic, non-narrated 11-minute film follows this process. On screen, accompanied by lush layers of nature sounds, Frey weaves with nimble hands, echoing motions perfected by his predecessors through millennia.</p>\n<p><i>Jeremy Frey: Woven</i>at the Bruce Museum</p>\n<p>Showcasing the visual language of Wabanaki basketry and Frey’s inventive additions to the lexicon, this mid-career retrospective traverses the artist’s first two decades as a sculptor. Organized in a rough chronology, starting with his early works (2003–12), <i>Woven</i> traces the ways Frey’s work builds on traditional techniques, including <i>qinusqikon </i>(porcupine or point weave), a weaving method marked by triangular, thorn-like protrusions, and <i>apsoshokunwe</i> (fine weave), in which the wood is gauged down to super-thin strands. </p>\n<p>Frey’s basket-sculptures range in shape and size from squat, spiky forms inspired by sea urchins (a traditional Passamaquoddy food source) that you could cradle in open palms to tall, sleek, fine-weave vases and vessels too wide to circle your arms around, as in “Watchful Spirit” (2022), an intricate and voluminous commission for the Denver Museum of Art, which took Frey six months of concentrated labor to complete. Some vessels are topped with circular finials, others with quillwork lids depicting animals and insects made with quills salvaged from roadkill porcupines — though you may need to stand on tiptoes and crane your neck to see the creatures, given the height of the exhibition’s display cases. A staggered series of rims crown “Biased Top Basket” (2013), and double-walled works harbor secrets. With its muted, undyed exterior, for instance, “Navigating Tradition” (2023) looks like an understated, undyed vessel from some angles. But the interior holds a surprise, bursting with color: a vibrant violet-and-red checkered fine-weave number. The piece encapsulates one of <i>Woven</i>’s recurring themes: the push-and-pull dynamics of tradition and innovation within this enduring Indigenous art form.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035748/jeremy-frey-mesmerizing-wonder-of-wabanaki-weaving/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The <i> Guardian</i>‘s Kaamil Ahmed writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>His work is mostly shared on social media sites such as Instagram but his images are earning attention in the art world, winning him the East African Photography award last year, a series of fellowships and a place in the British Journal of Photography’s “ones to watch” issue last year.</p>\n      <p>The striking masks in his photos were developed while trying to find a creative way to conceal the identities of his models, mindful of the risk to them and their families in Sudan if they were identified.</p>\n      <p>Some of his photos are a commentary on the war itself – such as a series called the Curse of Gold, which depicts men looming over a woman wrapped in gold fabric to represent the looting of Sudan’s gold resources by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.</p>\n      <p>But most of his work is about connecting with other Sudanese with shared experiences of trauma, loss and exile.</p>\n      <p>“I noticed this war isn’t talked about enough in social media or in the news,” he says. “I feel like it’s neglected and that gave me the motivation to talk more about it.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>‣ The latest novel to bridge the literary fiction and visual art spheres is <i>Lonely Crowds</i> by Stephanie Wambugu, who speaks with Tess Pollok in the <i> Los Angeles Review of Books</i> about what inspired her story, including the art market’s fetishization of Black art:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p/>\n      <i>For the most part, the novel does stay firmly embedded in Ruth’s consciousness as she travels through life; I can see how one function of her friendship with Maria is to generate the friction that makes her internal journey compelling. Did you like writing Ruth that way? What attracted you to that character?</i>\n      <p>I think her dissatisfaction with life and success were interesting to me. I started writing this book a bit after Black Lives Matter exploded, and it was a moment where a lot of Black art markets were booming. I was feeling a bit cynical about the instincts of the curators and collectors behind that, about why they were acquiring that art at the time that they were. So I came up with the character of Ruth as someone who’s not coming of age at exactly the same time as I was, but who exists in the 1990s art world where she grapples with many of the same issues that I did in the late ’10s. I thought of Ruth and how she might feel being on the sidelines watching Maria’s star rise and feeling bitter about it. Over time, I started to hear her voice more, and that just calcified the first-person narration and made her definitive for me.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>‣ In a <a href=\"https://wkamaubell.substack.com/p/yes-trump-is-fcking-with-the-museums?r=2jzu65&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;triedRedirect=true\">Substack essay</a> from April, writer W.

    "body": "<h2>Now in its third year, the Waterlily Weigh-Off invites public gardens and zoos to show off the strength of their aquatic plants</h2>\n<p>Giant waterlilies are known for their gorgeous white or pink flowers and green leaves, which float serenely atop the surface of lakes and streams.</p>\n<p>At first glance, these aquatic plants might seem delicate. But in reality, they’re incredibly strong. Earlier this month, the leaf of a giant waterlily at Florida’s <a href=\"https://boktowergardens.org/\">Bok Tower Gardens</a> supported <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNlnVPtSwkT/?igsh=amdzbGNlaGl2aXFj\">183 pounds</a> before it started sinking, beating out other global competitors to be crowned champion of the 2025 Waterlily Weigh-Off.</p>\n<p>The weigh-off, which is now in its third year, is an annual social media contest organized by Denver Botanic Gardens. To enter the competition, horticulturists at public gardens and zoos across the globe film themselves stacking weighted objects atop one of their giant waterlily pads (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNi66RKukQu/?igsh=MXR6ZnhyeXloYjdwdQ%3D%3D\">or smaller lilies</a>), noting the total weight the leaf was able to hold before dipping beneath the surface.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.botanicgardens.org/blog/waterlily-weigh-2025\">Denver Botanic Gardens</a>, the contest is a “playful opportunity” to educate the public about aquatic plants, specifically <a href=\"https://www.kew.org/plants/giant-waterlily\"> Victoria amazonica</a>, </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.botanic.cam.ac.uk/the-garden/plant-list/victoria-cruziana/\">and a mash-up of those two giant waterlily species called the</a>\n    </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/victoria-longwood-hybrid/\">Victoria ‘Longwood Hybrid.’</a>The leaves—also known as platters or pads—of these species can measure up to ten feet across.</p>\n<p>The pads can hold such an impressive amount of weight because of their structure. The bottom of each leaf consists of a “highly engineered network of radiating ribs and cross-veins,” per Denver Botanic Gardens. The ribs and veins form stiff compartments that trap pockets of air, which helps distribute weight across the leaf. The tops of the pads also have upturned edges, offering a barrier that can prevent water from spreading across the surface as the leaf gets weighed down.</p>\n<p>Scientists <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/what-a-huge-lily-pad-can-teach-us-about-building-design?loggedin=true&amp;rnd=1756495240861\">studying</a> the mechanics of the plants’ unique leaves suggest they could one day help improve the engineering, design and construction of manmade buildings, especially floating structures.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fpls.2022.883151/full\">2022</a>, scientists discovered the waterlily species <i> Victoria boliviana</i> after realizing it was distinct from the others. Then, the new species was certified as the </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2023/1/how-the-worlds-largest-waterlily-went-unnoticed-for-decades\">biggest waterlily in the world</a>.</p>\n<p>But giant waterlilies are not just strong—they’re also fierce. The bottoms of the leaves are covered in sharp, thorny spines, which help protect the plant from predators and encroachment from other plants.</p>\n<p>“Underneath is kind of cool, because they’re very dangerous,” says Kevin Bendetti, a horticulturist at Brookgreen Gardens in South Carolina, to the <a href=\"https://www.postandcourier.com/georgetown/news/brookgreen-gardens-waterlily-weigh-off/article_725dcbf4-1c15-47b0-b9e9-5b3ffc0bda77.html\"> Post and Courier</a>’s Lauren Leibman.</p>\n<p>This year, participants used everything from <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNkwmbpsCV6/\">bricks and gin bottles</a> to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNiPRjAsIvn/?igsh=MXZlOGp5NHM4emMzaw%3D%3D\">tea cakes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNisBkAtX0k/?igsh=dTN2a2c5aGs1MjE5\">toy frogs</a> to test the strength of their giant waterlily pads. The contest, which took place from August 18 to 24, included more than 40 participants in nine countries.</p>\n<p>This year’s runner-up was a giant waterlily at Missouri Botanical Garden, which held <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNiZhpRTqpW/?igsh=MTNxNWI2bGFhNXVheg%3D%3D\">182 pounds</a>, just one pound shy of the winner.</p>\n<p>Third place went to a specimen at the Huntsville Botanical Garden in Alabama, which held <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNi00X_RZnq/?igsh=MWJnZGJ4amc0OHAxaA%3D%3D\">176 pounds</a>. The team there kept piling on sandbags until they found the limit of their hybrid waterlily, which they’ve nicknamed “Tori.”</p>\n<p>“We just kept adding and I was like, ‘OK, we’re over 100 pounds, 120 pounds, OK, we’re still going.’ So it was amazing to see how much weight it could hold,” says Max McKeown, the garden’s horticulture manager, to <a href=\"https://whnt.com/news/huntsville/huntsville-botanical-gardens-giant-lily-pad-takes-3rd-in-national-competition/\">WHNT</a>’s Cristina Byrne and Emily Moessner.</p>\n<p>Denver Botanic Gardens’ own entry <a href=\"https://www.denver7.com/news/front-range/denver/denver-may-not-have-won-the-waterlily-weigh-off-but-international-enthusiasm-for-the-playful-challenge-soars\">came up short</a>, only holding 50 pounds before sinking. However, staffers there don’t mind the outcome one bit. They’re just thrilled to see how popular the contest has become, and they hope it will ultimately help attract more visitors to public gardens and zoos around the globe.</p>\n<p>“I’m really proud of what we have been able to build out of this silly little idea we started,” says Vanessa Callahan, assistant manager of learning engagement at Denver Botanic Gardens, to <a href=\"https://www.denver7.com/news/front-range/denver/denver-may-not-have-won-the-waterlily-weigh-off-but-international-enthusiasm-for-the-playful-challenge-soars#google_vignette\">KMGH-TV</a>’s Ethan Carlson. “[The participating gardens are] just showing so much creativity, so much storytelling, so much earnest about them, experiences and personality, and I’m having so much fun watching it.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/how-much-can-a-giant-waterlily-hold-see-one-carry-183-pounds-before-sinking-winning-a-social-media-contest-180987268/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Milam, one of the two men who kidnapped, tortured and killed the Black teenager for whistling at a white woman in a grocery store in 1955</h2>\n<p>After seven decades, the gun thought to have been used in the 1955 murder of <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/emmett-till#\">Emmett Till</a> is now on display in Mississippi.</p>\n<p>On August 28, the 70th anniversary of Till’s murder, the <a href=\"https://mcrm.mdah.ms.gov/\">Mississippi Civil Rights Museum</a> in Jackson unveiled an Ithaca .45 caliber pistol and its holster. Museum officials <a href=\"https://www.mdah.ms.gov/news/mdah-announces-acquisition-gun-used-1955-murder-emmett-till\">say</a> the weapon belonged to J.W. Milam, one of the men who killed the Black 14-year-old for whistling at a white woman in a grocery store.</p>\n<p>The gun, which is now part of a permanent exhibition about Till’s lynching, is “a very hard thing to see,” says Nan Prince, director of collections for the Mississippi Department of Archives and History, the state agency that operates the museum.</p>\n<p>“This weapon has affected me more so than any other artifact that I’ve encountered in my 30-year museum career,” Prince tells <a href=\"https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/28/displaying-gun-from-emmett-till-killing-is-part-of-unvarnished-truth-director-of-museums-says/\"> Mississippi Today</a>’s Simeon Gates.</p>\n<p>After Till was reburied in another coffin in 2005, his family <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/emmett-tills-casket-goes-to-the-smithsonian-144696940/\">donated</a> his original casket to the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture.</p>\n<p>How did the gun end up at the museum? And where has it been for the past 70 years? Many of these details have not been made public. However, according to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/28/us/emmett-till-gun-museum-mississippi.html\"> New York Times</a>’ Emily Cochrane and Audra D. S. Burch, the story starts around 2004, when filmmaker Keith Beauchamp first learned of the gun’s whereabouts. Beauchamp, who was working on a documentary about Till, shared what he knew about the gun with the FBI.</p>\n<p>The FBI <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/10/national/us-to-reopen-investigation-of-emmett-tills-murder-in-1955.html\">reopened</a> the case. Investigators performed various tests on the gun to determine whether it was linked to Till’s murder. However, their findings were inconclusive, per the <i>Times</i>.</p>\n<p>Later, journalist Wright Thompson heard about the gun from an FBI source while writing a book about the case, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Barn-Secret-History-Murder-Mississippi/dp/0593299825\"> The Barn: The Secret History of a Murder in Mississippi</a>, which was published last year. The weapon belonged to “a crop-duster pilot and his sister, who’d inherited it from their father,” Thompson writes in the </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/08/emmett-till-gun-mississippi-history-memory/684010/\">. “I don’t know how their father got it.”</a>\n    </p>\n<p>The family that owned the gun did not have a direct link to the Till case, according to the <i>Times</i>. The pilot and his sister had been storing the weapon in a safe-deposit box in a bank in Greenwood, Mississippi.</p>\n<p>Tommy Goodwin, deputy director at the Mississippi Department of Archives and History, read about the gun in Thompson’s book. Goodwin thought the weapon belonged in a museum, so his team got in touch with the family. The museum’s foundation purchased the gun and donated it to the state archives, reports <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/28/nx-s1-5519776/emmett-till-murder-mississippi-museum-gun\">NPR</a>’s Debbie Elliott. The terms of the arrangement have not been disclosed.</p>\n<p>“Goodwin met the pilot for the handoff,” Thompson writes in the <i>Atlantic</i>. “The gun came wrapped in a rag inside a plastic Kroger shopping bag.”</p>\n<p>Museum staffers spoke with Emmett’s surviving family members before putting the gun on display, per the <i>Times</i>.</p>\n<p>The weapon is made of “faded blueish nickel,” Thompson writes, and it bears the words “United States Property.” The holster is made of leather and has been etched with the initials “J.M.” and the word “Tippo,” likely a reference to the Mississippi town where Milam was living when he went off to fight in World War II for the U.S. Army.</p>\n<p>“The sights on the back of the slide had been violently mashed down and twisted, as if someone had used the gun as a hammer,” Thompson writes in the <i>Atlantic</i>.</p>\n<p>The FBI <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/federal-officials-close-cold-case-re-investigation-murder-emmett-till\">describes</a> Till’s murder as “one of the most infamous acts of racial violence in our country’s history.” In the summer of 1955, Till and his 16-year-old cousin, Wheeler Parker Jr., traveled from Chicago to Money, Mississippi, to visit relatives. One day, they ended up at Bryant’s Grocery and Meat Market, which was owned by Roy and Carolyn Bryant.</p>\n<p>Parker, who is now 86, tells NPR that Till was a jokester who was trying to elicit laughs when he whistled at Carolyn Bryant.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/the-gun-linked-to-emmett-tills-murder-is-now-on-display-at-a-museum-in-mississippi-180987266/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Instead of flicking the outdoor lights on, the space is already lit by a soft glow emanating from common houseplants lining the path.</p>\n    <p>In a study published Wednesday in the journal <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(25)00413-8\"> Matter</a>, researchers have taken a step toward making that scene a reality: Scientists created glow-in-the-dark succulents that recharge with exposure to light, in the hopes that they might pave the way for new sustainable lighting systems.</p>\n    <p>The team injected plants with strontium aluminate, the same material in the glow-in-the-dark stars children sometimes stick to their bedroom ceilings. Strontium aluminate displays <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/phosphorescence\">phosphorescence</a>—meaning it absorbs energy from light, then releases it slowly—as opposed to <a href=\"https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/biolum.html\">bioluminescence</a>, which is when an organism emits its own light via chemical reactions, as reported by the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/27/science/glowing-succulents.html\"> New York Times</a>’ Cara Giaimo.</p>\n    <h4>Fun fact: Glowing plants</h4>\n    <p>Researchers in the 1980s <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.234.4778.856\">introduced</a> a gene from a firefly into a tobacco plant, making it perceptibly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/07/us/tobacco-plant-with-firefly-gene-implant-grows.html\">glow in total darkness</a>.</p>\n    <p>At first, the process was “continuous trial and error,” <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Shuting-Liu-2108260102\">Shuting Liu</a>, first author of the paper and a researcher at the South China Agricultural University, tells the <i>New York Times</i>. While other scientists had previously used strontium aluminate in plants, Liu and her colleagues sought a brighter and longer glow by injecting larger particles.</p>\n    <p>The winning size for these particles was around seven micrometers (less than 0.0003 inches), or roughly equivalent to the width of a single red blood cell. Smaller particles made a dimmer glow, whereas larger particles couldn’t travel through plants very far.</p>\n    <p>Several injections later, the researchers determined that succulents called <i>Echeveria</i> “Mebina” emitted a strong light, thanks to their leaves’ thin, uniform and evenly distributed channels, which enabled the particles to spread more successfully, according to a <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1095392\">statement</a>.</p>\n    <p>The succulents produced an initial glow to rival that of a typical candle or small night light, then continued to glow more dimly for up to two hours—in different colors, depending on the injection. It only took a few minutes of exposure to the sun or LED light to charge the plant. Each plant costs around $1.40 to make, excluding labor, but they are prepared in just around ten minutes.</p>\n    <p>“It was really unexpected,” Liu says in the statement. “The particles diffused in just seconds, and the entire succulent leaf glowed.”</p>\n    <p>Scientists have already achieved luminous plants via genetic engineering, but this process is expensive and complicated—and it typically results in a weak glow that’s limited to the color green, according to the statement.</p>\n    <p>Still, the newly injected succulents have their own limitations. The plants’ glow diminishes over time. And <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-wood-38126824/\">Keith Wood</a>—chief executive of Light Bio, a company that sells genetically modified bioluminescent plants, who was not involved in the study—tells <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02740-2\"> Nature</a>’s Katherine Bourzac that the injected particles’ impact on the plants’ long-term health is still unclear. The researchers, too, note that more testing related to safety will be required.</p>\n    <p>“There is also a potential pollution issue when the plants die and are disposed of,” environment reporter Michael Le Page writes in an opinion piece for <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2494055-glow-in-the-dark-plants-to-replace-streetlights-forget-it/\"> New Scientist</a>. And there is no “discussion in the team’s paper of the environmental and safety aspects of plants with high levels of phosphors in their leaves,” he adds.</p>\n    <p>Liu tells the <i>New York Times</i> that “at this stage, our priority was to establish the proof of concept,” and that more research will be needed to diminish their approach’s environmental impact. The team’s ambitious vision would ultimately see these plants provide sustainable alternatives to low-intensity lighting.</p>\n    <p>“Imagine glowing trees replacing streetlights,” Liu says in the statement.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/researchers-create-rechargeable-glow-in-the-dark-succulents-180987265/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Portraiture has always been a slightly misleading art form. A good portrait gives the viewer the sense that they can peer into the essence of the sitter. It’s a glimpse, a passing moment in a person’s life. But to know someone more fully, we have to see them in their totality, from birth to death, through all the major seasons of their life and in relationship with their most important people.</p>\n<p>I first came across the expansive portraiture of artist John Clang in 2010 when <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/john-clang-being-together\">he began the  Being Together series</a>, which depicts diasporic families photographed together via Skype. A Singaporean artist living far from family after moving to New York, Clang stages the photos so that one half of the family is projected onto the wall, as if in the physical presence of the other half.</p>\n<p>For those of us living in diaspora with loved ones in other countries, togetherness also means being together across time. Some live in an ostensible future and others in an ostensible past, both close together and distant. As Clang wrote in a piece for <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/john-clang-being-together\"> LensCulture</a>, diasporic families can be “made whole again through the use of a third space, a site that is able to reassemble them together within the photographic space that we call a family portrait.”</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://johnclang.com/reading-by-an-artist\"> Reading by an Artist</a>, an ongoing performance series that began in 2023, Clang pulls from a decade-long study of </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.feng-shui-institute.org/Chinese_Astrology/ZWDS-astrology.html\">(紫微斗数)</a>\n    </p>\n<p><i>,</i>sometimes called purple star astrology in English. It’s a philosophical and astrological system dating back to Tang dynasty China and originally designed to make sense of royals’ destiny through a chart structure of 12 palaces. These palaces are laid out as a square border comprising smaller individual squares that represent elements like the self, finances, siblings, and travel.</p>\n<p><i>Reading by an Artist</i> was staged this year at the National Gallery Singapore, the Sharjah Biennial, and most recently, the <i> Summer Reads</i> group show at New York’s Galerie Lelong, where I visited him for a reading earlier this month. Although he occasionally conducts readings by request through his </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://johnclang.com/\">website</a>, his series is experienced through scheduled performances, including one in the upcoming</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.e-flux.com/announcements/6783961/ghost-2568-wish-we-were-here\">in Bangkok, Thailand, starting October 15.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>In popular apps like CHANI and Co–Star, users plug in their birth date and location and receive a natal chart that references one’s Sun, Moon, and Rising sign, along with other details. These charts come from <a href=\"https://time.com/5315377/are-zodiac-signs-real-astrology-history/\">Western astrology</a>, whose roots can be traced back to the Babylonian system, and every day, users can get a glimpse of what astrological forces may be shaping their lives.</p>\n<p>It’s a similar process for ziwei doushu: Clang requested basic details around my birth date in advance of our session so he could develop a chart. Getting a reading done by the artist transformed the experience, as he mediated the process through conversation. When I sat down with him at Galerie Lelong, he had a paper notebook and a tablet propped up on a stand. He pulled up my chart with a printout and on the screen in front of me, a series of squares with each palace laid out. The tablet app he used allowed him to move forward and backward by decades in my life, capturing different versions of me through time and space.</p>\n<p>Clang then homed in on a few squares: my Life palace to point out my challenges with burnout, my Career palace to note what he calls my “scholar energy,” and my Travel palace to observe my frequent sojourns. With each series of observations, he did a gut check with me to make sure his reading was landing effectively. It did.</p>\n<p>At this point, a skeptic could argue that these broad observations stem from topics I’ve written about publicly before (a quick look at <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/author/an/\">my  Hyperallergic bio and datelines</a>, for example, would confirm my frequent travel) and could just as easily have been Googled. The skeptic would be right, to a certain extent, but the reading was just getting started. And in any case, that critique would miss the point of Clang’s work.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035796/john-clang-reading-by-an-artist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>MIAMI — On a July afternoon, in an abandoned boutique sandwiched unassumingly between a dentist’s office, a Latin grocery store, and a barbershop, Little Havana residents and artists gathered for their afternoon <i>cafecito </i>ritual. But instead of coffee, the plastic fluted espresso cups held swamp mud from the Everglades and checkpoint soil from the entrance to Alligator Alcatraz, the notorious immigrant detention center at the center of a <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032766/alligator-alcatraz-construction-halted-but-native-heritage-remains-at-risk/\">lawsuit</a> alleging violations of the National Environmental Policy Act and <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032766/alligator-alcatraz-construction-halted-but-native-heritage-remains-at-risk/\">Miccosukee land protections</a>. On Thursday, August 21, a judge ordered the <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article311770767.html\">halting of operations</a> at the prison, but the state quickly filed a motion to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/22/alligator-alcatraz-closure-appeal-immigration\">appeal</a> the decision.</p>\n<p>The performance by Miami artist Agua Dulce, titled “Untitled (todo lo que toques se transforma)” (2025), took place at the opening of <i>The Artist As Activist</i>, curated by Isabella Marie Garcia with works by members of Artists 4 Artists (A4A). In recent history, the advocacy group has mobilized in response to local challenges like the <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/913047/art-alluding-to-pro-palestine-slogan-nixed-from-miami-beach-display/\">censorship</a> of political art for Palestine, inequitable pay, and <a href=\"https://www.americantheatre.org/2025/08/01/miami-dade-budget-proposes-major-cuts-to-arts-funding/\">funding cuts</a>. But since Alligator Alcatraz’s construction, A4A has shifted into high gear, convening artists to employ a range of defensive strategies against detention — accompanying migrants to their court hearings, participating in direct action, collecting stories of those detained, leading workshops to help affected families, and creating graphics to build awareness about the history and contemporary politics of the camp.</p>\n<p>Misael Soto, a lead organizer of A4A, told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that they want the organization to “commit itself to taking a stance,” encouraging artists to draw on their special expertise to “affect real change in this city.” </p>\n<p>“I was thinking of artists who are doing creative work, but also doing work for others,” said Garcia. “Artists who work in organizing spaces don’t often get the chance to show their work publicly.”</p>\n<p><i>The</i> <i>Artist As Activist</i>, on view through September 7, includes works by members Motyko, Fola Akinde, and Agua. The show occupies a storefront in a strip mall in Little Havana, a historically Cuban neighborhood that holds layered histories of migration and is home to residents of varied and often precarious legal status. </p>\n<p>“This show speaks to people who inhabit the space naturally,” said Agua. “It’s been interesting to disrupt the mundanity of people going about their days. That’s what makes this space powerful — you’re not expecting to engage with it.”</p>\n<p>Behind the glass, the installation unfolds as a triptych: Motyko’s mixed-media collages at the foreground, Akinde’s cartographic screenprints on the side, and Agua’s altarpiece on the ground. In the background reads the exhibition’s resonant message: “The Gestapo is here, has been here and its name is ICE. No to Alligator Alcatraz!” Translations in Spanish and Kreyòl ripple down.</p>\n<p>“We’re in a more removed part of the city from where a lot of the Alligator Alcatraz situation is in effect,” Garcia explained. She hopes that the installation serves as a public reminder that, despite diminishing news coverage and hopeful developments in the courts, people are still being kidnapped and unlawfully detained.</p>\n<p>Familiar motifs of immigrant life flank the explicit imagery about the detention center. Motyko’s collages include cutouts from magazines, personal photos, newspapers, websites, and archives, combining roosters with cans of condensed milk, whispers of lace with elders’ ringed hands. Two collages draw on the grief and instability that loom over mixed-status and undocumented families.</p>\n<p>Motyko’s father came from Cuba on the Mariel boatlift, her mother from Honduras on Temporary Protected Status. The collage “Untitled”<i> </i>(2023) splices a line of migrants diagonally across a Social Security card, white space in between marking an absence of family milestones: a mother’s funeral, a wedding, a birthday. </p>\n<p>Another overlays agricultural workers protesting the governor’s veto of the Heat Protections Bill onto a plastic Publix shopping bag. The proposed measure would have mandated rest, water, and shade for outdoor laborers, but ultimately failed, even after 29-year-old Mexican farmworker Efraín López García <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/climate-change/article277399723.html\">died</a> of heatstroke on the job in Miami. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036413/with-cafecito-cups-and-direct-action-miami-artists-rise-against-alligator-alcatraz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p><i> Kenny Nguyen: The Divine Eye</i> is an evocative, large-scale installation that invites viewers to engage with the rich spiritual and cultural history of Vietnam through the lens of Caodaism. Rooted in the synthesis of Eastern and Western philosophies, Caodaism — a syncretic religion founded in Vietnam in the 1920s — serves as both inspiration and metaphor in this work, which is on view at the </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/4fNyL7p\">Halsey Institute of Contemporary Art</a>at the College of Charleston in South Carolina through December 6.</p>\n    <p>In his practice, Nguyen transforms torn strips of silk by dipping them into acrylic paint, layering them onto canvas, and hanging them dynamically on the wall to construct new topographies. Now for the first time, his technique has been adapted to form columns that reflect Caodaism’s distinctive temple architecture, marrying traditional Eastern elements with Western influences to create a visual dialogue between the past and the present, the local and the global.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Kenny-Nguyen-The-Divine-Eye-2-1-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Caodaism emerged in response to the tumultuous history of Vietnam in the early 20th century, during a time of colonial occupation and national struggle. In the face of foreign domination and the erosion of indigenous cultural practices, this new religion synthesized elements from Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, Christianity, and other world religions to form a unifying spiritual force. Although Nguyen is not a practicing member of the faith himself, his grandmother was a member of the temple that inspired his work. This connection left a lasting imprint on his understanding of Caodaism and its significance to the Vietnamese people. For the artist, the creation of “The Divine Eye” (2025) is deeply personal.</p>\n    <p>Nguyen’s use of silk is deliberate and symbolic. By pushing the limits of the material, he aims to emphasize concepts of transformation and perseverance, mirroring the journey of the Vietnamese people — both within their homeland and in the diaspora. In many ways, the work is intended to reflect the strength and grace of his grandmother and others in their community who have preserved their culture and spirituality amidst adversity.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Kenny-Nguyen-The-Divine-Eye-3-1-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Through the hybrid form of architecture, intricate folds of silk, and the profound symbolism of the Divine Eye — an all-seeing force that guides and protects — Nguyen hopes to create a space of reflection and connection, speaking not only to the spiritual beliefs of Caodaism but also to the resilience and ongoing transformation of Vietnamese culture. Through Nguyen’s art, viewers are invited to look inward and outward, to witness the past’s impact on the present, and to consider the transformative power of heritage in shaping the future.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>To learn more, visit  halsey.charleston.edu.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Kenny-Nguyen-The-Divine-Eye-4-1-1200x972.jpeg?resize=1200%2C972&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Kenny-Nguyen-The-Divine-Eye-5-2-1200x954.jpg?resize=1200%2C954&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035821/kenny-nguyen-the-divine-eye/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Sherald <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1029808/amy-sherald-cancels-smithsonian-show-citing-censorship-of-trans-artwork/\">withdrew the show</a> entirely last month, citing concerns that the museum was planning to censor the work. </p>\n<p>Other targeted artworks in the list reference immigration in the United States, such as Rigoberto A. González’s 2020 <a href=\"https://portraitcompetition.si.edu/exhibition/2022-outwin-boochever-portrait-competition/refugees-crossing-the-border-wall-into-south-texas/\">painting</a> “Refugees Crossing the Border Wall into South Texas,” which features a man and a woman climbing a ladder holding a baby and accompanied by a child. González was a finalist in the National Portrait Gallery’s (NPG) triennial Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition.</p>\n<p>In an interview with <i>Hyperallergic</i>, González compared the inclusion of his painting on Trump’s list to the Nazi campaign against “degenerate art.” </p>\n<p>“Political parties and politicians know that art is very powerful, so they always try to use it as propaganda,” González said. He emphasized that at the bottom of the painting, he included a crumpled newspaper with the headline “Trump Impeached.” The figures in the work, he added, are references to the Holy Family.</p>\n<p>“It depicts immigration, but also the dangers that the immigrants face once they get here, and that’s what those objects at the bottom of the painting kind of represent: anti-immigrant sentiment,” González continued. The artist said he thoroughly researches his paintings and speaks to immigrants in Texas to understand their experiences.</p>\n<p>The museum kept the painting for two years as part of the 2022 Outwin competition for a group tour at museums across the country, but it is not currently displayed at the NPG, according to González<i>.</i></p>\n<p>The White House memo also accuses the Smithsonian Institution of excluding the “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/27/arts/design/national-portrait-gallery-performances.html\">wealthy, pale, and male</a>,” linking a <i>New York Times</i> report with the phrase in its headline. The Smithsonian, however, has not used the phrase.</p>\n<p>Many of the artworks and shows on the White House’s list were featured in an August 15 article published in the conservative publication the <i>Federalist.</i></p>\n<p>In the last few months, Trump has waged a relentless campaign to instill so-called “American exceptionalism” across the Smithsonian’s research centers and 21 museums, threatening to erase critical race theory, LGBTQ+ histories, and other narratives that he deems “unpatriotic.”</p>\n<p>The president has accused the Smithsonian and museums in the United States in general of being a last-standing pillar of the so-called liberal “woke,” a term with roots in Black culture and social justice movements that conservatives have co-opted as a derogatory term for progressive values.</p>\n<p>The White House’s list today leads with a 2020 infographic that the National Museum of African American History and Culture added to its website immediately after the killing of George Floyd. Titled “aspects and assumptions about white culture,” the graphic included descriptions about “white dominant” family structures, religion, and attitudes. The museum <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/african-american-museum-site-removes-whiteness-chart-after-criticism-from-trump-jr-and-conservative-media/2020/07/17/4ef6e6f2-c831-11ea-8ffe-372be8d82298_story.html\">apologized</a> for the infographic and removed it from its site after backlash from conservatives, including Ben Shapiro and Donald Trump Jr.</p>\n<p>Trump’s hit list also includes National Museum of American History (NMAH) <a href=\"https://americanhistory.si.edu/explore/topics/lgbtq-history#:~:text=The%20museum%20is,many%20other%20experiences.\">content</a> discussing LGBTQ+ history; a National Museum of African Art <a href=\"https://www.si.edu/newsdesk/releases/deep-wake-drexciya-ayana-v-jackson-opens-april-29-national-museum-african-art\">show</a> exploring the Afrofuturist legend of Drexciya; and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlp0S0UAA2o&amp;t=20s\">animated graphics</a> of Latinos with disabilities created by the National Museum of the American Latino.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036180/trump-targets-lgbtq-history-migrants-and-more-in-chilling-smithsonian-hit-list/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But hers are especially unique. The Tlingit artist, born and based in Juneau, Alaska, is trained in both Ravenstail and <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/985534/reviving-tsimshian-weaving-with-threads-of-community/\">Chilkat</a> weaving practices. She learned the art forms from her ancestors and elders, including her late mother, Clarissa Rizal — one of the last living apprentices of Master Chilkat <a href=\"https://www.arts.gov/honors/heritage/jennie-thlunaut\">Weaver Jennie Thlunaut</a> — and weaver Kay Field Parker. Hope’s Labubus are dressed in traditional Ravenstail regalia, woven robes, and headdresses made of Merino wool.</p>\n    <p>“They’re actually repurposed dance cuffs,” Hope told <i>Hyperallergic</i>, describing the process as “Indigenizing the Labubus.”</p>\n    <p>Hope planned to sell the regalia at the <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035211/dispatches-from-the-ever-evolving-santa-fe-indian-market-2025/\">Santa Fe Indian Market</a> during her recent trip to New Mexico, but after posting a Ravenstail Labubu on her Instagram on August 5, the clothes almost completely sold out within days. At the market, she gifted one to a tourist from Trinidad, who planned to give it to his father. “So the regalia has made its way down to the Caribbean,” she said. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/4R1B0280-1200x1419.jpg?resize=1200%2C1419&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Kathryn Bunn-Marcuse, curator of Northwest Native Art at Seattle’s Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture, also acquired two outfits via Facebook messenger, initially purchasing a Tlingit outfit beaded by Hope’s <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/yourauntiedee/\">Aunt Deanna</a>. Bunn-Marcuse was excited to add multiple artists to the collection; the second acquisition will be woven by Hope, contributing more mini Ravenstail attire “to represent the regalia that we love and share on the northwest coast of Alaska and Canada,” in the artist’s words.</p>\n    <p>Emphasis on <i>we</i>: For Hope, one of the most important components of her practice is sharing. She began teaching public weaving workshops in the early aughts with her mother. “I loved the community that was being built and expanded,” she said, “and the feeling of creating work that’s bigger than any one of us. Sitting in a quiet space alone — that’s a disservice to my weaving community, to my Native community. If I do that, the work is not serving its highest good.” Hope added online classes to her repertoire at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and now has Labubu regalia materials available for purchase on her website, in preparation for a public virtual course.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/jami-powell-osage-holding-doll-by-lily-hope-tlingit-credit-kaela-waldstein-1200x1799.jpg?resize=1200%2C1799&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Even if participants have no weaving experience, the kit “is a very beginner-accessible project,” Hope added. It includes a pre-drilled header bar, the initial band that spreads out a loom’s warp threads. “People who’ve never done this before can get to work right away. You can just snap the header bar on a basket or toilet paper roll.”</p>\n    <p>And the workshop is truly for everyone, Hope emphasized. “Ravenstail geometric weaving has been in the hands of many nations for 40 years,” the artist said, “so I don’t pause to share the knowledge with people of any nationality.”</p>\n    <p>To those who are curious: The kit doesn’t include Labubus themselves; any dolls that don’t become models are given to her children, who adore them. “My children help me unbox them,” Hope said. “For every six or 12 that I buy, they each get to keep one.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036741/the-indigenous-artist-making-dazzling-labubu-regalia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

New evidence now suggests that the damage was far less than initially feared and may not have warranted the harsh two-year sentence for Phoebe Plummer and the 20-month sentence for Anna Holland.</p>\n    <p>The two Just Stop Oil activists hurled soup at van Gogh’s 1888 painting “Sunflowers” in London’s National Gallery and then glued themselves to the wall, an act that made global headlines. The painting was protected by thick security glass, but social media reacted strongly to the protest that aimed to draw attention to the climate crisis.</p>\n    <p>A Freedom of Information request from <a href=\"https://novaramedia.com/2025/08/22/the-national-gallery-only-spent-150-retouching-van-gogh-frame-after-just-stop-oil-souping/\"> Novara Media</a> revealed that the museum’s head of framing, Peter Schade, estimated the cost of retouching the frame at £150 (~$203). According to the media outlet, the museum also spent around £250 (~$338) restoring the wall, plus £35 (~$47) for paint, totaling about £435 (~$588) for all damages. In September 2024, when reporting on the sentencing, the </p>\n    <p><i>BBC</i>said that the pair caused</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly7zy3d3exo\">£10,000 worth of damage to the gold-colored frame</a>of the glass-covered painting in what they characterized as an “attack,” but provided no evidence or</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>source for their estimate. The British public broadcaster added that the museum had purchased the frame in 1999 and that it was valued at £28,000.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Judge Christopher Hehir, who presided over the case, ruled that the value of the damage was irrelevant for the jury, thus preventing its members from hearing these figures. The activists were found guilty and received a combined three-and-a-half-year sentence. <i>Novara Media</i> inquired about a full restoration of the frame, but the museum reportedly declined to comment.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMAGE_JustStopOil_NationalGallery5_14102022-1200x874.png?resize=1200%2C874&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The judge, known for his harsh stance on climate activism, stated in his sentencing remarks, “It is not the value of the damage caused to the frame that is the most serious aspect of your offending … You came within the thickness of a pane of glass of irreparably damaging or even destroying this priceless treasure, and that must be reflected in the sentences I pass.”</p>\n    <p>Human rights lawyer <a href=\"https://juststopoil.org/2024/10/16/five-legal-missteps-in-judge-hehirs-sentencing-of-plummer-and-holland/\">Aabhinav Tyagi has written about five alleged legal missteps</a> in the sentencing of these eco-activists, and questions remain as to whether justice has actually been served. Pussy Riot member Nadya Tolokonnikova chimed in on the pages of the<i> </i><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/03/vincent-van-gogh-just-stop-oil-sentencing-nature-painter-protesters-soup-sunflowers\"> Guardian</a> shortly after the verdict, writing in the activist pair’s defense: “Nature was Van Gogh’s ultimate muse. He loved it, as do Phoebe and Anna. I believe he would have approved of Phoebe and Anna’s action — it belonging to the tradition of activists and artists defying norms to create a new, better world. In the case of Just Stop Oil, to save our one and only planet from destruction and protect the natural world that Van Gogh so loved.”</p>\n    <p>This case highlights the debate over what counts as peaceful protest versus violent crime. According to Tyagi, “Judge Hehir classified the activists’ actions as violent, equating throwing soup at a protected painting with physically assaulting a person. This characterization enabled the judge to disregard the protections for peaceful protest under the European Convention on Human Rights, bypassing Articles 10 and 11, which protect freedom of expression and assembly.”</p>\n    <p>As museum protests continue to draw attention, debates over protest rights and proportional sentences are likely to persist. One may argue that the cases of eco-protests at museums were the canary in the coal mine for the larger Gaza protests that have since followed, since many of the same issues outlined by Tyagi — including punishment based more on perceived risk than on actual harm and the proportionality of sentences — are more relevant than ever.</p>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i> reached out to the National Gallery for comment and has not yet heard back.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036809/why-did-eco-activists-get-years-in-prison-for-only-588-in-damages/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

    "excerpt": "Perfection (2022), translated by Sophie Hughes and published by New York Review Books (image courtesy New York Review Books)",
    "bodyHtml": "<p><i>Perfection</i>(2022), translated by Sophie Hughes and published by New York Review Books (image courtesy New York Review Books)</p>\n<p>I started reading Italian novelist Vincenzo Latronico’s <i>Perfection</i> (2022)<i> </i>splayed out languidly<i> </i>on the beach. Then I was sitting up, nerves ablaze, and then on the train, the world outside whizzing past unnoticed, and then in bed that night, my Kindle having temporarily usurped my iPhone, and then it was over. I felt abuzz, delirious, called out. Reading <i>Perfection </i>is as uncanny and disturbing as looking at your doppelganger. I’m not a Southern European emigré to Berlin, like the main characters, Anna and Tom. But I am a part of the art world of New York, and their East Berlin reads a lot to me like my Brooklyn and Lower East Side. Because, as Latronico himself points out, their neighborhood could “just as well have been New York — or anywhere in the world, for that matter.”</p>\n<p>Translated by Sophie Hughes and published in English earlier this year, <i>Perfection </i>is fundamentally about making meaning in a world where the real and digital, the local and global, have fused into one hybrid, monstrous, relentless thing. Latronico lampoons a specifically white-collar, self-styled cultural person with an art critic’s attention to detail, and perhaps the pettiness as well. Anna and Tom are graphic designers, and though they think of social media and the internet as a “constellation of distractions,” there is, in reality, no distinction between “the personal and the professional — between news stories and banter, project pitches and catchy pop hooks.” As the author puts it: “They would drift from one thing to the other, because one thing was the other.” But though Latronico delights in ridiculing his characters, he also recognizes them as hapless avatars of a globalized culture flattened by the internet. They live as though trapped in a screen, seemingly unable to really touch or taste the world as their lives unfold like the images they consume.</p>\n<p>The Berlin art scene, as experienced by Anna and Tom, is as surface-level as those images. It’s just another part of their protracted going-out routine that begins on Saturday morning and runs into the following afternoon. “Table tennis in Arkonaplatz” or “bocce on Paul-Lincke-Ufer” blends easily with an “independent art space above a car wash in Friedrichshain,” a “basement gallery on Graefestraße.” Descriptions of these events will be familiar to anyone who frequents a gallery circuit anywhere in the world: little clusters of people huddled under the “neon glow” of a streetlamp, the “empties piled up around plastic beer crates on the pavement.” They have learned to “talk the talk,” Latronico writes, but they didn’t actually “get it.” They go to openings because art is the “pulse of their life in Berlin”; galleries, he writes, are both “a stage and a social hub.”</p>\n<p>It’s not just the art world that’s been razed to the level of abstraction in <i>Perfection</i>. It’s literally everything. It’s sex: “One of them would read a piece by a New York journalist about how she’d taught her boyfriend to use a double strap-on and then send the affiliate link to the other over Slack.” It’s history: Living in East Berlin, Anna and Tom can vaguely connect “place names and crucial events from the previous century … but really their awareness didn’t exceed a few anecdotes rattled off to make it look like their life there had more substance.” It’s political engagement: the <a href=\"https://www.unhcr.org/us/news/stories/2015-year-europes-refugee-crisis\">refugee crisis</a>, with its “image[s] of migrants crammed into dinghies beside grey military patrol boats,” becomes just another part of the “information landscape,” along with the “dusty yellow photos of wars in the Middle East, or the red and cobalt blue of the smoke grenades at G8 protests.” Real life collapses into RGB pixels. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036701/vincenzo-latronico-perfection-novel-is-the-art-world-black-mirror/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

    "bodyHtml": "<p>The Surrealists understood that so much depends on context: What is ordinary lining a glove, for instance, becomes <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/works/80997\">grotesque in a teacup</a>. Angolan artist Sandra Poulson — who studied fashion in Lisbon and London, and lives between the latter, Angola’s capital, Luanda, and Amsterdam — operates under a similar ethos of off-kilter recontextualization. In her first museum exhibition, at MoMA PS1, she presents wooden assemblages embedded in or punctured by the floating signifiers connected with Angola after its Civil War (1975–2002), which began immediately after the nation gained independence from Portugal. A bed frame lurches drunkenly toward the viewer; a mirror sits sullenly in the corner, a headboard bolts upright like a soldier. Across these mostly household objects, Poulson emphasizes that history is something that haunts you as you sleep, as you dress, as you look at yourself in the mirror. </p>\n<p>Several complex circuits converge in Poulson’s work: the global trade routes that brought this specific wood into the artist’s path; symbols connected to important events in Angolan history as they intersect with world events; and, finally, Poulson’s own stylistic iconography. The material itself is freighted: Vintage Dutch objects made from wood that might be sourced from Angola sit along chipboard furniture made in China in an American style. It is the physical manifestation of a global trade network made local, the items carrying evidence of their circulation — peeling inventory stickers or faded stamps — and their use, such as the ring imprint of a cup.</p>\n<p>Poulson’s method, then, is not so much about lodging one signifier (logos, presidents’ silhouettes, and symbols of local organizations) into another (wood) so much as colliding them together. Her interventions certainly draw attention to the unseen forces that have shaped these objects — the symbol for the European Union, a dominant trade partner, appears multiple times. But by setting them in wood, rather than more ephemeral media such as digital imagery or even apparel, she draws attention to their significance and heft: These symbols and what they represent do not simply layer over your skin; they puncture the way you live.</p>\n<p>Some of the furniture-as-artworks on view, such as the found mirror “Untitled (Mirror)” or the wooden speaker “Leitura dos Acordos de Alvor, January 1975” (Reading of the Alvor Accords), which plays aloud the Angolan independence agreement, feel both underdone and too on-the-nose. While I liked that the former made a trick mirror of the exhibition space, intensifying its surreality by reflecting and recombining the other absurdist objects on its surface in jarring and unexpected ways, positioning a found object in the corner as the sole intervention felt a bit cheap compared to other works, and fell proportionately flat to me. Meanwhile, the latter emits audio so softly that I think even Portuguese speakers would miss its significance; even when noticed, the work’s intended effect of drawing attention to the way history permeates lived experience is already achieved more compellingly by other pieces in the show.</p>\n<p>plywood, and steel</p>\n<p>The more successful<strong> </strong>objects on view are simultaneously unfinished and highly finished, heightening their absurdity. In “Cabinda Dreams” (all works 2024), a bedframe with the EU logo punched into the cheap wooden headboard has been sawed at a clean diagonal on one end so that it angles haphazardly, as though pleading for help or reaching to grab you. Other objects short-circuited my sense of material logic: The wooden headboard of “Candidato a Presidente da República de Angola” (Candidate for President of the Republic of Angola) sits upright on a sheet of rusted steel, uncannily unsupported. I couldn’t determine either the quality or weight of the wood. Elsewhere — particularly in “Confessionário” (Confessional) — there are apertures where there shouldn’t be, glass where you wouldn’t expect it. And walk around to the back of “Igreja Universal do Reino de Deus” (Universal Church of the Kingdom of God) and you’ll see that it’s been blown out, the cheap corkboard drawers sagging from the lack of support, speaking to the disasters that hide beneath the veneer of stability. Meanwhile, “Propaganda Flush” declares and then immediately curtails its function: The toilet is suspended in the air, torn from the sewage pipes that make it what it is. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035186/sandra-poulson-haunted-house/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

    "bodyHtml": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>LONDON — There is something both frightening and fascinating about a sculpture that could kill you. Hamad Butt’s <i>Familiars</i> (1992) is a series of three sculptures that, if broken, could toxify the air and cause significant harm. “Familiars 3: Cradle” resembles a huge Newton’s cradle, common as a desk toy, wherein a ball is dropped against a stationary line of similar balls, causing the one at the other end to swing away before it falls back to repeat the process. In this case, however, the spheres are made of vacuum-sealed glass containing greenish-yellow chlorine gas — playing with this toy would spell disaster. </p>\n    <p>This series exemplifies Butt’s career-long exploration of risk and contagion. Made at the height of the AIDS epidemic, and shortly after the artist’s own diagnosis, which would lead to his premature death two years later, <i>Familiars</i> throws oblique light on the threat of disease and the complex, often contradictory emotions thrown up by the risk of contagion. Another piece in the series, “Familiars 1: Substance Sublimation Unit,” consists of a ladder whose rungs are glass tubes containing a heating element and iodine crystals. The heaters periodically turn on and off, sublimating the iodine into an eerie purple gas, again both fear-inducing and alluring.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/07/qFTKw-1200x1865.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1865&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/07/fP2PO-1200x2086.jpeg?resize=1200%2C2086&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>These are confident, conceptually complex, and allusive works, coolly holding their own in the large space of the opening gallery. Their minimalist and scientific aesthetic also offers an intriguing foil to some of the artist’s earlier paintings and drawings, displayed upstairs. A wall text notes that Butt saw his sculptures and paintings as closely connected, particularly in terms of color, but while his sculptures are more formal, his works on paper and canvas are significantly more figurative. “No Title: Figures with Muzzles” (c. 1984) shows nude men being chased into a body of water by dogs in barbed-wire muzzles. The scene, apparently lit by a bare lightbulb, feels both bleak and emotional, perhaps drawing from Butt’s experience of being a queer Pakistani in Britain in the 1980s.</p>\n    <p>Symbols of fear and contagion emerge repeatedly throughout Butt’s oeuvre. One series of drawings from 1990 features illustrations of triffids, the menacing plants from John Wyndham’s 1951 sci-fi novel <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-day-of-the-triffids-john-wyndham/17204649?ean=9780593450086&amp;next=t&amp;affiliate=539\"> The Day of the Triffids</a>. Butt draws a parallel between these monstrous plants and HIV’s indifference to human life, which he saw as an unstoppable force intent on fulfilling its destiny.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/07/N9m33-1200x1133.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1133&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>These drawings are directly connected to the installation “Transmissions” (1990), which consists of nine glass books engraved with a triffid and illuminated by ultraviolet light, which can cause damage to human eyes. Visitors are encouraged to put on protective glasses to view the installation, which draws attention to the scapegoating of sexual and racial minorities during the AIDs crisis and beyond. Here, as elsewhere, Butt’s work cleverly and powerfully plays with our sense of fear, examining its source, whether instinctual or instilled in us by political, religious, or media manipulation. In his hands, contagion becomes both poetic device and devastating lived reality — and we are invited to share the complicated emotions it evokes.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/07/uopDJ-1200x917.jpeg?resize=1200%2C917&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/07/5XmdF-1200x799.jpeg?resize=1200%2C799&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.whitechapelgallery.org/exhibitions/hamad-butt-apprehensions/\">Hamad Butt: Apprehensions</a> <i>continues at Whitechapel Gallery (77-82 Whitechapel High Street, London, England) through September 7.

According to Joslin, Temporary Deputy Superintendent Ray McPadden of the National Park Service (NPS) told them that they had “[failed] to demonstrate acceptable conduct” after they hung the Trans Pride flag on the face of the granite monolith El Capitan.</p>\n    <p>“The messages my termination send out to the public is that if you have an identity that has been turned into a ‘ideology’ not in line with the current administration, your rights will be different than other Americans that fall into the ‘ideal standard’ for who and what a person should be, look like, and believe in,” Joslin told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. </p>\n    <p>An NPS spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic </i>in a statement that the agency is “pursuing administrative action against multiple employees for failing to follow National Park Service regulations.” They declined to comment on the specifics of Joslin’s case.</p>\n    <p>“We want to emphasize that we take the protection of the park’s resources and the experience of our visitors very seriously, and will not tolerate violations of laws and regulations that impact those resources and experiences,” the spokesperson said, alleging that “several unauthorized demonstrations involving El Capitan” last year had drawn complaints from visitors.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/sj-with-flag-1-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Joslin stated that they displayed the flag for about two hours on May 20 during their off-duty hours, and noted that Yosemite regulations did not ban the hanging of flags at the time. The following day, however, the NPS appears to have updated the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/management/upload/yose-compendium.pdf\">park’s rules</a> to prohibit the display of “any banner, flag, or sign larger than fifteen square feet” on any natural or cultural features without a permit, citing the need to “provide for an unimpaired visitor experience” and “protect natural and cultural resources.”</p>\n    <p>While the new version of the compendium with the ban is dated May 20, the signature from the park’s acting superintendent, Raymond McPadden, is dated May 21, 2025. Previous versions of the compendium, accessed by <i>Hyperallergic</i> via the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250227002244/https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/management/upload/yose-compendium.pdf\">Wayback Machine,</a> did not mention flags or banners. </p>\n    <p>Hanging flags on the famous vertical wall of El Capitan is a tradition that many climbers have long participated in. In February, park employees <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/us/yosemite-upside-down-flag-protest.html\">flew an inverted United States flag over the side of the monolith’s cliff</a> to protest the Trump administration’s cuts to the National Park Service. Last June, climbers hung a banner that read “Stop the Genocide” to decry the US-backed Israeli military’s assault on Palestine.</p>\n    <p>The NPS’s termination of Joslin’s employment comes amid the Trump administration’s ongoing attacks on LGBTQ+ rights and visibility. In February, the national parks agency <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/990547/trans-rights-groups-protest-scrubbed-stonewall-monument-website/\">expunged all references to trans and queer people</a> from its website describing the 1969 Stonewall Rebellion. The erasure then <a href=\"https://www.them.us/story/stonewall-bisexuals\">extended to mentions of bisexual people</a> in May.</p>\n    <p>“In my celebration of identity and acceptance, I’ve been disparaged and deemed unacceptable,” Joslin told <i>Hyperallergic.</i> “It’s a tragic juxtaposition of how to treat human beings.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036200/us-parks-agency-fires-ranger-who-displayed-trans-pride-flag-yosemite/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

An exhibition of Beauford Delaney’s drawings at the Drawing Center is another must-see, as it focuses on the importance of this medium in the artist’s practice, and Sandra Poulson’s work, currently at MoMA PS1, is a fascinating take on the political life of domestic symbols and objects. Meanwhile, a quick trip to Greenwich, Connecticut, will lead you to the Bruce Museum, where Jeremy Frey’s stunning basketry awaits.

Brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Colorado, the suit claimed that the town had violated the artist’s constitutional right to free speech. </p>\n    <p>In last week’s settlement, Vail agreed to several concessions, including funding an art program “for underrepresented and economically disadvantaged people” and hosting a powwow led by SeeWalker every year for the next five years.</p>\n    <p>“The intention is to allow other underrepresented artists, including Native American people, to have the opportunity of creating art in the town of Vail in place of my own missed opportunity,” SeeWalker said in a statement.</p>\n    <p>The settlement also included Vail’s commitment to sponsor a “community forum” on Israel and Palestine that would include interfaith leaders and host an annual Indigenous-led cultural sensitivity training for employees of the municipality’s Arts and Public Places Department.</p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for the town of Vail did not respond to <i>Hyperallergic</i>‘s<i> </i>inquiries about when or how it would implement the terms of the settlement.

Months later, however, the town of Vail rescinded the opportunity after she posted an image of a pro-Palestine artwork on her Instagram that she said was unrelated to her public commission. In a public <a href=\"https://www.vail.gov/Home/Components/News/News/1509/15\">statement</a>, the town said it removed SeeWalker from the project because it would “not use public funds to support any position on a polarizing geopolitical issue.” </p>\n    <p>The painting “G for Genocide,” however, was created on SeeWalker’s own time and had not been submitted as her design for the public mural. She told <i>Hyperallergic </i>in an earlier <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/959839/aclu-sues-colorado-town-over-cancellation-of-native-artists-residency/\">interview</a> that she created the work after observing common threads between Israel’s assault on Gaza and the history of Native Americans in the United States. The artwork was included in a December 2024 <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/972948/things-not-seen/\">collaboration</a> between <i>Hyperallergic</i> and <i>Jewish Currents </i>that highlighted artists who had been silenced or censored over their support of Palestine. </p>\n    <p>SeeWalker told <i>Hyperallergic </i>that settling with Vail was advantageous in that it allowed her to secure programming that other artists can benefit from, whereas a trial might only have yielded a financial result, if any. She said the settlement could have included additional terms she bargained for, but she intended to maximize community benefit over her own grievances.</p>\n    <p>“Even if one other person is impacted in a good way, that is enough for me,” SeeWalker said. “My dad once told me, ‘Danielle, if you don’t speak up, no one will do it for you.’ I carry that with me everywhere I go.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036790/colorado-town-settles-with-native-artist-danielle-seewalker-who-brought-free-speech-lawsuit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s a balmy August night, lit by a big, yellow moon. Two fishermen in a boat are earning their keep out there off the shore of Antibes in southern France. One of them aims at a large, curmudgeonly fish with a pitchfork, the other tries his luck with a fishing line. A cautious crab keeps a safe distance.<strong> </strong>Gas lamps reflect on the water’s surface and flicker into the air. A girl on a bike observes the whole scene from a high dock while licking an ice cream. She’s there with a friend, it seems. </p>\n    <p>Luxurious Monaco is less than an hour away by car. Beachy Nice is even closer. Everything looks fine and lovely. But beneath these calm waters swirl malignant tides that portend the onset of a Second, much deadlier World War just a few weeks away.</p>\n    <p>This scene in Pablo Picasso’s “Night Fishing at Antibes” stopped me in my tracks during a visit to the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) on a hot Saturday afternoon in New York City.</p>\n    <p>Currently hung on a wall at a busy intersection connecting two escalators on the museum’s fifth floor, it’s nearly impossible to have a private moment with this Cubist masterpiece, much less heed its alarm that we’re never really too far away from a third, infinitely more horrific World War, probably powered by AI.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/image00002-1200x900.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>This sprawling piece (6.75 by 11.3 feet, or two by 3.5 meters) was acquired for MoMA in 1952 by Olga Hirsh Guggenheim, wife of industrialist-philanthropist Simon Guggenheim, brother of Solomon R. Guggenheim, who started his own eponymous museum on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue. The Guggenheims made their fortune from building a global mining and smelting empire, which reached its peak during the First World War. They, among others, have been <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt130hv7t\">accused of war profiteering</a> by gouging the price of copper, which was essential for the arms industry. Many in the family have abandoned the mining industry since then. Now we recognize them more as great patrons of the arts, just as we do many contemporary MoMA donors and board members accused of <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/871887/protesters-hit-moma-again-demanding-museum-drop-board-chair-marie-josee-kravis/\">extractivism</a> and <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/521733/moma-private-prison-open-letter/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20denounce%20MoMA\"s%20connections%20to%20mass%20incarceration%2C,letter%20reads.%20%E2%80%9CStopping%20the%20global%20cycles%20of\">profiting off the military-industrial complex</a>.</p>\n    <p>And isn’t it an interesting coincidence that 1939, the year Picasso made “Night Fishing at Antibes,” is also the year he loaned “Guernica” (1937), his most famous anti-war painting, to MoMA for safekeeping after the outbreak of the war in Europe? Such is history, a turning wheel of irony. The people collecting and safeguarding the anti-war art are often the same ones selling the bombs.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/image00001-1200x900.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>PING</i>!

On the opposite side of the gallery, “Half Memory”<strong> </strong>(2024) coalesces three years of filming in the United Kingdom, United States, and France into an allusive, nonlinear 27 minutes. Soon, though, the two works come to complement each other, their dreamlike atmospheres opening onto shared themes of history and memory threaded through with the voices of Black artists and intellectuals. </p>\n    <p>In “Bodies In Dissent,” Essi’s scenes of artist Nambi Kiyira performing in a grassy green field are interspersed with black and white video of then-married jazz drummer Max Roach and singer Abbey Lincoln during a 1964 concert, and archival clips of dancer Loretta Abbott. Kiyira, wearing a long black dress, is seen alternately from afar and up close, backed by audio from the concert.</p>\n    <p>“Half Memory” takes Toni Morrison’s essay “The Site of Memory” (1986) and her concept of “rememory” — repressed memories returning via a living force — as a jumping-off point for an exploration of individual and collective memory and history. In it, grainy imagery of public places like cities and beaches — suggesting both anonymous found footage and surveillance videos — is layered with the words of Morrison and other Black feminist scholars.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Essi2-1200x883.jpg?resize=1200%2C883&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>Most online descriptions of Essi’s work, including her own artist statement, put forth a didactic portrait of the films (her website states that her art “revolves around Black feminist epistemology and the configuration of displaced histories”). These themes inhere in the references and connections she brings to light, but the films themselves are far more abstract and intuitive than academic and dry. The meditative pace and washed-out color palette of “Half Memory” reflect the ways that memories cohere, dissipate, and reemerge, while the pastoral setting of “Bodies In Dissent,” framing the performer’s elegant movements and form, renders the work lush and painterly.</p>\n    <p>The show’s location, in one of MoMA’s free ground-floor galleries, is a boon for art lovers who don’t have $30 to spend on a museum visit. Essi’s focus on music and landscape calls to mind some film works by Cauleen Smith (for instance, her 2017 ode to Alice Coltrane, “Pilgrim”). Smith’s more cinematic vision strikes a balance between abstraction and narrative that Essi’s works don’t quite achieve — and maybe weren’t meant to.

However, Essi’s great skill in these pieces lies in articulating her conceptual concerns through aesthetic and sensory means. “Half Memory” evokes the workings of memory and its relationship with official and repressed histories through its fluid montage, while “Bodies In Dissent” interweaves the past and present of Black arts and activism through music and the body.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. A stroll through Copenhagen—one of the world's most walkable cities—takes one from colorful, cobbled streets to revamped industrial buildings (some of which also happen to be the best hotels in Copenhagen), from soaring spires to daring Scandi-modern architecture. This preservation of tradition, keenness to breathe new life into the disused, and appetite for evolution make choosing a place to lay one’s head a dream. New wonders are emerging: In the inner city, Brøchner Hotels is injecting a luxurious makeover into a historic, red brick, classic Copenhagen building on Åboulevard. Situated just north of The Lakes and slap-bang between cool Nørrebro and style-conscious Frederiksberg, Hotel Hans is due for launch late summer 2025 (keep an eye out for the suites with private rooftop terraces). Ruby Hotels is planning to convert a prime location office block into a six-floor hotel, featuring a winter garden on the ground floor and a rooftop terrace with panoramic city views, scheduled for early 2027. Just outside the city, Rox Resort in the town of Køge (20 minutes south of central Copenhagen) is nearing doors-open, with a seafront, colonial-style retreat with a rooftop pool; and the Park Lane Copenhagen just north of the city is new for 2025, vowing to bring serenity and elegance to the experience. But there are plenty of exciting new spaces located centrally that are ready to welcome city trippers. Here, we round up the best hotels in Copenhagen. How we choose the best hotels in Amsterdam Every hotel review on this list has been written by a Condé Nast Traveler journalist who knows the destination and has visited that property. When choosing hotels, our editors consider properties across price points that offer an authentic and insider experience of a destination, keeping design, location, service, and sustainability credentials top of mind.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Already aglow with fairy lights and flickering chalet windows, Europe’s best ski resorts are oiling their chairlifts and praying for an almighty snow dump (snow cannons poised as backup). But where to take the family? Some of Europe’s most alluring snow globe resorts simply don’t cut the mustard with multi-generation crowds in tow. Zermatt may have guaranteed snow, but there are scant ski-in/ski-out options (if you’ve ever tried to squeeze tots into ski gear before herding them and their ski clobber to the lifts, you’ll appreciate the insider tip). Similarly, Chamonix may have upped the ante on its family-friendly pistes and areas with the Mont Blanc Legend area on Flégère, but the resort remains largely geared towards the serious skier, with steep, challenging runs (teenager territory). In short, all ski holiday ingredients must be considered when traveling with kids: hotels and chalet options, mountain lunches, small group skiing, and viable routes on a piste map. As with life, there is skiing before children and there is skiing after children. As a keen skier, I am still on a quest to find the best young family ski holiday formula, with my eldest now old enough for ski school, but the youngest requiring daycare for us, as parents, to even consider hitting the slopes. Arriving in world-class resorts without the right childcare and floor-to-ceiling windows teasing us with skiers whooshing past on fresh powder is not an experience I'd like to repeat. Moreover, the family-friendly claim is ill-defined and incredibly vague on age and requirements—a cot and baby monitor are simply not enough to get you clicking into skis and bundling into a gondola if you’re traveling with a baby or toddler. Check the fine print before you book: Are your children old enough for the kids club, and what age does the recommended ski club take from? Is it ski-in/ski-out or an easy walk to the lifts? Do the restaurants open during children-friendly hours, and is there a playroom or area for them to burn off steam? Everyone does it differently, some with a chalet and babysitters or grandparents holding the fort while parents squeeze in a few runs and a long lunch, others with hotel kids clubs or pricey nannies. Ultimately, it’s how to avoid the mountain equivalent of all-inclusive plastic chair and waterslide territory while keeping everyone entertained, parents on the slopes, and limiting cortisol levels during precious family time. So, from the best nursery slopes and ski schools to winter afternoons of…",

    "category": "Lifestyle",
    "date": "2025-09-01",
    "excerpt": "Your September 2025 horoscope has arrived! September will confront us with a sense of déjà vu as we begin our return to a more familiar matrix. After presenting us with a brand new sandbox to play in, some of the major outer planet shifts that we got a sneak peek of over the last couple months begin to revert back to status quo during the remainder of 2025. That begins with Saturn retrograding back into Pisces on September 1, returning us to a paradigm of melancholy and idealistic tension that looks a lot more like the 2023-2025 timeframe we briefly came out of in late May. Then, on September 5, Uranus stations retrograde, claiming its high water mark in its new sign of Gemini before eventually returning back to Taurus in November. It should be noted that “regressing back to status quo” doesn’t mean staying there. We will go back to the future early next year, but for now, there’s much that remains incomplete about this transition. Whether we’re returning to normal life from the idle vacation months or switching gears in other ways, some familiar problems may return for a final resolution. Given that September is also spiked by two eclipses in Pisces and Virgo (September 7 and 21, respectively), this probably won’t be the most subtle transition. Doors will open, and doors will close. There’ll be a new crop of opportunities to harvest that wasn’t on the table previously, and there’ll also be expired produce to compost. How will you navigate this liminal space in between your past and your future? With some potentially big changes and big experiences afoot this month, it’ll be easy to overlook some of the fine print. Mercury spends the first half of September in Virgo, a place where it normally shows off with peak analytical sharpness and detail-oriented finesse. However, it will also be overwhelmed and beset from every angle as it passes through the eclipse vortex and opposes Saturn, kind of like an advanced high-tech computer getting banged up inside the MRI machine. It will probably take extra effort to communicate clearly and have travel logistics go 100% as planned, but there is also an unseen hand organizing things behind the scenes and making sure there’s order and logic to the way we cut from scene to scene. The devil may be in the details this month, but the details are also not the entire point. Pay even closer attention to the ways your perspective widens to accommodate greater, messier truths about the world. Astrologer's note: Below we refer to your signs as “rising” signs, also known as your ascendant sign. Horoscopes are more accurate when read this way—using your birth…",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. While Paris has a (deservedly) superb reputation as a summer travel destination, it would be remiss to forgo the rest of France. There’s so much more to this country than the capital city, including, of course, the South of France. Here, travelers will find laid-back beach towns, fields of lavender, glasses of rosé, and tranquil blue Mediterranean views. There are plenty of ritzy hotels in the South of France, but if you want a more authentic coastal experience (or are feeling spontaneous), we suggest checking out the impressive line-up of Airbnbs in the region. You can find incredible rentals in some of France’s most charming cities, like Cannes and Nice, as well as spots in delightful small towns across the region, like Menton, Grasse, and Cassis. Whether you’re looking for easy beach access or your own French farmhouse, you’re sure to find an Airbnb in this list to suit your style. Before you begin your search, there are a few things you may want to consider when staying in the area. Some of the places we’ve included below are in remote towns, so it’s recommended to do your due diligence when booking according to your personal needs—some older homes have staircases that are not ADA accessible, you will likely need a rental car to reach spots without reliable public transportation, and if you’re working remotely, know that fast Wi-Fi isn’t always a guarantee. However, many vacation rentals in this region more than make up for it with swimming pools, furnished balconies, and breathtaking views of the sea, mountains, or medieval villages. Read on to find the perfect Airbnb for your vacation along France’s southern coast. Our top picks: - Best for families: 18th-century villa in Roboin - Best for honeymooners: Standalone one-bedroom in Ménerbes - Best for film buffs: Screenwriter’s 12th-century apartment in Saint-Paul-de-Vence - Best for storied charm: 400-year-old rooftop apartment in St. Tropez - Best for nomads: Guest house with a swimming pool in Oppède We've selected these listings based on Superhost status, ratings, amenities, location, decor, editor stays, and previous guest reviews.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Trying to decide what to wear on a plane can turn into a whole ordeal: Do you dress for takeoff or touchdown? Will the plane be freezing or stifling? And how do you balance comfort with the vague sense that you should at least look like you’ve got your life together? Whether your travel vibe is tailored or totally laid-back, our team of frequent fliers has it down to a science. We’ve already broken down the comfiest brands for long travel days—this time, we asked our editors to share the exact outfits they reach for again and again. From stretchy joggers to cozy knits and slip-on shoes, these are the pieces our editors always wear on a flight. Clothing Lululemon Soft Jersey Jogger When it comes to flights, I always turn to quality basics. Lululemon’s Soft Jersey joggers have lasted me over four years—across too many flights to count. You can pair them with the matching hoodie in black for a streamlined set or dress them up with a neutral peacoat. They look great with classic white sneakers like Adidas Stan Smiths or Nike Air Force 1s. They run slim, so I'm glad I sized up. —Erik Buckingham, commerce producer Uniqlo Washable Ribbed Knit Pants I picked these up on a whim before a long-haul flight to Asia, and now they’re in regular rotation. The wide-leg cut is far more breathable than leggings, and the ribbed knit gives them a slightly elevated feel without sacrificing comfort. —Madison Flager, associate commerce editor Agolde Low-Slung Baggy jeans I know it’s borderline psychotic, but I am a jeans-on-a-plane person. These Agolde jeans have enough stretch to feel like sweatpants, but they still give off the impression that you tried. —Bridget Knowles, associate social media manager Soft Goat Cashmere Set Yes, it’s a little pricey—but is there anything better than wearing head-to-toe cashmere while crammed in coach? This set has become my go-to for both short and long flights. It looks polished in the airport and feels cozier than most pajamas. Plus, you can mix and match the pieces once you arrive. —Hannah Chubb, senior commerce editor Janji Transit Tech Pant Getting to the airport in NYC always feels like a bit of an ordeal, especially when public transportation is involved. I love these joggers for those mad dashes through the train station and TSA.

Ski and snow may be far from your mind as you savor the last days of summer, but if you’re thinking of attending the 2026 Winter Olympics in northern Italy come February, there's no time to waste. With the right planning, it's still possible to be a part of the action this winter—where you can hear skis slide across the snow, and the sweet scrape of skates on ice, as over 90 nations compete for medals. But you'll need to get organized, as events are scheduled to take place in more than a half dozen destinations throughout the region: figure skating will be in Milan, snowboarding in Livigno, and bobsledding in Cortina, for starters. Given that the past two winter Olympics were hosted in Pyeongchang, South Korea, and Beijing, China, athletes and spectators are thrilled to be heading to a more traditional winter sports venue, and one rooted in Olympic lore (Cortina hosted the 1956 Games)—and, there are some exciting storylines to follow, including American skier Lindsey Vonn’s remarkable comeback and the debut of ski mountaineering (a combination of uphill and downhill skiing). Following the February events, the 2026 Winter Paralympics will kick off on March 6 in the Roman Arena in Verona. The closing ceremony will be held March 15 at the Cortina Curling Stadium, where the new medal event, wheelchair curling mixed doubles, will also take place. Cortina will also host para alpine skiing and para snowboarding, while sled hockey will be showcased in Milan and Val di Fiemme will be the stage for the para biathlon and para Nordic skiing events. Bouncing between these different games won't be easy, as some venues are separated by hundreds of miles of winding mountain roads. Expect suggest picking and choosing a couple sports within one geographic area. If you're eager to see it all unfold live, we'll pulled together more tips below. Consider this your cheat sheet to planning a last-minute 2026 Winter Olympics trip. How to book a hotel for the Olympics Booking your accommodations should be done strategically, says Katia Brida, a travel designer at Dream Beyond, an agency specializing in the Dolomites. Visitors have multiple options for airports, including the main gateways of Milan’s Malpensa and Venice’s Marco Polo airports, plus smaller hubs in Verona and Treviso. But these tiny mountain towns have limited rooms. Hotels that have set aside rooms from Olympic officials will soon be releasing their remaining inventory, which is likely to be scooped up by September. “When it comes to accommodation, Milan offers…",

Latitude lines, however, are unevenly spaced, with the gaps between them growing wider the further out they are from the equator. This scaling creates a distorted, stretched-out effect at the top and bottom of the Earth. As a result, Greenland appears about equal in size to the entire African continent, when in reality the latter is about<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/03/05/how-big-is-greenland/81597696007/\"> 14 times larger</a>, according to some estimates.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/De5V0-1200x2609.jpeg?resize=1200%2C2609&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>“The current size of the map of Africa is wrong,” Moky Makura, executive director of the nonprofit organization Africa No Filter, told <i>Reuters</i> in an interview about the Mercator map projection. “It’s the world’s longest misinformation and disinformation campaign, and it just simply has to stop.”</p>\n    <p>In the Equal Earth map projection, continents appear to more closely match their real relative sizes.

Bambach, an Italian Renaissance art scholar in the museum’s Department of Drawings and Prints who previously worked on The Met’s blockbuster exhibitions <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2003/leonardo-da-vinci\"> Leonardo da Vinci: Master Draftsman</a> (2003) and </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/press-releases/michelangelo-2017-exhibitions\">(2017–18).</a>\n    </p>\n    <i>Michelangelo: Divine Draftsman and Designer</i>\n    <p>Many of these pieces, The Met’s Director Max Hollein said in a statement, have never before been shown together — making the exhibition an “exceptionally rare opportunity” to explore the depth of Raphael’s artistry.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Portrait-of-Baldassarre-Castiglione_1514-1516-1200x1489.jpg?resize=1200%2C1489&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Raphael: Sublime Poetry</i> will span the artist’s early years in Urbino to his untimely death at the age of 37 in Rome, tracing the development of his ideas and creative process across his lifetime in a roughly chronological order. Thematic presentations — including recent scientific research, preparatory drawings, and a focus on his approach to portraying women — will aim to contextualize Raphael’s practice in a new light.</p>\n    <p>Among the masterpieces on display will be Raphael’s oil portrait “<a href=\"https://www.raphaelpaintings.org/portrait-of-baldassare-castiglione.jsp\">Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione</a>” (1514–16), which depicts the eponymous Italian diplomat in an intimate, soft lighting and striking, realistic detail, and his tender “<a href=\"https://www.nga.gov/artworks/26-alba-madonna\">Virgin and Child with Infant Saint John the Baptist in a Landscape (The Alba Madonna)</a>” (1510), which showcases the artist’s expertise in color and balance.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/The-Head-and-Hands-of-Two-Apostles-Auxiliary-Cartoon-for-the-Transfiguration_ca-1519-20-1200x1651.jpg?resize=1200%2C1651&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Sublime Poetry</i> will notably examine Raphael’s work through the lens of his “unique artistic personality.” Vasari, in his extensive chapter on Raphael’s short but prolific life, praised not only the painter’s embodiment of Renaissance virtues but also his enviable social ease, which earned him friends, patrons, and the admiration of artists and assistants in his workshop.</p>\n    <p>“Nature created him as a gift to the world,” Vasari wrote. “After having been vanquished by art in the work of Michelangelo Buonarroti, it wished to be vanquished through Raphael by both art and moral habits as well.”</p>\n    <p>The show is slated to open on March 29 and run through June 28.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Portrait-of-a-Lady-with-a-Unicorn-1505-6-1200x1543.jpg?resize=1200%2C1543&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037141/a-landmark-raphael-retrospective-is-coming-to-the-met/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I cannot in good conscience comply with a culture of censorship, especially when it targets vulnerable communities.”</p>\n    <p>Sherald also cited other moments of political interference in the Smithsonian’s history in her essay, including former President Woodrow Wilson’s insistence that the institution implement Jim Crow racial segregation during his presidency in line with his <a href=\"https://calendar.eji.org/racial-injustice/apr/11\">segregation of the federal government</a> when he took office in 1913. Because the institution operates in a public-private arrangement, receiving funding from both federal and corporate sources, the Smithsonian <a href=\"https://siarchives.si.edu/history/featured-topics/African-Americans/american-negro-artists\">resisted</a> pressure from the White House.</p>\n    <p>But Sherald cautions that there have since been successful efforts to influence the content of the institution’s museums. A 2010 campaign by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/dec/01/smithsonian-pulls-christ-video\">right-wing Catholic League</a> led the National Portrait Gallery to remove a video work by David Wojnarowicz depicting Jesus being eaten by ants, a commentary on the federal government’s homophobia and failure to take action during the HIV/AIDS epidemic.</p>\n    <p>In her essay, the artist invoked a quote by former Metropolitan Museum of Art Director Philippe de Montebello: “A museum is the memory of mankind.”</p>\n    <p>“If that is true, then to manipulate museums is to manipulate who we believe we are,” she wrote of the quote. “Control the memory and you control the future.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037072/amy-sherald-speaks-out-on-cancelling-her-smithsonian-show/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>HAMBURG, Germany — “Ok, stop the cameras,” the head conservator commanded from the belly of the storage department. “I want to hear what these instruments sound like without Satch wearing the gloves.” The other assembled staff, seated in a scatter of folding chairs beneath the MARKK ethnographic museum in Hamburg, lowered their phones and tucked them away.</p>\n<p>These museum workers had gathered in the MARKK’s basement to oversee and document artist and musician Satch Hoyt “un-mute” the African instrument collection, as he calls it. A masterful player of wind and percussion alike, Hoyt has been working to gain access to African instrument collections in colonial and ethnographic museums so that they may be played again. Within certain African diasporic traditions, some of these instruments are understood as tools to communicate with the creator and ancestors. Thus, this un-muting is not a mere symbolic act protesting the enforced dormancy of museum storage, but an affirmation of fluid continuity between the living and ancestral realms.</p>\n<p>Surrounded by masks and statues in the dimly lit storage den, who seemed to be watching, Hoyt dispensed with the white archival gloves he had previously been instructed to wear. He then began, gently, to play a sanza.</p>\n<p>“And then,” Hoyt recalls, “It was — <i>Pffuuumm</i>, you could just feel the energy all of a sudden in the room.” Touching the instrument with bare skin invited a rush that the gloves had shielded. “There was a feeling of gratitude,” he said, “of ‘Oh, cool — somebody’s reactivating this instrument.’ Somebody’s actually, finally returning it to its proper use.” Hoyt grinned. “It was like they were going, ‘Yeah, we needed to hear this’” — “they,” in this case, referring not to the MARKK staff watching as he acquainted himself with the museum’s African instruments, but to the audience of masks and statues overhead. “If it happens, you just feel it,” he said, referring to the rush of presence he feels when an instrument has been successfully “un-muted.” As soon as you put your lips on the embouchure, a certain feeling happens….”</p>\n<p>Born in London in 1957 to an English mother and a Jamaican father, Hoyt’s early acculturation came at a time when the British Empire was in free fall, as many of its colonies, including Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, and Uganda, had recently won their independence. Artists, intellectuals, and musicians of the African diaspora converged on the fallen and swinging capital, forging a new era of Pan-African thought. Hoyt’s early mentors were of this milieu, including the Trini filmmaker Horace Ové and the exiled South African jazz trumpeter and flautist Mongezi Feza. In Australia, he was embraced by the First Nations painters Clifford Possum, Turkey Tolson Tjupurrula, and Johnny Warangkula Tjupurrula. Later on in New York, he ran with the pioneering Afrofuturist MC and visual artist <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/tag/rammellzee/\">Rammellzee</a>, as well as cultural critic and musician Greg Tate and the band Burnt Sugar the Arkestra Chamber. In Paris, he accompanied Louise Bourgeois on recordings of her poetry and composed for Grace Jones. His list of friends and collaborators is long and illustrious, but nowadays, Hoyt is increasingly focused on ancestral ties, and is coordinating recording dates in museum basements instead of commercial studios. </p>\n<p>The process of “un-muting” first occurred to Hoyt in 2017 at the Berlin phonographic archive, while he was studying the wax cylinders that archaeologist Leo Frobenius recorded in the Congo a century before.<strong> </strong>Wax cylinder recordings typically feature a bed of unruly static, through which distant intimations of highs can be heard. The rest — overtones, textural detail, any semblance of bass or mid-range frequencies — is left to the imagination. Unsatisfied with daydreaming, Hoyt decided to cut a new path.</p>\n<p>“With the phonographic recordings that Frobenius did, afterwards, he acquired the instruments that people had been playing. So, I thought, ‘Well, we’ve got all of these instruments, which are in these ethnographic museums. I can play them. I’ve collected them over years, and they should be sounded.’”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037093/satch-hoyt-artist-freeing-museum-musical-instruments/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But where can we turn to for resistance strategies? Might the historical rise of authoritarianism in the ancient world help us understand its rapid expansion today? A freely downloadable book by top ancient historians across the globe,</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783111705446/html\">(De Gruyter, 2025),</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>argues that it can.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>In the new anthology, edited by Frederik Juliaan Vervaet, David Rafferty, and Christopher J. Dart, the authors collectively claim that readers can use Ancient Roman history to make sense of the rapid descent into fascism in the United States. A key reason for choosing Rome as a parallel to America is the extraordinary nature of the moment we are living in.</p>\n<p>“Before now, no long-established democracy has fallen to internal causes except Rome,” the editors told <i>Hyperallergic</i> in a statement. “Several of the old, consolidated democracies around the world are in trouble, and political science has only recently started to confront that as a problem; they are used to thinking of consolidated democracies as pretty safe.” </p>\n<p>The book treats the late Roman Republic as a dataset. Although the editors noted that Rome did not have the same scope in terms of policing, healthcare, or inflation controls, they explained that democratic decay or creeping authoritarianism is primarily about “interactions of political institutions, about the relative power of the different parts of the state.” While comparisons between Rome and America are nothing new, <i>How Republics Die </i>analyzes these empires’ parallel lives to underscore the consistent methods used by autocrats to shift societies away from dissent, democracy, or independent thinking, toward a triumphalist narrative of the past that culminates in their own ascent. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.walksinrome.com/blog/maps-and-mussolini-via-dei-fori-imperiali-rome\">four large maps</a>that showed Rome’s ascent and empire from 753 BCE to 117 CE, along with a new map of Italy’s future conquest of Africa in 1936, which had to be removed because the campaign was a failure.

(image public domain via the</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/maps/2022/03/out-and-about-in-a-provincial-empire-of-fascism/\">Library of Congress</a>)</p>\n<p>Although the United States became a “<a href=\"https://www.colonialwilliamsburg.org/discover/civics/was-the-united-states-founded-as-a-republic-or-a-democracy/\">mixed government</a>” predicated on republican and democratic models of governance, Rome adopted a republican model in 509 BCE. This came in the wake of the overthrow of the city’s last king. Four centuries after Rome’s Republic began, the underpinnings of the state and the explicit policies that limited the power of ambitious politicians began to erode rapidly. The book looks particularly at this period from the end of the Roman Republic to the rise of the Augustan New Order (133 BCE to 14 CE) — a time when Rome began to transition from an electoral republic to a military monarchy. Vervaet, Rafferty, and Dart told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that the decades marking Rome’s shift from a republic into an autocracy were heavily influenced by the arts. They also suggest how we might cross-compare Ancient Rome and America with other moments of rising authoritarianism around the world, such as in India and Belarus.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037152/an-ancient-roman-guide-to-donald-trump-authoritarian-playbook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>OTTAWA — I first encountered multidisciplinary artist Skawennati in person at her December 2019 talk at the former McLuhan Centre for Communication and Technology in Toronto. I recall that the artist wore Barbie-doll pink; I later learned that she is a Barbie fan.</p>\n<p>At the talk, Skawennati introduced herself as both an urban Kanien’kehá:ka (Mohawk) woman and a cyberpunk avatar. She discussed her longtime practice of costuming avatars as a means of realizing Indigenous peoples’ self-determination in the Aboriginal Territories in Cyberspace (AbTeC) — a thriving, futuristic island she maintains in the virtual world, Second Life. Later, she shared work-in-progress documentation for the project <i>Calico &amp; Camouflage</i> (2020–22), a fashion line of Turtle Island “resistance wear” — her interpretation of traditional ribbon shirts and combat pants as Kanien’kehá:ka protest gear — for both avatars and IRL models. </p>\n<p>At the time, I was taken by Skawennati’s commitment to working within a massive multiplayer virtual world that was, in my view, a ghost town. She was adamant that if the platform were to “sunset,” she would stop making her avatars: “In the end, I know it’s not mine,” she shared with me in a 2020 interview for <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-in-america/features/skawennati-abtec-island-indigenous-community-second-life-1202693110/\">an  Art in America profile</a>. The Montreal-based artist utilizes these characters, as well as settings and backdrops she has built and designed in AbTeC, for her machinimas and machinimagraphs — films and photography produced within virtual worlds. “That’s why I take lots of pictures, lots of documentation. As long as you know you’re not actually in control, you have a lot of control.” </p>\n<p><i>Skawennati: Welcome to the Dreahouse</i>at the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa. Foreground: the diptych “Dancing with Myself” (2015); background: “Birth of an Avatar (Homage to Mariko Mori)” (2017)</p>\n<p>Yet, as her current National Gallery of Canada (NGC) mid-career survey <i> Skawennati: Welcome to the Dreamhouse</i> proves, the trajectory of the past 25 years of her work lies not only in these machinimas and machinimagraphs, but also in her burgeoning work with fashion. The </p>\n<p><i>Calico &amp; Camouflage</i>collection was part of a turn in her understanding of the virtual as increasingly hybrid performative experiences involving garment-based sculptures and textiles. Within the NGC exhibition catalog, contributors Cheryl Sim and Mojeanne Sarah Behzadi make the case for how formative Skawennati’s engagement with fashion has been to her work overall. As exhibition curator Wahsontiio Cross, of the NGC, writes in the accompanying catalog, her creation of fashion and textiles has resulted in the artist finally “bring[ing] her idea of the future into the present.”</p>\n<p>The exhibition design for <i>Welcome to the Dreamhouse</i>, in which each room is perfectly structured for its intended purpose, is reminiscent of the Barbie Dreamhouse, aligning Skawennati’s multidisciplinary works with open-ended play. However, the artist clarified in conversation with <i>Hyperallergic</i> that she and Cross were drawn toward the “dreamhouse” concept for its aspirational potential. “A dreamhouse feels attainable. It might take work, but people think they can achieve it. I wanted to say with this show, this concept, this title, that a peaceful and just future is attainable.”</p>\n<p>Among the longstanding themes that carry through the show, a core motif is Indigenous futurism, wherein the pain of the colonial past is worked through a “future imaginary.” The term, coined by Skawennati’s partner and frequent collaborator, Jason Edward Lewis, reclaims historical narratives and centers Indigenous peoples in “exploring new cultural configurations that will enable us not just to survive, but thrive.”</p>\n<p>Across different galleries, visitors encounter new and old characters from the artist’s moving and still image works. Many involve Indigenous sci-fi retellings of Hotinonshón:ni cosmology and histories, ranging from the creation story told in “She Falls For Ages” (2017) to the ancestral narrative of the Iroquois confederation, updated to the year 3025, in “The Peacemaker Returns” (2017).</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036805/skawennati-cyberpunk-future-is-now-national-gallery-canada/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I moved into the space shortly after my mom died from a very short battle with cancer. Moving here meant seismic change for me — leaving my family home, marriage, and longtime former studio. My mom worked with arts and accessibility. Her spirit is everywhere, and it is truly an amazing space. Every visitor feels the strong, positive, creative energy. When I moved in, I began imagining how I wanted my studio to feel, planning for months before starting construction. I was<i> </i>literally rebuilding myself while building my studio space. The first of many projects as a newly independent mid-career artist who had lost her mom and left her marriage to find herself.</p>\n<p><i>Describe an average day in your studio.</i></p>\n<p>My daily routine changes often. Constants: coffee. A long run, early-morning yoga, meditation — even a few times a week. Emails and Instagram. I read and journal. Each day is different because my practice is so varied. When I am making new work, I try to really let myself feel free. Music is so important to me. I like it loud — too loud for my neighbors. So many genres … I travel to time periods, places in the world, places in my mind with music. My <i>Composition</i> series is about music.</p>\n<p><i>How does the space affect your work?</i></p>\n<p>It is magical! The space is like a blank palette with which I can make anything. It is energetic in that my work is received and felt. I meditate often, balancing that with loud music. I feel so free here. During the first months in this space, I bought Yves Klein matte blue paint, and drew Buddhist quotes on the kitchen walls. I made a pact to be intentional about everything entering my space. I was leaving negative energy and needed a space to heal and grow. I wanted to use every corner in the space conceptually. I wanted a true artist’s home — welcoming, colorful, like a cabinet of curiosities; weird, filled with me.</p>\n<p><i>How do you interact with the environment outside your studio?</i></p>\n<p>I’m extremely involved with the art community in Omaha. This community is the reason I’ve stayed in this city. Omahans are down-to-earth and embrace bold ideas. The top three projects in my career were on the campus of the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Although I’ve moved further from the arts area, I’ve found the most important part of making art is feeling supported. My community is all over Omaha but also the world. I believe community is everywhere. Sometimes one close friend is one’s entire community. I want to continue to know my neighbors and support the arts organizations that support me.</p>\n<p><i>What do you love about your studio?</i></p>\n<p>One, I love feeling my mom’s presence. She was a mother to many beyond my family. She died too soon but left a legacy felt here. She worked with people who didn’t have access to art. Two, I love my trees. My home/studio has two massive oaks right through it. Three, I love that the studio is mine. I feel so free and independent now and don’t have to answer to anyone but myself. It was a long road to get here.</p>\n<p><i>What do you wish were different?</i></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037524/a-view-from-the-easel-300/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>It’s about that time of year when the slight crisping of the air signals that the balmy summer is departing, but hasn’t disappeared just yet. Suddenly, the fluorescent lights, lively chatter, and overpriced opening wine flowing onto the New York City streets beckon the passerby who has spent all summer tanning in Central Park. It’s fall art fair season, at last.</p>\n<p>As usual, the season’s kicking off with the gargantuan Armory Show next week, followed by a lineup of shows that range from the alternative (zines!) to the conservative and historical (Independent 2oth Century). This year brings a few changes, though: the unexpected <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032202/as-adaas-art-show-changes-course-a-nonprofit-is-left-in-limbo/\">cancellation</a> of the Art Dealers Association of America’s annual Art Show, for instance, typically an anchor of the autumn fairs. Volta is also skipping its NYC edition, while Clio is having <i>two</i> fairs in the same month. </p>\n<p>The art market might be topsy-turvy, but your fairgoing experience doesn’t have to be. Our handy guide below is here to help navigate your way through it all.</p>\n<h3>The Armory Show</h3>\n<p>September 5–7 | <a href=\"https://www.thearmoryshow.com/\">thearmoryshow.com</a><br/>Javits Center, 429 Eleventh Avenue, Midtown West, Manhattan</p>\n<p>The Goliath of the city’s art fairs, the Armory Show will once again descend upon the shopping mall-esque Javits Center to kick off New York’s fall season. More than 230 galleries will convene for the colossal event, with spotlight booths focused on the late artist Ming Fay and installation artist Sylvie Hayes-Wallace, among others. For the first time, the fair’s Platform section will be curated by a nonprofit, Souls Grown Deep, which will celebrate Black artistry from the American South with an exhibition of paintings, assemblages, sculptures, and textile works. Another fresh feature this year is the inaugural design-focused Function section, showcasing sculptural assemblages and installation works by Nikita Gale, Cauleen Smith, Ryan Johnson, and Gee’s Bend Quiltmakers.</p>\n<p>The Armory’s programming will also extend beyond the boundaries of Hudson Yards in a focused series of multi-borough partnership presentations. At the Queens Museum, a collaboration with Gagosian will produce a monumental banner reproduction of Honor Titus’s tennis painting “Louis Malle Practice” (2025) on the institution’s facade. Times Square Arts and the Whitney Museum of American Art will host nightly viewings of media artist Marina Zurkow’s multi-channel animation “The River is a Circle (Times Square Edition)” across 95 synchronized electronic billboard displays throughout the city.</p>\n<h3>Independent 20th Century</h3>\n<p>September 4–7 | <a href=\"https://www.independenthq.com/fair2\">independenthq.com</a> <br/>Casa Cipriani, 10 South Street, The Battery, Manhattan</p>\n<p>The modern art sibling fair of the contemporary-focused Independent fair returns to Manhattan’s Battery neighborhood with 31 galleries and arts nonprofits for its fourth edition. Solo, duo, and group presentations notably spotlight works by self-taught artists, Lebanese women artists, and influential figures from Latin America. Attendees can also check out a host of programs, including a live discussion between installation artist Judy Pfaff and author Joe Fig and a roundtable between directors of the Storm King Art Center, Princeton University Art Museum, the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, and Aspen Art Museum.</p>\n<h3>Art on Paper</h3>\n<p>September 4–7 | <a href=\"http://ny.thepaperfair.com\">ny.thepaperfair.com</a><br/>Pier 36, 299 South St, New York, New York</p>\n<p>Don’t underestimate the versatility of this pulpy, everyday material. Returning to its usual venue at Pier 36 on the East River, this year’s Art on Paper fair will showcase boundary-pushing artworks from over 100 galleries, such as Pace-represented artist Nina Katchadourian’s playful ecological sculptures made from found paper items. The show’s meta mini bookfair, BOOKsmART, will also return with exhibitors from more than 20 presses, including Oreades Press, Axis Press, and Central Booking. Installations like feminist participatory artist Mary Beth Edelson’s <a href=\"https://thealdrich.org/exhibitions/mary-beth-edelson-six-story-gathering-boxes-1972-2014\"> Story Gathering Boxes</a> series (1972–2014) and Ruben Castillo’s woodcuts and lithocuts exploring queer intimacy attest to the medium’s endless possibilities.</p>\n<h3>Salon Zürcher: 100 Women of Spirit +, Part 3</h3>\n<p>September 2–7 | <a href=\"https://www.galeriezurcher.com/salon-zurcher-33rd-edition-100-women-of-spirit-part-3-september-2-7-2025\">galeriezurcher.com</a><br/>Zürcher Gallery, 33 Bleecker Street, Soho, Manhattan</p>\n<p>Returning for its 33rd edition as an intimate and quieter satellite fair of the Armory Show, <i>100 Women of Spirit + </i>brings together 11 women artists at its Bleeker Street home. Deriving its name from the French phrase <i>femme d’esprit,</i> referring to intellectual and witty women, this year’s fair features psychedelic paintings by Amy Cheng, welded steel constellations by Dutch-born artist Marieken Couchius, and oil self-portraits by trauma-informed psychotherapist Trissy Callan.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037354/nyc-fall-2025-art-fair-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>LONDON — Of all the <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/y/young-british-artists-ybas\">YBAs</a> (Young British Artists) of the 1990s — including upstarts like Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin, mouthing off petulantly to the art establishment with dead livestock and unmade beds — it is Jenny Saville who has been most entrenched in the history of art. It is also Saville who can most convincingly claim to be Britain’s greatest living painter since the death of Lucien Freud (sorry, David Hockney). The artist’s superb draughtsmanship skills, informed by absorption and understanding of the Old Masters, are combined with a painterly technique that manipulates its plasticity for all its worth. (Ironically, Tracey Emin is a professor of drawing at the Royal Academy despite having no capacity for drawing.) Saville’s style is as complete and significant as that of Freud.</p>\n<p>It is hard to overestimate the impact of Saville’s early works on British contemporary painting. Her paintings often disappear into the most discerning private ownership. Those in public collections are the rare anomaly in her current survey, <i> The Anatomy of Painting</i>, at the National Portrait Gallery. As a result, some of that impact is recreated for those viewing her art for the first time. Enormous in scale, her uncomfortably close cropped depictions of women’s faces and nude bodies abound in the joy of painterly modeling, from bare — nude — patches of canvas to her swift, thick, viscous slathers, to dappled dry brush blends. The large scale alone may shock people accustomed to viewing only reproductions on screen. The distribution of muted and contrasting tones is sophisticated. In short, there is a wealth of virtuosic brushwork to drink in. </p>\n<p>Considering the painterly bombast, it is perhaps a pedantic complaint that the National Portrait Gallery has mounted an exhibition that has not a single “portrait” in it. We are given only a few of the sitters’ identities, and neither the museum nor Saville expound any particular reason for portraying them, nor any painter-sitter relationships to speak of. Hers is an academic interest with only perfunctory gestures toward body image issues, and pieces explicitly covering <a href=\"https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-5916645\">gender identity</a> are absent. In “Plan” (1993), one of the exhibition’s key works, Saville contours the nude flesh like ordinance survey map terrain, while “Ruben’s Flap” (1998–99) references the fleshy folds favored by the Dutch master, updated to the “real” folds of contemporary unidealized body types. In her most color-saturated rendering of flesh, “Figure 11.23” (1997), she deploys flat red more in the Renaissance discipline of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cangiante\">cangiante</a> – using depth of color rather than muted tones for shade – rather than realistically depicting blood. </p>\n<p>Similarly, a fantastic sequence of mother and child images that reference both Pietas and Maestas from Michelangelo, with bulbous children bending toward us, entasis-style, echo distinctly his Madonna of Bruges or the soft sfumato of Raphael, reimagined in colored pencil. Saville fails, though, to wear her influences on her sleeve when channeling her love for de Kooning into her compositions from the mid to late 2010s. Her attempts to break down nudes into intertwining layers of limbs and squiggles, shattering them with de Kooning-like surface articulation, feel forced, and obscure her gift for three-dimensional modeling. “Out of one, two (symposium)” (2016) nods to Cy Twombly simply by overlaying the nude figures with scribbles. Her academic attempts at abstraction — the opposite of Renaissance Old Master figure modeling — seem to be at the expense of her work’s soul.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036158/jenny-saville-uk-greatest-living-painter-national-portrait-gallery-london/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In photographer Alicia Vera’s portrait of her mother, Concepcion, she gazes skyward, her expression somewhere between curious and awestruck. The image has enough stylistic mottling and grain to obscure any sort of background, but Concepcion is clear: broad cheekbones, bejeweled ears, eyes full of wonder—maybe. Vera is a deeply humanistic image-maker, and it’s impossible to differentiate between a posed subject and a candid one. She approaches both with generosity.</p>\n<p>Isolated, the phrase “va a llover toda la noche,” which translates in English to “it’s going to rain all night,” feels like a snippet of poetry or song. A few years ago, it was a note left on Vera’s door by her mother. Now, it’s the title of Vera’s new project, and a self-published book of the same name, documenting Concepcion’s Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis and Vera’s experience processing it. “Every time I go home to Miami, I stay in my childhood home,” Vera shares. “My mom loves to leave notes on the door. I kept this one; a year or so later, when I was taking out all this material I had, I thought, ‘this is exactly what this feels like.’” The portrait of her mother is one of many in <i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i> (2025); alongside Vera’s portraits, the book includes archival images of Concepcion over the last several decades, text messages, emails, and other personal ephemera.</p>\n<p><i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i>(2025), with the caption: “Mom and her orchids in Miami”</p>\n<p>Vera, who is based in Mexico City, is an award-winning editorial and commercial photographer, and her personal projects feature some of her most captivating images. In “Basketball in the Sierra Norte of Oaxaca” (2018), she captured the Copa Mixe, a basketball tournament for Indigenous Mixe youth in Sierra Norte; for “Stripped” (2009–11), she spent years documenting strippers in Miami and the Bay Area. Her photos are devoid of the voyeuristic quality often visible in like-minded series by other artists; instead, she seems warmly welcomed, like a relative. She’s been photographing her own family, too, “since forever,” she says. “I think I knew deep down, one day, everything’s going to be so different. Every time I would go home, I would take a ton of pictures.”</p>\n<p>Concepcion was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease in 2018, which prompted Vera to begin photographing her more. In a Spanglish epilogue to the book, Vera writes, in English: “After my mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, I felt devastated, overwhelmed, anxious and helpless.” In Spanish, she adds: “<i>Mi mamá se me iba a ir. En mi desesperación de entender lo que le estaba pasando y porque nunca realmente sentí que la conocí, empecé este proyecto llamado</i>, <i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i>” (My mom was going to leave me. In my desperation to understand what was happening to her, and because I never really felt like I knew her, I started this project called <i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i>.) Vera’s understanding of her mother’s own personhood was limited by the challenges of their relationship—a too-common dynamic among mothers and daughters, and one that Vera has long hoped to correct. “She grew up in Mexico and I grew up in the US, so there were a lot of cultural differences,” she says. “In my 20s, I moved away and realized, ‘I really miss my mom.’ We started having these phone calls, and it hit me that my mom was an entire human … I remember trying to make an effort to get to know her, asking her really specific questions. When my mom got diagnosed, I was like, ‘Wait, but I’m just starting to get to know you.’”</p>\n<p><i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i>(2025), with the caption: “My mother as a child runs through a field with her brother in Mexico. / A prayer card found in my mother’s room.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037506/alicia-vera-photographs-depict-alzheimers-with-dignity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>A Pennsylvania art museum is suing the Trump administration after the government terminated a $750,000 federal grant for collection conservation earlier this year.</p>\n    <p>The Woodmere Art Museum in Philadelphia filed a lawsuit yesterday, August 26, against President Donald Trump, the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the agency’s Interim Director Keith Sonderling, and other administration officials, months after the agency revoked its Fiscal Year 2024 “Save America’s Treasures” grant. The museum, which operates out of a 19th-century mansion in the city’s Chestnut Hill neighborhood, alleges that Trump officials usurped Congress’s authority to distribute federal funds by prematurely terminating its grant.</p>\n    <p>The IMLS grant that the Woodmere received is administered in <a href=\"https://nps.gov/subjects/historicpreservationfund/save-americas-treasures-grants.htm\">partnership</a> with the National Park Service and awarded to “historic properties and collections.” After receiving the grant, according to the lawsuit, the museum initiated an “ambitious conservation project” to prepare an exhibition of Philadelphia artists in 2026, timed with America’s 250th celebrations. The museum received just $195,000 of its total grant before its termination. </p>\n    <p>The Woodmere hopes the IMLS will restore its funding so that it can continue its original planned <a href=\"https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/st-256887-oms-24\">project</a> to install new storage facilities, address collection crowding, and improve cataloguing efforts. </p>\n    <p>“This has delayed critical preservation, digitization, and conservation of our collection — work we hope to resume if the grant is reinstated,” Woodmere Art Museum Director and CEO William Valerio told <i>Hyperallergic. </i></p>\n    <p>With the grant expiration approaching in September, the museum stated in court papers that it has exhausted non-litigious methods of restoring the grant, including a formal appeal. Trump signed an executive order in March demanding that the IMLS and several other federal agencies <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/996700/trump-moves-to-dismantle-institute-of-museum-and-library-services/\">cease operations</a> of non-statutory functions, effectively dismantling the organization. The lawsuit asks the court to reinstate its grant and declare Trump’s gutting of the IMLS “unlawful” or “unconstitutional.”</p>\n    <p>The president proposed eliminating the organization’s funding in his Fiscal Year 2026 budget proposal, which also excluded the National Endowment for the Arts from federal dollars. A federal judge <a href=\"https://www.ala.org/news/2025/06/court-allows-trump-administration-proceed-efforts-destroy-institute-museum-and-library\">declined</a> to block Trump’s dismantling of the agency in June after other judges blocked <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1014493/museum-grants-reinstated-after-federal-court-ruling/\">some of his actions</a>.</p>\n    <p>The IMLS has not yet responded to <i>Hyperallergic’s </i>request for comment. </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037363/pennsylvania-museum-sues-trump-administration-over-grant-cuts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>CHICAGO — Though Wafaa Bilal was born in Iraq and is based in New York, his survey at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, <i> Indulge Me</i>, can be called a homecoming of sorts. In 2007, the accomplished yet underrated artist captured the art world’s attention with his durational performance “Domestic Tension,” wherein he lived for 30 days inside the exhibition space of Chicago’s FlatFile Gallery; a web camera broadcast his movements while a paintball gun was available for anyone to remotely fire at him via a website. Reconstructed as an open-face cubicle inside the museum’s pristine gallery space, the splatters of thousands of yellow paintballs on its interior walls do not convey the torturous persistence of the gun as forcefully as the brief video diary screened on a small monitor nearby. In an increasingly distressed voice, the goggled Bilal unironically thanks his audience for their participation as the gun processes a ceaseless string of firing commands. </p>\n    <p>For a significant survey, the exhibition is remarkably spare. Curator Bana Kattan selected five major projects, each one integrating technology, performance, and a conceptual approach to the conditions of being Arab in the United States in the post-9/11 era. In “3rdi,” Bilal surgically implanted a web camera to the back of his head and attached it to an internet-connected laptop slung at his waist. Each minute, the camera would take an image and send it via the laptop to a live website feed. We are privy to an oversized presentation of a year’s worth of these images, projected on a 14-foot scrim diagonally bisecting the gallery and synced to the date and time they were originally taken.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Bilal-1200x947.jpg?resize=1200%2C947&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>While Bilal once again submits himself to anonymous public scrutiny, making literal the Arab-American condition, the seemingly arbitrary images show the view from behind, telling us not where he is going but where he has been. The project title can be parsed as “third eye,” referring both literally to the camera and conceptually to the watchful eye of the state, but can also be read in Western-transliterated Arabizi as “my land,” pointing to the places from which Bilal has fled as a political refugee who could not look back.</p>\n    <p>The latest project on view, “In a Grain of Wheat,” exhibits Bilal’s persistent concern with the technological mediation of contemporary culture. Responding to the destruction of Iraqi cultural heritage by ISIS, the artist collaborated with a scientist and coder team to scan the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s lamassu and write its form into the DNA of a grain of wheat. The specific mechanics of this process are not comprehensible via the minimal didactics presented, so viewers must accept that the sculpture lives in the wheat as an act of faith in the art and science of the project. Aptly, the work demands a devotional gesture. To partake of the wheat, one must bend down before the replica winged bull to reach for the pile of seeds at its hooves.

    "bodyHtml": "<p>On Friday morning, August 22, illustrator Felipe Galindo Gómez opened his email to find a note from his friend. “Have you seen this?” the message read, and linked to the White House’s bullet-pointed <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036180/trump-targets-lgbtq-history-migrants-and-more-in-chilling-smithsonian-hit-list/\">list targeting Smithsonian artworks and exhibitions</a>. There it was: an image of his 1999 <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2018648700/\">illustration</a> “4th of July from the south border.”</p>\n<p>Since 2022, Galindo’s work had been reproduced on a label about anti-immigrant prejudice as part of<i> </i><a href=\"https://latino.si.edu/exhibitions/presente\"> ¡Presente! A Latino History of the United States</a> in the National Museum of American History’s (NMAH) Molina Family Latino Gallery. Over the last three years, the gallery space has served as the temporary location of the nascent National Museum of the American Latino, which is currently facing an uncertain future under the Trump administration. Now, the Molina gallery has quietly closed for the next nine months, </p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>confirmed.</p>\n<p>After the White House featured his work in its hit list, Galindo, who also goes by the name “Feggo,” said he traveled from New York City to Washington, DC, to see whether it was still up. When he arrived at the museum on Tuesday, he found the exhibition closed. A sign said it would reopen in spring 2026. According to the Smithsonian’s website, <i>¡Presente! </i>was scheduled to close at the end of November, in preparation for <a href=\"https://www.si.edu/250\">programming</a> marking the United States’s 250th birthday. But the exhibition was shuttered on July 20, four months sooner than expected. The decision notably follows Trump’s <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/999509/trump-whitewashes-history-in-new-smithsonian-executive-order/\">March executive order</a> targeting the Smithsonian Institution and the release of his Fiscal Year 2026 budget, which excluded funding for the NMAL.</p>\n<p>The Molina Family Latino Gallery’s early closure means it will remain shuttered throughout Hispanic Heritage Month this fall, and marks a lengthy period of inactivity for the fledgling National Museum of the American Latino’s only current physical gallery, which the museum’s director, Jorge Zamanillo, has <a href=\"https://time.com/6314166/museum-american-latino-controversy/\">referred</a> to as the institution’s “first iteration.” </p>\n<p>Reached by <i>Hyperallergic</i>, a spokesperson for the institution cited preparations for the Smithsonian’s <i>Our Shared Future: 250</i> programming as the reason for the exhibition’s premature closure. </p>\n<p>“The National Museum of the American Latino is participating in the Smithsonian’s celebration of the nation’s 250th anniversary and wanted to meet the spring 2026 deadline for opening the <i>Puro Ritmo</i> exhibition in support of the Smithsonian’s institution-wide plans,” the spokesperson said, referring to the upcoming show <a href=\"https://latino.si.edu/exhibitions\"> ¡Puro Ritmo! The Musical Journey of Salsa</a> at the Molina gallery. “The Molina Family Latino Gallery is closed to visitors because museum staff need the space to safely de-install </p>\n<p><i>Presente</i>and then transition the exhibition space into a staging area to prepare for the renovation and installation of</p>\n<p><i>Puro Ritmo</i>.”</p>\n<p>The institution <a href=\"https://time.com/6314166/museum-american-latino-controversy/\">reportedly</a> adopted the salsa-themed exhibition as a softer alternative to a planned exhibition on Latino youth movements that garnered significant conservative backlash. Before Trump’s crackdown on the Smithsonian began, that exhibition was widely criticized by conservatives who disagreed with its focus on colonization and threatened to <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/835401/republicans-vote-to-block-funding-for-museum-of-american-latino/\">withhold federal funding</a> for the forthcoming museum in 2023.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>The Smithsonian spokesperson did not directly answer a question about whether Trump’s museum reviews or executive action influenced the decision to close the Molina Gallery in July. Trump has<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Letter-Sec.-Bunch-Smithsonian-8.12.2025.pdf\"> repeatedly pushed</a> the Smithsonian to promote “unity, progress, and enduring values” in time for the country’s 250th anniversary next year. Earlier this month, the administration demanded that Smithsonian museums submit their 250th anniversary plans to “<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/08/letter-to-the-smithsonian-internal-review-of-smithsonian-exhibitions-and-materials/\">align messaging</a>” with the White House Salute to America 250 Task Force.</p>\n<p>Three of the works named on last week’s White House list were created by living artists who were born in Mexico, including Galindo, raising questions about how the institution will protect its Latino artists under pressure from the federal government.</p>\n<p>When Galindo learned from a staff member that the museum was “rotating” the exhibition, he told <i>Hyperallergic </i>he remembers thinking, “Is that a new word for censoring?” </p>\n<p>The administration has already launched a review of <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/08/letter-to-the-smithsonian-internal-review-of-smithsonian-exhibitions-and-materials/\">exhibitions</a> planned for the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence as part of its larger probe. Trump’s government referenced the US’s 250th anniversary nine times in its letter to the Smithsonian announcing its review and forthcoming “content corrections.” </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037811/smithsonian-latino-gallery-quietly-closes-for-nine-months/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>\n",

The buzz of neon lights drones in the background. It’s hard to say if the temperature has truly dropped, or if it’s psychosomatic, that the atmosphere has cooled your skin just by the power of suggestion. You’re floating in space, or suspended underwater — gravity works differently here.</p>\n    <p>The phases of the moon are painted on the wall in a matte metallic silver, and a small poem by Saar is draped across the wall: “The moon keeps vigil as a lone canoe drifts into a sea of tranquility seeking serenity in the twilight.” In the middle of the room, a long canoe, 17 feet across, sits atop a bed of branches, bramble, and sheets of jagged wood. At either tip of the ship is a watchful eye guiding the raft in both directions. Two sentinels — antiques affixed with antlers — keep watch at each end. Saar has crafted a fantastical scene; you can envision the boat careening upriver, striding forth.</p>\n    <p>The vessel is occupied by bird cages confining animal antlers and seated upon miniature chairs fit only for a toddler — or, perhaps, spirits who scarcely need a physical seat, just an invitation to rest. These scavenged items are characteristic of Saar’s found object assemblage; she hunts for her materials, whether in nature or at flea markets.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/cFoCY-1200x900.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>“I like combining manufactured objects with natural objects,” says the 98-year-old artist in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n2Dg3C10Y&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huntington.org%2F&amp;embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huntington.org&amp;source_ve_path=MjM4NTE&amp;themeRefresh=1\">video</a> at the back of the gallery. She started collecting at four or five, she explains, but the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. was a catalyzing moment. She was so overwhelmed with emotion that she could do nothing but create art, leading her to assemble one of her most famed sculptures, “The Liberation of Aunt Jemima” (1972), which empowers and equips a “mammy” figurine with defensive weaponry.</p>\n    <p>Saar is a famed Angeleno, a fixture in the city’s art scene, but she was raised in Pasadena, which neighbors the Huntington Gardens, where this site-specific commission went up in 2023. In the short directed by Kyle Provencio Reingold, the camera follows her through the massive campus, where she first wandered at 12 or 13 alongside her mother and neighbor. We forage the gardens with her as she instructs the Huntington employees of her artistic intentions; you can hear the giddiness in her voice as she remembers her childhood traversing its grounds, selecting fallen branches and trimmings. “Even in death, those things can be really beautiful,” she muses.</p>\n    <p>The gallery lighting shifts from daylight to dusk as time creeps along. <i>Drifting Into Twilight </i>is an encapsulated, self-sustaining environment of its own, like a display exhibit at a natural history museum with a surrealistic twist. The room is as relaxing as it is disorienting; it feels like you’ve been plunged into a misty and peculiar other world. You are sinking, descending, drifting into twilight. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/bcIbO-1200x900.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.huntington.org/exhibitions/betye-saar-drifting-toward-twilight\">Betye Saar: Drifting Toward Twilight</a> <i>continues at Virginia Steele Scott Galleries of American Art at the Huntington (1151 Oxford Road, San Marino, California) through November 30, 2027.

    "bodyHtml": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Since 1973, Vincent van Gogh masterpieces including his beloved sunflowers, wistful wheatfields, and self-portraits have been housed in Amsterdam’s Van Gogh Museum. The institution was established via a historic 1962 agreement between the painter’s nephew and the Dutch government to ensure the long-term preservation of hundreds of paintings, drawings, and letters comprising van Gogh’s oeuvre.<br/>Now, the museum says that the collection’s future is uncertain, citing a dispute with the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (OCW) over the funding for costly maintenance repairs and sustainability efforts mandated by the state. In a legal complaint, the institution claims that the Dutch government is violating its decades-old agreement by refusing to provide sufficient subsidies to cover the cost of the three-year, €104 million (~$121 million) project.</p>\n    <p>Under the Dutch Heritage Act, national museums, including the Van Gogh Museum, the Rijksmuseum, and the Kröller-Müller Museum, receive annual housing subsidies to help them maintain and preserve their collections. But the Van Gogh Museum says that this yearly government funding —<a href=\"https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0037533/2025-05-07\"> currently €8,428,300 (~$9.8 million)</a> — falls short of the more than €11 million (~$12.8 million) needed to help it finance much-needed renovations to its fire and security alarms, climate control system, and internal elevators leading to storage facilities, plus the sustainability upgrades required for all Dutch public buildings as of 2024.</p>\n    <p>“So far, the state of the museum has not directly affected the programming and operations,” a Van Gogh Museum spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “But it’s just a matter of time before it will become a major issue.” </p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for OCW said that the ministry “maintains that the allocated housing subsidy is sufficient to cover the necessary maintenance cost.”</p>\n    <p>“This position is based on comprehensive research conducted by independent experts commissioned by the Ministry,” the spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>, noting that the subsidy is a “fixed amount” that is annually adjusted for inflation. </p>\n    <p>The museum did not disclose how the subsidy is calculated, but the OCW representative said that the same methodology is used for other national museums, citing the Rijksmuseum, which receives<a href=\"https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0037533/2025-05-07\"> €37 million (~$43 million)</a>, and the Kröller-Müller Museum, which receives<a href=\"https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0037533/2025-05-07\"> €9.8 (~$11.4 million)</a>.</p>\n    <p>For the past two years, the Van Gogh Museum has been negotiating with the government to increase this annual subsidy by €2.5 million (~$2.9 million) to no avail.</p>\n    <p>If the institution does not come to a resolution soon, the museum says it may need to close its doors. The Van Gogh Foundation, established by the painter’s nephew, has also echoed concerns about the institution’s future and urged the Dutch government to abide by its obligations to protect the artist’s works as stipulated by the founding 1962 agreement.</p>\n    <p>The Van Gogh Museum houses the largest collection of works by the artist in the world, comprising over 200 paintings, 500 drawings, and 900 letters, as well as other works by the Dutch artist’s contemporaries and influences. Over the course of five decades, nearly 57 million people have visited the museum, with annual attendance reaching a peak of 2.6 million in 2017.

    "bodyHtml": "<p>‣ Design is a minefield of ethical dilemmas, incentivizing companies to work with exploitative clients and making it difficult for employees to say no. Elizabeth Goodspeed spoke with a few designers, writing in <i> It’s Nice That</i>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Questions about client ethics are tricky enough when you know exactly who you’re working for. Things get even murkier when work is licensed, resold, or embedded with no direct link between creator and end user. For type designers, this is the norm. Once a font is released, it can surface almost anywhere, often without warning. Jesse Ragan, cofounder of XYZ Type, says custom projects feel relatively straightforward to assess ideologically: if he doesn’t believe in a client, he can simply turn down the work. Retail fonts are a different story. A typeface is made in isolation long before it’s used, and can be licensed anonymously or simply pulled from Adobe Fonts without the designer’s knowledge. Jesse has seen his work turn up in porn, conservative Christian campaigns, and even materials for a far-right Texas militia. “It’s always a shock to see,” he says, especially given his left-leaning politics. He describes designing a typeface as a slow, intimate process – “every little letterform, it’s like, ‘hello, friend’, when I see them” – which makes it all the more jarring when it gets into the wrong hands. Rutherford Craze, founder of foundry Mass Driver, shares this feeling. “Some type designers feel that once they release a typeface, where it ends up is no longer their concern. I strongly disagree,” he says. “It’s not feasible to make a living and keep a spotless conscience, but it’s our responsibility to find the most equitable balance we can, whether that’s through [dis]incentivising certain usage, or turning down work for clients we disagree with.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>‣ Noguchi Museum Rights, an anonymous group of workers at the New York institution, penned an essay flagging longstanding allegations of racism and artwashing at the museum. They write in <i> Everything is Political</i>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Given that the keffiyeh is a cultural garment, meaning it is protected under city and state laws, and is the only thing ever explicitly targeted by this policy, how does the selective enforcement of this policy not discriminate against individuals who would wear a keffiyeh as a cultural item? What is the distinction between cultural and political in this context, and how is that dealt with by museum leadership?</p>\n      <p>Why were board Co-Chairs Spencer Bailey and Susan Kessler so involved in enforcing the keffiyeh ban, and in what ways does enforcing the ban relate to their responsibilities?</p>\n      <p>The leadership is not for the community, despite running a community museum founded by an activist artist who would be appalled by the current conditions. While people and organizations have stopped partnering with the museum, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaints have been filed, the staff has unionized, and the museum has received terrible press, those in leadership positions have simply crossed their fingers in the hope that the public will forget about it all. The Noguchi Museum is a community non-profit, and as a member of the community, you deserve answers.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>‣ The Moomins exhibition at the Brooklyn Public Library was easily one of the highlights of my summer, and for the <i> New Yorker</i>, Jon Allsop articulates the role these deeply human trolls can play in an age of anxiety and repression:</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037819/required-reading-748/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>\n",

    "bodyHtml": "<p>SANTA FE — In 1998, science fiction writer Ted Chiang published “Story of Your Life,” in which aliens come to Earth in “looking glasses,” mirrored spaceships that act as communication devices. The central character, linguist Dr. Louise Banks, is tasked with deciphering the aliens’ language. In turn, she begins to see time like they do — as simultaneous events — and ultimately glimpses her own future.</p>\n<p>A reference to “Story of Your Life” is tucked into the exhibition guidebook for <i> Once Within a Time</i>, SITE Santa Fe’s 12th International. Curator Cecilia Alemani identified Chiang as one of the exhibition’s 27 “figures of interest” — catalysts for the 71</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>participating artists and more than two dozen writers. What struck me about Alemani’s inclusion of Chiang’s writing was not the reference to extraterrestrial life (many readers will be familiar with the accounts of UFO sightings in New Mexico), but the surreal, endlessly fascinating phenomenon of the looking glass.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><i>Once Within a Time</i> takes reflection as a major cue. Within each curated theme, such as “The Wheel of Telling” and “The Secret Life of Puppets,” are mirror images, doubles, reversals, and echoes, along with symmetries of place, histories, peoples, and legends — offering exhibition visitors concurrent rather than sequential events, in which multiple perspectives and timelines unfold. Even the treatment of the exhibition title, <a href=\"https://www.sitesantafe.org/en/once-within-a-time/\">in which “Time” is printed upside down</a>, gestures to alternative ways of experiencing the temporal, reflective nature of both art and language. </p>\n<p>Among the many echoing narratives are works by Nora Turato and Will Rawls. Turato’s mural “I WANT OUT!” (2025), a red vinyl triptych with one panel per word, is installed on the exterior of SITE Santa Fe, the main venue; inside the museum, Rawls’s <i>Amphigory </i>(2022), a series of inky, glitchy screen prints, seems to respond to Turato’s plea with the barely legible phrase “U Can’t Escape Alive.” </p>\n<p>In the gallery with Rawls is a suite of 72 computer drawings from 1969 by hard-edge abstract painter Frederick Hammersley, who died in 2009 at age 90. He hit an artistic dry spell in the late ’60s, saying, “I painted myself out,” a condition of exhaustion, liberation, or perhaps both. To shake things up, he enrolled in <a href=\"https://www.santafenewmexican.com/pasatiempo/art/by-design-art1-and-the-early-history-of-computer-art/article_f5239b0a-13d2-11eb-ae6c-378f161fb667.html\">a computer class for artists</a> at the University of New Mexico. He used the program ART 1 to create multiple printouts of the individual “drawings” that comprise the suite on view, visually undulating abstract compositions of gray monochrome letters, numbers, and punctuation marks. With additional presentations of Chester Nez and the “<a href=\"https://guides.loc.gov/navajo-code-talkers/profiles\">Original 29” Navajo Code Talkers</a>, Autumn Chacon’s radio frequency installation, and others, visitors may experience some seriously surreal data-driven reverberations.  </p>\n<p>In SITE’s central gallery space, color-rich reverse paintings on glass — a vase of flowers, a snake, a dreamlike landscape — by Rebecca Salsbury James, born in 1891, were just odd enough to make me linger and consider her time in Taos, New Mexico, with Mabel Dodge Luhan, Georgia O’Keeffe, and other New York-to-Taos transplants. A selection from James’s collection of miniatures, including figurines, mirrors, and devotional objects, is also on view, many of which are in pairs or otherwise doubled. One tells a story, but two hold a conversation.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere in the gallery, I felt like I was in a funhouse or hall of mirrors. Louise Bonnet’s fleshy, misshapen, iridescent-skinned figures had me reflecting on my own pale, bony frame as equally warped and grotesque, alien to New Mexico’s desert environment. Katja Seib’s large-scale portrait paintings present the concept of reflection in literal and metaphysical terms. For example, “Cornucopia” (2025) depicts a fortune teller revealing her cards to the viewer; in the background, a framed image of another woman doing the same creates an infinity mirror effect. Nearby, a travel chest that belonged to <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/money/Gertrudis-Barcelo\">Doña Tules</a>, dubbed the “Queen of Sin” for her business activities (gambling and possibly a brothel), sits in the corner lit by a red light bulb, which I read as a heavy-handed reference to the stigma applied to other fiercely independent women who’ve come to the region. </p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037395/seeing-new-mexico-through-the-looking-glass-site-santa-fe-12th-international/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>\n",

    "bodyHtml": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>LONDON — Edwards Burra was a chronically ill English painter, suffering from debilitating arthritis and asthma throughout much of his life. Hailing from the upper classes of southern England, with regularized, side-parted, tamped-down hair, he spent much of his life in headlong flight from his upbringing.</p>\n    <p>Burra wanted to experience the shock of strangeness, to embrace the allure of the louche, the forbidden, the disapproved of. He sometimes left home for months at a time without even saying goodbye. Where has Edward gone? Nobody knew. Will he ever come back? Perhaps.</p>\n    <p>First it was to Paris, and then to Spain, the United States, and Mexico. As you walk around his carefully curated, chronologically organized <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/edward-burra\">exhibition</a> at Tate Britain of the best of a lifetime’s work, you can hear the drift of music in the air, the music Edward loved, the visceral excitement of jazz and how that excitement fed into the work of the Harlem years. You can even see a row of black vinyl discs along the wall. These were Edward’s records. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3754-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Edward Burra</i>at Tate Britain, London (photo Michael Glover/</p>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>It is riddling, foot-stomping, 1920s stuff, with all its wildness. You may feel an urge to put your arm around someone nearby and swerve them out onto the dance floor. There’s plenty of space in these galleries to make your mark.</p>\n    <p>Burra’s paintings, like him, are motoring away, at speed, from convention or respectability. Most are crowded with figures — you can almost smell the sweet sweat. You can almost feel the heady excitement of all those twists and turns and crazy swerves, the pushes and the pulls.</p>\n    <p>The figures’ limbs are often inclined to bend pneumatically, as if they might be nothing but inflatables. Fingers get stretched and rubberized. Features get squeezed into inhuman, mask-like shapes. Their faces are so clarted with makeup that it’s hard to tell where the fantasy of all this posing and posturing begins or ends.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Burra3-1200x1666.jpg?resize=1200%2C1666&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>These beings, afloat on the fantasies of the Englishman wielding the brush, thrive in sexy, late-night environments where booze often topples from the trays on which it is transported. Who lives inside all these dangerously pouty cravings? This is erotic provocation on speed, surrealism lightly peppered with satire, and Burra records it all, relishing the particularity of his people and scenes. (It is he, of course, who has twisted things so out of shape.) Take a good, hard look at the weird grimaces of “The Two Sisters” (1929) or the parodic mistrust on display in “Balcony Toulon” (1929). In New York, he falls instantly for the appeal of Harlem’s nightlife — such gorgeous clinches to be savored in “Savoy Ballroom, Harlem” (1934)!</p>\n    <p>Then, once in Spain, amid the death and the turmoil and confusion of the Spanish Civil War, the mood and the palette darken, and the human figure begins to incline toward the anonymous and mechanized. War looms over these paintings. We stare into open graves to admire the skeletons.</p>\n    <p>At the end he returns to England and tries to work up some response to the puff-smoke of industry and the grit of working-class street life. Rude boys kick out in unison, like stiff performers on a stage. These paintings don’t quite convince — the old energy has left him. Burra can no longer dig deep enough.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/4.-Edward-Burra-Dancing-Skeletons-1934.-Tate-Purchased-1939-1200x1671.jpg?resize=1200%2C1671&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/13.-Edward-Burra-Simply-Heavenly-Scene-in-Harlem-1957.-Private-Collection-1200x812.jpg?resize=1200%2C812&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/11.-Edward-Burra-Balcony-Toulon-1929.-Private-collection-1200x1551.jpg?resize=1200%2C1551&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/12.-Edward-Burra-John-Deth-Hommage-to-Conrad-Aiken-1931-Whitworth-Art-Gallery-1200x862.jpg?resize=1200%2C862&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/10.-Edward-Burra-Valley-and-River-Northumberland-1972-1200x1799.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1799&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/6.-Edward-Burra-Minuit-Chanson-1931-Private-Collection-1200x901.jpg?resize=1200%2C901&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/15.-Edward-Burra-The-Watcher-1937-Scottish-National-Gallery-of-Modern-Art-1200x1821.jpg?resize=1200%2C1821&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/edward-burra\">Edward Burra</a> <i>continues at Tate Britain (Millbank, London, England) through October 19.

    "excerpt": "We all contain multitudes, and it's hard to come by an individual who better personifies this idea than pop culture critic and Women Who Travel podcast guest Kristen Meinzer. With a Scandanavian first name, German surname, Midwestern sensibilities, and Korean background, Meinzer seeks out the multi-hyphenate histories of others wherever her travels take her. She returns to the podcast to chat with Lale about her latest adventures—including hiking the ancient Via Francigena which begins in Chaucer's Cantebury and ends in Rome, beholding the magnificence and prestige of Gilded Age estates, and following dairy princess pageantry at the Minnesota State Fair. Lale Arikoglu: Hi, there. I'm Lale Arikoglu, and this is Women Who Travel. Today, I'm talking with the podcaster and author Kristen Meinzer. Kristen is great at talking about pretty much everything. Before we started recording, we were talking about all of the podcasts that you have hosted and you really... You're like a Swiss army knife of podcasters from topics on health to movies, to self-help, you touch on travel most relevantly. You came on this podcast a while back to talk about taking a Midwest road trip. Kristen Meinzer: Yes. LA: I remember you talking about a giant chair in Idaho. KM: I think that's Casey, Illinois. LA: Oh, it was Casey, Illinois. KM: I think so, yes—a town with large things. LA: Is there anything more American than the moniker of a town with large things? LA: Today you've chosen to talk about three different travel topics that all embrace history in really different ways, both domestic and afar. There's a famous pilgrimage route that crosses into Italy. There are the houses of The Gilded Age, which for anyone who's been watching the show will be very relevant, and then the traditions of state fairs in the US. Kristen, you said in a radio interview a while ago, \"My first name is Scandinavian. My last name is German. My accent is thick Minnesotan. My sensibilities are Midwestern, and I'm Korean. To me, all these parts of my identity are incredibly ordinary and even boring. I'm just one of thousands of Minnesota Korean adoptees.\" You also say that you had an Irish grandmother who you loved. KM: Yes. LA: Are all of these influences why you're so interested in popular culture and also just keep jumping around? KM: Oh, I'm sure that's part of it. I think part of it was that my Irish grandmother, she raised me reading the National Enquirer and the tabloids, so she got me really into celebrity culture, I think. And then just talking— LA: Deep, deep into celebrity culture. KM: Oh, very much so. Just the most highbrow celebrity culture— LA: Celebrity…",

    "excerpt": "For Dr Madelyn Cabrera and Carlos Hernandez of Hialeah, Florida, a vacation that’s out of this world isn’t just a figure of speech—it’s a family tradition. Along with their two sons, Christopher (11) and Matthew (8), they’ve swapped beach towels for flight suits and made Space Camp a recurring family getaway. “It actually started about four years ago,” Madelyn says. “Carlos heard about this reputable program out of state. We looked it up, joined the waitlist, and in 2021, he went with our oldest son for the first time. Since then, we’ve gone every year.” This year, all four family members signed up for Family Space Camp—a three-day program in Huntsville, Alabama, where kids as young as seven can train like astronauts with their parents at their side. “What drew us in was the hands-on, educational aspect,” Madelyn says. “We didn’t just want to go on vacation—we wanted to experience something together, to learn something new.” Why choose rocket boosters over room service While many families choose beach resorts or amusement parks for their getaways, the appeal of Space Camp came down to one big draw: hands-on learning. “What drew us in was the educational and interactive nature of it,” Madelyn says. “We were excited by the opportunity to learn about space while also getting to test simulators, complete missions, and even launch rockets that we built ourselves.” They signed up for the Family Space Camp program, which is open to children ages seven and older, along with their parents. The experience takes place at the US Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville, which houses not only the camp itself but also one of the most comprehensive collections of space artifacts and exhibits in the country. “It’s kind of amazing that you can do all this training and learning in a place where real astronauts have prepared for missions,” she adds. Planning for takeoff With limited program slots, the family knew they had to plan early. “We registered about 10 months in advance,” says Madelyn. “The Family Camp schedule is released well ahead of time, but spots go quickly.” And while this wasn’t their first rodeo, they’ve learned a few packing tricks along the way. “I always bring the basics—clothes, toiletries, chargers—but we never forget our flight suits,” she laughs. “We bought them on a previous trip and wear them proudly during graduation.” For those staying in the on-site habitat dormitories, she also recommends bringing a combination lock for lockers, S-hooks for towels, and comfortable shoes. “You’re on your feet a lot, so good shoes are a must.” This year, they opted to stay at the Marriott next door instead of the camp’s bunk-style lodging. “It gave us a little…",

    "excerpt": "All products and listings featured on Condé Nast Traveler are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Pulling up to The Henson, a boutique hotel in the Catskills, it hit me what I was about to do: spend 48 hours with 14 strangers reading a book out loud. I’ve dreaded reading aloud since my elementary school days (I was a timid, slow reader who often stumbled over words… I still do). And now, here I was at Page Break, a weekend-long reading retreat dedicated to doing precisely that. “I think many of us are scarred from our schooling experience of being called by the teacher.” Says Page Break founder Mikey Friedman. However, with his novel reimagining of a rural group retreat, Friedman is reclaiming the act of reading out loud for an adult audience. The idea came about when Friedman was looking for a way to engage with his community through literature and wasn’t finding a suitable option from traditional models like book clubs. After reading a UK study about the benefits of reading aloud for adults, he was struck by the results: According to the report, reading together gave adults different perspectives when dealing with life’s challenges. Not only that, but without a phone screen to hide behind, friendships can form. Soon, Friedman saw the benefits for himself, noting that 94% of participants say they made a new friend at their Page Break retreat. Upon arrival, my room was stocked with a detailed weekend itinerary—lovingly planned to the hour—along with a list of the retreat guidelines, which included a piece on mutual respect (even after heavy wine consumption), silencing our phones during reading times, and a reminder that all activities are optional. “This is not school,” Friedman repeated throughout the weekend. Not long after checking into our rooms, we gathered as a group in the Henson’s backyard for our first reading session. Arranged in a circle—some in chairs and others directly on the grass—we did quick introductions before diving into the book of the retreat: There Are Reasons for This, a debut novel from queer female author, Nini Berndt. Page Break takes pride in showcasing first-time authors, as well as BIPOC and Queer writers. This dedication to diverse voices was reflected in the group at an individual identity level, too. Our group of 15 represented a wide variety of professions, sexual orientations, and family histories. Outside of reading sessions, conversations would quickly move away from discussing the world of the book and get personal, fast. I learned all about a perfume brand one attendee was launching; I spent a bus ride hearing about the burnout a…",

I walked into my first tennis US Open in 2003 assuming that, like any other pro sports game, I’d be sardined shoulder-to-shoulder with screaming fans doing the wave, while juggling a crusty hot dog and soda. Instead, an air of refined classiness lured me across the threshold at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York City’s Flushing Meadows. This wasn't just about sitting on the sidelines for one match, there was a wonderland to be discovered, from immersive activities and refined food and most impressively, matches on courts all around me, some so close that I felt like I'd knock the ball off course if I sneezed. The American Grand Slam, currently running through September 7, is one of the sport's four majors, the top titles that every tennis pro strives for. The year starts with the Australian Open in Melbourne in January, then moves to Roland Garros (also called the French Open) in Paris around Memorial Day, and Wimbledon outside of London around the Fourth of July. While each Grand Slam bears its own personality, they all exude that magical feeling that's equal parts thrilling and overwhelming, especially to first-timers who may not realize the massiveness of the tournaments' grounds and offerings. So we turned to the insiders, from pro players like No. 4 American Jessica Pegula, International Tennis Hall of Fame (ITHF) Class of 2025 inductee Maria Sharapova, and four-time Grand Slam semifinalist Tommy Haas to founders of travel tennis tour companies, coaches, concessioners, and more to source the unwritten rules of attending a Grand Slam. Go early in the tournaments All the Grand Slams follow a bracket-style elimination, which means there are more matches at the beginning, as players get sent home after they lose. Pegula advises attending earlier in the tournament's first week. “You get a chance to see a bunch of matches, and usually it's cheaper and easier,” the World of Hyatt ambassador tells Condé Nast Traveler. She’s even seen her own friends, who may not be the biggest tennis fans, get to know up-and-coming players by catching them early on a small court. “Maybe that person does well and then you have a connection to them and follow them,” she says. Find ticket deals Like any event, ticket prices have soared in recent years. During our search this week, we saw US Open grounds passes (that means no access to the main stadiums) ranging for $76 to $140 for weekday day sessions, but over $400 for a weekend on the…",

From hole-in-the-wall lokantas dishing up hearty bean stews by the bowlful to sharply executed tasting menus that riff on Anatolian terroir, this is a place where food is very much a staple of daily life. Yet with thousands of dining options sprawled across the Turkish capital's two halves, choosing the best restaurants in Istanbul can be bewildering. You could follow your nose through the bazaars and backstreets and stumble on something wonderful. But when faced with such variety, it's well worth having a handful of stalwarts in your address book to fall back on for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Here are our top picks of the best restaurants in Istanbul—whether you’re after a plate of hamsi pilavi in one of the city's heavyweights, a long lunch on a leafy terrace, or a modern Turkish tasting menu with a sparkling view over the Bosphorus. Read our complete Istanbul travel guide here, which includes: How we choose the best things to do in Istanbul Every review on this list has been written by a Condé Nast Traveler journalist who knows the destination and has visited that activity.

Divan Brasserie Bebek Divan is one of Türkiye’s best-known hotel groups with a reputation for good food, and this brasserie, right on one of the most scenic stretches of the Bosphorus, exudes the leisurely atmosphere that waterside Bebek, a wealthy neighborhood of luxury yachts and esplanade joggers, is known for. As you descend the polished wooden steps and step onto the chic black and white herringbone tiles, the smell of manti bubbling in tomato sauce and burnt butter and yogurt kebab wafts by. The menu is huge and has classic Turkish dishes, from kebabs to sütlaç (rice pudding) as well as Italian offerings, from pizza and lasagna to risotto and tiramisu (the latter is highly recommended). The on-site shop sells beautifully wrapped boxes of lokum (Turkish delight) and other treats but it’s worth crossing the road and paying a visit to Mesur Bebek Badem Ezmesi which is famous for selling the best marzipan in the city, as it has done since 1904. Aheste Since opening, Aheste has grown hugely in popularity. Once you could walk in and get a table, but now you almost certainly have to book.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Tallahassee is often dismissed as a stopover for students, but it’s truly much more than that. Home to two of Florida's prestigious universities—Florida A&M University and Florida State University—Tallahassee also offers a glimpse of Southern cuisine and culture. Add to that a breathtaking Florida sunset in parks like Tom Brown Park, and you begin to see why this underrated region of the Sunshine State is a destination worth pausing for. As a FAMU graduate and local, I can attest to Tallahassee’s proximity to natural springs and scenic state parks—and how it radiates warmth and welcome across seasons, whether you're here for the legendary Marching 100 or a prospective campus visit. There's no doubt about it, though: The town (and state capital) becomes even more lively when football season and homecoming are approaching. Read on for the best Airbnbs in Tallahassee for easy access to both universities. We've selected these listings based on Superhost status, ratings, amenities, location, decor, editor stays, and previous guest reviews. Our top picks: - For families: Secluded nature lover’s paradise - For solo travelers: Condo in downtown - For proximity to the stadiums: ’70s-inspired surf hut FAQ: What is the best area to stay in Tallahassee? For game days or campus visits, stay close to the stadiums—you’ll savor pre-game energy and cut down on commute time. For FAMU games, that means Cascades Park; for FSU games, Frenchtown is closest. Prefer peace and fresh air? Opt for rentals near Tom Brown Park or Alfred B. Maclay Gardens, where nature and tranquility reign. When is the best time to go to Tallahassee? If you're not from the South, consider following the snowbirds down and spending a weekend or longer in Tallahassee during the fall, when football season is in full bloom and the air is vibrant with tradition and tailgates. What are the best things to do in Tallahassee? Tallahassee is full of charm, from lush parks like Tom Brown, Maclay Gardens, and the hidden gem Lichgate, to outdoor escapes like Wakulla Springs and Lafayette Heritage Trail for paddling, hiking, and wildlife spotting. Dive into local history at Mission San Luis or the Historic Capitol, then browse art in the funky Railroad Square Art District. For a family-friendly stop, the Tallahassee Museum blends nature, history, and zip-lining. Grab a bite at Kool Beanz or Backwoods Crossing, sip coffee at Lucky Goat, and finish with dessert at Sugar Rush or a local brew from Proof Brewing.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. A few years ago, a round-up of hotels in Athens as extensive and luxurious as the one our editors have curated below would have been almost unthinkable. While the Greek capital has long been a city-break destination for history buffs and sunshine seekers, it’s only recently that Athens hotels have caught up with the appetite for long weekends and shoulder-season trips from a chic, jet-setting crew. Far from a stop-over on the way to the islands, Athens is reaping the rewards of a long-overdue renaissance, complete with a buzzing food scene and the surprisingly new phenomenon of rooftop bars with views of the Parthenon; constantly regenerating neighborhoods where new stores and galleries pop up next to long-standing institutions; and, finally, some smart places to stay. A new hotel seems to open in Athens every week now—from funky guesthouses and chic boutique hotels to restored neoclassical monuments and coastal resorts. In the center, book into chic design hotels, urban-cool restaurants with rooms, or centuries-old landmark buildings which have had new life breathed into them. Stays in the heart of the city mean you're in the thick of the action, and can spend days wandering idly along the crumbly streets or brushing up on your history at the big-hitting attractions. But don’t overlook the Athens Riviera. This recently regenerated coastal area, about 10 miles out of the city, is where slick resorts from big-name brands (One&Only, Four Seasons) and cool, low-key properties offer the best of both worlds—many have vibey pool scenes and private beaches where you can slip into the Aegean. Ready to take the plunge? Here are the 19 best hotels in Athens. How we choose the best hotels in Athens Every hotel on this list has been selected independently by our editors and written by a Condé Nast Traveler journalist who knows the destination or has visited that property. When choosing hotels, our editors consider properties across price points that offer an authentic and insider experience of a destination, keeping design, location, service, and sustainability credentials top of mind.

    "excerpt": "Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high, there’s an airplane—and you could be on it. Ahead of Labor Day weekend, a peak travel period during which anyone and everyone braving the airport can use a healthy dose of good fortune, flight tracking network Wingbits and atmospheric physicist Dr. Elizabeth Austin have teamed up to present what they purport to be the luckiest flights you can take take. What makes them so? Well, they pass over Earth’s most rainbow-dense locations. It’s an old pilots’ adage that seeing a rainbow in the air—not necessarily flying over one, as one cannot pass over an intangible optical phenomenon—is a sign of good luck and safe passage. To start, Dr. Austin identified a list of these rainbow-dense locations. Wingbits took this list and cross-referenced it against their flight data to figure out which of Austin’s selections actually lay beneath frequently-trafficked commercial flight paths. Some of Austin’s favorite spots did not make the cut because commercial flights do not typically pass overhead—namely, New Zealand’s Southern Alps (“You owe yourself a trip to the south island,” she tells me). Each of the flights below has been varified by Wingbits to present the highest probability of flying over a rainbow, keeping in mind that flight paths tend to vary four to eight miles to either side of the standard operational centerline. Rainbows can form in a variety of locations, according to Austin, but there are some necessary conditions: water droplets in the air, and a sun sitting at around 42 degrees or lower—mornings or evenings, in other words, are best. At this angle, light from the sun may refract through said droplets: “You might see little rainbows when you’ve got a sprinkler on your lawn.” But it’s waterfalls, she says, that are the surest bet for the abundance of droplets they send into the air. So, what which flight routes offer the best chance of seeing a rainbow below? And where, along that route, is the pot of gold? Read on to find out. Niagara Falls Best route: Washington (IAD), USA to Toronto (YTZ) The flight between D.C. and Toronto passes right over Niagara Falls, North America’s most famous display of natural waterworks. If you didn’t know, Niagara Falls is actually the name for a group of three distinct but adjacent waterfalls: Horseshoe Falls, American Falls, and Bridal Veil Falls. Together, these waterfalls produce near-constant mist, meaning sunny days are often replete with rainbows. Karersee, Italy Best routes: London Heathrow (LHR) to Dubrovnik (DBV); Munich (MUC) to Palma de Mallorca (PMI); Frankfurt Airport (FRA) to Leonardo da Vinci Rome Fiumicino Airport (FCO) This small alpine lake in the Dolomites is like glass, and is known to produce rainbows…",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. At 6.01 p.m. on Tuesday, an hour into a five-hour train to Edinburgh, my phone buzzed—then buzzed again, and again, and again. The BBC News ‘breaking news’ notification chimed: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce announce their engagement. Along with 13 million other chronically online people, I zoomed in on the ring and tried to work out where the engagement shoot had happened. But soon, my thoughts turned to the most exciting part of any wedding—the honeymoon. Where will the internet’s royal couple choose to spend the biggest holiday of their lives? Will they go low-key and off-grid, seeking out a super-secluded private island, perhaps? Maybe they’ll return to a previous holiday hotspot or seek out a Euro summer? Wherever they choose, we can all but guarantee it’ll kickstart a trend for romantic getaways to that location—so I asked our team of travel editors to weigh in with guesses, ideas, and recommendations. Lake Como, Italy It doesn’t matter if you’re a billionaire celebrity power couple or an ordinary spouse-to-be—the romance and allure of the Italian lakes is everlasting. Something Taylor and Travis know All Too Well, as they cleverly chose Lake Como for a getaway last year. Why not return, then, for the most romantic holiday of all—their honeymoon? I’d recommend booking one of the private villas at Grand Hotel Tremezzo, a film-set-like, Grand Budapest Hotel-style property with staggering views across the water. —Sarah James, digital editor South Africa When I picture Taylor and Travis on a honeymoon, I imagine them all giddy with excitement and desperate for some time alone, away from crowds and snapping photographers. But, having said that, I can’t see either of them as the type of people who can sit still for long. A holiday that feels far removed from reality but has plenty of activities and things to do is my bet—and I think Travis’ golden retriever energy and Taylor’s wide-eyed wonder of the world lend themselves nicely to a safari honeymoon. South Africa provides plenty of options to choose from—a classic safari destination with renowned private conservation areas and game reserves. The Farmstead at Royal Malewane (owned by the Biden family, no less, who Taylor famously endorsed back in 2020) should do the trick, with private, secluded villas, vast sweeping views across the 30,000 acres of Thornybush Game Reserveplains and plenty of romantic corners to watch the sunset and catch a glimpse of a lion or two (we will, of course, be waiting with bated breath in the hope that Travis gifts us with…",

Famed for being the nation's fashion capital, Milan pulses with creative energy, and the elegantly designed Airbnbs dotted across this sprawling metropolis are no exception. Return to these homely bases after a packed day exploring the chic shopping districts and world-famous cathedrals of this cultural hub—not to mention, devouring countless tangy aperitivos and doughy pizzas. Airbnbs in Milan are experimental, yet also effortlessly glamorous, and the bountiful selection leaves visitors spoilt for choice. Not only are these homestays easy on the eye, but they offer more space, privacy, and amenities than a hotel room, too. From minimalist studios to traditional canalside family homes, we’ve rounded up the loveliest Airbnbs in Milan for your next break, where Italian culture meets the unmatched warmth of a cozy home.

    "excerpt": "The drama of Zion Canyon’s sheer Navajo sandstone towers and cliffs demand pedal assist. I consider myself a proficient cyclist, but I notch up my e-bike’s power boost so I can devote my energy to admiring the soft red glow of Watchman peak looming high above the Virgin River. It’s a late afternoon in early June and Zion National Park is the first stop on my four-day trip with EXP Journeys, a tour operator specializing in bespoke, high-touch adventure trips. I’m shocked that we have the paved Pa’Rus trail in Zion to ourselves, with the exception of a few lizards and wild turkeys that scamper into the rabbitbrush as our e-bikes near. But that’s the magic of EXP Journeys. Their guides have spent years scouting these wildly popular places and know how to deliver solitude. In the last 15 years, Zion has seen annual visitation nearly double to just shy of five million people, making it America’s second most-visited national park. Stats like this have deterred me from seeing the natural treasures in my own backyard. And even for outdoorsy folks like myself, the preparation and gear required to pull off a comfortable family camping trip can be daunting. “Camping is an adventure, not a vacation,” my dad used to say. EXP Journeys handles all the logistics to ensure it’s both. Co-founders Kevin Jackson and Andrew Roberts have led trips around the globe, from the Pyrenees to Everest Base Camp, and kept feeling a pull back to America’s wild places, particularly the Southwest. Their trips reimagine the American camping experience with passionate guides, luxe amenities once reserved for Africa’s high-end safari camps, and, through a partnership with Navajo-owned tour company, Monument Valley Safari, native storytellers. “These tourism projects allow us to share our land but also our culture,” says owner Shaye Holiday. “That exchange keeps our culture alive.” Our leave-no-trace mobile camp, set up in 48 hours on Bureau of Land Management grounds just beyond the East Entrance of Zion National Park, provides every imaginable comfort. Palatial canvas-walled tents are outfitted with ensuite bathrooms and memory foam beds, and illuminated by bell jar chandeliers. Two hot showers, shared by the guests in the camp, are just ten steps away. Games, like corn hole, are sprinkled around a central fire pit and dining tent, where Shon Foster, the former chef at Amangiri and owner of Sego restaurant in nearby Kanab, dazzles us with artichoke mozzarella tomato frittatas and filet mignon cooked cowboy papillote-style. Over four days, our guides, Maxie and Chris, chaperone us on thrilling adventures, like UTVing and sand-boarding in Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park. Their knowledge is a master class in geology, history, botany, and even off-roading. “Drive…",
