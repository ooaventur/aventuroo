# AventurOO

AventurOO is a lightweight content site that aggregates travel, culture, lifestyle, and story articles.  
Static HTML pages under the project root power the web front-end, while autopost scripts fetch and curate content from external RSS feeds into `data/posts.json`.

## Project Structure
- `autopost/` – Python scripts for pulling articles from RSS feeds and converting them to HTML.
- `data/` – Generated posts and feed configuration files.
- `assets/` – Images, CSS, and other static assets used by the site.
- Static `.html` files – The site pages rendered by Netlify or other static hosts.

## Setup
1. **Clone and install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.lock
   ```
   `requirements.lock` pins the full set of dependencies and should be treated as the authoritative list. `requirements.txt` lists the top-level packages if exact pinning is not required.
2. **Environment variables** – Autopost scripts read a few optional variables:
   - `MAX_PER_CAT`, `MAX_TOTAL` – Limits for fetched articles per category or run.
   - `SUMMARY_WORDS`, `MAX_POSTS_PERSIST` – Control truncation and persistence of generated posts.
   - `HTTP_TIMEOUT`, `AP_USER_AGENT` – Networking options.
   - `FALLBACK_COVER`, `DEFAULT_AUTHOR` – Defaults for missing metadata.

## Running Autopost Scripts
RSS feeds for each category are listed in `autopost/data/feeds.txt` (see also `feeds.culture.txt`, `feeds.lifestyle.txt`, `feeds.stories.txt`, `feeds.travel.txt`).

### Run everything at once

To pull from all categories and render HTML snippets in one go, run:

```bash
python -m autopost.run_all
# or
python -m autopost
```

### Run individual scripts

You can also run the pullers separately to populate `data/posts.json` and then convert to HTML:

```bash
python -m autopost.pull_travel
python -m autopost.pull_culture
python -m autopost.pull_lifestyle
python -m autopost.pull_stories
python -m autopost.rss_to_html
```

## Tests
No automated test suite is bundled with this repository.

## Contributing
- Fork the repository and create commits on top of `main`.
- Add tests where appropriate and run `python -m pytest -q` if tests are present.
- Update feed lists under `autopost/data/` or `data/external-feeds.json` when introducing new sources.

## Data and External Resources
- `autopost/data/feeds*.txt` – Text files listing external RSS feeds per category.
- `data/posts.json` – Aggregated posts generated by the scripts.
- Project uses [trafilatura](https://github.com/adbar/trafilatura) and `readability-lxml` for article extraction.
- Live site is hosted on Netlify: `https://aventuroo.netlify.app/`
